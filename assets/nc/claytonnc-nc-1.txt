§ 10.20 RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIOLATIONS BY CORPORATIONS.
   In the event any provision of this code is violated by a corporation, the

procures, aids, or abets a violation, shall be subject to the same penalties as
if he himself committed the violation.
('71 Code, § 1-9)
§ 10.98 CIVIL PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, partner, partnership, corporation or party violating or
failing, refusing or neglecting to comply with any provision or requirement of
any section or subsection of this Town Code or any ordinance of the town now in
force or hereafter enacted, to which no specific penalty is affixed shall be
required to pay the penalty and comply with the provisions of this particular
section. However, ordinances which have criminal penalties or fines are
excluded and excepted from the Civil Penalties Ordinance of the town; and, this
exclusion and exception from this particular section includes ordinances which
subject violators to misdemeanor charges unless and until the Town Council
shall specifically eliminate that or those particular ordinances which subject
the violator to misdemeanor charge(s).
   (B)   This section is enacted and adopted pursuant to G.S. § 160A-175(c):
any violator of this section is not subject to prosecution criminally and is
not subject to prosecution for violation of any State of North Carolina Penal
Law; this is absolutely restricted to enforcement by civil action only.
   (C)   The enforcement procedure as to this section shall be as follows: A
police officer of the town or such other official or employee of the town as
shall be so authorized by the Town Council may issue a notice of violation to
any party if there is reasonable cause to believe that the party has violated
an ordinance of the town. The notice of violation shall be delivered to the
violator by personal service upon the violator or mailed by certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, with a return receipt requested, to the
violator. The notice of violation shall specify the penalty which is to be paid
within five business days to the Town Collections Department. If the original
notice of violation is not paid within five business days, a delinquency charge
of $25 shall be added to the amount shown on the Notice of Violation and a
notice thereof shall be mailed to the violator. This notice shall inform the
violator that if the penalty is not paid within 15 days from the date of the
delinquency notice, a civil action may be commenced in the General Court of
Justice, the appropriate division, in Johnston County, North Carolina.
   (D)   Any ordinance of the town may be enforced by an appropriate legal
remedy issuing from a competent jurisdiction. It shall not be defense to the
application of the town for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy
at law.
   (E)   All notice of violation forms shall be issued in triplicate and
serially numbered. Records of all notice of violations shall be maintained and
shall be subject to periodic audit.
   (F)   Each day that any breach or violation of, or any failure to comply
with, any provision or requirement of this section shall constitute and is
hereby declared to be a separate and distinct infraction.
   Violators shall be subject to the following schedule for notices of
violation:
   First notice of violation:   $25.00
   Second and subsequent notices of violation:   $75.00
   (G)   The imposition of a penalty under the provision of this section shall
not prevent the revocation or suspension of any license, franchise or permit
issued or granted.
(Ord. passed 8-18-97; Am. Ord. 2010-10-02, passed 10-4-10)
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   In accordance with G.S. § 160A-175, violation of any provision hereof
shall be subject to a civil penalty as set out in division (B). Said penalty
must be paid within 48 hours of receipt of official notice of said violation.
Once official notice of a violation has been received, each day's continuing
violation shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. Failure to pay the
civil penalty as set forth herein may result in a civil action in the nature of
a debt being filed by the Town to recover the penalty, costs of court and
attorney's fees. The assessment of a civil penalty shall be in addition to the
Town's authority to enforce the Code of Ordinances by injunction or order of
abatement pursuant to G.S. § 160A-175(e). Further, in the event of a violation
of an ordinance providing for a higher penalty than set out in subsection (B)
the higher penalty shall apply and shall be enforceable as set out herein.
   (B)   Upon receiving a First Notice of Violation, the violator shall have
five business days from receipt of said notice to correct the noticed
violation. If the violation is corrected within the prescribed time, no penalty
shall be assessed. Failure to correct the violation within the prescribed time
pursuant to a First Notice shall result in the issuance of a Second Notice of
Violation and the assessment of a penalty in the amount of $50 for each day the
violation remains uncorrected up to a maximum of five days. Failure to correct
the violation within five days after receiving a Second Notice shall result in
the issuance of a Third Notice of Violation and the assessment of a penalty in
the amount of $75 for each day the violation remains uncorrected up to a
maximum of five days. Failure to correct a violation within five days from
receipt of a Third Notice of Violation shall result in the issuance of a Fourth
Notice of Violation and the assessment of a penalty in the amount of $100 for
each day that the violation remains uncorrected.
   (C)   The imposition of a civil penalty under this section shall not prevent
the revocation or suspension of any license, franchise or permit issued or
granted and failure to pay any penalty assessed shall be grounds for the
revocation or suspension of any license, franchise or permit issued by the
Town. Any ordinance of the Town may be enforced by an appropriate legal remedy
issuing from a competent jurisdiction and it shall not be a defense to the
application of the Town for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy
at law.
   (D)   Whenever in this code or any ordinance of the Town any act is made or
declared to be a misdemeanor and no specific penalty is provided therefor, the
violation of any such provision of this code or other ordinance shall be
punished by a fine not exceeding $500 or by imprisonment for a term not
exceeding 30 days, or both. Each day that any violation shall continue shall
constitute a separate offense.

CHAPTER 51: WATER AND SEWER SYSTEM EXTENSION POLICY
Section
   51.01   Subdivisions
   51.02   Other properties
§ 51.01 SUBDIVISIONS.
   With respect to the installation of utilities to serve subdivisions, the
following policies shall apply:
   (A)   Specifications. All installations shall be made according to such
specifications as may be approved by the town or its engineers, including the
size of all lines and their locations, grade, and material used.
   (B)   Ownership and control. All lines constructed and connected with the
facilities of the town under these policies shall become the property of the
town upon their completion, dedication, and acceptance. The town shall have
exclusive control of all such lines and shall be responsible for their
maintenance, repair, and operation.
   (C)   Contracts. All installations made under a reimbursement agreement
shall be accomplished under contracts let after the receipt of sealed
competitive bids. The town shall exercise general supervision over the letting
of such contracts in order to assure the securing of free competition on such
contracts.
   (D)   Reimbursement policy.
      (1)   A reimbursement agreement may be entered into between the town and
each private party installing water and/or sewer lines, which shall become the
property of, and operation and maintenance responsibility of the town.
      (2)   The cost of installing all lines within a subdivision shall be
borne initially by the participating developer or developers.
      (3)   Infrastructure subject to reimbursement shall be:
         (a)   Those between a subdivision and the facilities of the town and
which are so located as to serve other properties; and
         (b)   Lines within a subdivision which will serve lands outside the
subdivision and are of a size in excess of the needs of the subdivision itself.
In this case, the cost subject to reimbursement shall be only the extra cost
incurred by installing lines larger than needed to serve the subdivision
itself; and
         (c)   The proportionate cost of lines of any size to which direct
service connections may be made by property other than those by the initial
investor; and
         (d)   The town shall be reimbursed for its expenses in constructing or
providing for water or sewer utility capital improvements adjacent or ancillary
to the development if the owner or developer has agreed to be financially
responsible for such expenses, and such reimbursement shall be credited against
the system development fees owed by the owner or developer.
      (4)   Only the actual cost of the lines shall be included in the
calculations of costs subject to reimbursement. No interest on costs pending
reimbursement shall be allowed.
      (5)   No reimbursement of any cost shall be made after ten years from the
date of acceptance by the town of the lines installed under a reimbursement
agreement.
(Ord. passed 2-18-85; Am. Ord. passed 4-2-90; Am. Ord. 2017-03-01, passed 3-6-
17; Am. Ord. 2018-07-07, passed 7-16-18)
§ 51.02 OTHER PROPERTIES.
   In accordance with the general principle that benefitted property should
bear the cost of extending water and sewer lines, one or more of the following
methods shall be used in providing for the extension of water and sewer lines
to serve properties not located within subdivisions currently under
development. Properties which are annexed by the town based upon the properties
meeting the necessary standards for annexation as set forth in the North
Carolina General Statutes (i.e., annexation not based on a petition requesting
annexation by the property owners) will have services extended to them with
financing arranged by assessments as described in divisions (A)(1) through (7)
below.
   (A)   Assessments for costs.
      (1)   Lateral water and sewer main extensions will be made by assessment
of the cost thereof against property owners to be benefitted thereby in
conformity with G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10. In the event it is necessary or
desirable to lay a water main larger than a six-inch main, or a sewer main
larger than an eight-inch main, the town will bear the cost of the difference
between the cost of the size of main required and that of a six-inch water main
or eight-inch sewer main.
      (2)   Lots at the intersection of streets, except lots in a subdivision
which are assessed on a per lot basis as authorized by G.S. Chapter 160A,
Article 10, shall be assessed as follows:
         (a)   If water and sewer mains or both are installed simultaneously on
both streets on which the lot abuts, assessment of the cost of the installation
shall be based upon the entire frontage on one street plus the frontage on the
other street in excess of 150 feet.
         (b)   If such lot is already served by water or sewer mains in a
street on which the lot abuts and a like main is installed in the other
abutting street, the cost of such new installation shall be assessed against
the lot to the extent that such frontage abutting the new installation exceeds
150 feet.
         (c)   If water or sewer service is installed in a street abutting a
corner lot, and such service is not a duplicating service, and the method of
assessment used is the street frontage method, the assessment shall not exceed
the number of feet of the shortest side of said lot abutting the street. Upon
installation of a duplicating service to said lot, an exemption as specified in
division (A)(2) above shall be credited against the longest side of said lot
abutting on the public street.
      (3)   Where one or more water or sewer lines traverse a lot or tract of
land and the method of assessment used is the abutting footage on the
improvement, the abutting footage for each lot, tract, or parcel assessed
according to the assessment roll shall not exceed the straight line distance
between the beginning point and the ending point of said line or lines.
However, upon the installation of a duplicating service to a traversed lot or
tract of land, an exemption of 150 feet shall be allowed for the duplicating
service, whether it is installed separately or simultaneously with the original
service.
      (4)   A lot not on a corner abutting two streets which has a water or
sewer service in one street shall not be liable for an assessment for a
duplicating service in the other street or streets if the subdivision of such
lot or sale of any part thereof for an additional building site or sites is
prohibited by the zoning or subdivision standard provisions of the town or any
restrictive covenants running for a period of not less than five years from the
date of the assessment for such installation.
      (5)   The term LOT as used in this section is defined as a parcel of land
without regard to whether or not it is shown on any subdivision map as a
separate lot and without regard to how or when acquired, except that when an
assessment is made on a per lot basis in a subdivision, the term LOT shall
apply to each separate subdivided lot. However, when a lot in a subdivision is
already served by a water or sewer line and the lots in the subdivision are
assessed on a per lot basis, the lot so served shall not be assessed a greater
amount than the amount which would be assessed against the lot on a linear foot
basis after giving credit for the exemptions contained in this section.
      (6)   The Town Council shall determine which method of assessment
authorized by G.S. § 160A-218 would be most equitable to be used in an
assessment roll.
      (7)   When the Town Council determines that the most equitable method of
assessment is on the basis of the frontage abutting the project, the Council
shall determine the amount of the construction cost to be borne by the abutting
property owner and the amount to be borne by the town.
   (B)   Reimbursement policy.
      (1)   The reimbursement policy outlined in division (A)(2) of this
section shall be available for use by an individual property owner who desires
service at some distance from existing lines and when assessment of, or
contributions from, intervening property does not appear feasible. This method
may also be used in financing extensions both inside and outside the town
boundaries.
      (2)   Extensions under any of the above financing methods may be made
either by forces of the town or under contracts let by the town, or by private
contracts let under the supervision of the town.

of Clayton, hereafter referred to as the town, and enables the town to comply
with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act (33
USC 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges
into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of
the system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges
into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system,
inadequately treated, into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible
with the system;
      (3)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the municipal system;
      (4)   To protect both municipal personnel who might be affected by
sewage, sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as
protecting the general public;
      (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and
      (6)   To ensure that the municipality complies with its NPDES or non-
discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any
other federal or state laws and/or regulations to which the municipal
wastewater system is subject.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the issuance of
permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the municipal wastewater
system as authorized by G.S. § 160A-312 or § 153A-275. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Superintendent and/or Director shall administer,
implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted to or
imposed upon the Superintendent or Director may be delegated by the
Superintendent or Director to other town personnel. By discharging wastewater
into the municipal wastewater system, industrial users located outside the town
limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions established in this
chapter, as well as any permits, enforcement actions, or orders issued
hereunder.

require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate
that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/
or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from
industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to
protect the POTW and determine the users compliance with the requirements of
this chapter.
      (2)   The Superintendent or Director may require any person discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense,
a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent or Director, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand;
except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Superintendent or Director and shall be so located to be easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and
repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at the user's expense.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

of its discharge.
   (B)   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as
required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary
to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for
additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90 Day Compliance
Reports. Additionally, the Superintendent may allow collection of multiple
grabs during a 24-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed
under 40 CFR 136.
   (C)   Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected
with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a
discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow
proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Superintendent. When
authorizing time- proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be
representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 52.070 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The town requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and internal drainage systems. The monitoring
facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the town may,
when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user,
allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (B)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the town's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the town.

§ 52.071 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The town will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the town, approval authority and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The town, approval
authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring
and metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town,
approval authority, and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the POTW,
approval authority's, or EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a
violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access.

§ 52.072 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the POTW, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the POTW, approval
authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Superior Court
of Johnston County.

   (A)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall
be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent or Director that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be
asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, non-discharge
permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions
of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
   (C)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall
be made available to officials of the approval authority and EPA upon request.

52.010(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §
52.010(B)(2), (3), (5) through (7), and (9) through (23) of this chapter if it
can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-
through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the town was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent or Director may waive
the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within 24 hours.
   (C)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent or Director may
take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) of
this section.
      (2)   The Superintendent or Director may approve an anticipated bypass,

alternative method of compliance, documentation of the proposed method’s actual
performance criteria must be submitted to the town’s Enforcement Official or
Public Works Director for review and approval.
   (C)   Grease traps and interceptors may also be required in other
facilities, as deemed necessary by the town’s designated Enforcement Official
or Public Works Director.
   (D)   Upon the prior written approval of the Public Works Director, non-
cooking establishments may be exempted from the requirements of this subchapter
after an inspection of the subject premises and submission of adequate
supporting documentation, as deemed necessary in the sole and absolute
discretion of the Public Works Director. At a minimum, such supporting
documentation shall include: blueprints of the subject premises, a full and
detailed description of the operations and activities at the subject premises,
and a full and detailed list of all potential sources of grease at the subject
premises.

as necessary to comply with the performance criteria in division (A) of this
section. The default maximum period of time allowed between servicing of grease
traps shall be 60 days; however, individual customers may prepare and submit an
alternative schedule for review and approval by the Public Works Director.
Alternative schedules may be approved based on evaluation of the flow volume,
character of the wastewater, and capacity of the grease trap. Once approved,
the user must adhere to the alternative schedule. Under-the-counter types of
grease traps and interceptors shall be cleaned at least daily, and shall comply
with the performance criteria in division (A) of this section. There shall be
no reintroduction of wastewater back into the grease trap or interceptor unless
and until said wastewater has been proven to contain 200 mg/l or less of
grease. Under no circumstances shall the sludge or scum layer be reintroduced
or discharged into the town’s wastewater collection system or POTW.
   (F)   Users shall supply (1) an adequate sampling point downstream of the
grease trap or interceptor, prior to mixing with other sanitary flows, and (2)
an accessible entry into each chamber of the grease trap or interceptor. The
minimum requirement for the sampling point shall be four-inch vertical clean-
out.
   (G)   Users shall retain detailed records on-site for a minimum of three
years reflecting all maintenance carried out pursuant to this section. All
permitted haulers and/or commercial establishment, industrial establishment or

publicly-owned treatment works shall file a report regarding the results of
that contracted cleaning using the town’s designated electronic reporting
system managed by the currently contracted vendor as published at
www.Townofclaytonnc.org. Permitted haulers shall supply all cleaning
information required by the designated electronic reporting system to include
but not limited to facility name, location address, manager name, phone number
or email, service date, size, name of pumping company, address, phone number,
driver name, disposal facility, and any other information deemed necessary.
   (H)   Users are required to keep the grease trap or interceptor free of
inorganic solids such as grit, towels, gloves, cigarettes, eating utensils, and
the like, which could clog or settle in the trap or interceptor, thereby
reducing the effective volume or capacity of the trap or interceptor.
   (I)   Users are required to ensure that all waste material removed from
grease traps and interceptors is disposed of in a manner that complies with all
federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations, policies and ordinances.
   (J)   Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following the
adoption of this subchapter, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
section for failure to achieve the performance criteria specified in division
(A) of this section. If, during such period, (1) an obstruction of any of the
town’s sanitary sewer main(s) occurs and causes a sewer overflow, spill, leak
or other event with any environmental impact, and (2) such overflow, spill,
leak or other event may be attributed in part or in whole to a particular user,
then the town will seek enforcement action under this chapter, and/or the
Pretreatment Enforcement Plan. For purposes of this section, an overflow,
spill, leak or other event shall be deemed to have an environmental impact when
(1) such overflow or other event involves an amount of wastewater equal to or
in excess of 1,000 gallons, or (2) any amount of wastewater reaches any body of
surface water.

the violation occurred and personally delivering or mailing such notice to the
customer of record and to any other person known to the town who is responsible
for the violation or its correction. Such notice shall describe the violation,
order that it be corrected, cured or abated immediately or within such
specified times as the Manager determines is reasonable under the
circumstances, and warn that more severe measures, such as civil penalties,
criminal charges or termination of water service may be brought, assessed or
imposed. If the order is not complied with within the time period, the Manager
may undertake enforcement action as follows.
   (C)   Enforcement action. Any person who, after being given notice of
violation, does not comply with this section or policy adopted hereunder within
the time period specified shall, at the option of the town, be subject to any
of the following: civil penalties, criminal penalties, termination of water
service, injunctive relief, or any appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a
court of competent jurisdiction.
      (1)   Criminal penalties. Any person may be charged with violation of
this section or policy adopted hereunder and prosecuted in district court. Any
person so charged and found guilty of violating this section or policy shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day's violation shall constitute a separate
offense. The penalty for violation shall be a maximum fine of $50 per
occurrence or imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The imposition of one or
more penalties for any violation shall not excuse any violation or permit it to
continue.
      (2)   Civil penalties. In addition to or in lieu of criminal prosecution,
violation of this section or any policy adopted hereunder may subject the
violator or customer to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation per day
for so long as the violation exists. Each day on which a violation occurs or
continues shall constitute a separate and distinct violation. In determining
the amount of the civil penalty, the Manager shall take into account all
relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm
caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, efforts
to correct the violation, the compliance history of the person against whom the
violation is assessed, the cost of enforcement to the town, whether the
violation was willful or intentional and any other factor as justice requires.
The town shall serve a written citation on the violator, and the customer, if
different, by personal delivery or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. The citation shall describe the violation and shall specify
the amount of the civil penalty levied. The civil penalty is collectible in a
civil action in the nature of debt. The imposition of one or more penalties for
a violation shall not excuse any violation or permit it to continue.
      (3)   Termination of service. The Manager or his designee may make
findings of fact and order whether service should continue, be flow restricted,
or terminated. Termination of water service shall be performed in accordance
with the town's ordinances, policies, procedures and practices. The standard
reconnection charge shall be paid for the reconnection of any water service
terminated pursuant to the current town ordinances and procedures.
      (4)   Appeal. Any person against whom enforcement action has been taken,
hereafter referred to as "aggrieved party," is entitled to appeal to the Town
Council upon serving written notice to the Town Manager and following
administrative procedures for appeal to the Town Council.

§ 90.07 below, an abandoned, nuisance or junked vehicle which is to be removed
shall be towed only after notice to the registered owner or person entitled to
possession of the vehicle. In the case of a nuisance vehicle or a junked motor
vehicle, if the names and mailing addresses of the registered owner or person
entitled to possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee, or occupant of the
real property upon which the vehicle is located can be ascertained in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given by first- class
mail. The person who mails the notice shall retain a written record to show the
name and address to which mailed, and the date mailed. If such names and
addresses cannot be ascertained, or if the vehicle to be removed is an
abandoned motor vehicle, notice shall be given by affixing on the windshield or
some other conspicuous place on the vehicle a notice indicating that the
vehicle will be removed by the town on a specified date (no sooner than seven
days after the notice is affixed). The notice shall state that the vehicle will
be removed by the town on a specified date, no sooner than seven days after the
notice is affixed or mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by the owner or legal
possessor prior to that time.
   (B)   With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property, nuisance
vehicles and junked motor vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if
the registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the
vehicle but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is abandoned,
a nuisance vehicle or in the case of a junked motor vehicle that the aesthetic
benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, such appeal shall be
made to the Town Council in writing, heard at the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the Town Council, and further proceedings to remove the vehicle
shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and decided.
(Ord. passed 5-21-90)
§ 90.07 EXCEPTIONS TO PRIOR NOTICE REQUIREMENT.
   The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an abandoned,
nuisance or junked motor vehicle may, as determined by the authorizing
official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a special need for
prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to otherwise maintain and
protect the public safety and welfare. Such findings shall, in all cases, be
entered by the authorizing official in the appropriate daily records.
Circumstances justifying the removal of vehicles without prior notice includes:
   (A)   Vehicles abandoned on the streets. For vehicles left on the public
streets and highways, the Town Council hereby determines that immediate removal
of such vehicles may be warranted when they are:
      (1)   Obstructing traffic;
      (2)   Parked in violation of an ordinance prohibiting or restricting
parking;
      (3)   Parked in a no-stopping or standing zone;
      (4)   Parked in loading zones;

code sections.
   (B)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles. With respect to abandoned or
nuisance vehicles left on city-owned property other than the streets and
highways, and on private property, such vehicles may be removed without giving
prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing official finds a
special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health,
safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation, such
circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to
businesses and residences, vehicles parked in such a location or manner as to
pose a traffic hazard, and vehicles causing damage to public or private
property.

within 24 hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the state, notice shall be
given to the registered owner within 72 hours from the removal of the vehicle.

vehicle identification number, to determine the last known registered owner of
the vehicle and to notify him of the information set forth in divisions (A)(1)

hearing for the purpose of determining if probable cause existed for removing
the vehicle. A request for hearing must be filed in writing with the county
magistrate designated by the chief district court judge to receive such hearing

accordance with Article I of Chapter 44A of the North Carolina General

of the owner, occupant or lessee, except in those cases where a vehicle is a
nuisance vehicle or is a junked motor vehicle which has been ordered removed by

   (B)   Water. Fresh, clean water should be provided at all times in adequate
amounts. Owners should take into consideration the age and size of the animal
or animals and the temperature, to ensure the uses of a large enough container.
An exception would be if a veterinarian ordered a temporary fast for medical

discomfort of the animals, sufficient shade by natural or artificial means
shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from
direct sunlight.
   (D)   Space requirements. Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so
as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and
social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement to maintain physical
conditioning. The animal should be able to sit, stand, turn, and lie without
obstruction. Adequate space for food and water containers must be provided.
Inadequate space may be indicated by evidence of malnutrition, poor condition,
debility, stress, or abnormal behavioral patterns. Animals shall not be tied,
chained, fastened, or otherwise tethered to any stationary or inanimate object
as a means of confinement or restraint to property, but must be in an approved
enclosure.
   (E)   Sanitation. Both indoor and outdoor enclosures shall receive periodic
cleanings to remove excreta and other waste material, dirt and trash so as to
minimize disease, hazards and to reduce odors. These periodic cleanings shall
not exceed a five-day period. If, however, more than one animal is held in one
enclosure, these cleanings shall not exceed two days.

by first class mail of notice of the defacement. The notice shall contain the
following information:

to remove the defacing graffiti; or
      (2)   The property owner or responsible party has an active program for
the removal of graffiti and has scheduled the removal of the graffiti as part

remain defaced with graffiti for a period of 15 days after service by first
class mail of notice of the defacement.
   (D)   Right of town to remove; use of public funds. Whenever the town
becomes aware or is notified and determines that graffiti is located on
publicly or privately owned property viewable from a public or quasi-public
place, the town shall be authorized to use public funds for the removal of the
graffiti, or for the painting or repairing of the graffiti, but shall not
authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more
extensive an area than that where the graffiti is located, unless the Town
Manager, or the designee of the Town Manager, determines in writing that a more
extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an
aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community, or unless the
property owner or responsible party agrees to pay for the costs of repainting
or repairing the more extensive area.
   (E)   Right of entry on private property. Prior to entering upon private
property or property owned by a public entity other than the town for the
purpose of graffiti removal the town shall attempt to secure the consent of the
property owner or responsible party and a release of the town from liability

SNOW REMOVAL POLICY
§ 99.100 POLICY STATEMENT.
   In the event of a snow (and/or ice/sleet) storm resulting in significant
accumulation, the town shall initiate the removal of snow with the use of town
personnel. The Public Works Department shall have primary responsibility for
all snow removal activities. All other town departments shall provide full
cooperation and assistance under the direction of the Town Manager. Depending
on the severity of the snow storm, various town operations, excluding emergency
services, may be temporarily suspended. However, it is the intent of the town
to make every effort to keep town streets passable and to continue to provide
town services to every resident.
(Adopted 10-10-88)
§ 99.101 PROCEDURES AND ACTION.
   (A)   During winter months, the Public Works Director will monitor weather
service storm advisories and upon a snow storm forecast, equipment will be
mobilized and personnel placed on standby. Once a snow storm begins, all
designated personnel will assemble at the Public Works garage and make
preparation for snow removal as well as treating of icing conditions. Upon the
accumulation of one inch and continuing snowfall, the Public Works Director
shall dispatch personnel to their assignments.
   (B)   In the case of a severe snow storm in which the Public Works Director
is of the opinion that town forces will be unable to remove snow in a timely
manner, the Public Works Director, upon the approval of the Town Manager, shall
contact local contractors with whom prior arrangements have been made, to begin
snow plowing with motorgraders and other equipment. These contractors shall
work under the direction of the Public Works Director.
   (C)   The Police Department shall closely monitor road conditions within the
town and provide traffic control as required. The Police Department will also
advise the public and other agencies of traffic conditions.
   (D)   During a snow storm and until streets have become reasonably passable
(as determined by the Chief of Police), the Public Works Department will
maintain 24-hour operation with work crews assigned to eight-hour shifts. The
Town Manager may tem- porarily assign other employees to snow removal work with
the Public Works Department. Other town operations excluding emergency services
may be temporarily suspended by authority of the Town Manager during this
period.

right to request payment in advance. For purposes of this division, REASONABLE
NOTICE shall be construed to mean notice given at least 48 hours prior to the
move.
   (H)   If, at any time, in case of fire or disaster in the town it shall
become necessary in the judgment of the Mayor, Town Manager, or the Fire Chief
to cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or
appurtenances thereto of the grantee, this cutting or moving may be done and
any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the grantee, at its
sole expense.

§ 111.20 ADDITIONAL TOWN RIGHTS IN FRANCHISE.
   (A)   The town may from time to time, add to, modify, or delete provisions
of this chapter as it shall deem necessary in the exercise of its regulatory
powers, provided that the additions or revisions are reasonable and in keeping
with the public interest and welfare. Additions or revisions shall be made only

grantee to be in noncompliance with this chapter, the grantee shall have 90
days to bring all areas then not in compliance with this chapter into

establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes,
power or communication lines, tracts, or other types of structures or
improvements by governmental agencies or any structures of public improvement.
Reasonable notice for this provision shall be construed to mean at least 30
days notice, except in the case of emergencies where no specific notice period
shall be required.
   (C)   In the event of the failure by the grantee to complete any work
required by division (B) of this section or any work required by town ordinance
within the time established and to the satisfaction of the town, the town may
cause the work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the town the costs
thereof within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of such cost.
   (D)   At all reasonable times, grantee shall permit examination by any duly
authorized representative of the town, of all grantee property, together with
any appurtenant property of grantee situated within or without the town. The
grantee shall also permit any duly authorized representative of the town to
examine and transcribe any and all maps, financial records, and other records
kept or maintained by grantee or under its control concerning the operations,
affairs transactions, or property of grantee. If any of such maps, financial
records, or other records are not kept in the town, or upon reasonable request

its duties, then all travel and maintenance expense necessarily incurred in
making the examination shall be paid by the grantee.
   (E)   The town reserves the right during the life of any franchise granted

hereunder, to reasonably inspect and supervise at the grantee's cost, all
construction or installation work performed subject to the provisions of this

such franchise shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any
governmental right or power of the town.
   (H)   Nothing in this chapter shall in any way or to any extent be construed
to waive, modify, or abridge the town's right of eminent domain in respect to
the grantee.
   (I)   Any right or power in, or duty impressed upon any officer, employee,
department, or board of the town shall be subject to transfer by the town to
any other officer, employee, department, or board of the town. The town
reserves all rights not specifically granted herein, and the enumeration of the
rights herein shall not be construed to be a limitation of any right or power
the town may otherwise have.
   (J)   The town reserves the right during the life of any franchise granted
hereunder, upon 90 days notice to hold a public hearing for the express purpose
of reviewing the general and specific performance of the grantee with regard to

town.
   (K)   The town shall have the authority to order a hearing no less than
every five years on the provision of additional channel capacity for the

constructing, operating, and maintaining the CATV system, as defined herein,
and for the privilege of providing the CATV service, as defined herein, during
the ensuing fiscal year, a sum of up to 5% of its gross revenues, as defined

   (B)   The payment of the fee described in division (A) of this section shall
be in addition to any charges, permits, licenses, utilities, taxes, services,
and other costs or fees on real or personal property. Acceptance of payments

this chapter or for the performance of any other obligations hereunder. In the
event of holding over after expiration or other termination of any franchise
granted hereunder without the consent of the town, the grantee shall pay to the

   (E)   The franchise fee provided for herein shall be reviewed at least every
five years during the term of the franchise. The franchise fee, at the sole
option of the town, shall be adjusted upward if the town determines that an
upward adjustment is necessary in order to maintain a franchise fee at a level
consistent with:
      (1)   Franchise fees being paid by cable television companies operating
under similar conditions;
      (2)   The costs being incurred by the town in administering the
franchise;
      (3)   The value of the grantee's right to use town streets and public
easements;
      (4)   Any applicable statutes, laws, rules, and regulations.
   (F)   If the franchise fee is adjusted upward, the adjustment shall be
effective at the beginning of the next immediate full quarter of the grantee's
fiscal year in which the adjustment is made. The town may unilaterally adjust
the franchise fee upward only after giving notice to the grantee and holding a
hearing.
   (G)   The grantee is obligated to obtain pole space and other facilities
from the town, private utilities, and other lawful users at its own expense and
cost, at a rate which will be established in the franchise agreement.

§ 111.23 RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
   (A)   Grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate
against any subscriber, channel user, or other user, or any citizen on the
basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or sexual orientation.
Grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state, and
local laws and regulations, and all executive and administrative orders
relating to nondiscrimination which are incorporated and made part of this
chapter by reference.
   (B)   No signals of a class IV cable com- munications channel shall be

viewing patterns or practices without the express written permission of the
subscriber. No person shall be required to grant such permission. The request
for such permission shall be contained in a separate document with a prominent
statement that the subscriber is authorizing the permission in full knowledge
of its provision. The authorization shall be revocable at any time by the
subscriber without penalty of any kind whatsoever. Such authorization is
required for each type of classification of class IV cable communications
activity planned for the purpose; provided, however, that the grantee shall be
entitled:
      (1)   To conduct system-wide or individually addressed "sweeps" for the
purpose of verifying system integrity, provided such sweeps do not monitor or
reveal what subscribers are viewing; and
      (2)   Conduct individually addressed sweeps for the purpose of
controlling return-path trans- mission, or billing for pay services.
   (C)   Pursuant to the requirements of the Cable Communication Policy Act of
1984, the grantee shall be required to notify subscribers annually as to their
rights to subscriber privacy under the Act. The grantee shall be prohibited
from disclosure of any personally identified information except as provided for
under the Act.

§ 111.99
§ 111.24 SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENTS.
   The form of grantee's agreements with his subscribers and users shall be
subject to the approval of the town before they are used. Copies of all types
of agreements shall be filed and maintained with the Town Clerk.
(Ord. passed 7-21-86)
§ 111.25 SUBSCRIBER RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   The rates and charges to subscribers that are stated in the
application and approved and stated in the franchise shall be in effect for a
minimum of one year following the effective date of the franchise.
   (B)   The grantee may initially charge subscribers and users of the CATV
system for services up to the amounts specified in the schedule of rates and
charges as proposed in its franchise agreement.
   (C)   In the event that the grantee does seek to submit a petition for a
change in rates, the town shall hold a public hearing on this topic. The
grantee shall notify its subscribers of the hearing by announcement on at least
one channel of its system between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. for five
consecutive days. Additionally, the hearing shall be announced in a newspaper
of general circulation in the town at least five days before the date of the
hearing. Following all proper notice, but in no event later than 60 days from
the date of the petition, the town shall hold an appropriate public hearing to
consider new rates, at which hearing all parties desiring to be heard,
including the grantee, shall be heard on any matters relating to the
performance of the franchise, the grantee's services, and the proposed new
rates.
   (D)   No increase in rates and charges to subscribers for basic service
shall be made except as authorized by the Town Council by resolution after a
public hearing. In the event that the Town Council fails to approve or
disapprove the rate increase within a 90-day period, the increase shall be
deemed approved and shall be effective at the end of the 90-day notice period.
Should any agency of the federal, or state government increase compensation
liabilities of the grantee, the grantee shall have the right to increase its
rates pro rata for regular subscriber services to its subscribers in order to
offset the excess liability. Should the federal or state government make any
changes in rules or regulations relating to the franchise, then this agreement
shall be automatically amended to comply with the law or rule and the agreement
shall be subject to the same in all respects. The grantee shall not make cable
television service conditional upon the subscriber's buying, renting, leasing,
or obtaining repair services for television receivers, radio receivers,
antennas, parts, or accessories from the grantee, nor shall the grantee attempt
to influence its subscribers to deal with any particular person in regard
thereto. It shall not other- wise be unlawful for the grantee to engage in the
sale, service, repair, rental, or leasing of television receivers, radio
receivers, antennas, parts, or accessories in the franchise area. Except as and
to the extent elsewhere provided herein, the grantee shall not, as to rates,
charges, service facilities, rules, regulations, or in other respect, make or
grant any preferences or advantages to any person connected to its system, nor
subject any such person to any prejudice or disadvantage. However, nothing
herein contained shall be deemed to prevent the establishment of a graduated
scale of charges and classified rate schedules to which any customer coming
within the classification would be entitled; provided, that such graduated
scale of charges and classified rate schedules shall be first submitted to and
approved by the Town Council.
   (E)   Prior approval of the Town Council need not be obtained for any
increase for installation of equipment that does not exceed 10% in any one 12-
month period; however, any increase in rates pursuant to this provision shall
not be in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index
applicable to the same 12-month period. Any increase shall become effective ten
days after notice of the increase is given to the Town Council, together with a
certification that the increase is limited to 10% or less of grantee's existing
rate schedule for installation of equipment, or that the increase is limited to
the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the applicable 12-month period,
whichever is the lesser.
   (F)   Divisions (A) through (E) of this section shall be applicable to
grantee's operation only if it is not subject to effective competition as
provided by applicable FCC regulation; these provisions automatically shall be
inapplicable at those times as the grantee's operations qualify as subject to
effective competition under FCC regulations.
   (G)   Before putting any rate changes into effect the grantee shall be
required to notify all customers at least 30 days before the rate changes are
to become effective, by using a bill stuffer.

§ 111.26 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Local business and complaint office.
      (1)   During the term of this franchise, and any renewal thereof, the

a reasonable and cost-effective manner.
      (2)   As a minimum, the grantee shall provide the following:
         (a)   Grantee office and technical personnel to receive and respond to
customer calls during normal business hours (9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), Monday
through Friday, excluding legal holidays.
         (b)   A qualified and trained local answering service to receive calls
after normal business hours and on weekends and holidays. Training for the
personnel of the answering service shall ensure that the personnel will be able
to knowledgeably discuss certain limited aspects of typical cable-related
customer problems.
         (c)   Trained technicians to respond to all customer complaint calls
until 10:00 p.m. on any day should five or more calls be received from a given
service area.
   (B)   The general manager shall be responsible for implementing and
maintaining a comprehensive procedure for handling all complaints. Individual
company department heads shall be responsible for the immediate resolution of
complaints concerning their department.
   (C)   Grantee priorities for handling complaints.
      (1)   Grantee complaints concerning billing, employee courtesy,
programming, safety, or company policy shall be handled immediately. If the
employee initially contacted is unable to resolve the problem to the
subscriber's satisfaction the appropriate department manager or the general
manager shall have the responsibility for doing so.
      (2)   Service complaints involving a loss of service or affecting more
than one subscriber shall be dealt with immediately. All other complaints
relating to service shall be handled in sequence. Whenever reasonably possible
complaints shall be rectified in the same day as the complaint is received. In
no instance shall the system's response be more than 24 hours after the
complaint is received.
      (3)   All service calls shall be centrally dispatched and controlled by
the dispatcher contacting the nearest service technician and relating all the
pertinent information concerning the complaint (as described in recordkeeping
procedures).
   (D)   At the time cable service is installed, the subscriber shall receive a
package designed to forestall as many problems as possible. The package shall
contain an illustration of the monthly statement which explains the different
charges, instructions on how to use the converter, an explanation of the
system's service and complaint procedures, and the number to call for service.
The address and telephone number of the town office responsible for the
administration of the franchise shall be given to the subscriber. This package
shall be sent to all new subscribers and each subscriber upon request.
   (E)   The grantee will initiate prompt corrective action if any is needed to
satisfy unresolved complaints. If a customer is not satisfied with the solution
of a complaint, that customer shall automatically be referred to a management
person. Local management shall work with the person to resolve the problem
within 48 hours. Credits may be extended at the local management's option. In
the event that local management does not satisfy the customer's complaint, the
complaint shall be referred to the district manager.
   (F) All complaints shall be recorded on a service request form which shall
include name, address, phone number, date, and time of call, nature of
complaint, person to whom the call was assigned, how the problem was resolved,
and the time and date of resolution. These records shall be retained for three
years from the date of the resolution and shall be made available for periodic
inspection by the town.
   (G) Service calls shall be promptly dispatched to appropriate technicians.
The following procedure shall be observed among others:
      (1)    If the subscriber is not home, the technician shall check signal
levels on a grounding block outside the subscriber's home. If a problem exists,
the technician shall identify, locate, and resolve it.
      (2)    If no problem exists or after a problem has been fixed, the
technician shall leave a door hanger stating the fact that he has been there
and the time, the name of service technician, and request that, if there is
still a problem, the customer call the service office. The service call log
shall be completed, and the service call work order shall be placed with those
of other completed calls of the day.
   (H)   When there have been several similar complaints made, or where there
exists other evidence, which, in the judgment of the town, casts doubt on the
reliability or quality of cable service, the town shall have the right and
authority to require grantee to test, analyze, and report on the perform- ance
of the system. Grantee shall fully cooperate with the town in performing this
testing and shall prepare results and a report within 30 days after notice.
This report shall include the following information:
      (1)   The nature of the complaint or problem which precipitated the
special tests;
      (2)   What system component was tested;
      (3)   The equipment used and procedures employed in testing;
      (4)   The method, if any, in which the complaint or problem was resolved;
and
      (5)   Any other information pertinent to the tests and analyses which may
be required.
   (I)   The town may require that tests be supervised, at grantee's expense,
by a professional engineer, not on the permanent staff of the grantee. The
engineer should sign all records of special tests and forward to the town this
record with a report interpreting the results of the test and recommending
actions to be taken.
   (J)   The town's rights under this action shall be limited to requiring
tests, analyses, and reports covering the specified subject and characteristics
based on the complaints or other evidence when and under those circumstances as
the town has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other
evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against
substandard cable service.

§ 111.27 TRANSFER OF CATV SYSTEM.
   (A)   No transfer of control of a CATV system shall take place, whether by
force of attachment, merger, or any other form of disposition, without prior
notice to and approval of the town. The notice shall include full identifying
particulars of the proposed transaction, and the town shall act by resolution.
The town shall have 60 days within which to approve or disapprove a transfer of
control; if no action is taken within 60 days, approval shall be deemed to have
been given.
   (B)   Notice of transfer, together with copies of all documents pertaining
thereto, shall be filed in writing with the Town Clerk at least 30 days prior
thereto and is expressly conditioned upon full compliance with the terms of the
franchise issued and this chapter. The transferee shall agree in writing to
comply with all provisions and requirements the town may require.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section the term CONTROL is not limited to
majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever
manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has
occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or
group of persons to 10% of the voting shares of the grantee.
   (D)   In the absence of extraordinary circum- stances, the town will not
approve any transfer, assignment, or renewal of the franchise before completion
of initial construction of the energized system or within the first two years
of operation thereafter.

§ 111.28 TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   The town reserves the right to terminate, at any time any franchise
granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated therewith in
the event that:
      (1)   Grantee has not substantially complied in some material respect
with any provision of this chapter or the franchise agreement entered into by
and between the town and the grantee, or in any material respect with any terms
or conditions of any franchise or permit issued hereunder;
      (2)   Grantee has made a material, false statement in the application or
proposal for the franchise, knowing it to be false;
      (3)   The grantee, contrary to the best interest of public convenience
and welfare, is not providing subscribers with regular, adequate, and proper
service;
      (4)   The grantee becomes insolvent, enters into receivership or
liquidation, files for bankruptcy or for composition of creditors, is unable or
unwilling to pay his debts as they mature, or is in financial difficulty of
sufficient consequence so as to jeopardize the continued operation of the cable
television system unless the grantee is in due process of contesting these
debts;
      (5)   Grantee violates any FCC order or ruling or the order or ruling of
any other govern- mental body having jurisdiction over the grantee unless the
grantee is lawfully contesting the legality of applicability of the order;
      (6)   Grantee attempts to evade any material provision of this chapter or
of any supplemental written agreement entered into by and between the town and
the grantee; or
      (7)   Grantee disposes of any of the facilities or property of its CATV
business to prevent the town from purchasing same, as provided for herein.
   (B)   In the event that the town shall decide to terminate for cause a
franchise granted hereunder, it shall give the grantee 60 days written notice
of its intention to terminate and stipulate the cause. If during the 60-day
period the cause shall be cured to the satisfaction of the town, the town shall
declare the notice to be null and void. In any event, before a franchise may be
terminated the grantee must be provided with an opportunity to be heard before
the town in accordance with due process procedures.
   (C)   In the event of expiration or non-renewal of the term for which the
franchise is granted or if any part of the CATV system is discontinued for any
reason for a continuous period of 30 days or the franchise held by any grantee
to construct, operate, or maintain a CATV system is terminated by the town,
pursuant to the terms of this chapter, and all negotiations to settle the
differences between the parties have failed (provided, however, that such
negotiations shall not be required), the town may advertise and seek another
grantee to operate the system. If a franchise is granted to another person, the
terminated grantee may be required to sell the physical assets of the entire
CATV system to the new grantee at a price to be determined by three competent,
independent appraisers, one each to be appointed by the terminated grantee, the
new grantee, and the town. The appraisers so appointed shall use the then best
methods of appraising to determine this value. The cost of appraisers shall be
shared equally by the terminated grantee and the new grantee. The terminated
grantee shall execute those deeds, bills of sale, and other documents as may be
necessary to effectuate this sale. The terminated grantee shall fully cooperate
with these appraisers.
   (D)   At the expiration or nonrenewal of the term for which a franchise is
granted, or upon its termin- ation and cancellation, as provided for herein,
the town is expressly given the first right of refusal and option to purchase
the physical assets of grantee. In the event of a bona fide offer by a third
person to grantee for purchase of the physical assets, grantee shall, if it
desires to entertain the offer, immediately inform the town of same and submit
to the town incontrovertible evidence of the good faith bona fide terms,
conditions, and purchase price of the offer for which the town shall have the
first right of refusal. Should the town exercise this option and upon its
service of an official notice of such action upon the grantee, the grantee
shall immediately transfer to the town possession and title to all facilities
and property, real and personal, of the CATV business, free from any and all
liens and encumbrances not agreed to be assumed by the town in lieu of some
portion of the purchase price set forth above; and the grantee shall execute
such warranty deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the town as shall be
necessary for this purpose.
   (E)   The town shall give to grantee notice of its intent to exercise the
option to purchase at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the term of the
franchise. If the franchise is terminated as provided elsewhere herein, notice
of intent to exercise the option to purchase shall be contained in the notice
of intention to terminate.
   (F)   Should the grantee's franchise be termin- ated, expired, or not
renewed, and not purchased as above provided, and at such times as the
successor is ready to provide service, but not later than six months from
termination, expiration, or nonrenewal, the grantee shall begin removal of all
property owned by it, and placed on a public or private right-of-way unless
permitted by the town to abandon the property in place. In so removing such
plants, structures, and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own
expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave the public and
private places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to the grantee's
removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting, altering, or
disturbing in any way the electrical distribution or telephone cable, wire, or
attachments or any poles. The Town Manager or other officer, or his appointee,
shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and places and
cables, wires, attachments, and poles after removal. Liability insurance and
indemnity provided for herein shall continue in full force and effect during
the entire period of removal.
   (G)   In the event of any such removal, the grantee shall restore the public
right-of-way to a condition satisfactory to the town. Upon abandonment, which
shall only be done as the town directs, the grantee shall transfer ownership of
all such abandoned property to the town and submit to the town an instrument in
writing, subject to the approval of the Town Attorney, effecting the transfer.
   (H)   If the town or state is forced to remove the system, the work shall be
done at the expense of the terminated grantee.

town. This report shall be comprised of a standard corporate worksheet
including an itemized schedule of revenues and indicating that gross receipts
reported have been audited internally. The accuracy of the gross receipts

      (1)   Every alarm system user shall obtain a permit from the town Police
Department for each alarm system that such alarm system user owns, leases,
operates or uses within the municipal corporate limits or extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the town. An alarm system business must obtain a permit under
this section only if an alarm system is used to protect the premises in which
the business is housed.
      (2)   Any owner, lessor, operator or user of an alarm system that has a
direct connection with the Communication Center shall pay a fee of $240 per
year per alarm system.

located; the street address of the premises on which the alarm system has been
or will be installed; the type of alarm system; and the name, address, and
telephone number of at least three other persons who can be reasonably expected
to be available at any time, day or night, and who are authorized by the alarm
system user to respond to and open the premises where the alarm system is
installed. An alarm system located at a residential property and which is
capable of and configured to reset after a maximum of 30 minutes shall suffice
to meet the requirement that persons other than the alarm system owner be
available to respond to and open the premises in the event of a false alarm.
The form of the alarm system user permit application shall be prescribed by the
Town Manager. Any alarm system user may obtain a permit appli- cation from the
Police Department.
      (2)   At such time that any information required as provided in this
section is in any way changed or expanded, all alarm system users with permits
shall complete an updated alarm system user permit application within 60 days
after the town distributes notification of any such change or expansion of the
information required in the alarm system user permit application; provided,
however, that previously issued permits shall remain valid and in effect until
60 days after the town distributes notification of any such change or expansion
of the information required in the alarm system user permit application, at
which such permits shall automatically expire if the alarm system user has not
filed an updated alarm system user permit application. There shall be no fee
for completing another permit appli- cation under such circumstances.
      (3)   All alarm system users shall be responsible for updating and
supplementing the information in their alarm system user permit applications,
as necessary. Failure to fulfill such obligation shall be grounds for
revocation of a permit.
   (C)   (1)   An alarm system user permit application shall be submitted to
the Police Chief or Fire Chief, who shall approve such application if it is
determined that (i) the application provides all of the information required by
this chapter, and (ii) the applicant is not disqualified pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The Police Chief or Fire Chief shall not approve an alarm system
user permit application where the alarm system user's previous permit was
revoked and the alarm system user has not had the alarm system inspected and
repaired by a company licensed by the state to install and inspect alarm
systems.
      (3)   The Police Chief or Fire Chief may revoke a permit where it is
found that the alarm system user provided false information on the alarm system
user permit application form. Upon approval of an alarm system user permit
application by the Police Chief or Fire Chief as set forth in this section, a
permit shall be issued.
      (4)   Any person whose application for a permit is denied by the Police
Chief or Fire Chief may appeal from such decision to the Town Manager pursuant
to
§ 114.04 of this chapter.
   (D)   Each permit for a business shall be available at the premises where
the alarm system is installed and shall be available for inspection by the
Police Chief or Fire Chief during normal business hours.

alarm system without a permit as required by this chapter shall be assessed a

      (2)   If, at the time of the first false fire or police alarm for any
alarm system, the alarm system user has not obtained a permit, the alarm system
user will not be assessed a civil penalty, as provided above, so long as such
alarm system user applies for a permit within ten days of the occurrence of
such false fire or police alarm.
      (3)   The operation or use of an alarm system without a permit is
sufficient cause for the Police Department, upon notice in writing to the alarm
system user, to cease responding to further alarms until the alarm system user
applies for or obtains a valid permit.
(Ord. passed 7-17-00)
§ 114.03 ALARM SYSTEM USER RESPONSE TO POLICE ALARMS.
   (A)   The alarm system user or a representative thereof shall be available
at all times for the purpose of responding to police alarms by personally

Communications Center may elect not to respond to any further police alarms
from that system until the alarm is reset by the alarm system user or, in the
case of a defective alarm system, until the alarm system has been repaired.

the Police Department to cease responding to further alarms until:
      (1)   The alarm system user has paid all outstanding civil penalties in
full; and,

number listed in the alarm system user's updated permit application, the alarm
system user shall be assessed a civil penalty in accordance with
§ 10.98 of the Code of Ordinances.

      (1)   If the Communications Center receives in excess of one false police
alarm in any calendar month from any single alarm system, the alarm system user
shall be assessed a civil penalty of $50 for each said false alarm. Failure to
pay such civil penalty within 30 days from the date the notice of the violation
is issued may result in the revocation of the permit, and the Police Department
may cease responding to alarms from the premises until (i) the alarm system
user has paid all outstanding civil penalties in full, and (ii) the alarm
system is reset by the alarm system user or, in the case of a defective alarm
system, the alarm system has been repaired.
      (2)   If the Communications Center receives in excess of six false police
alarms in any calendar year from any single alarm system, the Police Chief
shall order the disconnection of any such alarm system and/or may revoke the
permit; provided, however, when the Police Chief has reason to believe that
such false alarms are the result of a defective alarm system, in lieu of such
disconnection or permit revocation, the Police Chief may require the alarm
system user to cause the alarm system to be inspected by an individual or
company licensed by the state to install and inspect alarm systems. The alarm
system user shall select and arrange for a qualified individual or company to
perform the inspection, and shall be responsible for compensating such
individual or company for such inspection. Within 30 days after being ordered
to do so by the Police Chief, the alarm system user shall provide the Police
Chief with appropriate documentation that (i) such an inspection was performed
and (ii) the alarm system has been reset or otherwise repaired. If the alarm
system user fails to provide the Police Chief with such documen- tation within
30 days after being ordered to do so, or if the alarm system is not repaired,
altered, replaced or other appropriate corrective action taken within 30 days
after the false alarm in all other circumstances, the Police Chief may
immediately order the alarm system to be disconnected and/or revoke the permit,
in the Police Chief’s sole and absolute discretion.
      (3)   Further, if the alarm system transmits an electronic alarm signal
or recorded message to a receiving station other than the Communication Center,
or is a local audible alarm, the Police Department, upon notice in writing to
the alarm system user, may cease responding to the alarms until the alarm
system is repaired and inspected under the guidelines stated in this section.
      (4)   Signals or messages transmitted by the alarm system during testing
procedures shall not be considered false alarms if the alarm system user first
notifies and receives permission from the Com- munications Center before
testing the alarm system.
   (B)   Fire false alarms.
      (1)   If the Communications Center receives in excess of one false fire
alarm in any calendar month from any single alarm system, the alarm system user
shall be assessed a civil penalty of $100 for each false alarm. Failure to pay
this penalty within 30 days from the date of notice of the violation is issued
may result in the revocation of the permit.
      (2)   If the Communications Center receives in excess of six false fire
alarms in any calendar year, the Fire Chief shall, except in the case of
educational and health care institutions, have the authority to order the
disconnection of any such alarm system and/or may revoke the permit; provided,
however, when the Fire Chief has reason to believe that such false alarms are
the result of a defective alarm system, in lieu of such disconnection or permit
revocation, the Fire Chief may require the alarm system user to cause the alarm
system to be inspected by an individual or company licensed by the state to
install and inspect alarm systems. The alarm system user shall select and
arrange for a qualified individual or company to perform the inspection, and
shall be responsible for compensating such individual for such inspection.
Within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Fire Chief, the alarm system
user shall provide the Fire Chief with appropriate documentation that (i) such
an inspection was performed and (ii) the alarm system has been reset or
otherwise repaired. If the alarm system user fails to provide the Fire Chief
with such documentation within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Fire
Chief, or if the alarm system is not repaired, altered, replaced or other
appropriate corrective action taken within 30 days after the false alarm in all
other circumstances, the Fire Chief may recommend to the Police Chief and the
Police Chief may immediately cause the alarm system to be disconnected and/or
may revoke the permit, in the Police Chief's sole and absolute discretion.
Signals or messages transmitted by the alarm system during testing procedures
shall not be considered false alarms if the alarm system user first notifies
and receives permission from the Communications Center before testing the alarm
system.

PERMITS
§ 150.020 PERMITS REQUIRED; APPLICATION.
   (A)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (B) of this section, no person

all permits required by the State Building Code and any other state or local
laws applicable to the work:
         (a)   The construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, movement
to another site, removal, or demolition of any building or structure.
         (b)   The installation, extension, or general repair of any plumbing
system except that in any one- or two-family dwelling unit a permit shall not
be required for the connection of a water heater that is being replaced,
provided that the work is performed by a person licensed under G.S. § 87-21,
who personally examines the work at completion and ensures that a leak test has
been performed on the gas piping, and provided the energy use rate or thermal
input is not greater than that of the water heater which is being replaced,
there is no change in fuel, energy source, location, capacity, or routing or
sizing of venting and piping, and the replacement is installed in accordance
with the current edition of the State Building Code.
         (c)   The installation, extension, alteration, or general repair of
any heating or cooling equipment system.
         (d)   The installation, extension, alteration, or general repair of
any electrical wiring, devices, appliances, or equipment except that in any
one- or two-family dwelling unit a permit shall not be required for repair or
replacement of electrical lighting fixtures or devices, such as receptacles and
lighting switches, or for the connection of an existing branch circuit to an
electric water heater that is being replaced, provided that all of the
following requirements are met:
            1.   With respect to electric water heaters, the replacement water
heater is placed in the same location and is of the same or less capacity and
electrical rating as the original.
            2.   With respect to electrical lighting fixtures and devices, the

            4.   The repair or replacement installation meets the current
edition of the State Building Code, including the State Electrical Code.
      (2)   However, a permit is not required for the installation,
maintenance, or replacement of any load control device or equipment by an
electric power supplier, as defined in G.S. § 62-133.8, or an electrical
contractor contracted by the electric power supplier, so long as the work is
subject to supervision by an electrical contractor licensed under Article 4 of
Chapter 87 of the General Statutes. The electric power supplier shall provide
such installation, maintenance, or replacement in accordance with an activity
or program ordered, authorized, or approved by the North Carolina Utilities
Commission pursuant to G.S. § 62-133.8 or G.S. § 62-133.9 or a similar program

are identified by the name and address of the author thereof, and if the
General Statutes of North Carolina require that plans for certain types of work
be prepared only by a registered architect or registered engineer, no permit
shall be issued unless the plans and specifications bear the North Carolina

contractor. No permit issued under Articles 9 or 9C of Chapter 143 shall be
required for any construction, installation, repair, replacement, or alteration
costing $5,000 or less in any single family residence or farm building unless

structures; the addition (excluding replacement of same size and capacity) or
change in the design of plumbing; the addition, replacement or change in the
design of heating, air conditioning, or electrical wiring, devices, appliances,

Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (B)   A city shall not require more than one permit for the complete
installation or replacement of any natural gas, propane gas, or electrical
appliance on an existing structure when the installation or replacement is
performed by a person licensed under G.S. § 87-21 or G.S. § 87-43. The cost of
the permit for such work shall not exceed the cost of any one individual trade
permit issued by that city, nor shall the city increase the costs of any fees
to offset the loss of revenue caused by this provision.
   (C)   No permit shall be issued pursuant to division (A) of this section for
any land-disturbing activity, as defined in G.S. § 113A-52(6), for any activity
covered by G.S. § 113A-57, unless an erosion and sedimentation control plan has
been approved by the Sedimentation Pollution Control Commission pursuant to
G.S. § 113A-54(d)(4) or by a local government pursuant to G.S. § 113A-61 for
the site of the activity or a tract of land including the site of the activity.
   (D)   No permit shall be issued pursuant to division (A) of this section for
any land-disturbing activity that is subject to, but does not comply with, the
requirements of G.S. § 113A-71.
   (E)   No permit shall be issued pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section
where the cost of the work is $30,000 or more, other than for improvements to
an existing single-family residential dwelling unit as defined in G.S. § 87-
15.5(7) that the owner occupies as a residence, or for the addition of an
accessory building or accessory structure as defined in the North Carolina
Uniform Residential Building Code, the use of which is incidental to that
residential dwelling unit, unless the name, physical and mailing address,
telephone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address of the lien
agent designated by the owner pursuant to G.S. § 44A-11.1(a) is conspicuously
set forth in the permit or in an attachment thereto. The building permit may
contain the lien agent's electronic mail address. The lien agent information
for each permit issued pursuant to this subsection shall be maintained by the
inspection department in the same manner and in the same location in which it
maintains its record of building permits issued.
   (F)   No city may withhold issuing a building permit or certificate of
occupancy that otherwise would be eligible to be issued under this section to
compel, with respect to another property or parcel, completion of work for a
separate permit or compliance with land use regulations under this section
unless otherwise authorized by law or unless the city reasonably determines the
existence of a public safety issue directly related to the issuance of a
building permit or certificate of occupancy.
(G.S. §160A-417)
   (G)   A city may by ordinance provide that a permit may not be issued under
divisions (A) and (B) of this section to a person who owes delinquent property
taxes, determined under G.S. § 105-360, on property owned by the person. The
ordinance may provide that a building permit may be issued to a person
protesting the assessment or collection of property taxes.

him to determine whether the proposed work complies with the appropriate
regulatory codes. Plans shall be drawn to scale with sufficient clarity to
indicate the nature and extent of the work proposed, and the plans and
specifications together shall contain information sufficient to indicate that
the work proposed will conform to the provisions of this chapter and the

   (B)   Limitations on issuance.

prepared only by a registered architect or registered engineer, no building
permit shall be issued for any building or structure, unless the plans and
specifications bear the state seal of a registered architect or a registered
engineer.
      (3)   Where any provision of the General Statutes of North Carolina or of
any provision of this code or other ordinance requires that work be done by a
licensed specialty contractor of any kind, no permit for such work shall be
issued, unless it is to be performed by such licensed specialty contractor.
      (4)   Where detailed plans and specifications are required under this
chapter, no building permit shall be issued, unless such plans and
specifications have been provided.
Penalty, see §
150.999
§ 150.023 FEES.
   Fees for permits shall be based upon the total estimated cost of the
proposed work, including all subcontracts, if any, but in no case shall the
total estimated cost be less than the market value of similar completed work in
the town, as determined by the appropriate inspector. Permit fees shall be as
established from time to time by the Town Council. Schedules of such fees shall
be maintained on file in the offices of the appropriate inspectors.
§ 150.024 TIME LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY.
   All permits issued under this chapter shall expire by limitation six months
after the date of issuance, if the work authorized by the permit has not been
commenced. If, after commencement, the work is discontinued for a period of 12
months, the permit therefor shall immediately expire. No work authorized by any
permit which has expired shall thereafter be performed, until a new permit
therefor has been secured.
(G.S. § 160A-418) Penalty, see
§ 150.999
§ 150.025 CHANGES IN WORK AFTER ISSUANCE.
   After a permit has been issued, no changes or deviations from the terms of

deviations are clearly permissible under the state building code, shall be
made, until specific written approval of such changes or deviations has been
obtained from the Inspection Department.
(G.S. § 160A-419) Penalty, see
§ 150.999
§ 150.026 REVOCATION.
   The appropriate inspector may revoke and require the return of any permit by
notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for such revocation.
Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved
application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with
requirements of this chapter, any applicable state law and/or any appropriate

   (A)   Inspections of work in process. The Inspection Department shall
inspect all buildings and structures and work therein for which a permit of any
kind has been issued as often as necessary in order to determine whether the
work complies with this chapter and the appropriate codes. When deemed
necessary by the appropriate inspector, materials and assemblies may be
inspected at the point of manufacture or fabrication, or inspections may be
made by approved and recognized inspection organizations. However, no approval
shall be based upon reports of such organ- izations, unless the same are in
writing and certified by a responsible officer of such organization. All
holders of permits, or their agents, shall notify the Inspection Department and
the appropriate inspector at each of the following stages of construction, so
that approval may be given before work is continued:
      (1)   Foundation inspection. To be made after trenches are excavated and
the necessary reinforcement and forms are in place, and before concrete is
placed. Drilled footings, piles, and similar types of foundations shall be
inspected as installed.
      (2)   Framing inspection. To be made after all structural framing is in
place and all roughing-in of plumbing and electrical and heating has been
installed, after all fire blocking, chimneys, bracing and vents are installed,
but before any of the structure is enclosed or covered. Poured-in-place
concrete structural elements shall be inspected before each pour of any
structural member.
      (3)   Fireproofing inspection. To be made after all areas required to be
protected by fireproofing are lathed, but before the plastering or other fire-
proofing is applied.
      (4)   Final inspection. To be made after the building or structure has
all doors hung and fixtures set and is ready for occupancy, but before the
building is occupied.
   (B)   Calls for inspection. Request for inspect- ions may be made to the
office of the Inspection Department or to the appropriate inspector. The
Inspection Department shall make inspections as soon as practicable after
requests are made therefor, provided such work is ready for inspection at the
time the request is made.
      (1)   Re-inspections may be at the con- venience of the inspector. No
work shall be inspected until it is in proper and completed condition ready for
inspection. All work which has been concealed before the inspection and
approval shall be uncovered at the request of the inspector and placed in
condition for proper inspection. Approval or rejection of the work shall be
furnished by the appropriate inspector in the form of a notice posted on the
building or given to the permit holder or his agent.
      (2)   Failure to call for inspections or pro- ceeding without approval at
each stage of construction shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
   (C)   Street or alley lines. Where the applicant for a permit proposes to
erect any building or structure on the line of any street, alley, or other
public place, he shall secure a survey of the line of the street, alley, or
other public place adjacent to the property upon which the building or
structure is to be erected, before proceeding with construction of the building
or structure. It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to see that the
building does not encroach upon the street, alley, or other public place.
   (D)   Certificates of compliance. At the con- clusion of all work done under
a permit, the appropriate inspector shall make a final inspection, and if he
finds that the completed work complies with all applicable state and local laws
and with the terms of the permit, he shall issue a certificate of compliance.
No new building or part thereof may be occupied, no addition or enlargement of
an existing building may be occupied, and no existing building that has been
altered or moved may be occupied, until the Inspection Department has issued a
certificate of compliance. A temporary certificate of compliance may be issued
permitting occupancy for a stated period of specified portions of the building
that the inspector finds may safely be occupied prior to final completion of
the entire building. Violation of this section shall constitute a class 1
misdemeanor.
(G.S. § 160A-423)
   (E)   Periodic inspections. The Inspection Department shall make periodic
inspections, subject to the Board of Commissioner's directions, for unsafe,
unsanitary, or otherwise hazardous and unlawful conditions in structures within
its territorial jurisdiction. In addition, it shall make inspections when it
has reason to believe that such conditions may exist in a particular structure.
In exercising this power, members of the Department shall have a right to enter
on any premises within the jurisdiction of the Department at all reasonable
hours for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action, upon
presentation of proper credentials.

§ 152.37 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing.  Whenever a petition is
filed with the Inspector by a public authority or by at least five residents of
the town, charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human
habitation, or whenever it appears to the Inspector, upon inspection, that any
dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, he shall, if his
preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause
to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or

   (B)   Procedure after hearing. After such notice and hearing, the Inspector
shall state in writing his determination whether the dwelling or dwelling unit
is unfit for human habitation, and if so, whether it is deteriorated or
dilapidated.
      (1)   If the Inspector determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is
deteriorated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of that
determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an
order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter, or improve the
dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness
established by this chapter within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90
days. The order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close the
dwelling or dwelling unit until the repairs, alterations, and improvements have
been made.
      (2)   If the Inspector determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, he
shall state in writing his findings of fact to support that determination, and
shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing
and requiring the owner either to repair, alter, or improve the dwelling or
dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by
this chapter, or else to vacate and remove or demolish them within a specified
period of time not to exceed 90 days.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or
dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the Inspector to repair,
alter, or improve, or to vacate and close the same within the time specified
therein, or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail
to comply with an order of the Inspector to repair, alter, or improve, or to
vacate and close and remove or demolish the same within the time specified
therein, the Inspector shall submit to the Town Council at its next regular
meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney to petition the superior court
for an order directing that owner to comply with the order of the Inspector, as
authorized by G.S. § 160A-446(g).
      (2)   In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated or
dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with an order of the Inspector
within the time specified therein, if injunctive relief has not been sought or
has not been granted as provided in division (C)(1) above, the Inspector shall
submit to the Town Council an ordinance ordering the Inspector to cause that
dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, closed,
removed, or demolished, as provided in the original order of the Inspector, and
pending removal or demolition, to place a placard on that dwelling as provided
by G.S. § 160A-443 and
§ 152.39.
      (3)   (a)    If the Town Council shall have adopted an ordinance as
provided in G.S. § 160A-443(4), or the Inspector shall have: (a) in a
municipality located in counties which have a population in excess of 71,000 by
the last federal census, other than municipalities with a population in excess
of 190,000 by the last federal census, issued an order, ordering a dwelling to
be repaired or vacated and closed, as provided in G.S. § 160A-443(3)a., and if
the dwelling has been vacated and closed for a period of one year pursuant to
the ordinance or order; (b) in a municipality with a population in excess of
190,000 by the last federal census, commenced proceedings under the substandard
housing regulations regarding a dwelling to be repaired or vacated and closed,
as provided in G.S. § 160A-443(3)a., and if the dwelling has been vacated and
closed for a period of one year pursuant to the ordinance or after such
proceedings have commenced, then if the Town Council shall find that the owner
has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling
in order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the
dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health,
safety, morals and welfare of the town in that the dwelling would continue to
deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to
children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities,
would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in
the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might
otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent
and affordable housing in this state, then in such circumstances, the Town
Council may, after the expiration of such one-year period, enact an ordinance
and serve such ordinances on the owner, setting forth the following:
         1.   It is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit
for the human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days; or
         2.   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
      (b)   This ordinance shall be recorded in the Office of the Registrar of
Deeds in the county wherein the property or properties are located and shall be
indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner
fails to comply with this ordinance, the public officer shall effectuate the
purpose of the ordinance. (G.S. § 160A-443(5a))
   (D)   Appeals from orders of Inspector.
      (1)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Inspector may be taken
by any person aggrieved thereby. Any appeal from the Inspector shall be taken
within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order, and
shall be taken by filing with the Inspector and with the Board of Adjustment a
notice of appeal, which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is
based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the Inspector shall forthwith
transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon
which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of
the Inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his
decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When an appeal is
from a decision of the Inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act,
the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the
hearing by the Board of Adjustment, unless the Inspector certifies to the Board
of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of
the facts stated in the certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished the
appellant, a suspension of this requirement would cause imminent peril to life
or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except for
due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the Inspector,
by the Board of Adjustment, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant
to G.S. § 160A-446(f) and division (E) below.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its
decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent
or attorney. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision
and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it
shall have all the powers of the Inspector, but the concurring vote of four
members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to reverse or modify any
decision or order of the Inspector. The Board of Adjustment shall have power
also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict
letter of this chapter, to adapt the application of this chapter to the
necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
      (3)   Every decision of the Board of Adjust- ment shall be subject to
review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of
the decision of the Board of Adjustment, but not otherwise.
      (E)   Petition to superior court by owner.  Any person aggrieved by an
order issued by the Inspector or a decision rendered by the Board of Adjustment
shall have the right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering
of the decision, to petition the superior court for a temporary injunction
restraining the Inspector pending a final disposition of the cause, as provided
by G.S. § 160A-446(f).
(Ord. passed 6-6-83)
§ 152.38 METHOD OF SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   Complaints or orders issued by the Inspector shall be served upon persons
either personally or by registered or certified mail. If the whereabouts of
such persons are unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Inspector in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, the Inspector shall make an affidavit to that
effect, and the serving of the complaint or order upon that person may be made
by publishing the same at least once no later than the time at which personal
service would be required under the provisions of this chapter in a newspaper
having general circulation in the town. Where service is made by publication, a
notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
premises affected by the complaint or order.

chapter, and upon adoption by the Town Council of an ordinance authorizing and
directing him to do so, as provided by G.S. § 160A-443(5) and
§ 152.37(C), the Inspector shall proceed to cause such dwelling or dwelling

chapter by criminal process as authorized by G.S. § 14-4 and
§ 152.99, and the enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent

MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES
§ 153.010 MAINTENANCE STANDARDS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   All nonresidential buildings and structures shall be free of all conditions
that are dangerous and injurious to the public health, safety and welfare of

chapter:
   (A)   Interior walls, vertical studs, partitions, supporting members, sills,
joists, rafters, or other basic structural members that list, lean, or buckle
to such an extent as to render the building unsafe, that are rotted,
deteriorated or damaged, and that have holes or cracks which might admit
rodents.
   (B)   Exterior walls that are not structurally sound, free from defects and
damages, and capable of bearing imposed loads safely. Where a wall of a
building has become exposed as a result of demolition of adjacent buildings,

sanitation problems. All garbage and solid waste shall be in approved
containers or stored in a safe and sanitary manner.

overhanging objects, which constitute a danger of falling on persons or
property.
   (I)   Buildings and structures including their environs that have
insufficiently protected holes, excavations, breaks, projections, obstructions,
and other such dangerous impediments on and around walks, driveways, parking
lots, alleyways, and other areas which are accessible to and generally used by
persons on or around the premises.
   (J)   Buildings and structures that have cracked or broken glass, loose
shingles, loose wood, crumbling stone or brick, loose or broken plastic, or
other dangerous objects or similar hazardous conditions. Exterior surfaces
shall be maintained in such material or treated in such a manner as to prevent
deterioration and repaired or replaced with like or similar material according

jeopardized for failure of the property to meet the minimum standards
established by this chapter, the Inspector shall undertake a preliminary
investigation.
   (B)   Complaint and hearing. If the preliminary investigation discloses

   (C)   Procedure after hearing.
      (1)   If, after notice and hearing, the Inspector determines that the
nonresidential building or structure has been maintained in that the property
meets the minimum standards established by this chapter, the Inspector shall
state in writing findings of fact in support of that determination and shall
issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof a copy of said
determination.
      (2)   If, after notice and hearing, the Inspector determines that the

fact in support of that determination and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner thereof an order in accordance with the provisions of division
(C)(3) and (4) of this section and subject to the limitations set forth in §§
153.023 and
153.024.
      (3)   If the Inspector determines that the cost of repair, alteration, or
improvement of the building or structure would not exceed 50% of its then
current value, then the Inspector shall state in writing the findings of fact
in support of such determination and issue an order that requires the owner,
within a reasonable time specified in the order, to either repair, alter, or
improve the nonresidential building or structure in order to bring it into
compliance with the minimum standards established by this chapter or vacate and
close the nonresidential building or structure for any use.
      (4)   If the Inspector determines that the cost of repair, alteration, or
improvement of the building or structure would exceed 50% of its then current
value, then the code enforcement coordinator or officer shall state in writing
the findings of fact in support of such determination and issue an order that

the nonresidential building or structure, the Inspector shall submit to the
Town Council an ordinance ordering the Inspector to cause such nonresidential
building or structure to be removed or demolished. No ordinance shall be

Council. The property shall be described in the ordinance. If the Town Council
adopts the ordinance, the Inspector shall cause the building or structure to be
removed or demolished.

§ 153.023 LIMITATIONS ON ORDERS AND ORDINANCES: HISTORIC LANDMARK OR HISTORIC
DISTRICT.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the nonresidential
building or structure is designated as a local historic landmark, listed in the
National Register of Historic Places, or located in a locally designated
historic district or in a historic district listed in the National Register of
Historic Places and the Town Council determines, after a public hearing, that
the nonresidential building or structure is of individual significance or
contributes to maintaining the character of the district, and the
nonresidential building or structure has not been condemned as unsafe, an order
issued by the Inspector pursuant to §
153.022(C) and an ordinance approved by the Town Council pursuant to §
153.022(D) may only require that the nonresidential building or structure be
vacated and closed until it is brought into compliance with the minimum
standards established by this chapter.
(Ord. 2008-09-02, passed 9-2-08)
§ 153.024 LIMITATIONS ON ORDERS AND ORDINANCES: VACANT MANUFACTURING FACILITY
OR VACANT INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an order issued by the
Inspector pursuant to §
153.022(C) and an ordinance approved by the Town Council pursuant to §
153.022(D) may not require repairs, alterations, or improvements to be made to
a vacant manufacturing facility or a vacant industrial warehouse to preserve
the original use. The order and ordinance may require such building or
structure to be vacated and closed, but repairs may be required only when
necessary to maintain structural integrity or to abate a health or safety
hazard that cannot be remedied by ordering the building or structure closed for
any use.
(Ord. 2008-09-02, passed 9-2-08)
§ 153.025 VACATED AND CLOSED NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   (A)   If the Town Council has adopted an ordinance or the Inspector has
issued an order requiring the building or structure to be repaired, altered, or
improved or vacated and closed and the building or structure has been vacated
and closed for a period of two years pursuant to the ordinance or order, then
if the Town Council finds that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose
to repair, alter, or improve the building or structure and that the
continuation of the building or structure in its vacated and closed status
would be inimical to the health, safety, and welfare of the town in that it
would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire or safety hazard, would be a
threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal
activities, or would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of
property values in the area, then the Town Council may, after the expiration of
the two year period, adopt an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner,
setting forth the following:
      (1)   The ordinance shall require that the owner either demolish and
remove the nonresidential building or structure within 90 days or repair,
alter, or improve the nonresidential building or structure to bring it into
compliance with the minimum standards established by this chapter within 90
days.
      (2)   The ordinance shall require that if the owner does not either
demolish and remove the nonresidential building or structure within 90 days or
repair, alter, or improve the nonresidential building or structure to bring it
into compliance with the minimum standards established by this chapter within
90 days, then the Inspector shall demolish and remove the nonresidential
building or structure.
   (B)   In the case of a vacant manufacturing facility or a vacant industrial
warehouse, the building or structure must have been vacated and closed pursuant
to an order or ordinance for a period of five years before the Town Council may
take action under this section.
   (C)   If the owner fails to comply with the requirements of the ordinance
within 90 days, the Inspector shall demolish and remove the nonresidential
building or structure.

§ 153.026 METHODS OF SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)   Complaints or orders issued by the Inspector under this chapter shall
be served upon persons either personally or by registered or certified mail
and, in conjunction therewith, may be served by regular mail. When the manner
or service is by regular mail in conjunction with registered or certified mail,
and the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular
mail is not returned by the post office within ten days after mailing, service
shall be deemed sufficient. The person mailing the complaint or order by
regular mail shall certify that fact and the date thereof, and such certificate
shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. If regular mail is used, a notice
of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
premises thereby affected.
   (B)   If the identities of any owner or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Inspector in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, and the Inspector makes an affidavit to that effect, then
the serving of the complaint or order upon the unknown owners or other persons
may be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the
town at least once no later than the time at which personal service would be
required under the provisions of this chapter. When service is made by
publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises thereby affected.

comply with an order of the Inspector issued pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter and upon adoption by the Town Council of an ordinance authorizing and
directing the owner to do so, as provided by G.S. § 160A-439(f) and §
153.022(D), the Inspector shall proceed to cause such nonresidential building
or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved to comply with the minimum
standards established by this chapter, or to be vacated and closed or to be
removed or demolished, as directed by the ordinance of the Town Council. The
Inspector may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any nonresidential
building or structure which is to be vacated and closed a placard with the

shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.
(Ord. 2008-09-02, passed 9-2-08)
§ 153.028 COSTS, A LIEN ON PREMISES.
   (A)   As provided by G.S. § 160A-439(i), the amount of the cost of any
repairs, alterations, or improvements, or vacating and closing, or removal or
demolition, caused to be made or done by the Inspector pursuant to §
153.022(D) or §
153.025 shall be a lien against the real property upon which such costs were
incurred. Such lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be enforced and
the costs collected as provided by G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10. The amount of
the costs shall also be a lien on any other real property of the owner located
within the town limits except for the owner's primary residence. The additional
lien provided in this division is inferior to all prior liens and shall be
collected as a money judgment.
   (B)   If the nonresidential building or structure is removed or demolished
by the Inspector, the Inspector shall offer for sale the recoverable materials
of the building or structure and any personal property, fixtures, or
appurtenances found in or attached to the building or structure and shall
credit the proceeds of the sale, if any, against the cost of the removal or
demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court
by the Inspector, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall
be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final
order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
impair or limit in any way the power of the governing body to define and
declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary
proceedings or otherwise.

§ 153.029 EJECTMENT.
   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a nonresidential
building or structure, the Inspector may file a civil action in the name of the
town to remove the occupant. The action to vacate shall be in the nature of
summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as
parties-defendant any person occupying the nonresidential building or
structure. The clerk of superior court shall issue a summons requiring the
defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date, and place not
to exceed ten days from the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint.
The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. § 42-29. The
summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it
appears to have been duly served and if at the hearing the Inspector produces a
certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the Town Council pursuant to G.S. §
160A-493(f) and §
153.022(D) to vacate the occupied nonresidential building or structure, the
magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated and all
persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the nonresidential building or
structure be vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for
summary ejectment entered under G.S. § 42-30. An appeal from any judgment
entered under this division by the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S.
§ 7A-228, and the execution of the judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. §
7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a nonresidential building or
structure who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary
ejectment proceeding pursuant to this division unless the occupant was served
with notice, at least 30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment
proceeding, that the Town Council has ordered the Inspector to proceed to
exercise his duties under G.S. § 160A-493(f) and § 153.022(D) to vacate and
close or remove and demolish the nonresidential building or structure.

§ 153.031 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
   Neither this chapter nor any of its provisions shall be construed to impair
or limit in any way the power of the town to define and declare nuisances and
to cause their abatement by summary action or otherwise, or to enforce this
chapter by criminal process as authorized by G.S. § 14-4, and §
153.035, and the enforcement of any remedy provided herein or in other

notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is
based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the Inspector shall forthwith
transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon

of the Inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act,
the Inspector's decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When
any appeal is from a decision of the Inspector requiring the person aggrieved
to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement
until the hearing by the Board of Adjustment, unless the Inspector certifies to
the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal is filed, that by reason of
the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the
appellant) a suspension of the requirement would cause imminent peril to life
or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a
restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than
one day's written notice to the Inspector, by the Board of Adjustment, or by a
court of record upon petition made pursuant to G. S. § 160A-446(f) and §
153.033.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of all appeals, shall give notice to all the parties, and shall render its
decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent
or attorney. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision
and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it
shall have all the powers of the Inspector, but the concurring vote of four-
fifths of the members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to reverse
or modify any decision or order of the Inspector. The Board of Adjustment shall
have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case when practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict
letter of this chapter, to adapt the application of the chapter to the
necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the chapter shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
      (3)   Every decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be subject to
review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari
instituted within 15 days of the decision of the Board of Adjustment, but not
otherwise.
