property line where the distribution line runs immediately adjacent and
parallel to the property to be served, and charge an installation fee in
accordance with the fee schedule kept on file in the office of the Town Clerk.
The meter will be installed at a mutually agreeable location, clear of
obstructions and accessible for reading.
      (2)   At its discretion, the town shall replace water meters at town
expense to insure correct metering of water usage and to avoid improperly
functioning or leaking meters. Hookup of the meter from the distribution line
to the meter shall be the responsibility of the town.
      (3)   All premises using the town’s water supply must be equipped with an
adequate water meter furnished by the town, but paid for by the consumer. In
the case of new construction, before any premises are occupied a water meter
shall be installed therein as herein required or application made for such
water service. The town, by and through its Town Manager, has the authority to
require the installation of meters in a location that will be easy to access
and, in the case of a multi-unit structure, shall have the authority to
determine if a meter is necessary for each unit or if the multi-unit structure
can be served by one meter. In the case of structures that are currently being
occupied, the Town Manager shall have the authority to require the installation
of meters in a location that will be easy to access and, in the case of a
multi-unit structure, shall have the authority to determine if a meter is
necessary for each unit or if the multi-unit structure can be served by one
meter. The town shall arrange to install meters on premises that are not
currently metered either individually by unit or by multi-unit structure and
the consumer shall be billed for the cost of the meter installation, said bill
to be included within and becoming a part of their water bill.
      (4)   The town reserves the right to refuse service unless consumer’s
lines are installed in such a manner as to prevent cross-connection or
backflow. Upon request of the consumer or upon recommendation of the Building
Inspector, the town may inspect consumer’s dwelling-side system hook-up for
adequacy. A plumbing inspection fee will be collected.
      (5)   When two or more meters are to be installed on the same premises
for different consumers, they shall be closely grouped and clearly identified
as to which consumer each applies. Installation fees are charged for each
individual meter.
      (6)   The town shall be responsible for the cost of repair of town-owned
waterlines up to individual resident’s meter or where two inch or six inch
meters are in use, to the cut off valve and/or meter closest to the outside of
the building to which the water is supplied.
   (B)   Town liability:  
      (1)   The town shall not be liable for damage of any kind resulting from
water or use of water on consumer’s premises. The town shall not be responsible
for any damage done or resulting from any defect in the piping, fixtures, or
appliances on consumer’s premises. The town shall not be responsible for
negligence of third persons or forces beyond the control of the town resulting
in interruption of service.
      (2)   The town shall not be liable to consumers for the quantity or
quality of water furnished by the county, or for any damage that may result to
the consumers from shutting off water main or service, for all purposes
whatsoever, even in cases where no notice is given, and all contracts
agreements or permits for the use of water purchased by the town from the
county, are made expressly subject to the provisions of this section.
   (C)   Consumer responsibilities:
      (1)   Consumer’s piping and apparatus shall be installed and maintained
in a safe and efficient manner in accordance with town’s ordinances and in full
compliance with sanitary regulations of State Board of Health and the North
Carolina Standard Plumbing Code.
      (2)   Consumer shall guarantee proper protection of town’s property
placed on consumer’s premises and permit access to it only by town
representatives.
      (3)   On all new construction, and replacements of water meters on
improved property, consumer shall furnish and maintain a private cutoff valve
on the consumer’s side of the water meter. The town provides curb stops
accessible only by special tool on the opposite side of the meter (normally
part of the installed meter). Water may be cut off at the town’s side of the
meter only by town officials, town staff, qualified county maintenance workers
or plumbers licensed to work in the town. Throughout the year, an owner or
rental agent may request the town turn the water off or on at a specific meter
or cut-off valve. A fee will be assessed for each water turn off/on which is
payable at town hall at the time of the request. For disregard of or violation
of this section, the water may be turned off by the town.
      (4)   If replacement in accordance with division (A)(2) above is
required, connection of a replacement water meter to the house waterline shall
be the financial responsibility of the property owners who according to the
current State Plumbing Code may perform their own hookup of the waterline to
the meter or may pay a licensed plumber to connect the line to the meter. The
Town Building Inspector will check final work but will waive plumbing
inspection fee by consumer. No certification of occupancy on new construction
or certificate of completion will be issues until inspection is satisfactory.
      (5)   Replacement of the meter box due to damage by a property owner,
renter, or worker employed by the owner will be performed by the town and
billed to the property owner at a fee established on the fee schedule kept on
file in the office of the Town Clerk.
   (D)   Consumer Liability: Should a consumer be the cause of any loss or
damage to the town’s water system property, or accident/injury to persons
performing water system operations or maintenance on consumer’s property, they
shall be fully liable and will be considered for action under §
50.04.

Town Hall to the water commissioner before the bill becomes delinquent in
accordance with §
50.04. Such claim, if made after the bill is delinquent, shall not prevent
discontinuance of service as provided above. The consumer may pay the bill
under protest and not prejudice their claim.
   (B)   Should a consumer suffer unanticipated water loss and subsequent high
consumption charge due to no fault of the town, the consumer may apply for
relief to the town. In order to be eligible for relief, the consumer must
produce evidence that a repair has been made correcting the water loss
situation. The consumer’s loss will be reduced by no more than the excess to
the town’s cost of water for all water above the consumer’s normal consumption.
No adjustment will be made to any other charge for service. Consumer must
nonetheless pay the original bill as computed, on time and in accord with §
50.32. The adjustment process will be handled as an administrative function of
the town with periodic reports of activity to the Town Manager.

Department of Environment and Natural Resources and which has been approved for
human consumption.
   PUBLIC POTABLE WATER SYSTEM. Any publicly or privately owned water system
operated as a public utility, under a current State Department of Environment
and Natural Resources permit, to supply water for public consumption or use.
This system will include all sources, facilities, and appurtenances between the
source and the point of delivery such as valves, pumps, pipes, conduits, tanks,
receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey,
treat, or store a potable water for public consumption or use.
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An assembly
containing within its structure a minimum of two independently acting, approved
check valves, together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically
independent, pressure differential relief valve located between the check
valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The first check valve
reduces the supply pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal flow
and at cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the checks is less than
the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the pressure
differential relief valve, by discharge to atmosphere, shall operate to
maintain the pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure. The
unit shall include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the
assembly and each assembly shall be fitted with properly located test cocks.
The assembly is designed to protect against a health hazard (for example,
contaminant).
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE DETECTOR ASSEMBLY. A specially designed assembly
composed of a line-size approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly with a specific bypass water meter and a meter-sized approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. The meter shall register, in

public potable water system, for example, where the Department loses
jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to
the consumer's water system.
   TOWN. The Town of Caswell Beach, North Carolina.
   VACUUM BREAKIER - ATMOSPHERIC TYPE. Also known as the “non-pressure type
vacuum breaker,” this term means a device containing a float-check, a check
seat, and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the body causes the float
to close the air inlet port. When the flow of water stops, the float falls and
forms a check valve against backsiphonage and at the same time opens the air
inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shutoff valve
immediately upstream may be an integral part of the device. An atmospheric
vacuum breaker is designed to protect against a nonhealth hazard, isolation
protection only, under a backsiphonage condition only.
   VACUUM BREAKER - PRESSURE TYPE. An assembly containing an independently
operating internally loaded check valve and an independently operating loaded
air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The assembly
is to be equipped with properly located test cocks and tightly closing shutoff
valves attached at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed to
protect against a health hazard (for example, contaminant) under a
backsiphonage condition only.
   WATER PURVEYOR. The owner or operator of a public potable water system,
providing an approved water supply to the public. Brunswick County is the water
purveyor for the Town of Caswell Beach. The Town of Caswell Beach is the water
purveyor to its customers.
   WATER SUPPLY - APPROVED. Any public potable water supply which has been
investigated and approved by the State Department of Environment and Natural
Resources. The system must be operating under a valid health permit. In
determining what constitutes an approved water supply, the State Department of
Environment and Natural Resources has reserved the final judgment as to its
safety and potability.
   WATER SUPPLY - AUXILIARY. Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than Brunswick County's approved public potable water supply. These
auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water
supply or any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream, and the
like, “used water”, or industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted,
contaminated, or objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over
which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
   WATER SUPPLY - UNAPPROVED. A water supply which has not been approved for
human consumption by the State Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
   WATER - USED. Any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public water
system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of
delivery and is no longer under the control of the water purveyor.

Department, hereinafter referred to as the Department, as the water purveyor,
in the elimination of all hazards, both actual and potential to potable water
within the town's public water supply system.
   (B)   This subchapter will comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act
(SDWA) (P.L. 93-523), the North Carolina Administrative Code (NCAC) (Title 10,
Chapter 10, Subchapter 10-D, paragraph, 1006), and the North Carolina Building
Code (Volume II) as they pertain to cross-connections with the public water
supply system and will apply the principle that the degree of protection should
be commensurate with the degree of the hazard or potential hazard to the public
water supply system.
(Res. passed 11-20-03)
§ 50.47 PURPOSE.
   The specific purposes of this subchapter are as follows:
   (A)   To protect the public potable water supply of the town against actual
or potential contamination (for example, cross-connections, backflow,
backsiphonage) by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or
pollutants that could, under adverse conditions, backflow through uncontrolled
cross-connections into the public water system.
   (B)   To eliminate or control existing cross-connections, actual or
potential, (backflow, backsiphonage or any other source of water or process
water used for any purpose whatsoever) which may jeopardize the potability of
the town's public water supply system.
   (C)   Establish and maintain a continuing inspection program of cross-
connection and inspection which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution, either actual or potential, of all potable water
systems connected to the town's public water supply system.
   (D)   Control cross-connections (for example, backflow and backsiphonage)
through cooperation between the town and the town's customers (consumers).
Responsibilities and duties of each will be set forth in this policy and their
applicable regulations.
(Res. passed 11-20-03)
§ 50.48 RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   Health agency. The State Department of Environment and Natural
Resources has the responsibility for promulgating and enforcing laws, rules,
regulations, and policies to be followed in carrying out an effective cross-
connection control program. The State Department of Environment and Natural
Resources also has the primary responsibility of insuring that Brunswick County
operates the public potable water system free of actual or potential sanitary
hazards, including unprotected cross-connections. The State Department of
Environment and Natural Resources has the further responsibility of insuring
that Brunswick County provides an approved water supply at the service to the
town's public water system and, further, that it requires the installation,
testing, and maintenance of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the
service connection when required.
   (B)   Water purveyor. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter,
Brunswick County has the responsibility to ensure a safe water supply begins at
the source and includes all of the public water distribution system, including
the service connection, and ends at the point of delivery to the town's water
system. In addition, the Department shall exercise reasonable vigilance to
insure that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public
potable water system. To insure that the proper precautions are taken, the
town's Water Commissioner or his duly appointed representative, is required to
determine the degree of hazard or potential hazard to the public potable water
system and to determine the degree of protection required; and to ensure proper
containment protection through an on-going inspection program. When it is
determined that a backflow prevention assembly is required for the protection
of the public system, the Department shall require the consumer, at the
consumer's expense, to install an approved backflow prevention assembly at each
service connection, to test immediately upon installation and thereafter at a
frequency as determined by the Department, to properly repair and maintain the
assembly or assemblies and to keep adequate records of each test and subsequent
maintenance and repair, including materials and/or replacement part. Failure,
refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer to install, have tested, and
maintain the assembly(s), shall constitute grounds for enforcement (for
example, stipulated penalties, disconnection of water service, and the like)
until the requirements have been satisfactorily met. Enforcement of this policy
shall be administered by the Water Commissioner or an authorized representative
of the town.
   (C)   Plumbing inspection.  
      (1)   The town's Building Inspector as part of the permitting process has
the responsibility to not only review building plans and inspect plumbing as it
is installed, but, he or she has the explicit responsibility of preventing
cross-connections from being designed and built into the plumbing system within
his jurisdiction.
      (2)   Where the review of building plans suggests or detects the
potential for cross-connections being made an integral part of the plumbing
system, the Building Inspector has the responsibility, under the State Building
Code, for requiring that such cross-connection be either eliminated or provided
with backflow prevention equipment approved by the State Building Code. The
Building Inspector's responsibility begins at the point of delivery, downstream
of the first installed backflow prevention assembly, and continues throughout
the entire length of the consumer's water system. The Building Inspector should
inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is suspected that
a cross-connection might be made or where one is actually called for by the
plans. When such is discovered it shall be mandatory that a suitable, approved
backflow prevention assembly approved by the State Building Code be required by
the plans and be properly installed.
      (3)   The primary protection assembly for containment purposes only shall
have approval from the town, Brunswick County, the State Building Code, and the
State Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
   (D)   Consumer/customer.  
      (1)   The consumer has the primary responsibility of preventing
pollutants and contaminants from entering his potable water system or the
public potable water system. The consumer's responsibility starts at the point
of delivery from the public potable water system and includes all of his or her
water system.
      (2)   The consumer, at his or her own expense, shall install, operate,
test, and maintain approved backflow prevention assemblies as directed by the
Department. The consumer shall maintain accurate records of tests and repairs
made to backflow prevention assemblies and shall maintain records for a minimum
period of three years. The records shall be on forms approved by the Department
and shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used.
      (3)   Following any repair, overhaul, repiping or relocation of an
assembly, the consumer shall have it tested to insure that it is in good
operating condition and will prevent backflow. Tests, maintenance, and repairs
of backflow prevention assemblies shall be made by a certified backflow
prevention assembly tester.
   (E)   Certified backflow prevention assembly testers. When employed by the
consumer to test, repair, overhaul, or maintain backflow prevention assemblies,
a backflow prevention assembly tester will have the following responsibilities:
      (1)   The tester will be responsible for making competent inspections and
for repairing or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies and making reports
of such repair to the consumer and responsible authorities on forms approved by
the Department.
      (2)   The tester shall include the list of materials or replacement parts
used.
      (3)   The tester shall be equipped with and be competent to use all the
necessary tools, gauges, manometers and other equipment necessary to properly
test, repair, and maintain backflow prevention assemblies.
      (4)   It will be the tester's responsibility to insure that original
manufactured parts are used in the repair of or replacement of parts in a
backflow prevention assembly.
      (5)   It will be the tester's further responsibility not to change the
design, material or operational characteristics of an assembly during repair or
maintenance without prior approval of the Department.
      (6)   A certified tester shall perform the work and be responsible for
the competency and accuracy of all tests and reports.
      (7)   A certified tester shall provide a copy of all test and repair
reports to the consumer and to the Department's staff responsible for cross-
connection control within ten business days of any completed test or repair
work.
      (8)   A certified tester shall maintain such records for a minimum period
of three years. All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must obtain
and employ backflow prevention assembly test equipment that has been evaluated
and/or approved by the Department. All test equipment shall be registered with
Brunswick County Water Department. All test equipment shall be checked for
accuracy annually, at a minimum, calibrated, if necessary, and certified to the
Department as to the calibration, employing an accuracy/calibration method
acceptable to the Department.
      (9)   All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must become
recertified every two years through an approved backflow prevention
certification program.

§ 50.49 WATER SYSTEM.
   The water system shall be considered as made up of three parts: Brunswick
County's (water purveyor) system, the town's (water purveyor) system and the
consumer's system.
   (A)   Brunswick County's system. The county is permitted as a treatment and
supply system by the State of North Carolina since the county does treat water
from a natural source (for example, wells, spring, stream, river, pond, lake,
and the like). The county sells some portion of its water to the Town of
Caswell Beach. The county's system shall consist of treatment facilities,
pumping, storage, and distribution including all those facilities of the water
system under the complete control of the county, up to the point where the
town's system begins (service connection).
   (B)   Town's system. The town purchases all its potable water from Brunswick
County. The town tests the water as required by the State Department of
Environment and Natural Resources but does not treat the water it receivers
from the county system.
   (C)   Consumer's system. The consumer's system shall include those parts of
the facilities beyond the termination of the town's distribution system
(service connection) that are utilized in conveying potable water to points of
use.
(Res. passed 11-20-03)
Penalty, see § 50.99
§ 50.50 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   (A)   Authorized representatives from the Department and Brunswick County
Water Department shall have the right to enter, upon presentation of proper
credentials and identification, any building, structure, or premises during
normal business hours, or at any time during the event of an emergency, to
perform any duty imposed by this subchapter. Those duties may include sampling
and testing of water, or inspections and observations of all piping systems
connected to the public water supply. Where a user has security measures in
force that would require proper identification and clearance before entry into
their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with the security
guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, Department
personnel will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities. Refusal to allow entry for these
purposes may result in discontinuance of water service.
   (B)   On request, the consumer shall furnish to the Department any pertinent
information regarding the water supply system on such property where cross-
connections and backflow are deemed possible.
   (C)   The consumer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives from the county or town to determine
whether unprotected cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards,
including violations of this policy, exist. Refusal to allow entry for these
purposes shall result in enforcement action (disconnection of water services,
stipulated penalties, and the like). When a condition becomes know, the
consumer, his or her agent, occupant, or tenant shall be notified in writing to
disconnect the unprotected cross-connection(s) within a time period established
in this policy. The degree of protection required and the period of time
required for conformance shall be commensurate with the actual or potential
degree of hazard to the public potable water supply system.
      (1)   Cross-connection with private wells or other unapproved auxiliary
water supplies require immediate disconnection of unapproved sources.
      (2)   Cross-connection requiring correction through:
         (a)   Elimination;
         (b)   Air gap separation;
         (c)   Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly (RPZ) or
double check valve assembly (DCVA) for sized three-fourths inch through two
inch require 30 day maximum conformance period.
      (3)   Cross-connection requiring correction through reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly (RPZ) or double check valve assembly
(DCVA) for sizes greater than two inch require 120 day maximum conformance
period.
      (4)   Upon completion of the above requirement, the consumer shall be
required to submit, in writing, notification of compliance to the Department.
      (5)   If, in the judgment of the Department, an imminent health hazard
exists, water service to the building or premises where a cross-connection
exists may be terminated unless an air gap is immediately provided, or the
cross-connection is immediately eliminated.
      (6)   Based upon recommendation from the Department, the consumer is
responsible for installing sufficient internal isolation backflow prevention
assemblies and/or methods (for example, air gap, pressure vacuum breakers,
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly, double check valve
assembly).
      (7)   No person shall fill special use tanks or tankers containing
pesticides, fertilizers, other toxic chemicals or their residues from the
public water system except at a location equipped with an air gap or an
approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly properly
installed on the public water supply.

prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard.
This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from
the water purveyor's system that have been subject to deterioration in quality.
      (3)   In the case of premises having internal cross-connections that can
not be permanently corrected or protected against or intricate plumbing and
piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exits, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line
commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   (B)   All new construction plans and specifications, when required by the
State Building Code and the State Department of Environment and Natural
Resources, shall be made available to the town's Building Inspector for review

§ 72.01 POLICY STATEMENT.
   This chapter is adopted to address the interest of public safety under the
provisions of House Bill 2027, Session Law 2006-149 which provides the Town of
Caswell Beach authority to regulate the use of golf carts in the town that have
not been outfitted and registered as required by state law. Generally, golf
carts, hereinafter called “carts”, that have not been outfitted and registered
are not designed or manufactured to be used on other than golf courses, and the
Town of Caswell Beach in no way advocates or endorses their operation elsewhere
in town. The town, by regulating such operation is merely trying to address
obvious safety issues, and adoption of this chapter is not to be relied upon as
a determination that operation is safe or advisable if done in accordance with
this chapter. All persons who operate or ride upon carts do so at their own
risk and peril, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of
themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists,
and pedestrians. The Town of Caswell Beach has no liability under any theory of
liability, for permitting carts to be operated in town. The owner and operator
of a cart are responsible for any liability involved in using a cart. Without
the adoption of standards for operation on private streets, there are currently
no rules or regulations that address golf cart operation and by creating

benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, such appeal shall be
made to the Board of Commissioners, in writing, heard at the next regularly
scheduled Commissioners' meeting, and further proceedings to remove the vehicle
shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and decided.

address, unless the notice is waived in writing by the vehicle owner or his
agent.

the registered owner within 24 hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the
state, notice shall be given to the registered owner within 72 hours from the

and such vehicle has no valid registration plates, the authorizing city
official shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the vehicle
identification number, to determine the last registered owner of the vehicle

hearing for the purpose of determining if probable cause existed for removing
the vehicle. A request for hearing must be filed with the County Magistrate
designated by the Chief District Court Judge to receive such hearing requests.
The Magistrate will set the hearing within 72 hours of the receipt of the
request, and the hearing will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of
G.S. § 20-219.11, as amended.
('75 Code, § 3-18-9)
§ 90.22 REDEMPTION OF VEHICLE DURING PROCEEDINGS.
   At any stage in the proceedings before the probable cause hearing, the owner
may obtain possession of the removed vehicle by paying the towing fee,
including any storage charges, or by posting a bond for double the amount of
such fees and charges to the tow truck operator or towing business having
custody of the removed vehicle. Upon regaining possession of a vehicle, the
owner or person entitled to the possession of the vehicle shall not allow or
engage in further violations of this chapter.
('75 Code, § 3-18-10)
§ 90.23 SALE AND DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED VEHICLES.

44A, Article 1.
('75 Code, § 3-18-11)
§ 90.24 REMOVAL OF VEHICLES FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   As a general policy, the town will not remove a vehicle from private
property if the owner, occupant, or lessee of such property could have the

or lessee, except in those cases where a vehicle is a nuisance or is a junked
motor vehicle which has been order removed by the appropriate Town Official.
The town may require any person requesting the removal of an abandoned,

against any loss, expense or liability incurred because of the removal,
storage, or sale thereof.

violations or if the owner of the animal fails to abate the condition which
constitutes the nuisance, the animal control/law enforcement officer may issue
a notice of violation and civil penalty for the first offense and additional

appropriate by the animal control supervisor. Any person guilty of violations
of this section shall be subject to criminal or civil proceedings, or by any

§ 95.15 CERTAIN CONDITIONS PROHIBITED.
   The existence of any of the following conditions on any vacant lot or other
parcel of land within the corporate limits is hereby declared to be dangerous
and prejudicial to the public health or safety and to constitute a public
nuisance:
   (A)   The uncontrolled growth of noxious weeds or grass to a height in

§ 95.16 AUTHORITY OF TOWN TO INVESTIGATE.
   The Town Clerk, upon notice from any person of the existence of any of the
conditions described in
§ 95.15, shall cause to be made by the appropriate County Health Department
official, or town official, such investigation as may be necessary to determine
whether, in fact, such conditions exist as to constitute a public nuisance as
declared in
§ 95.15.
('75 Code, § 3-10-2)
§ 95.17 NOTICE TO ABATE NUISANCE.
   (A)   Upon a determination that such conditions constituting a public
nuisance exist, the Town Clerk shall notify, in writing, the owner, occupant or
person in possession of the premises in question of the conditions constituting
such public nuisance and shall order the prompt abatement thereof within 15
days from the receipt of such written notice.

from municipal limits. Upon identification of any Beach Vitex plant, the
property owner shall be ordered to eradicate the plant from his or her property
pursuant to an acceptable means of removal and disposal. As eradication
precedes restoration, the plant must be removed from properties before the
property is restored with native plants or other appropriate plants. As Beach
Vitex has the ability to generate new plants from seeds, stem sections and root
sections, the proper disposal of plants and plant parts is important. The town
shall be responsible for the collection of Vitex separately from other yard
waste and will treat it appropriately. Beach Vitex clippings shall not be
chipped and shredded into mulch and distributed to any yard waste disposal
site. The town shall cooperate with private landowners in this task to proceed
with the eradication.

condition to be removed or otherwise remedied by having employees of the town
to go upon the premises and remove or otherwise abate such nuisance under the

such charges to the owner or other person in possession of such premises with
instructions that such charges are due and payable within 30 days from the

   (A)   Inspections.
      (1)   The Inspection Department shall inspect all buildings and
structures and work therein for which a permit of any kind has been issued as
often as necessary in order to determine whether the work complies with the
latest edition of the North Carolina State Building Code Administration &
Enforcement Requirements Code and this chapter and the appropriate codes.
      (2)   When deemed necessary by the appropriate inspector, materials and
assemblies may be inspected at the point of manufacture or fabrication, or
inspections may be made by approved and recognized inspection organizations,
provided that no approval shall be based upon reports of such organizations
unless the same are in writing and certified by a responsible officer of such
organization.
      (3)   All holders of permits, of their agents, shall notify the
Inspection Department and the appropriate inspector at each of the following
stages of construction outlined in the North Carolina Administration &
Enforcement Requirements Code so that approval may be given before work is
continued. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to provide access to and
means for inspection of the work for any inspections that are required by the
code.
         (a)   Foundation inspection. To be made after trenches are excavated
and the necessary reinforcement and forms are in place, and before concrete is
placed. Drilled footings, piles, and similar types of foundations shall be
inspected as installed.
         (b)   Framing inspection. To be made after all structural framing is
in place and all roughing-in of plumbing and electrical and heating has been
installed, after all fire blocking, chimneys, bracing and vents are installed,
but before any of the structure is enclosed, elements shall be inspected before
each pour of any structural member.
         (c)   Insulation inspection. To be made after all areas required to be
insulated are to verify that all “R” values required by code are complied with
and all vapor barriers are intact.
         (d)   Final inspection. To be made after building or structure has all
doors hung, fixtures set and ready for occupancy, but before the building is
occupied.
   (B)   Calls for inspection.
      (1)   Requests for inspections may be made to the office of the
Inspection Department or to the appropriate inspector. The Inspection
Department shall make inspections as soon as practicable after request is made
therefor, provided that such work is ready for inspection at the time the
request is made.
      (2)   Reinspections may be made at the convenience of the Inspector. No
work shall be inspected until it is in proper and completed condition ready for
inspection. All work which has been concealed before the inspection and
approval shall be uncovered at the request of the Inspector and placed in
condition for proper inspection. Approval or rejection of the work shall be
furnished by the appropriate inspector in the form of a notice posted on the
building or given to the permit holder or his agent. Failure to call for
inspections or proceeding without approval at each stage of construction shall
be deemed a violation of this chapter.
   (C)   Street or alley lines. Where the applicant for a permit proposes to
erect any building or structure on the line of any street, alley, or other
public place, he or she shall secure a survey of the line of such street,
alley, or other public place adjacent to the property upon which such building
or structure is to be erected before proceeding with construction of such
building or structure. It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to see
that the building does not encroach upon such street, alley, or other public
place.
   (D)   Certificate of occupancy. No new building or part thereof shall be
occupied, and no addition or enlargement of any existing building shall be
occupied, and no existing building after being altered or moved shall be
occupied until the Inspection Department has issued a certificate of occupancy
therefor. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a portion or
portions of a building which may safely be occupied prior to final completion
and occupancy of the entire building. Application for a certificate of
occupancy may be made by the owner or the owner's agent after all final
inspections have been made for new buildings, or, in the case of existing
buildings, after supplying the information and data necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter, the appropriate regulatory codes and any zoning
ordinance of the occupancy intended. The Inspection Department shall issue a
certificate of occupancy when, after examination and inspection, it is found
that the building in all respects conforms to the provisions of this chapter,
the regulatory codes, any zoning ordinance for the occupancy intended, and the
property has been properly cleared of debris as provided in §
150.039(B).

      Persons carrying on the business of building, plumbing, mechanical, or
electrical contractor within the town shall register at the office of the
Inspection Department and each must post a clean-up bond for construction or
remodeling activities that are equal to or exceed the project amount as shown
in the fee schedule maintained in the offices of the Building Inspector and the
Town Clerk. The clean-up bond for designated activities shall also be
maintained in the offices of the Building Inspector and the Town Clerk. During
the period of construction, the contractor will construct a temporary holding
area per the specifications of the town’s Building Inspector to contain
residual materials and other solid waste incidental to work at the site.
Failure to do so or subsequent failure to maintain trash in the containment
area will result in issuing a stop work order, which provides seven working
days for the offender to correct the problem, after which work will be halted
with loss of clean-up bond. Once the situation is corrected, inspected, and new
clean-up bond is posted, resumption of construction will be permitted by formal
letter from the Building Inspector. If final inspection has not been requested
by the time the Inspection Department declares the work discontinued pursuant §
150.036, the Building Inspector will contact the permitted to resolve clean-up
activity, posted bond and document in dormant file. The clean-up of property
must be affected before final inspection by the Building Inspector. If clean-up
is satisfactory, the bond will be returned. If the clean-up is not
satisfactory, the bond will be forfeited, and the town will complete the clean-
up job of the area.

§ 150.072 LANDSCAPE CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   Landscaping or landscape construction includes, but is not limited to,
clearing and site preparation for construction of residence; landscaping area
upon completion of construction; installation of driveways, parking areas,
patios, and sport courts; and any post-construction landscape alterations to
established home site. Prior to initiating the permitted activity, the request
for the appropriate permit must be accompanied by a landscape plan, which has
been approved by the town’s Building Inspector. The permit application and an
example of the construction/landscape plan plot are available from the Town of
Caswell Beach Inspection Department. Such construction shall not be permitted
if it violates the following rules.
   (A)   The proposed modification to the land and resulting residential
construction shall provide positive means of controlling storm water drainage
onto adjacent property or other off-site.
   (B)   Any impervious surfaces to be employed shall have positive means such
as curbs, gutters, and absorption areas to assure that run-off brought about by
increased water velocity shall not cause storm water and/or sediment to collect
in off-site locations.
   (C)   For impermeable driveway construction, one of the following methods
will be used to satisfy the requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   A residential property shall access the roadway by no more than one
24-foot maximum width driveway or two 12-foot maximum width driveways. Total
combined width of all driveways shall not exceed 24 feet. An apron connecting
the driveway to the road may taper from driveway width out to an additional
maximum six-foot width where the apron meets the road. Addition of an apron
shall not cause the width of a driveway to exceed 24 feet. Aprons must taper
directly to driveway width within no more than ten feet from the road.
Beginning at the road, the driveway maximum width(s) may not be exceeded until
it passes the front property line.
      (2)   (a)   All new driveway construction must be permitted and shall
comply with these requirements.
         (b)   Driveway additions and driveway replacements, including
sectional replacements, require submission of plans to the town for review and
approval. The town, at its discretion, may require permitting. In most cases,
increases in impervious surface, increases in grade, increases in elevation, or
significant alteration in location or configuration will require permitting and
an engineered determination that the town’s stormwater regulations are met.
      (3)   Driveway permit applications, when required, shall include an
engineering certification that the plans meet the requirements of the town’s
stormwater regulations (see Chapter 154).
   (D)   The following activities will not be considered landscaping activity
under this section:
      (1)   The use of any land for the purposes of planting, growing, or
harvesting plants, crops, trees, grass or other agricultural or forestry
products; and
      (2)   Work by any utility company and other persons engaged in the
distribution and transmission of petroleum products, water, telephone, or
telegraph messages, or electricity for the purposes of inspecting, repairing,
maintaining, or upgrading, any existing substations sewers, mains, pipes,
cables, utility tunnels, lines, towers, poles, a and the line on any of its
existing utility property or rights-of-way, or the extension of any of the
above distribution related facilities to serve development.
   (E)   Tree removal.
      (1)   The general purpose of this division is to reduce the effect of
development on the problem of storm water run-off and water quality by
regulating and controlling the removal of trees in conjunction with land
development and/or building construction.
      (2)   The specific purposes of this division are:
         (a)   To safeguard and enhance property value and to protect the
public and private investment through the protection of native trees;
         (b)   To prevent the indiscriminate removal of native trees;
         (c)   To mitigate storm-water runoff and water quality problems caused
by removal of native trees;
         (d)   To protect marshlands and estuaries; and
         (e)   To preserve and enhance the visual appearance of the town.
      (3)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         DIAMETER AT BREAST HEIGHT (DBH). A standard method of expressing the
diameter of the trunk of a standing tree. In The U.S., breast height diameter
is measured at a height of 1.4 meters (approximately 4.5 feet). The most
effective methods for measuring DBH is use of a girthing (or diameter) tape. A
girthing tape actually measures the girth (circumference) of the tree; the
girthing tape is calibrated in divisions of centimeter (3.14159 cm), thus
giving a directly converted reading of the diameter. This assumes the trunk has
a circular cross-section, which is typically accurate for most trees.
         NEIGHBORHOOD. A subdivision of the Town of Caswell Beach. For this
section, it includes the Arboretum, Caswell Dunes, Ocean Greens, and the Oak
Island Villas.
         PERSON. For the purpose of this section, any individual, property
owner, contractor, corporation, or other entity that might be involved in
removal of trees.
         PLOT CONSTRUCTION/LANDSCAPE PLAN. A formal plan submitted to the
town’s Building Inspector in conjunction with subdivision of land, alteration
of an existing building (residence), or landscape construction prior to start
of site development. The plot construction/landscape plan must show a footprint
and location of intended building and the location of vegetation to be removed.
The plan must also show existing regulated trees (see division (D)(4) of this
section) and trees and shrubs and vegetation to be retained or added.
         PROPERTY OWNER. For purpose of this section, individuals,
corporations, tenants, proprietors or other entities who possess entitlement to
the property.
         TOWN. The Town of Caswell Beach, North Carolina.
         TREE. Any woody perennial deciduous or evergreen plant which usually
has one or more main stems.
      (4)   Tree removal authorization. All requests for cutting shall require
a landscape plan showing the location of regulated trees in relation to site
construction activities, driveways, patios or other paved areas. The plan
should accurately represent the proposed activities, drawn to scale and
certified by both the property owner and the builder. Approval of the landscape
plan will be for the following reasons.
         (a)   The tree to be removed is less than the required minimum:
            1.   Hardwood species at DBH < 6";
            2.   Softwoods/evergreens at DBH < 8"; and
            3.   Flowering species at DBH <2".
         (b)   Whether related to new construction or existing properties
planning to remove vegetation, trees greater than these minimums should not be
removed unless an exception is granted in writing by the town for:
            1.   A tree that is within 12 feet of the building perimeter;
            2.   A tree that is within 3 feet of a driveway or paved walkway;
            3.   A tree severely damaged by lightning;
            4.   A strong lean on the trunk, 45 degrees or less when measured
from the ground; or
            5.   Trees with a suspected disease affecting the structural
soundness of the tree. The condition must be diagnosed by the County Extension
Agent or County Forest Ranger. The property owner must include written
documentation with the landscape plan.
         (c)   No vegetation of any sort may be removed from areas zoned
Conservation without written permission from the town pursuant to Chapter 98.
      (5)   Prerequisite for authorization of building permit.
         (a)   The town’s Building Inspector may withhold or withdraw any
permits, certificates, and other granted authorization, including building
permits, driveway permits, and certificates of occupancy, until an application
for building/landscape construction permit is satisfactorily completed and
approved.
         (b)   In addition, all persons seeking approval for tree removal shall
make application to the town’s Building Inspector. Application shall be in
writing in accordance with procedures approved by the Town Commissioners.
      (6)   Nothing herein shall relieve the property owner or the owner’s
authorized agent from the responsibility to observe applicable local
subdivision or private unit development bylaws and restrictive covenants.
      (7)   Penalty. The maximum fine for violation of this chapter exceeds $50
and is $100 for each individual violation of this chapter. Violation of this
chapter may result in the town applying to the appropriate division of the
General Court of Justice for payment of the fine. Violation of this chapter is
a misdemeanor offense.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The Legislature of the state has in G.S. Ch. 143, Part 6, Art. 21 and
Ch. 160D delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Therefore, the Town Commission of the Town of Caswell Beach North
Carolina, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. passed 8-28-18; Am. Ord. passed - -)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Caswell Beach are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 8-28-18)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;

(Ord. passed 8-28-18)
§ 151.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where BFE data has been provided, as set
forth in §§
151.16, or
151.43, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
151.40, are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.10.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.10. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with §
151.48(B). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the floodproofing standards of this section are satisfied. Such certification
shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in §
151.31(C), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.10.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is
above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) of this section.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor or below the
lowest horizontal structural member in VE zones:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 flood openings to

either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      (4)   Shall, in coastal high hazard areas (Zone VE), either be free of
obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls, open wood latticework or
insect screening, provided they are not part of the structural support of the
building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or
wave action without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or
supporting foundation system or otherwise jeopardizing the structural integrity
of the building. The following design specifications shall be met:
         (a)   Material shall consist of open wood or plastic lattice (having
an opening ratio of at least 40% or insect screening; or
         (b)   Breakaway walls shall meet the following design specifications:
            1.   Design safe loading resistance shall be not less than ten nor
more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
            2.   Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance
of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by state or
local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of
the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and
nonstructural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with
the base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the
North Carolina State Building Code.
   (E)   Fill/grading.
      (1)   Minor grading and the placement of minor quantities of
nonstructural fill may be permitted for landscaping and for drainage purposes
under and around buildings and for support of parking slabs, pool decks, patios
and walkways.
      (2)   The fill material must be similar and consistent with the natural
soils in the area.
      (3)   The placement of site-compatible, non-structural fill under or
around an elevated building is limited to two feet. Fill greater than two feet
must include an analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional
demonstrating no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave
reflection that would increase damage to adjacent elevated buildings and
structures.
      (4)   Nonstructural fill with finished slopes that are steeper than five
units horizontal to one unit vertical shall be permitted only if an analysis
prepared by a qualified registered design professional demonstrates no harmful
diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave reflection that would increase
damage to adjacent elevated buildings and structures.
   (F)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure; or
         (b)   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally
modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the
addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
      (2)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure; or
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with
the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the one
year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this chapter.
Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement
does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the Building
Official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;
or
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (G)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Temporary placement.
         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no
permanently attached additions.)
      (2)   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
   (H)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (I)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached

conformance with the provisions of §
151.41(D)(4).
      (8)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 400 square feet
or that is a minimal investment of $3,000 or less and satisfies the criteria
outlined above is not required to meet the elevation or floodproofing standards
of §
151.41(B). Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other
accessory structures in accordance with §
151.31(C).

§ 151.48 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO).
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.16, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to §§
151.40 and
151.41, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
   (A)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
   (B)   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed
to the same level as required in §
151.40(A) so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required in accordance with §§
151.16(C) and
151.41(B).
   (C)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes,

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 FOREWARD; BACKGROUND INFORMATION.
   (A)   Most urban expansion takes place in the form of land subdivision
created by private developers for residential, business and industrial users.
Subdivision of land will be explained in the text of this chapter. Generally,
the great bulk of subdivision activity is for residential use and takes place
in the growing corridors of existing communities.
   (B)   Land subdivision regulation is one of the most important tools for
carrying out plans for the development of the town area. Land development plans
calling for the location of future streets, parks and schools can be
incorporated into plans for new subdivisions. It is customary to require the
dedication, without cost to the community, of public street right-of-way and
open space land. The reservation of sites for public buildings or for later
public acquisition is also a frequent practice.
   (C)   The use of subdivision regulations also protects the community in
other ways. Streets that are properly designed and adequately paved will
require a minimum amount of maintenance. Requirements for installing essential
utilities, paving streets and providing other improvements will discourage the
premature and excessive subdivision of land, which would inevitably result in
scattered development and increase the cost of governmental operation. Properly
subdivided land stabilizes property values and thus strengthens the local tax
base.
   (D)   The subdivision chapter will bring the developer, the local decision-
maker and the homeowners to a common ground of understanding in an urban
environment. Special note: The developer should consult any locally adopted
area thoroughfare plan, and hazard mitigation plan. Reference to these plans by
the developer will assist in proper street design and subdivision location.

§ 152.03 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures and standards
for the development and subdivision of land within the territorial jurisdiction
of the town. It is further designed to provide for:
      (1)   The orderly growth and development of the town;
      (2)   The coordination of transportation networks and utilities within
proposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and highways and with
other public facilities;
      (3)   The dedication or reservation of recreation areas serving residents
of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision or, alternatively, for
provision of funds to be used to acquire recreation areas serving residents of
the development or subdivision or more than one subdivision or development
within the immediate area, and rights-of-way or easements for street and
utility purposes including the dedication of rights-of-way pursuant to G.S. §§
136-66.10 or 136-66.11;
      (4)   The distribution of population and traffic in such a manner that
will mitigate hazards, avoid congestion and overcrowding, and will create
conditions that promote public health, safety and the general welfare.
   (B)   This chapter is designed to further facilitate adequate provision of
water, sewerage, parks, schools and playgrounds, and also to facilitate the
further resubdivision of larger tracts into smaller parcels of land.

§ 152.32 ELEMENTS OF THE PRELIMINARY PLAN PROCESS.
   (A)   Pre-application discussion. A pre-application discussion is strongly
encouraged between the applicant, the site designer(s), and the Subdivision
Administrator. The purpose of this informal meeting is to introduce the
applicant and the site designer(s) to Caswell Beach's zoning and subdivision
regulations and procedures and to discuss the applicant's objectives in
relation to the town's official policies and ordinance requirements.
   (B)   Existing Features Plan (site analysis). Plans analyzing each site's
special features are required for all proposed subdivisions, as they form the
basis of the design process for house locations, lot lines, street alignments,
and conservation areas. The subdivider or his/her representative shall bring a
copy of the Existing Features Plan to the on-site walkabout. Detailed
requirements for the Existing Features Plan shall include, at the minimum:
      (1)   Contour lines based at least upon topographical maps published by
the U.S. Geological Survey;
      (2)   The location of severely constraining elements such as steep slopes
(over 25%), wetlands, watercourses, intermittent streams and 100-year
floodplains, and all rights-of-way and easements;
      (3)   The location of significant features such as woodlands, treelines,
open fields or meadows, scenic views into or out from the property, watershed
divides and drainage ways, protected wetlands, fences or stone walls, rock
outcrops, and existing structures, roads, tracks and trails.
   (C)   On-site walkabout.  After the Existing Features Plan has been
prepared, the Subdivision Administrator shall schedule a mutually convenient
date to walk the property with the applicant and his/her site designer. The
purpose of this visit is to familiarize the Subdivision Administrator with the
property's special features, and to provide him an informal opportunity to
offer guidance to the applicant regarding the potential house locations, street
alignments, and the tentative location of conservation areas.
   (D)   Pre-submission conference. Prior to the submission of the sketch plan
or preliminary plat, the applicant shall meet with the Subdivision
Administrator to discuss how the severely constraining elements and the
significant features, which were identified in the Existing Features Plan,
could be applied to the design and layout of the proposed subdivision. At the
discretion of the Subdivision Administrator this conference may be combined
with the on-site walkabout.
   (E)   Sketch plan.  
      (1)   After the pre-submission conference, a sketch plan shall be
submitted for all proposed subdivisions. A sketch plan is drawn to illustrate
the initial thoughts about a conceptual layout for house sites, street
alignments, and conservation areas, taking into account the special conditions
identified in the Existing Features Plan. This is the stage where drawings are
tentatively illustrated, before heavy engineering costs are incurred in the
design of any proposed subdivision layout. Prior to the preliminary plat
submission, the applicant shall submit to the Subdivision Administrator 12
copies of the sketch plan of the proposed subdivision containing the following
information:
         (a)   A sketch vicinity map showing the location of the subdivision in
relation to neighboring tracts, subdivisions, roads, and waterways;
         (b)   The boundaries of the tract and the portion of the tract to be
subdivided;
         (c)   The total acreage to be subdivided;
         (d)   The location of all potential conservation areas, using the
Existing Features Plan. These areas consist of wetlands, floodplains, slopes
over 25%, soils susceptible to slumping, and noteworthy natural, scenic, and
cultural resources;
         (e)   The existing and proposed uses of the land within the
subdivision and the existing uses of land adjoining it;
         (f)   The proposed street layout with approximate pavement and right-
of-way widths;
         (g)   Proposed lot layout and size of lots;
         (h)   The name, address, and telephone number of the owner;
         (i)   The name, if any, of the proposed subdivision;
         (j)   Streets and lots of adjacent developed or platted properties;
         (k)   The zoning classification of the tract and of adjacent
properties;
         (l)   A statement from the Brunswick County Health Department that a
copy of the sketch plan has been submitted to them, if a septic tank system or
other onsite water or wastewater system is to be used in the subdivision.
      (2)   The Subdivision Administrator shall review the sketch plan for
general compliance with the requirements and goals of this chapter and the
zoning ordinance. The Subdivision Administrator shall advise the applicant, or
his authorized agent, of the regulations pertaining to the proposed subdivision
and the procedures to be followed in the preparation and submission of the
preliminary and final plats. One copy of the sketch plan shall be retained by
the Subdivision Administrator and one copy shall be returned to the applicant
or his authorized agent.

recommendation within this time period shall be deemed as approval by the
Planning Board.
      (5)   During its review of the preliminary plat the Planning Board may
appoint an engineer or surveyor to confirm the accuracy of the plat (if agreed
to by the Board of Commissioners). If substantial errors are found, the cost
shall be charged to the subdivider and the plat shall not be recommended for
approval until such errors have been corrected.
      (6)   If the Planning Board disapproves the plat, the reasons therefor
shall be stated, in writing, and submitted, along with the original and four
prints of the plat, to the subdivider who may make the recommended changes and
submit a revised plat for Planning Board approval without paying an additional
filing fee. If the Planning Board approves the preliminary plat conditionally,
the conditions and reasons thereof shall be stated, in writing, and, if
necessary, the Planning Board may require the subdivider to submit a revised
plat. Resubmission of a revised plat does not require and additional filing
fee. Resubmission must be made within 60 days and submitted at least one week
prior to the Board meeting.
      (7)   If the Planning Board approves the preliminary plat, such approval
shall be noted on the three copies of the plat. One print and one original
reproducible drawing of the plat shall be returned to the subdivider, or his/
her agent, and one copy of the print shall be retained by the Subdivision
Administrator.

§ 152.34 FINAL PLAT FOR MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Preparation of final plat and installation of improvements. Upon
approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Board, the subdivider may
proceed with the preparation of the final plat, and the installation of, or
arrangement for, required improvements in accordance with the approved
preliminary plat and the requirements of this chapter. Prior to approval of a
final plat, the subdivider shall have installed the improvements specified in
this chapter or guaranteed their installation as provided herein. No final plat
will be accepted or reviewed by the Planning Board unless accompanied by
written notice by the Subdivision Administrator acknowledging compliance with
the improvement and guarantee standards of this chapter. The final plat shall
constitute only the portion of the preliminary plat, which the subdivider
proposes to record and develop at that time. Such portion shall conform to all
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Improvements guarantees.
      (1)   Agreement and security required. In lieu of requiring the
completion, installation, and dedication of all improvements prior to final
plat approval, the Caswell Beach Board of Commissioners may enter into an
agreement with the subdivider whereby the subdivider shall agree to complete
all required improvements. Once said agreements are signed by both parties and
the security required herein is provided, the final plat may be approved, if
all other requirements of this chapter are met. To secure this agreement, the
subdivider shall provide either one or a combination of the following
guarantees not exceeding 1.25 times the entire cost. Portions of the security
deposit may be released as work progresses. The following range of surety
options are available and may be used by subdividers, subject to approval by
town.
      (2)   Surety performance bond(s). The subdivider shall obtain a
performance bond(s) from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in
North Carolina. The bond(s) shall be payable to the Town of Caswell Beach and
shall be in an amount equal to 1.25 times the entire cost of installing all
required improvements, as estimated by the town. The duration of the bond(s)
shall be until such time as the improvements are accepted by the town.
      (3)   Cash or equivalent security. The subdivider shall deposit cash, a
certified check payable to the town, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other
instrument readily convertible into cash at face value, either with the town or
in escrow with a financial institution designated as an official depository of
the town. The use of any instrument other than cash shall be subject to the
approval of the Board of Commissioners. The amount of deposit shall be equal to
1.25 times the cost of installing all required improvements, as estimated by
the town. If cash or other instrument is deposited in escrow with a financial
institution as provided above, then the subdivider shall file with the town a
copy of an agreement between the financial institution and himself guaranteeing
the following:
         (a)   That said escrow account shall be held in trust until released
by the town and may not be used or pledged by the subdivider in any other
matter for the term of the escrow; and
         (b)   That in the case of a failure on the part of the subdivider to
complete said improvements the financial institution shall, upon notification
by the Board of Commissioners, and submission by the Council to the financial
institution of an engineer's estimate of the amount needed to complete the
improvements, immediately either pay to the town the funds estimated to
complete the improvements, up to the full balance of the escrow account, or
deliver to the town any other instruments fully endorsed or otherwise made
payable in full to the town.
      (4)   Duration. The duration of the performance guarantee shall initially
be one year, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the
required improvements necessitates a longer duration in which case the Board of
Commissioners shall approve an expiration date beyond one year. In the case of
a bonded obligation, the completion date shall be set one year from the date
the bond is issued, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for
the required improvements necessitates a longer duration in which case the
Board of Commissioners shall approve an expiration date beyond one year.
      (5)   Extension. A developer shall demonstrate reasonable, good-faith
progress toward completion of the required improvements that are secured by the
performance guarantee or any extension. If the improvements are not completed
to the specifications of the town, and the current performance guarantee is
likely to expire prior to completion of the required improvements, the
performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance guarantee issued,
for an additional period. An extension under this subdivision shall only be for
a duration necessary to complete the required improvements. If a new
performance guarantee is issued, the amount shall include the total cost of all
incomplete improvements.
      (5)   Default. Upon default, meaning failure on the part of the
subdivider to complete the required improvements in a timely manner as spelled
out in the performance bond or escrow agreement, then the surety, or the
financial institution holding the escrow account shall, if requested by the
Board of Commissioners, pay all or any portion of the bond or escrow fund to
the Town of Caswell Beach up to the amount needed to complete the improvements
based on an engineering estimate. Upon payment the town, at its discretion, may
expend such portion of said funds as it deems necessary to complete all or any
portion of the required improvements.
      (6)   Release of guarantee security. The Board of Commissioners may
authorize the release of a portion of any corresponding percentage of a
security posted as the improvements are completed and approved by the
Subdivision Administrator.
   (C)   Submission procedure.
      (1)   The subdivider shall submit the final plat, so marked, to the
Subdivision Administrator who will forward it to the Planning Board for review.
The final plat shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor currently
licensed and registered in the State of North Carolina by the North Carolina
State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. The
final plat shall conform to the provisions for plats, subdivisions, and mapping
requirements set forth in G.S. § 47-30 and the Manual of Practice for Land
Surveying in North Carolina.
      (2)   Fourteen copies of the final plat shall be submitted. Twelve of
these shall be paper copies and one shall be an original linen meeting the
standards of this chapter. Material and drawing medium for the original shall
be in accordance with the Manual of Practice for Land Surveying in North
Carolina, where applicable, and the requirements of the Brunswick County
Register of Deeds.
      (3)   The final plat shall meet the specifications in this section and
must be of a size suitable for recording with the Brunswick County Register of
Deeds. It must be at the same scale and meet the same sheet size requirements
as the preliminary plat. Plats may be placed on more than one sheet with
appropriate match lines.
      (4)   The following signed certificates shall appear on all 14 copies of
the final plat:
         (a)   Certificate of Ownership and Dedication.
I hereby certify that I am the owner of the property shown and described
hereon, which is located in the subdivision jurisdiction of the Town of Caswell

      (1)   The Subdivision Review Committee or the Planning Board shall review
the final plat at or before its next regularly scheduled meeting and shall
approve or disapprove the plat with reasons within 45 days of its first
consideration of the plat. During its review of the final plat the Review
Committee or the Planning Board may appoint an engineer or surveyor to confirm
the accuracy of the plat (if agreed to by the Board of Commissioners). If
substantial errors are found, the costs shall be charged to the subdivider and
the plat shall not be recommended for approval until such errors have been
corrected.
      (2)   If the final plat is not approved, the reasons for such disapproval
shall be stated in writing, specifying the provisions of this chapter with
which the final plat does not comply. A copy of this statement, along with the
original and three prints of the plat, will be submitted to the subdivider who
may make the recommended changes and submit a revise plat for approval or may
directly appeal to the Board of Commissioners. Resubmission of a revised plat
does not require an additional filing fee. Resubmission must be made within 60
days and submitted at least one week prior to the board or committee meeting.
      (3)   If the final plat is approved conditionally, the conditions and
reasons thereof shall be stated, in writing, and, if necessary, the Planning
Board may require the subdivider to submit a revised plat. The process for
approving conditions shall be the same as specified for approval of conditions
in the town's zoning ordinance.
      (4)   Whenever a street or right-of-way dedication is involved the Board
of Commissioners must approve the final plat. If approved by the Review
Committee or Planning Board such a plat shall be considered by the Board of
Commissioners at its regularly scheduled meeting.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT
§ 152.39 PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (A)   It is the intent to establish a new planned development (PD) section
for specialized purposes where tracts suitable in location, area, and character
for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed on a
unified basis. Suitability of tracts for the development proposed shall be
determined primarily by reference to the town land use plan but due
consideration shall be given to the existing and prospective character of
surrounding development. All such requests require the statutory procedures for
a zoning map amendment as contained in
Chapter 153, which may be processed concurrently with the preliminary and final
site development plan. No such zoning map amendment shall be approved prior to
the approval of a preliminary site development plan.
   (B)   The intent of this subchapter is to permit flexibility from
conventional development controls of use, setback, height and minimum lot size
requirements of other zoning districts while at the same time provide criteria
for planned development based on performance.
   (C)   These regulations are designed to accomplish the purposes of zoning
and subdivision regulation to an equivalent or higher degree than where such
regulations are designed to control unscheduled development on individual lots
and to promote economical and efficient land use; an improved level of
amenities, such as open space; appropriate and harmonious variety; creative
design; and a better environment.
   (D)   All copies and distribution shall comply with the provisions contained
in §
152.34(C) just like a major subdivision.

cost than would develop in forms generally permitted under current zoning for
the area.
   (B)   The development shall be located with respect to necessary public
facilities as to have access to such facilities in the same degree as would
develop under existing zoning and shall be so located, designated, and scaled
that access for public services is equivalent to, and net cost for services is
not greater than access and net cost for public services for development as
permitted under existing zoning.
   (C)   Private facilities. The proposed development shall provide private
facilities, utilities, and/or services approved by appropriate public agencies

DESIGN STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS; DEDICATIONS AND RESERVATIONS
§ 152.49 GENERAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   Land subject to flooding as denoted in Caswell Beach's flood
plain maps and land deemed by the Planning Board to be uninhabitable for other
reasons including, but not limited to, slopes in excess of 25%, slumping soils,
wetlands, habitats for endangered species, and historic/archeological sites,
shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may
increase danger to health, life or property, or aggravated the flood hazard.
Such land within a plan shall be set aside for such uses as will not be
endangered by periodic or occasional inundation, or will not produce
unsatisfactory living conditions.
      (2)   Past records of flood levels shall be used to determine sufficient
area from the centerline of streams to provide adequate protection from the
most severe flood of record.
   (B)   Where land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building
lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future
streets and logical further subdivision.
   (C)   Where a proposed residential subdivision contains or is adjacent to a
major highway, it shall be planned so as to avoid having lots fronting on the
highway in such a manner as to derive their access from said highway,
preferably by providing a marginal access street for these lots or by backing
the lots to the highway.
   (D)   Where a proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad
right-of-way, it shall be planned so as to avoid having residential lots front
on a street, which parallels and is adjacent to the railroad right-of-way.
   (E)   Subdivision showing reserve strips controlling access to public ways
will not be approved except when the control and disposition of land comprising
such strips is placed within the town's jurisdiction under conditions meeting
the approval of the Subdivision Administrator.
   (F)   All subdivided land shall be part of a usable and numbered lot or it
shall be reserved as permanent open space. All major subdivisions shall be
required to reserve a minimum of 5% or more of the gross land area as permanent
open space, subject to the review of the Planning Board.
   (G)   If the entire area shown on an approved preliminary plat is not to be
recorded at the same time as one unit, but instead, sections or units of the
entire subdivision are to be recorded at subsequent time intervals, then the
unit boundaries shall be so designated as to permit each unit recorded to
function independently of the unit to follow it in the proposed recording
schedule of the subdivider. Temporary turnarounds shall be constructed by the
developer, as required by the town, at the ends of streets, which are presently
dead-end, but are planned as through streets when the adjacent unit ultimately
recorded.
   (H)   Areas that have been used for disposal of solid waste shall not be
subdivided unless tests by the Brunswick County Health Department, a structural
engineer, and soils expert determine that the land is suitable for the purpose
proposed.
   (I)   The names of the subdivision and street shall not duplicate nor
closely approximate the names of any existing subdivision or streets within
Caswell Beach or its extraterritorial jurisdiction. The Board of Commissioners
has final say regarding names.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10; Am. Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.50 UTILITIES.
   (A)   Utilities described in this section shall include, but not be limited
to water and sewer lines, electrical distribution systems, and telephone and
cablevision facilities. The utility companies shall be provided with copies of
the preliminary plat by the subdivider and shall be expected to work with the
subdivider in designing the utilities plan for the subdivision. Underground
installation of utility lines is required unless the Subdivision Administrator
determines that circumstances exist that make this requirement impractical. In
no case shall a developer be required to bury a power line existing above
ground and outside of property to be subdivided.
   (B)   Where public sewer is not available.  All lots in subdivisions not
connected to sanitary sewer systems shall have a suitable source of sanitary
sewage disposal which complies with the regulations of the appropriate
agencies.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10; Am. Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.51 STREETS; GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Street layout.
      (1)   In any new subdivision the street layout shall conform to the
arrangement, width and location indicated by an official plan or map for the
town. In areas for which such plans have not been completed, the streets shall
be designed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to
the topography, to such natural features as streams and tree growth, to public
convenience and safety, and to the proposed use of land to be served by such
streets.
      (2)   Residential collector and local streets and roads shall be laid out
in such a way that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Streets
shall be designed or walkways dedicated to assure convenient access to parks,
playgrounds, schools, or other places of public assembly.
      (3)   The proposed street layout shall be made according to good land
planning practice for the type development proposed and shall be coordinated
with the street system of the surrounding areas. The arrangements of streets in
new subdivision shall make provision for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining subdivisions or, when adjoining property is not
subdivided, their proper projection insofar as they may be necessary for
vehicular circulation in the future. The street and alley arrangement must be
so designated as to cause no hardship to owners of adjoining property when they
plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient access to it. When a new
subdivision adjoins subdivided land, the new streets shall be carried to the
boundaries of the tract proposed to be subdivided, except where it is
determined by the Planning Board that certain streets may not be required to be
so extended.
      (4)   Proposed streets should be adjusted to the contour of the land so
as to produce usable lots and streets shall be kept to a minimum.
   (B)   Intersections.
      (1)   Intersection of local streets with major streets shall be kept to a
minimum.
      (2)   An approved permit is required for connection to any existing state
system road. This permit is required prior to any construction on the street or
road. The application is available at the office of the nearest district
engineer of the NC Division of Highways.
      (3)   All connections of private streets to public streets must be
approved by the NCDOT or Board of Commissioners prior to preliminary plat
approval.
   (C)   Cul-de-sacs.
      (1)   As a feature of subdivision design, cul-de-sacs should be
discouraged and kept to a minimum. Cul-de-sacs should not be used to avoid
connection with an existing street or to avoid the extension of an important
street, unless an exception is granted by the Planning Board.
      (2)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not exceed 400 feet in length
unless necessitated by topography or property accessibility and in no case
shall be permitted to be over 900 feet. Measurement shall be from the point
where the centerline of the dead-end street intersects with the centerline of a
through street to the center of the turnaround of the cul-de-sacs.
   (D)   Half-streets.
      (1)   The dedication of half-streets of less than 50 feet at the
perimeter of a new subdivision shall be prohibited. If circumstances render
this impracticable, adequate provision for the concurrent dedication of the
remaining half of the street must be furnished by the subdivider. Where there
exists a half-street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be
provided by the proposed development.
      (2)   However, in circumstances where more than 50 feet of right-of-way
is required, a partial width right-of-way, not less than 50 feet in width, may
be dedicated when adjoining undeveloped property is owned or controlled by the
subdivides provided that the width of the partial dedication is such as to
permit the installation of such facilities as may be necessary to serve
abutting lots. When the adjoining property is subdivided, the remainder of the
full required right-of-way shall be dedicated.
   (E)   Alleys. 
      (1)   Alleys may be required in all blocks along the rear line of
business property, in multiple-family residential or industrial blocks, if, in
the opinion of the Planning Board, alleys are needed to service these areas.
      (2)   All dead-end alleys shall be provided with a turnaround in
accordance with town standards.
      (3)   Sharp changes in alignment and grade shall be avoided. All alleys
shall be designed in accordance with North Carolina Department of
Transportation standards.
      (4)   No alley shall have access from a major street or highway, but
shall have its access points confined to minor, lightly traveled streets.
   (F)   Street names and signs.
      (1)   Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other
existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing
streets.
      (2)   In assigning new names, duplication of existing names shall be
avoided and in no case shall the proposed name be phonetically similar to
existing names in Caswell Beach and the extra territorial jurisdiction
irrespective of the use of a suffix such as a street, road, drive, place,
court, etc. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Board of
Commissioners.
      (3)   The subdivider shall be required to provide and erect metal street
name signs to town or county standards, as appropriate, at all intersections
and at any other point within the subdivision deemed necessary by the town.
Subdividers shall assume the total cost of all new signs in addition to any
installation costs involved.
   (G)   Street dedication. 
      (1)   All public streets inside the corporate limits of the Town of
Caswell Beach shall be dedicated to the town and all public streets in the
extraterritorial area shall be constructed to the standards necessary for
acceptance into the state highway system or the standards in this chapter,
whichever is stricter in regard to each particular item, and may be added to
the state system, if eligible. If such a public street is not eligible for
acceptance into the state system, due to an inadequate number of lots or
residences, it shall, nevertheless, be dedicated to the public.
      (2)   All public streets shall be built to the standards of this chapter
and all other applicable standards of the Town of Caswell Beach and/or the
North Carolina Department of Transportation.
   (H)   Street lights. All subdivisions within the corporate limits of the
Town of Caswell Beach shall have streetlights installed, according to town
code.
   (I)   Street trees. Developers are encouraged to plant native deciduous
shade trees along both sides of all streets in new subdivisions. Such trees
should be planted within the right-of-way areas and be spaced no more than 40
feet apart.
   (J)   Disclosure statement.  All streets shown on the final plat shall be
designated in accordance with G.S. § 136-102.6 and designation as public shall
be conclusively presumed an offer of dedication to the public. Where streets
are dedicated to the public but not accepted into a municipal or the state
system before lots are sold, a statement explaining the status of the street
shall be included with the final plat.
   (K)   Access to adjacent properties. Where, in the opinion of the Planning
Board, it is necessary to provide for street access to an adjoining property,
proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such
property and a temporary turnaround provided. In areas subdivided and recorded
prior to the adoption of this chapter (i.e. lots of record) which do not have
direct access to a public road or highway, a private drive or roadway may
provide access for further division meeting the definition of a minor
subdivision if and only if a permanent easement for such drive or roadway, with
a minimum right-of-way width of 20 feet, is recorded with the Register of Deeds
and depicted as such on the final plat.
   (L)   Nonresidential streets. The subdivider of a nonresidential subdivision
shall provide public streets in accordance with the North Carolina Roads,
Minimum Construction Standards and the standards of this chapter, whichever are
stricter in regard to each particular item.
   (M)   Private streets. Private streets may be allowed within the
jurisdiction of this chapter only if they meet the following criteria:
      (1)   All private streets shall be designated as such on the preliminary
and final plats.
      (2)   No more than five lots may be accessed by a private street.
      (3)   Private streets shall meet or exceed the minimum standards for
streets approved by the NCDOT and carry the same warranties set forth in this
chapter.
      (4)   Vehicle turnarounds must be provided at the end of all dead end
streets. Vehicle turnarounds must accommodate emergency vehicles including but
not limited to ambulance and fire safety equipment.
      (5)   (a)   A right-of-way maintenance agreement, satisfactory to the
Council, must be recorded by a property owner's association in the office of
the Register of Deeds to ensure proper maintenance. The agreement shall specify
lot owners' responsibilities for maintenance of private streets and drainage
systems, and shall provide for assessments to finance all maintenance
activities. In addition, all property transfer instruments must contain
reference to that agreement, as well as a statement indicating that the private
street does not meet public standards for maintenance and will not be
considered for maintenance unless improved by the property owner's association
to those standards. This agreement shall also specify that unless the street is
privately maintained in condition for safe passage of public service and
emergency vehicles, the town may provide such maintenance, with charges
therefore becoming a lien on the properties served, dividing among them
proportionate to their assessed tax valuation.
         (b)   A legally responsible organization such as a property owner's
association shall be established to maintain a private street(s). Documents to
assure private responsibility of future maintenance and repair by property
owner's association shall be provided to the town prior to preliminary plat
approval.
   (N)   Gated/controlled subdivisions. All gated or controlled access
subdivisions within the jurisdiction of this chapter must provide continuous
accessibility to subdivision for provision of public service and emergency
vehicles.

§ 152.52 STREETS; DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   In general the design of all public and private streets and roads
within the jurisdiction of this chapter shall be in accordance with the
accepted policies of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, Division
of Highways, as described in its publication Subdivision Road Minimum
Construction Standards.
   (B)   Sidewalks. The subdivider shall be required to construct sidewalks on
both sides of the streets. Sidewalks shall be constructed to the NCDOT standard

§ 152.53 LOTS.
   (A)   All lots shall conform to the area and bulk requirements set forth in
the town zoning ordinance. Whenever there is a discrepancy between the minimum
standards or dimensions noted herein and those contained in the zoning
ordinance, building codes or other official regulations, the highest or most
restrictive standards shall apply. Conformance to zoning requirements means,
among other things, that the smallest lot in the subdivision must meet all
dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance. It is not sufficient merely
for the average lot to meet zoning requirement.
   (B)   General standards for lots shall be as follows:
      (1)   Lot size, shapes and location shall be made with due regard to
topographic conditions, contemplated use and the surrounding area.
      (2)   Every lot shall front or abut on a public street for a minimum
distance of 50 feet.
      (3)   Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra width of ten
feet to permit adequate building setback from side streets.
      (4)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except
where necessary to separate residential development from through traffic or
nonresidential uses.
      (5)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines.
      (6)   Flag-shaped lots shall only be permitted in those cases where the
minimum area, width, depth and street frontage requirements of the zone in
which the property is located is complied with.
      (7)   Lots shall meet any applicable requirements of the Brunswick County
Health Department.
   (C)   All lots which are located within the territorial jurisdiction of the
town for which public water and/or sewer is available shall connect to such
public water and sewer. Where public water and/or sewer service is not
provided, the following requirements shall apply:
      (1)   Where public water but not public sewer is provided, said lot shall
have an area of not less than 15,000 square feet; a mean lot width of not less
than 100 feet; and a mean lot depth of not less than 125 feet;
      (2)   Where neither public water nor public sewer is provided, said lot
shall have an area of not less than 20,000 square feet; a mean lot width of not
less than 120 feet; and a mean lot depth of not less than 150 feet.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10)
§ 152.54 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Utility easements. Easements centered on rear or side lot lines shall
be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least 12 feet in
width, or wider as required by the companies or agencies involved, e.g.
telephone, gas, or electric power. A ten-foot wide utility easement shall be
reserved for future public utilities along each side of all private streets.
   (B)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement
or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be
adequate for the purpose. Parallel streets or frontage roads may be required in
connection therewith.
   (C)   Public maintenance. Lakes, ponds, creeks, flood plains and similar
areas will be accepted for maintenance by the town only if sufficient land is
dedicated as a public recreation area or park or if such area constitutes a
necessary part of the drainage control system. Such areas must be approved by
the Planning Board before approval of the final plat.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10)
§ 152.55 BUFFER STRIPS.
   It is recommended that in residential districts a buffer strip of at least
50 feet in depth, in addition to the normal lot depth required, be provided
adjacent to all railroads, limited access highways and commercial developments.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots, but shall have the following
restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the
planting of evergreen shrubs and/or trees by the owner; the building of
structures hereon is prohibited."; or in the case of commonly-owned property,
shall be deeded to the homeowners' association.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10)
§ 152.56 STORM WATER DRAINAGE.
   The subdivider shall provide a surface water drainage system constructed to
Town of Caswell Beach Storm Water Management Plan and to North Carolina
Department of Transportation standards as reflected in the Handbook for the
Design of Highway Surface Drainage Structures, or the current equivalent,
subject to review by the Town Engineer.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10)
IMPROVEMENTS
§ 152.65 IMPROVEMENT COSTS.
   Prior to approval of the final plat, the following improvements shall be
installed, bonded for or otherwise guaranteed according to §
152.31. The subdivider or developer shall assume the entire cost of all
improvements, whether they be sewer line, water line extensions or street
paving, listed in this section. Any professional service required in this
chapter as a condition of approval of a subdivision plat, such as soil
percolation tests, shall be also paid for by the subdivider.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10)
§ 152.66 GENERAL IMPROVEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   No construction or installation of improvements shall commence in a proposed
major subdivision until the preliminary plat has been approved, or until the
final plat has been approved in a minor subdivision, and all plans and
specifications have been approved by the appropriate authorities. All proposed
subdivision located within the territorial jurisdiction of the town shall
comply with the following improvement requirements:
   (A)   Permanent monuments and markers. Permanent monuments shall be placed
at all block corners or at the tangent points of curves connecting intersecting
street lines, at the points of curvature and tangency in curved street lines,
at all corners in the exterior boundary of the subdivision and at such other
points as may be necessary to make the retracing of the lines as shown upon the
final plat thereof reasonably convenient. The location of all such monuments
shall be clearly designated on said final plat. All lot corners shall be marked
by permanent markers. Unless otherwise specified by this chapter, the Manual of
Practice for Land Surveying, as adopted by the North Carolina State Board of
Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, shall apply when
conducting surveys for subdivisions, in placing monuments and markers, etc.
   (B)   Required improvements. In addition to survey monuments and markers,
other improvements must be completed prior to final plat approval, or their
completion provided for as described in division (C) below. These required
improvements include the construction of streets, storm drainage facilities,
and public water and sewer lines; the planting of street trees; and the
installation of street name signs.
   (C)   Construction guarantee. In lieu of completed improvements no final
plat shall be approved or accepted for recording by the Register of Deeds until
the required improvements have been constructed in a satisfactory manner and
approved by the Subdivision Administrator or, in lieu of such prior
construction, the Board of Commissioners may accept a bond with surety and
condition satisfactory to the town, cash, a certified letter of credit from a
local bank, in an amount equal to 125% of the estimated cost of the
installation of the required improvements, whereby improvements may be made and
utilities installed without cost to the town or county in the event of default
by the subdivider, owner, or contractor. The owner of a subdivision shall
require the contractor constructing streets, curbs, gutters, drainage
facilities, water and sewer lines to give bond guaranteeing the work against
defects for a period of one year from the date of completion of such
construction.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.75 SUBDIVISION ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Town Manager or his/her designee is hereby appointed to serve as
Subdivision Administrator.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10)
§ 152.76 APPLICATION OF STANDARDS.
   Only those standards explicitly set forth in the chapter as criteria for
decision may be used in making individual plat approval decisions. If judgment
is required in approval, only that criteria set forth in the special and
conditional uses section of the town's zoning code shall be used as a guideline
in making those decisions.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10; Am. Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.77 VARIANCE.
   The Zoning Board of Adjustment, after reviewing the recommendation of the
Planning Board and after holding a quasi- judicial hearing, may authorize a
variance from these regulations when, in its opinion, unnecessary hardships may
result from strict compliance and only to the extent that is absolutely
necessary and not to an extent which would violate the intent of this chapter.
In granting any variance, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall make the
findings required below, taking into account the nature of the proposed
subdivision, the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to
reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the possible effect of the
proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. Notice of
hearings conducted pursuant to this section shall be mailed to the person or
entity whose application or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner
of the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not
initiate the hearing and to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the
parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing. In the absence of evidence
to the contrary, the local government may rely on the county tax listing to
determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be
deposited in the mail at least ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to
the date of the hearing. Within that same time period, the Subdivision
Administrator shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site
that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-
of-way. The Board may continue an evidentiary hearing that has been convened
without further advertisement. If an evidentiary hearing is set for a given
date and a quorum of the Board is not then present, the hearing shall be
continued until the next regular Board meeting without further advertisement.
No variance shall be granted unless the Zoning Board of Adjustment finds all of
the following conditions to exist:
   (A)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the
chapter. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
   (B)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
   (C)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the
property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
   (D)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the chapter, such that public safety is secured, and substantial
justice is achieved.

not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. passed 9-8-83; Am. Res. passed 4-8-10)
§ 152.79 VESTED RIGHTS.
   A landowner submitting a preliminary or final plat for approval may declare

§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Violations. After adoption of this chapter, any person who, being the
owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the territorial
jurisdiction of this chapter, thereafter subdivides his land in violation of
this chapter or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of, or any
other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been
properly approved under the terms of this chapter and recorded in the office of
the Brunswick County Register of Deeds, shall be guilty of a violation and
guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. In addition, enforcement remedies specified in
G.S. § 160D-807 for zoning enforcement shall hereby be authorized as applicable
for enforcement of these violations, including denial of building permits. The
description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document
used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the
transaction from this penalty. The notice of violation shall be delivered to
the holder of the development approval and to the landowner of the property
involved, if the landowner is not the holder of the development approval, by
personal delivery, electronic delivery, or first-class mail and may be provided
by similar means to the occupant of the property or the person undertaking the
work or activity. The notice of violation may be posted on the property. The
person providing the notice of violation shall certify to the town that the
notice was provided, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the
absence of fraud.
   (B)   Criminal penalties. The violation of any provision of this chapter
shall subject the offender to criminal prosecution and, upon conviction, to
fine and/or imprisonment set to the maximum allowed by G.S. § 14.4.
   (C)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any violation of any provision of this chapter shall subject the
violator to a civil penalty in the sum of $500 per violation.
      (2)   A citation for said civil penalty shall be issued by the Caswell
Beach Police Department.
      (3)   Each citation for a civil penalty must be paid within 72 hours of
issuance.
      (4)   The town, through its attorney or other official designated by the
Board of Commissioners, may enjoin illegal subdivision transfer, or sale of
land by action for injunction or ensure compliance through an order of
abatement. If the violator fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or
order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he/she may be cited
for contempt and the town may execute the order of abatement. The town shall
have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement.
   (D)   Continuing violation. Each day's continuing violation of this chapter
after notification of such violation shall be a separate and distinct offense
and subject to additional fine or civil penalty.
   (E)   Equitable remedies.  Notwithstanding division (C) above, this chapter
may be enforced by appropriate equitable remedies issuing from a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (F)   Combination of remedies.  Nothing in this section shall be construed
to limit the use of remedies available to the town. The Town of Caswell Beach
may seek to enforce this chapter by using any one, all, or a combination of
remedies.

ZONING DISTRICTS; BOUNDARIES
§ 153.015 CLASSES AND PURPOSES OF DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Single-family residential district (R-20SF). This district is intended
for single-family housing at a specific density; such as 20,000 square feet per
residence. The regulations are designed to maintain a suitable environment for
family living.
   (B)   Single-family residential districts (R-20, R-12, R-8). These districts
are intended primarily for single-family houses at various densities of
population. Certain non-residential uses of public or semi-public nature are
permitted. The regulations for these districts are designed to maintain a
suitable environment for family living. Densities of development are controlled
by minimum lot area requirements, which are different with each district. The
minimum lot area requirements, in thousands of square feet, is indicated by the
numerical identification of each district.
   (C)   Multi-family residential district (R-20MF). The purpose of the R-20MF
multi-family district is to provide for low density apartment development in
areas which would be unsuited for multi-family use on a higher density. By
having high dimensional standards and requiring site plan approval, maximum
control of development can be achieved through this district.
   (D)   R-MH Mobile homes district. The purpose of this district is to provide
for the development of properly located and planned facilities for mobile
homes. It is recognized that mobile homes should be located in mobile home
parks and subdivisions only and that such areas must be carefully located and
designed to meet the needs of the residents and to achieve a satisfactory
relationship to adjoining and nearby property.
   (E)   Resort residential condominium district. This district is designed
primarily as a district for resort-style condominiums serving visitors and
tourists, composed of multi-family dwellings, parking and accessory uses such
as sales and rental offices and recreation amenities.
   (F)   Business district. Reserved.
   (G)   Conservation. This district is intended to preserve and protect
fragile estuarine cosystem from adverse affects created by incompatible uses.
   (H)   Commercial recreation district (CR).
      (1)   This district is established to maintain and protect the existing
golf course and related uses. The principal use of the land is for recreational
pursuits which are in keeping with the town's low density single-family
residential development. It is also the intent to limit the uses to those that
presently exist.
         (a)   Golf course;
         (b)   Golf club house and pro shop;
         (c)   Swimming pool;
         (d)   Tennis courts;
         (e)   Accessory buildings for golf course maintenance;
         (f)   Restaurants with lounge.
      (2)   Any new uses (not listed in subdivision (H)(1)) will require the
zoning amendment procedure.
   (I)   Non-commercial recreation district (NCR).  The purpose of this
district is to provide and maintain public access to the designated park land
and the beach.
      (1)   It is the intent of this section to limit the use to those that
presently exist:
         (a)   Education;
         (b)   Preservation and maintenance, including historic preservation;
         (c)   Beach access;
         (d)   Parking;
         (e)   Fund raising in support of the above uses, including the sale of

§ 153.016 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES; ZONING MAP.
   The boundaries of each zoning district are established as shown on the map
titled “The Town of Caswell Beach Zoning Map” which accompanies and is hereby
declared to be a part of this chapter. Unless otherwise shown on the map, the
boundaries of the districts are street centerlines or lot lines as they existed
at the time of the establishment of the boundary in question. Where uncertainty
exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the map, the following
rules shall apply:
   (A)   Where a district boundary appears to divide a lot, the location of
such boundary, unless the boundary is indicated by dimensions, shall be
determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map. In the event that a
district boundary line on the zoning map divides a platted lot held in one
ownership on the date of passage of this chapter, each part of the lot so
divided shall be used in conformity with the zoning district in which the part
is located.
   (B)   Regardless of the existence of copies of the official zoning map which
may from time to time be published, the official zoning map shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of land, buildings or other
structures within the corporate limits of the town. The official zoning map
shall be kept in the office of the Town Clerk and made available to the public
in read only format. All amendments to said map shall be entered onto the
official map with date and reference along with certification by the Town Clerk
under his or her seal. The zoning map, both current and prior adopted versions,
shall be on file in the office of the Town Clerk. The zoning map(s) may be in
paper or digital format.

NONCONFORMING USES
§ 153.050 PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (A)   If, within the districts established by this chapter, or by amendments
that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and use of land and
structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited under the terms of this chapter, it is the intent of
this chapter to permit these pre-existing nonconformances to be grandfathered
and continue until they are either removed, destroyed or brought into
compliance (except signs, which are provided for in this chapter and
residential uses as permitted by § 153.053). These uses are declared by this
chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which they
are located. It is the intent of this section to encourage conformance without
prohibiting the reconstruction of a nonconforming residential structure within
the structure’s original footprint destroyed by fire, explosion, tornado,
earthquake, hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause.
   (B)   It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformances shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or used as grounds for adding other
structures, or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.

single lot which was recorded prior to the date it became legally non-
conforming. Such lot must be in separate ownership. This provision shall apply
even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both,
that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions
and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of lot, shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variance of area, width, and yard requirements shall be obtained only through
action of the Board of Adjustment.
   (B)   If two or more lots or combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet at least
80% of the requirements for lot width and area, for the zone in which they are
located, as established by this chapter, the land involved shall be considered
to be an undivided parcel, for the purpose of this chapter, and no portion of
the parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet width and area
requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of the parcel
be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this chapter.

   (B)   A non-conforming use may not be enlarged or extended, but extension of
a use to any portion of a building, which portion is at the time of the
adoption of this chapter primarily arranged or designed for such non-conforming
use, shall not be deemed to be an extension of a non-conforming use.
   (C)   The structural alterations made in a non-conforming building shall
not, during its life, exceed 50% of its assessed value, nor shall the building
be enlarged unless the use therein is changed to a conforming use, provided,
however, that non-conforming building damaged by fire, explosion, tornado,
earthquake, hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause, to an extent of not more
than 60% of its assessed value, may be repaired or rebuilt within one year of
the date of such damage, but not thereafter.
   (D)   If a non-conforming use is discontinued, any further use of the
building and premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. A reasonable interim, not to exceed 180 days, between tenants or
occupants shall not be construed to mean discontinuance.

destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane or
similar uncontrollable cause, it must be permitted to be repaired or rebuilt
within one year of the date of the damage, but not thereafter.

* Note: The schedule of maximum built-upon area and bulk size is not intended
to render nonconforming any use or structure in existence at the time of
adoption. Nothing in §
153.086 shall prohibit the repair or rebuilding of a structure or use based
solely upon the lot coverage or bulk size requirements imposed, should such a
structure be destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake,
hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause. Should a structure suffer such
damage or destruction it must be permitted to be repaired or rebuilt in the
same footprint that was occupied prior to the damage within one year of the
date of such damage, but not thereafter.
** Note: In determining compliance with the requirements of §
153.086, compliance with maximum built-upon area is the first consideration.
Therefore, a structure of 5,400 square feet bulk size is permitted only if the
resultant total built-upon area associated with the construction of the
residence including all other impervious or partially impervious surfaces
complies with the maximum built-upon area limitations set out in §
153.086.

§ 153.087 BUILD-TO-LINE.
   (A)   Existing configuration of land.
      (1)   The existing configuration of the land and its natural vegetation
shall not be altered from the principal natural features of the town landscape.
All construction and placement of structures, including but not necessarily
limited to housing, exterior decks, walkways, docks, and viewing and seating
platforms detached from housing, and landscape planting shall be governed by an
intent to limit intrusions into the natural features and beauty of the town's
landscape.
      (2)   The natural features referred to in division (A)(1) will be taken
to mean:
         (a)   The ocean located generally to the south of the beach area.
         (b)   The foredune of this area immediately behind the beach strand
and to the vegetation of this foredune.
         (c)   The tidal marsh generally to the north of the town, and marsh
and the land to be used for human habitation.
   (B)   Ocean-front properties.
      (1)   Ocean-front properties. The build-to-line is a straight line drawn
between the points farthest from the street lot line on the immediately
adjacent structures. The line is drawn between that point on each of the
immediately adjacent structures that is farthest from the street lot line when
measured perpendicularly to the roadway. Should there be no immediately
adjacent structure or structures, the above-mentioned straight line shall be
made between the nearest adjacent structures, taking into consideration the
curve of the road in front of the property.
      (2)   Marsh-side properties. The build-to-line is a straight line drawn
between the points farthest from the street lot line on the immediately
adjacent structures. The line is drawn between that point on each of the
immediately adjacent structures that is farthest from the street lot line when
measured perpendicularly to the roadway. Should there be no immediately
adjacent structure or structures, the above-mentioned straight line shall be
made between the nearest adjacent structures taking into consideration the
curve of the road in front of the property.
      (3)   Determination of the ocean-ward or marsh-ward points of adjacent
properties farthest from the street lot line and production of the build-to-
line. Using the entirety of each adjacent structure with all attached above-
ground level features, the surveyor preparing the proposed building plan shall
identify, by survey measurement, the point on each structure that is farthest
from the street lot line. The surveyor will prepare a certified line between
those points, that will establish the build-to-line. Existing fences and
walkways over the dunes shall not be used in the survey measurement. Elevated
stairs leading from the principal structure to a walkway are, in their
entirety, considered part of the structure. Stairs leading from the principal
structure or attached porch/deck to the ground are, in their entirety,
considered part of the structure and shall be considered in the build-to-line
measurement. For purposes of identifying the build-to-line, transitions from
residential structure to walkway wider than six feet shall be considered part
of the structure.
   (C)   Applicability.
      (1)   All above-ground construction and placement of structures,
including but not necessarily limited to housing, exterior decks, walkways,
docks and viewing and seating platforms detached from housing shall be subject
to the build-to-line provisions established by this section. No decking,
stairs, or at-grade improvements exceeding six inches in height shall be
permitted ocean-ward or marsh-ward of the build-to-line except as provided in
division (D), Exemptions.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, structures include buildings,
screened enclosures, fences, and/or man-made facilities or infrastructure that
is principally above ground.
   (D)   Exemptions. The following shall be permitted beyond the build-to-line
subject to the standards provided.
      (1)   Walkways, viewing platforms, docks, stairs to the beach, and
similar appurtenances.
         (a)   Walkways (including associated stairs) connecting the principal
structure to beach and marsh walkways and detached seating and viewing
platforms shall occur as close as possible to the natural, undisturbed contour
of the terrain, but no lower than provided for by CAMA rules, so as to minimize
intrusion into the natural features and beauty of the town's landscape. Stairs
leading from a walkway to a ground level feature, which may include an in-
ground pool, beach, marsh, or similar, are permitted.
         (b)   To minimize intrusion into the health and natural beauty of the
dunes, residential walkways must follow, within reason, the shortest straight-
line path from the structure to the beach. The maximum allowed width for a
walkway from a residential structure is six feet. The walking surface of the
walkway deck shall be no greater than 18 inches above the highest point of the
natural, undisturbed peak of the terrain under the proposed path of the
structure.
         (c)   A viewing platform, with a total footprint not to exceed 200
square feet may be attached to the walkway. The platform shall be immediately
adjacent to the walkway with a transition from walkway to deck not to exceed
four feet. The walking surface of the platform may not be elevated above the
walking surface of the walkway.
         (d)   1.   Hand railings or guard railings on residential walkways
shall be no higher than required by the NC Building Code. Where elevation
requires fall protection, walkway railings must provide at least 50% open
space, measured between the vertical pilings. Where code mandates fall
protection due to elevation, vertical or horizontal balusters shall be used in
a manner conforming to NC Building Code and shall be sized and spaced to
provide at least 50% open space, measured between the vertical pilings. Lattice
type closure on railings is not permitted.
            2.   For example, a guard rail constructed with a top rail five
inches tall, with one and one-half inch vertical or horizontal balusters spaced
three and four-fifths inches apart, and a bottom runner that is three and one-
half inches tall will provide more than 54% open space.
         (e)   Under no circumstances shall a detached platform, walkway, or
dock, be roofed, enclosed or have a second story.
      (2)   Swimming pool fences. Pool security fences mandated by NC Building
Code may be placed on the perimeter of the pool at the minimum height required
by code. Such fences shall be at minimum 70% transparent.
      (3)   Construction of minor ornamental features. On marsh side
properties, construction of minor ornamental features with horizontal
dimensions no greater than six feet and height no greater than three feet are
permitted. Such features may include, but are not limited to, fire pits,
benches, and seating.
   (E)   Build-to-line when replacing, enlarging, or elevating an existing
structure.
      (1)   When an existing structure is removed, the build-to-line must be
established for any new construction, redevelopment, or placement of a
structure on that site relative to adjacent properties. The new principal
structure and all accessory structures shall be subject to the provisions of
this section.
      (2)   Elevating an existing structure or adding another floor to an
existing structure shall be subject to the build-to-line. Such elevation or
addition shall only be permitted if the existing structure and new construction
are street-ward of the build-to-line.
      (3)   Should a structure be destroyed by fire, explosion, tornado,
earthquake, hurricane, or similar uncontrollable cause, it may be replaced in
the same footprint provided the height, elevation, and building footprint of
the replacement are no different than existed before the structure was
destroyed. If height, elevation, or building footprint are different, the
build-to-line must be established and adhered to relative to adjacent
structures.

   (C)   In order for a zoning vested right to be established upon approval of
a site-specific vesting plan, the applicant must indicate at the time of
application, on a form to be provided by the city, that a zoning vested right
is being sought.
   (D)   Each map, plat, site plan or other document evidencing a site-specific
vesting plan shall contain the following notation: “Approval of this plan
established a zoning vested right under G.S. § 160D-108. Unless terminated at
an earlier date, the zoning vested right shall be valid until (date).”
   (E)   Following approval or conditional approval of a site- specific vesting
plan, nothing in this chapter shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews
and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the
original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not
inconsistent with the original approval.
   (F)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the revocation of the original
approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and
conditions of the approval or the zoning ordinance. Any revocation of a
development approval shall be in accordance with the same process that was
followed for approval.

§ 153.139 DURATION.
   (A)   A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this chapter shall
remain vested for a period of two years unless specifically and unambiguously
provided otherwise pursuant to division (B) of this section. This vesting shall
not be extended by any amendments or modification to a site-specific vesting
plan unless expressly provided by the approval authority at the time the
amendment or modification is approved.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (A), the approval authority
may provide that rights shall be vested for a period exceeding two years but
not exceeding five years where warranted in light of all relevant
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size of the development, the
level of investment, the need for or desirability of the development, economic
cycles, and market conditions. These determinations shall be in the sound
discretion of the approval authority at the time the site-specific vesting plan
is approved. A multi-phased development is vested for the entire development
with the land development regulations then in place at the time a site plan
approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development. A
right which has been vested as provided for in this division remains vested for
a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for the
initial phase of the multi-phased development.
   (C)   Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions of G.S.
§ 160D-1111 shall apply, except that a building permit shall not expire or be
revoked because of the running of time while a zoning vested right under this
section is outstanding.

§ 153.140 TERMINATION.
   A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this chapter shall
terminate:
   (A)   At the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings
and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filled;
   (B)   With the written consent of the affected landowner;
   (C)   Upon findings by the Board of Commissioners, by ordinance after notice
and a public hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate
vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the
public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as
contemplated in the site-specific vesting plan;
   (D)   Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all costs,
expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not
limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural,
planning, marketing, legal, and other consultant’s fees incurred after approval
by the town, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid.
Compensation shall not include any diminutive in the value of the property
which is caused by such action;
   (E)   Upon findings by the Board of Commissioners, by ordinance after notice
and a hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied
inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a
difference in the approval by the approval authority of the site-specific
vesting plan; or
   (F)   Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or
regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site-specific
vesting plan, in which case the approval authority may modify the affected
provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has
fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and a hearing.

statement that declares that no zoning vested right has been established under

zoning vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner and
any such zoning vested right shall be terminated.

at the time for appointment of regular members, provided, however, that in the
case of the first appointment of alternate members, the appointment shall be

meetings and hearings at which one or more regular members are absent or are
unable to participate in hearing a case because of financial or other interest.
Regular members, on receiving notice of a special meeting that they cannot
attend or on learning that they will be unable to participate in a particular

§ 153.159 MEETINGS.
   (A)   Regular meetings. Meetings of the Board may be held on the fourth

statute are followed.
   (B)   Special meetings. The Chairman may call special meetings of the Board

   (C)   Cancellation of meetings. If there are no appeals, applications for

   (E)   Voting. All regular members may vote on any issue unless they have

§ 153.160 APPEALS; HEARINGS; REQUEST FOR VARIANCE OR SPECIAL USE PERMIT;
DECISIONS.
   (A)   Types of appeals. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide all
appeals from and review any order, requirements, decision, or determination
made by the Zoning Administrator. The officer making the determination shall
give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the
determination and to the party who sought the determination, if different from
the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery,
electronic mail, or by first-class mail. The notice shall be delivered to the
last address listed for the owner of the affected property on the county tax
abstract and to the address provided in the application or request for a
determination if the party seeking the determination is different from the
owner. The official who made the decision (or his/her successor if no longer
employed) shall appear as a witness in the appeal. It shall also hear and
decide all matters referred to it or on which the zoning code requires it to
pass. In deciding appeals the Board may hear both those based on an allegedly
improper or erroneous interpretation of the code and those based on alleged
hardship resulting from strict interpretation of the code. An appeal of a
notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action
appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed during the pendency of the
appeal to the Board of Adjustment and any subsequent appeal in accordance with
G.S. § 160D-1402 or during the pendency of any civil proceeding authorized by
law or appeals therefrom, unless the official who made the decision certifies
to the board after notice of appeal has been filed that, because of the facts
stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property
or, because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously
interfere with enforcement of the development regulation. In that case,
enforcement proceedings are not stayed except by a restraining order, which may
be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant
may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal,
and the Board shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request
is filed. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, appeals of
decisions granting a development approval or otherwise affirming that a
proposed use of property is consistent with the development regulation does not
stay the further review of an application for development approvals to use the
property; in these situations, the appellant or town may request and the Board
may grant a stay of a final decision of development approval applications,
including building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
   (B)   Procedure for filing appeals. No appeal shall be heard by the Board of
Adjustment unless a complete application for an appeal hearing is filed within
30 days after the interested party or parties receive notice of the final
order, requirement, decision, or determination by the Zoning Administrator. Any
other person with standing to appeal has 30 days from receipt from any source
of actual or constructive notice of the determination within which to file an
appeal. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given pursuant to
G.S. § 160D-403(b) by first-class mail is deemed received on the third business
day following deposit of the notice for mailing with the United States Postal
Service. The applicant must file his application for a hearing with the Town
Clerk, who shall act as clerk for the Board in receiving this notice. All
applications shall be made on the form furnished for that purpose, and all
information required thereon shall be completed before an appeal may be
considered as having been filed. All applications shall be accompanied by a
filing fee according to the town’s schedule of fees maintained in the office of
the Town Clerk.
   (C)   Quasi-judicial hearing.
      (1)   Time. After a complete application for a quasi-judicial decision is
received by the Town Clerk, the Board Chairman shall schedule the time for a
hearing, which shall be a regular or special meeting within 45 days from the
receipt of a complete application. For special use permits, once a complete
application has been received, the application shall be placed on the agenda
for the next regularly scheduled BOC meeting following 45 days from receipt of
the complete application. The BOC shall follow the quasi-judication hearing
process as described herein for the special use permit application.
      (2)   Quasi-judicial hearing notice.
         (a)   The notice of the quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing shall be
mailed to the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request is the
subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the
hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels
of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to
any other persons as the Building Inspector shall direct. In the absence of
evidence to the contrary, the town may rely on the county tax listing to
determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be
deposited in the mail at least ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to
the date of the hearing. The Board may continue an evidentiary hearing that has
been convened without further advertisement. If an evidentiary hearing is set
for a given date and a quorum of the Board is not then present, the hearing
shall be continued until the next regular Board meeting without further
advertisement.
         (b)   Such notice shall state the location of the building or lot, the
general nature of the question involved in the appeal, and the date, time and
place of the hearing.
         (c)   In addition, a notice shall be placed on the door of the Town
Hall, and adjacent neighbors shall be notified. ADJACENT shall be defined as
the owner of that parcel of land in question shown on the county tax listing,
and the owners of all parcels of land abutting that parcel of land as shown on
the county tax listing and parcels within 100 feet.
         (d)   The site subject to the hearing shall be posted at least ten
days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. The posted
notice shall provide reasonable notice to interested persons. The notice shall
be posted on the site that is subject of the hearing or an adjacent street or
highway right-of-way.
      (3)   Conduct of the hearing.
         (a)   Any party may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney at the
hearing. The order of business for each hearing shall be as follows.
            1.   The Chairman or such person as he shall direct, shall give a
preliminary statement of the case noting that the proceedings are quasi-
judicial and therefore shall be conducted in the manner of a court of law with
sworn testimony presented as evidence. All who wish to speak shall first be
placed under oath and the opposing party may cross examine them as set forth in
(b) below;
            2.   The applicant shall present the evidence and arguments in
support of his application;
            3.   Persons opposed to granting the application shall present the
evidence and arguments against the application;
            4.   Both sides shall be permitted to present rebuttals to opposing
evidence and arguments;
            5.   The Chairman shall summarize the evidence that has been
presented, giving the parties opportunity to make objections or corrections.
         (b)   Witnesses may be called and factual evidence may be submitted,
but the Board shall not be limited to consideration of such evidence as would
be admissible in a court of law when evidence is not reasonably available under
such rules to show relevant facts. In such cases facts may be shown by the most
reliable and substantial evidence available. The Board may view the premises
before the hearing, but the facts indicated by such inspection shall be
disclosed at the hearing and made part of the record.
         (c)   All witnesses before the Board, including the applicant(s),
shall be placed under oath, and the opposing party may cross-examine them.
Officials of the court (attorneys) not wishing to be sworn must understand
their testimony must be treated not as evidence on which to base a decision but
merely as arguments.
      (4)   Rehearings. An application for a rehearing may be made in the same
manner as an application for an original hearing. Evidence in support of the
application shall initially be limited to what is necessary to enable the Board
to determine whether there has been a substantial change in the facts,
evidence, or conditions in the case. The Board shall deny the application for
rehearing it, from the record, it finds that there has been no substantial
change in facts, evidence, or conditions. If the Board finds that a change has
occurred, it shall thereupon treat the request in the same manner as any other
application.
   (D)   Decisions.
      (1)   Time. Written decisions by the Board including findings of fact
shall be made and presented to the applicant no later than 30 days from the
time of the hearing.
      (2)   Form.
         (a)   The Board’s final decision shall be shown in record of the case
as entered in the Board’s minutes and signed by the Secretary and the Chairman
on approval of the minutes by the Board. Such record shall show the reasons for
the determinations, with a summary of the evidence introduced, the conclusions
of law, and the findings of fact made by the Board. No variance shall be
granted for a specific use. When a variance is granted, the record shall state
in detail any exceptional difficulty to unnecessary hardship upon which the
appeal was based and which the Board finds to exist. The decision may reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed from. When a special use permit is granted, the record
shall state in detail any facts that support findings required to be made
before such permit is issued.
         (b)   The Chair or his or her designee shall rule on objections and
motions to quash subpoenas. Objections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary
issues, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal or the
standing of a party, may be made to the Board. The Board Chair shall rule on
any objections, and the Chair's rulings may be appealed to the full Board.
These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1402
         (c)   The record shall state in detail what, if any, conditions and
safeguards the Board imposes in connection with granting of a variance or
special use permit. A separate record of decision in each case shall be
prepared, filed in the Town Clerk’s office and furnished to the parties as
specified in subsection (5) of this division.
      (3)   Expiration of permits. Unless otherwise specified, any order or
decision of the Board granting a special use permit shall expire if the
applicant does not obtain a building permit or certificate of occupancy for
such use within 12 months from the date of the decision.
      (4)   Voting at hearings. The concurring vote of four- fifths of the
Board members shall be necessary to grant a variance from the ordinance
provisions. All other decisions shall be made by a majority vote. However,
vacant seats and disqualified members are not considered in calculating four-
fifths votes if there are no qualified alternates.
      (5)   A variance may only be issued when the following findings of fact
are made by the Board of Adjustment. The burden of proving these conditions
exist is on the applicant.
         (a)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
         (b)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
         (c)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant
or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
         (d)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose,
and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and
substantial justice is achieved.
      (6)   Notice and public records of decisions. The Secretary shall give
written notice of the decision in the case to the appellant and/or applicant
and to every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such notice
with the Secretary or the Chairman of the Board when the hearing is held. Such
notice may be delivered either by personal service or by registered mail or
certified mail, or return receipt requested. A copy of the decision shall also
be filed in the Town Clerk’s office. The decision shall be a public record,
available for inspection at all reasonable times.

§ 153.174 AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   This chapter, including the official zoning map, may be amended from
time to time, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been
referred first to the Planning Board. After thorough review, including public
forums if deemed necessary, the Planning Board shall submit to the Board of
Commissioners a written statement as to whether the proposed amendment is
consistent with the town’s comprehensive long range planning document. When
conducting a review of proposed zoning text or map amendments pursuant to this
section, the Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed
action is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any
other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning Board shall
provide a written recommendation to the Board of Commissioners that addresses
plan consistency, but a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment
is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or
approval of the proposed amendment by the Board of Commissioners. If a zoning
map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-602(b),
the Planning Board statement describing plan consistency may address the
overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant
adopted plans were considered in the recommendation made.
   (B)   Hearing and notice requirements. A public hearing shall be held by the
Board of Commissioners before adoption of any proposed amendment to this
chapter. A notice of such public hearing shall be given once a week for two
successive calendar weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the town,
the notice to be published the first time not less than ten days nor more than
25 days prior to the date established for such public hearing. Whenever there
is a zoning map amendment, the owner of that parcel of land shown on the county
tax listing, and the owners of all parcels of land abutting that parcel of land
as shown on the county tax listing and parcels within 100 feet of the subject
property, shall be mailed notice of a public hearing on the proposed amendment
by first class mail at the last address listed for such owners on the county
tax abstracts. For the purpose of this section, properties are abutting even if
separated by a street, railroad, or other transportation corridor. The notice
must be deposited in the mail at least ten but not more than 25 days prior to
the date of the public hearing. The person mailing such notices shall certify
to the Board of Commissioners that fact and such certificate shall be deemed
conclusive in the absence of fraud. At the same time the first notice is sent
out, a sign shall be posted on the affected property stating:
      (1)   The date of the hearing;
      (2)   The purpose of the hearing; and
      (3)   Where to get more information regarding the action.
   (C)   When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the town shall prominently
post a notice of the public hearing on the site proposed for rezoning or on an
adjacent public street or highway right-of-way at least ten but more than 25
days prior to the date of the hearing. When multiple parcels are included
within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is
not required, but the town shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable
notice to interested persons.
   (D)   (1)   If the adoption or modification of the ordinance would result in
changes to the zoning map or would change or affect the permitted uses of land
located five miles or less from the perimeter boundary of a military base, the
Board of Commissioners shall provide written notice of the proposed changes by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Commander of the military base
not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the
public hearing. If the military provides comments or analysis regarding the
compatibility of the proposed ordinance or amendment with military operations
at the base, the Board of Commissioners shall take the comments and analysis
into consideration before making a final determination on the ordinance.
      (2)   If the adoption or modification of the ordinance would result in
changes to the zoning map or would change or affect the permitted uses of land
within the jurisdiction of Caswell Beach, the Board of Commissioners shall
provide written notice of the proposed changes by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the manager of the Cape Fear Regional Jetport not less
than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the public
hearing. If the manager of the Jetport provides comments or analysis regarding
the compatibility of the proposed ordinance or amendment with operations at the
airport, the Board of Commissioners shall take the comments and analysis into
consideration before making a final determination on the ordinance.
   (E)   No amendment to zoning regulations or a zoning map that down-zones
property shall be initiated nor is it enforceable without the written consent
of all property owners whose property is the subject of the down-zoning
amendment, unless the down-zoning amendment is initiated by the town. For
purposes of this section, "down-zoning" means a zoning ordinance that affects
an area of land in one of the following ways: (1) by decreasing the development
density of the land to be less dense than was allowed under its previous usage;
or (2) by reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in a
zoning ordinance or land development regulation to fewer uses than were allowed
under its previous usage.
   (F)   A fee will be charged for each application for business use or
application for rezoning of any property within the zoning jurisdiction of the
town. A schedule of fees shall be maintained in the office of the Town Clerk.
   (G)   Proposed changes or amendments to this chapter may be initiated by the
Board of Commissioners, the Planning Board, the Board of Adjustment or by one
or more interested persons.
   (H)   An application for any change or amendment shall contain a statement
of the present regulation, the proposed amendment to it and the name and
address of the party requesting the change. An application for any change or
amendment of a district boundary shall contain a legal description of the
property to be affected by the change in the name and address of the party
requesting the change.
   (I)   No amendment shall become effective except by favorable vote of three-
fourths of all members of the Board of Commissioners.
   (J)   When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, the Board
of Commissioners shall approve a brief statement describing whether its action
is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive plan. The
requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear
indication in the minutes of the Board of Commissioners meeting that at the
time of action on the amendment the Board was aware of and considered the
Planning Board's recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted
comprehensive plan. If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was
deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the
effect of also amending any future land-use map in the approved plan, and no
additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. When
adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, an additional
statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be
approved by the Board of Commissioners. This statement of reasonableness may
consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other
attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned; (ii) the benefits and detriments
to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding community; (iii) the
relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the
tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be permissible under
the proposed amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public interest;
and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a zoning map
amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the
Board of Commissioners statement on reasonableness may address the overall
rezoning. The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement
required by this section may be approved as a single statement.
   (K)   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under
G.S. § 160D-602(b), the statement describing plan consistency may address the
overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant
adopted plans were considered in the recommendation made. If a zoning map
amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted
comprehensive plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending
the future land-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or
application for a plan amendment shall be required.

§ 153.175 CONFLICTING REGULATIONS.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of the chapter, the provisions
shall be held to the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
safety, health, convenience, propriety or general welfare. It is not intended
by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easement, covenants,
or other agreements between parties, provided, however, that where this chapter
imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the
height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or
required by other ordinances, rules, regulations or by easements, covenants or
agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.

§ 153.176 PERMIT REVOCATION.
   Any permit or development approval issued under this chapter may be revoked
by the permit-issuing authority by the same process as was used for the
approval, this shall include any notice and hearing requirements for a special
use permit. Before permits other than special use may be revoked, the Zoning
Administrator shall give the permit recipient ten days' notice of intent to
revoke the permit and shall inform the recipient of the alleged reasons for the
revocation and of his/her right to request an informal hearing on the
allegations. If the permit is revoked, the Zoning Administrator shall provide
to the permittee a written statement of the decision and the reasons therefor.
Appeals may be made to the Board of Adjustment.

Assembly in 1974, lays the framework for the N.C. Coastal Management Program by
establishing guidelines for development in designated areas of environmental
concern. CAMA also created the Coastal Resources Commission and Coastal
Resources Advisory Council. The Coastal Resources Commission carves out a
permit program to guide development in AECs.
   CAMA PERMIT. One of the principal ways CAMA protects North Carolina’s
natural resources is through the coastal management permitting program. Major
permits are required for any development proposed in a designated area of
environmental concern. Minor permits may be issued locally if there is a

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 154.05 SHORT TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known as the Stormwater Management subchapter for
Caswell Beach, North Carolina.
(Ord. passed 11-11-05)
§ 154.06 GOALS AND PURPOSES.
   The preservation of water quality and protection against flooding are
central environmental goals of the town. In order to meet these important
goals, the town adopts this stormwater management subchapter for the following
purposes:
   (A)   To regulate new development, redevelopment, and other construction
activities within the jurisdiction of the town, consistent with federal, state
and local requirements, and the town’s environmental goals.
   (B)   To provide the structure for which the authority of the town to
administer and enforce stormwater quantity and quality regulations will be
exercised.
(Ord. passed 11-11-05)
§ 154.07 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Board of Commissioners finds that development without control of
drainage has a significant impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the
community. More specifically:
   (A)   Uncontrolled stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving
water bodies, degrade water quality and result in closures of shellfish waters.
   (B)   Uncontrolled stormwater runoff can increase nutrients such as
phosphorous and nitrogen, thereby accelerating eutrophication of receiving
waters, adversely affecting flora and fauna.
   (C)   Improperly channeling water increases the velocity of runoff thereby
increasing erosion and sedimentation.
   (D)   Construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and
removal of vegetation tends to cause a loss of natural recharge areas and
increase erosion.
   (E)   Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases
their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation, and
harms flora and fauna.
   (F)   Impervious surfaces increases the volume and rate of stormwater runoff
and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater
recharge.
   (G)   Improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of
flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering property and human
life.
   (H)   Improperly managed stormwater runoff can interfere with the
maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas, thereby disrupting
biological productivity.
   (I)   The economy of the town as well as the health, safety and welfare of
its citizens is dependent upon the preservation of healthy beaches, clean
navigable waterways, abundant fishing and shellfishing resources, and a healthy
ecosystem that attracts visitors to the town.
   (J)   Many future problems can be avoided or substantially mitigated if land
is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff management practices.
(Ord. passed 11-11-05)

ILLICIT STORMWATER DISCHARGE
§ 154.25 SHORT TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known as the Illicit Stormwater Discharge
subchapter of the Town of Caswell Beach, North Carolina.
(Ord. passed 11-11-05)
§ 154.26 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Board of Commissioners, based upon comprehensive science as evidenced
from the UNCW - Dr. Mike Malin Study of Tiny Piney Creek, among other data,
finds that the discharge of non-stormwater drainage to the waters of the state
and to the municipal stormwater drainage system could have significant adverse
impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the community. More specifically:
   (A)   Illicit stormwater discharges carry pollutants into receiving water
bodies, degrading water quality and effecting closure of shell fishing waters.
   (B)   Nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen accelerate eutrophication
of receiving waters adversely affecting flora and fauna.
   (C)   Improper connection to the storm drain system and to water of the
state adversely impacts the quality of receiving waters.
   (D)   Septic tank discharges from non-compliant systems, washing machine
discharges and illegal dumping into stormwater drains are examples of illicit
discharges.
   (E)   The town must have the authority to deter and/or stop illicit
discharges to stormwater drains, ditches and systems.
   (F)   Substantial economic losses result from adverse impacts on community
waters through illicit discharges.
   (G)   Illicit discharges to water bodies diminish their capacity to
naturally process runoff nutrients thereby harming flora and fauna.
   (H)   Pollutants in illicit discharges to waters can percolate into the soil
thereby decreasing groundwater quality.
   (I)   Improperly managed stormwater systems can decrease the quality of
property and human life.
   (J)   Improperly managed stormwater drainage systems can interfere with the
maintenance of estuarine areas and biological productivity.
   (K)   Future environmental problems can be avoided if land is developed and
used in compliance with the provisions of an illicit stormwater discharge
subchapter.
(Ord. passed 11-11-05; Am. Res. passed 10-13-11)
§ 154.27 OBJECTIVES.

separate storm sewer system and other community stormwater systems by
stormwater discharges by any user.
      (2)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system and other community stormwater systems.
      (3)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspections,
surveillances, and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with
this subchapter.
      (4)   To encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between humanity and
nature.
      (5)   To protect and maintain the chemical, physical and biological
integrity of any and all waters.
      (6)   To prevent individuals and organizations from causing harm to the
community by activities which adversely affect water resources.
      (7)   To encourage the maintenance and construction of drainage systems
which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems.
      (8)   To encourage town citizens, property owners and visitors to be
aware of potential sources of illicit discharges so they can better manage
their actions in the environment.
      (9)   To protect natural systems and their uses in ways that do not
impair beneficial functioning.
      (10)   To increase and maintain the quality of groundwater sources.
      (11)   To protect and maintain estuarine areas.
      (12)   To prevent damage to waters, including wetlands and groundwater
systems.
      (13)   To protect and maintain fish and wildlife habitats.

(Ord. passed 11-11-05)
§ 154.31 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. For the purpose of this section, beaver dams shall be
construed as debris. Beaver control is the responsibility of the property owner
who shall mitigate beaver related issues in accordance with state and federal
law. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned
structures within it adjacent to a watercourse so that such structures will not
become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. passed 11-11-05; Am. Res. passed 10-13-11)
§ 154.32 REQUIREMENTS TO PREVENT CONTROL AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The town will retain the latest available manual of best management
practices (BMPs) for illustrative purposes for use by those seeking to
appropriately manage stormwater discharges in accordance with this subchapter
or applicable ordinances. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into stormwater
drainage systems or watercourses through the use of structural and
nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises
which is or may be the source of an illicit discharge, shall be required to
implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural or non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of discharge to stormwater drainage
systems or watercourses. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid
NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity shall be enforced by the State of North Carolina. The owner or
operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall prepare a facility-
specific pollution response plan that includes, at a minimum, BMP standards for
spill and release management of the anticipated flows. Sufficient response
equipment shall be kept on site and properly labeled as such. All employees
shall be familiar with the plan and the equipment. Included in the plan shall
be current emergency response numbers for local, state, and federal agencies
required to be notified of spills and releases.

other NPDES permit) shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the town
prior to the allowing of discharges to stormwater drainage systems or
watercourse.
(Ord. 11-11-05)
§ 154.34 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into stormwater
drainage systems or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to
pollutants or waters containing pollutants that cause or contribute to a
violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater.
   (B)   The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to
stormwater drainage systems or watercourses is prohibited except as described
below.
      (1)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this subchapter:
         (a)   Rising ground water.
         (b)   Uncontaminated pumped ground water.
         (c)   Foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems).
         (d)   Crawl space pumps.
         (e)   Other water source not containing pollutants.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the town as being necessary to
protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge but requires a verbal
notification to the town prior to the time of the test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge
permitted under a NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued and
administered under compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver or
order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to stormwater drainage systems or
watercourses.
   (C)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to stormwater drainage systems is prohibited. This prohibition
expressly includes, without limitation, connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practice
applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.

Penalty, see § 154.99
§ 154.35 MONITORING OF DISCHARGE.
   This section applies to all properties that have stormwater discharges.
   (A)   The town shall be permitted to enter and inspect property subject to
regulation under this subchapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has security measures in
force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry onto
property, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the town.
   (B)   Existing NPDES permit operators shall allow the town ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of a NPDES permit
to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as
defined by state and federal law.
   (C)   The town has the right to establish on any permitted property such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the town to conduct monitoring and/
or sampling of the stormwater discharge from the property. Sampling may include
turbidity, conform, nutrients, suspended solids. Other testing devices for
existing systems may include video recording, dye testing or similar
techniques.
   (D)   The town has the right to require NPDES permittees discharging
stormwater to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facilities
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and operating condition by the discharger at his or her expense. All devices
used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
property to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the town and shall not be replaced.
The cost of clearing such access shall be borne by the property owner.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the town access to a permitted
property is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
subchapter. A person who is the operator of a property with a NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the town reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this subchapter.
   (G)   If the town has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any other order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and general
welfare of the community, then the town may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. passed 11-11-05)
§ 154.36 SUSPENSION OF STORMWATER DRAIN ACCESS.
   (A)   The town may, without prior notice, suspend stormwater drain discharge
access to a person or business when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the heath or welfare of persons,
or to stormwater drain systems, or to the waters of the community. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
town may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to
stormwater systems or to the waters of the community, or to minimize damage to
persons.
   (B)   Any person discharging to a stormwater drainage system in violation of
this subchapter may have their stormwater drainage access terminated if such
termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The town will notify
the violator of the proposed termination of its stormwater drainage access. The
violator may petition the town for a reconsideration and hearing.
(Ord. 11-11-05)
§ 154.37 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS OR RELEASE.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting in or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, stormwater system or community waters,
said person shall immediately implement their spill or release containment plan
and take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup
of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said
person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies, town police, fire
and rescue departments, and town offices of the occurrence via emergency
dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said
person shall notify the town in person or by phone or facsimile no later than
the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed
by written notice addressed and mailed to the town within three business days
of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or business establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.

   In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any

§ 154.99 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any development activity that is commenced without prior approval of a
stormwater management plan or is conducted contrary to an approved stormwater
management plan as required by this chapter may be deemed a public health
nuisance and may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner
prescribed by law. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter is
subject to a civil penalty. The penalty shall not be less than $100 nor more
than $1,000. Such person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each day
during which the violation occurs or continues. If the violator does not pay a
civil penalty assessed by the town within 30 days after it is due, the town may
institute a civil action to recover the amount of the penalty assessed in the
Superior Court of Brunswick County. An assessed penalty that is not contested
is due when the violator is served with a notice of violation. An assessment
that is contested is due at the conclusion of the administrative and/or
judicial review of the assessment.
   (B)   Any violator may be required to restore the land disturbed by the
violator to its undisturbed condition. In such cases, the town shall bring an
action for mandatory and/or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement.
Should the violator fail to restore the land in accordance with the court’s
order of abatement, the town may execute the order of abatement and levy a lien
upon the property restored.
   (C)   When the town determines that development activity is not being
carried out in conformance with the requirements of this chapter, a stop work
order and notice of violation shall be issued to the owner of the property. The
notice of violation shall contain:
      (1)   The name and address of the owner or developer.
      (2)   The street address when available or a description of the building
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring.
      (3)   A statement specifying the nature of the violation.
      (4)   A description of the remedial actions necessary to bring the
development into compliance with this chapter and a time schedule for
completion of such remedial action.
      (5)   A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed.
      (6)   A statement that the town’s determination may be appealed to the
Board of Adjustment by filing a written notice of appeal with the town within
15 days of service of the notice of violation.
   (D)   The notice of violation shall be served upon the person to whom it is
directed in any of, or any combination of, the following methods:
      (1)   By personal service upon the violator.
      (2)   By mailing a copy of the notice of violation by certified mail,
postage prepaid, returned receipt requested to such person at his or her last
known address. Notice shall be deemed to be received if no return is received
within ten days of the date of such mailing.
      (3)   By posting a notice in a visible location upon the property where a
violation is or was occurring. Notice of the violation shall be deemed to be
received by the violator immediately upon such posting.
   (E)   A notice of violation issued pursuant to this section constitutes a
determination from which an administrative appeal may be taken to the Board of
Adjustment.
   (F)   No action, inaction or election of remedy shall be construed as a
waiver of the town’s right to enforce any part of this chapter by any and all
remedies provided herein.
