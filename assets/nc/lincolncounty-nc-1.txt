prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the Board of
Commissioners. A supplement to the code shall include all substantive permanent
and general parts of ordinances passed by the Board of Commissioners during the
period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the code. The
pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the

in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it
is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the
codifier may:
      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
      (2)   Provide appropriate catchlines, headings, and titles of sections
and other subdivisions of the code printed in the supplement, and make changes
in those catchlines, headings, and titles;

inserted in the code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change
existing section or other subdivision numbers;
      (4)   Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to
"this chapter," "this subchapter," "this division," and the like, as the case
may be, or to "§§      through      " (inserting section numbers to indicate
the sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the code); and
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the code; but, in no case
shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.
Statutory reference:
   Authority to maintain code by replacement pages, see G.S. § 153A-49
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to the authority granted
to the Board of Commissioners in G.S. §§ 153A-121 and 153A-123.
   (B)   Applicability. Except as otherwise provided herein, the system of
penalties provided for in this section shall apply to any violation of any
county ordinance, unless otherwise prohibited by state law. The provisions of
this section shall not apply to the Lincoln County Fire Prevention and
Protection Ordinance (
Chapter 95 of this code), the penalties under which are hereby restored to the
levels at which they were set prior to the effective date of this section.
   (C)   Enforcement. Violations of county ordinances may be enforced by any
one or more of the remedies authorized by G.S. § 153A-123, including, but not
limited to, the following.
      (1)   Civil penalties; escalation of penalties for continuing violations.
Each day that a violation of a county ordinance continues shall be treated as a
separate violation subject to the accrual of the following civil penalties.
Upon being cited by the applicable ordinance administrator or officer
responsible for enforcement (hereinafter referred to as "enforcement officer")
for a violation of a county ordinance, the violator shall be subject to a civil
penalty of $50 per day for each day that the violation continues unabated for a
period of seven days after the citation is issued. Violations continuing beyond
seven days shall be penalized as follows: $100 per day for the eighth through
the fourteenth days; $150 per day for the fifteenth through the twenty-first
days; $200 per day for the twenty-second through the twenty-eighth days; and
$250 per day for each day that the violation continues beyond the twenty-eighth
day. All the penalties shall render the violator subject to a civil action in
the nature of debt if the violator does not pay the penalty within 20 days
after being notified by the enforcement officer of the accrued total of civil
penalties for the violation for which he or she has been cited. The enforcement
officer shall have the discretion to stay the accrual of civil penalties
hereunder, pending reasonable efforts by the violator to bring into compliance
the condition that is the subject of the violation.
      (2)   Repeat violations. After having been once cited for a violation of
a county ordinance, a violator shall be subject to the following civil
penalties for any additional violations within the following 12-calendar-month
period. For a second violation within the period, civil penalties will begin at
$100 per day for each day that the violation continues and will escalate
according to the following schedule: $150 per day for the eighth through the
fourteenth days; $200 per day for the fifteenth through the twenty-first days;
$250 per day for the twenty-second through the twenty-eighth days; and $300 per
day for each day that the violation continues beyond the twenty-eighth day. A
third violation during the same period shall subject the violator to civil
penalties beginning at $200 per day and escalating in a similar fashion for as
long as the violation continues.
      (3)   Injunctive relief or equitable remedy. Notwithstanding the
assessment of civil penalties as provided above, the county may pursue a civil
action seeking a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement or
other equitable remedy against the violator of a county ordinance. The action
may be in addition to, and not in lieu of, civil penalties.
      (4)   Criminal prosecution. A misdemeanor warrant may be issued either
immediately or upon the issuance of a citation, as provided for herein, and the
violator’s failure to pay the penalty within the time provided. A violation of
a county ordinance upon the issuance of a misdemeanor warrant shall be
punishable as a Class 3 misdemeanor under G.S. § 14-4 unless otherwise stated
herein, by a maximum sentence of 30 days and/or a maximum fine of $500.
   (D)   Enforcement provisions of ordinances amended. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, the enforcement provisions of all county ordinances that are
subject to enforcement as herein provided are hereby amended to be consistent
herewith. The penalties provided for in this section shall be cumulative and in
addition to other penalties that may apply under the provisions of other county
ordinances.
   (E)   Effective date. The provisions of this section shall become effective
on 7-21-2008, and shall apply to all violations of county ordinances for which
citations are issued on or after that date.

WATER CONSERVATION
§ 50.01 DEFINITION OF WATER SHORTAGE; CURTAILMENT OF USE REQUIRED.
   A WATER SHORTAGE shall be deemed to exist when water demand by customers
connected to the county water system reaches the point where, in the opinion of
the County Manager or his or her designee, continued or increased demand will
equal or exceed the system supply or transmission capabilities and results in
the condition whereby customers cannot be supplied with water to protect their
health and safety. WATER SHORTAGES may also be deemed to exist when the
reservoirs and river system that provides the water supply to the county water
system experience such a demand that water systems throughout the area cannot
be supplied with water to meet their needs. Upon the occurrences, demand must
be substantially curtailed to relieve the water shortage as provided in this
subchapter.
(Ord. passed 6-4-2007)
§ 50.02 DECLARATION OF WATER SHORTAGE CONDITION.
   (A)   In the event that it appears that the demand on the water system may
exceed supply or transmission capabilities, or that the demand on the water
supply may exceed its ability to provide sufficient water for all of the water
users, the County Public Works Department shall so notify the County Manager.
   (B)   Following consultation with the Chairperson of the Board of
Commissioners, the County Manager may declare a Stage 0 water shortage watch.
   (C)   If water supply conditions worsen, following consultation with the
Chairperson of the Board of Commissioners, the County Manager may declare a
Stage 1 water shortage condition requesting voluntary water conservation by
customers of the system.
   (D)   In the event that the voluntary measures of the Stage 1 water shortage
condition fail to alleviate the shortage, the County Manager, after
consultation with the Chairperson, may declare that a Stage 2, Stage 3, or
Stage 4 water shortage condition exists and implement the mandatory procedures
provided hereinafter.
(Ord. passed 6-4-2007)
§ 50.03 STAGE 0 WATER SHORTAGE WATCH CONDITION.
   (A)   In the event that a Stage 0 water shortage watch condition is
declared, an extensive publicity campaign will be initiated using public media
and any other methods as the County Manager may deem appropriate or necessary
to inform the public of an impending water shortage.
   (B)   Stage 0 water shortage watch conditions do not encourage any specific
reduction in use of water beyond normal use.
(Ord. passed 6-4-2007)
§ 50.04 STAGE 1 WATER SHORTAGE CONDITION; VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES.
   (A)   In the event that a Stage 1 water shortage condition is declared, an
extensive publicity campaign will be initiated using public media and any other
methods as the County Manager may deem appropriate or necessary to inform the
public of an existing water shortage. The public shall be encouraged to
voluntarily adhere to the following guidelines:
      (1)   Limit car washing;
      (2)   Limit lawn, garden, and shrubbery watering to the minimum necessary
for plants to survive, and reuse household water when possible;
      (3)   Eliminate washing down of outside areas such as sidewalks, patios,
parking lots, service bays, or aprons;
      (4)   Eliminate continuous running of water while shaving or rinsing
dishes;
      (5)   Limit the use of washing machines and dishwashers and operate only

      (8)   Limit hours of operation of water-cooled air conditioners;
      (9)   Use biodegradable and/or disposable dishes;
      (10)   Use flow restriction and other water-saving devices where
possible; and
      (11)   Delay new landscape work until the water shortage has ended.
   (B)   The goal for a Stage 1 water shortage condition is to reduce water
usage by 3% to 5% from a normal level.
(Ord. passed 6-4-2007)
§ 50.05 STAGE 2 WATER SHORTAGE CONDITION; DECLARATION OF MANDATORY
RESTRICTIONS; ILLEGAL ACTS.
   (A)   In determining whether to declare a Stage 2 water shortage condition,
the County Manager shall consider water storage levels, available supply
sources, available usable storage on hand, drawdown rates, projected supply
capability, outlook for precipitation, daily water use patterns, and
availability of water from other sources.
   (B)   Upon the declaration of a Stage 2 water shortage condition, and until

establishments, except upon request;
      (8)   To operate water-cooled air conditioners or other equipment that
does not recycle cooling water, except when health and safety are adversely
affected; and/or
      (9)   To use water for any unnecessary purpose or to intentionally waste
water.
   (C)   The goal for a Stage 2 water shortage condition is to reduce water
usage by 5% to 10% from a normal level.
   (D)   Incidental uses of water (including birdbaths and garden ponds or
pools) that serve pets, livestock, or other animals are hereby exempted from
these restrictions.
   (E)   Violations of this section.

to the offender’s next water bill or recover the penalties in a civil action in
the nature of debt. Offenders who fail to pay any such penalties added onto
their water bills will be subject to disconnection of service as provided in §
50.10.

153A-123, the county may seek a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and/or an
order of abatement commanding the offender to correct the unlawful condition or
cease the unlawful activity.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the
county, and enables the county to comply with all applicable state and federal
laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 C.F.R. pt. 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludges
from the county system;
      (4)   To protect both county personnel who may be affected by sewage,
sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting
the general public;
      (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance, and improvement of the county wastewater system; and
      (6)   To ensure that the county complies with its NPDES or non-discharge
permit conditions, sludge use, and disposal requirements and any other federal
or state laws to which the county wastewater system is subject.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the county wastewater system, through the issuance of permits
to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements
for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires
user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the county wastewater system,
as authorized by G.S. §§ 160A-312 and/or 153A-275. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the POTW Director shall administer, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted to or imposed upon the POTW
Director may be delegated by the POTW Director to other county personnel. By
discharging wastewater into the county wastewater system, industrial users
located outside the county limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions
established in this chapter, as well as any permits, enforcement actions, or
orders issued hereunder.

§ 51.073 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   The municipality may choose to prohibit the discharge of hazardous
waste.
   (B)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. pt. 261. The notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. pt. 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type
of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than
100 kilograms of the waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification
also shall contain the following information to the extent the information is
known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, as estimation of the mass and
concentration of the constituents in the wastestream discharge during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division (B) need to be submitted only
once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
51.069. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
51.065,
51.067, and
51.068.
   (C)   Discharges are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
nonacute hazardous waste in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous waste as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than the quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (D)   In the case of any new regulation under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW Director, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the effective
date of the regulations.
   (E)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous waste generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
   (F)   The provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   (G)   Any violation of this section shall be subject to the penalties as
described in §
51.999 herein.
(Ord. passed 8-22-1994; Ord. passed 3-21-2022)

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 51.090 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The county requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
county may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship
on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   (1)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring/facilities shall be provided in accordance with the county's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.
      (2)   Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written
notification by the county.

§ 51.091 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The county will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the county, approval authority and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The county, approval
authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property the
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the
county, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay,
for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the
POTW Director's, approval authority's, or EPA's access to the user's premises
shall be a violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial
of access.
(Ord. passed 8-22-1994)
§ 51.092 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the POTW Director, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to
a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the county designed to verify compliance
with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the POTW
Director, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from
the County Superior Court.

industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, wastewater permit,
or any prohibition, limitation, or requirements contained therein or any other
pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the
date of this notice, any explanation for the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the county by the user.
Submission of this plans does not relieve the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
The orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to division (D) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this chapter or is in
noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW Director
determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for the action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be
made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §

   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;

provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to

against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
51.015 or the specific prohibitions in §
51.015 if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially

the provision of divisions (B) and (C) below.
   (B)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW Director, at least ten days before the date of

         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) above.
      (2)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Director determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(1) above.

benefits from the availability of the facility. Fees for the use of the
facility shall not exceed the cost of operating the facility and may be imposed
only on those who use the facility.
   (B)   Authority. This chapter is adopted under the authority of G.S.§ 153A-

applied separately for each individual business, store, or other entity within
a commercial enterprise.

however, that this fee shall not apply to solid waste deposited by commercial
and municipal haulers that is collected from residential customers within the

improved property that benefit from the availability of the facility shall be
billed with property taxes pursuant to G.S. § 153A-293 and shall be payable in
the same manner as property taxes, provided, however, that in the event of
nonpayment, the fee shall be collected in any manner in which delinquent
personal or real property taxes can be collected, and that until paid, the fees
imposed shall constitute a lien on the real property described on the bill that
includes the fee. In conjunction with and in the same manner as used for
billing owners for property taxes, the County Tax Administrator shall bill
owners who are not otherwise subject to taxation for the availability fees
imposed by this section.
      (2)   Partial exemption for elderly or disabled owners.  Owners of this
class of residential property described hereinafter shall be liable for only
50% of the availability fee imposed under this chapter. The following class of

eligible applicants.
      (3)   Married applicants residing with their spouses.  For married
applicants residing with their spouses, the disposable income of both spouses
must be included, whether or not the property is registered in both names.
Property owned and occupied by spouses as tenants by the entirety shall be
entitled to the full benefit of this classification if either of them meets the
age or disability requirements herein provided.

disposition of solid waste of all kinds by commercial, municipal, and
industrial users at the facility, the users shall pay the fees charged
hereunder for the use of the facilities at the time of the disposition of the
solid waste products, or shall run an account approved by the Board as defined
in the Operating Procedures Manual, which account shall be payable in full on a
monthly basis. In the event of nonpayment of the monthly account, the privilege
of the monthly account may be suspended, thereby requiring the delinquent user
to pay at the time any further solid waste is deposited at the facility by the
delinquent user. Until the account is fully paid, the suspension, as herein
provided, may remain in full force and effect. The county retains rights to
seek collection of unpaid fees.

GOLF CARTS
§ 71.01 PURPOSE.  
   The purpose of the subchapter shall be to establish a golf cart ordinance
within the county to promote the health, safety and welfare of persons
operating cart(s) within the county, and to protect the safety of their
passengers and other users of roads. Golf carts, if properly used, are an
effective way to travel for short distances within the county. However, to
insure the public safety and welfare, the operation of golf carts must not only
comply with normal regulations intended to protect the operator and passengers
in a vehicle that is primarily designed for operation on a golf course or
recreational purposes, but also to comply with the terms and conditions of this
subchapter. This subchapter establishes the basic, minimum standards of care to
be used by the operators of golf carts on public roads, streets and highways.
Likewise, public safety requires that golf carts, used as a means of
transportation, must also meet certain minimum safety standards that can only
be assured through a system of registration and inspection.
(Ord. 2018-01, passed 12-3-2018; Ord. 2019-2, passed 5-6-2019)

   LIMITED VISIBILITY. Any condition in which visibility is restricted by fog,
mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms or any other similar causes.
   OPERATOR. A person at least 16 years of age.

(Ord. 2018-01, passed 12-3-2018; Ord. 2019-2, passed 5-6-2019)
§ 71.04 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The subchapter establishes guidance in the interest of public safety.
   (A)   Golf carts shall not be operated on or alongside a public road or
street with a posted speed limit greater than 35 miles per hour. The County
Sheriff has designated certain roads that meet the speed limit criteria as
being unsafe for use by golf carts, attached to Ord. 2019-2, as Exhibit “A”.
The Sheriff may add and revise such roads from time to time. In such cases, no
golf cart shall be operated on those designated roads.
   (B)   Golf carts may cross a road with a posted speed limit greater than 35
mph. However, once this segment of road has been traversed, the golf cart is
still required to travel only on or along a roadway with a speed limit of 35
mph or less. Golf carts must cross in a manner that is the most direct route in
order to decrease crossing distance, i.e., no riding along a road or crossing
at an angle. Even if the speed limit is 35 mph or less, golf carts shall not be
operated on any sections of roadway with four or more lanes. Under no
circumstance is a golf cart allowed to cross a control access facility other
than at bridges which cross over or under a control access facility.
   (C)   Any owner of a golf cart shall be responsible for all liability
associated with operation of the golf cart, and must have liability insurance
coverage that will cover the use of a golf cart, in an amount not less than
required by state law for motor vehicles operated on public highways in the
state.
   (D)   Anyone who operates a golf cart must be 16 years of age or older.
   (E)   Any person who operates a golf cart on public streets and roads must
adhere to all applicable state and local laws, regulations and ordinances,
including but not limited to, those banning the possession and use of alcoholic
beverages, and all other illegal drugs. In addition, no golf cart containing
any open container of alcohol shall be operated on public roads.
   (F)   The operator of the golf cart shall comply with all traffic rules and
regulations adopted by the state and the county that govern the operation of
motor vehicles.
   (G)   An operator shall not allow the number of people in the golf cart at
any one time to exceed the maximum capacity specified by the manufacturer. The
operator shall not allow passengers to ride on any part of a golf cart not
designed to carry passengers, such as the part of the golf cart designed to
carry golf bags; this is included only as an example and is not an exhaustive
list.
   (H)   An operator shall operate the golf cart at a speed which is the lesser
of either:
      (1)   Twenty miles per hour; or
      (2)   The speed that is reasonable and prudent for the existing
conditions.
   (I)   Golf carts must be operated at the right edge of the roadway and the
operator thereof must yield to all vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
   (J)   Operators must park golf carts in designated spaces in such a manner
that multiple golf carts can utilize the space. All parking rules and limits
apply. No parking on sidewalks is allowed.
   (K)   Golf carts must have basic equipment supplied by the manufacturer,
including a vehicle identification or serial number. Required equipment must
include: a rearview mirror, two headlights and two tail lights permanently
affixed if the golf cart is operated under any conditions of limited
visibility, and a rear triangle reflector of the same type required by state
law.
   (L)   If a mechanical turn signal indicator is not installed on a golf cart,
then the operator must use hand signals for turns.
   (M)   Violation. Any violation of this section shall be punishable as an
infraction, and shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $50 as provided
in G.S. § 14-4.

§ 90.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to encourage alarm users and alarm
companies to properly use and maintain the operational effectiveness of alarm
systems and to reduce or eliminate false alarms; thereby reducing unnecessary
use of limited Sheriff's Office resources and hidden costs associated with
investigating alarms that are false.
   (B)   This section governs alarm systems intended to summon a law
enforcement officer response, establishes fees, provides penalties for
violations, establishes a system of administration, and sets conditions for the
suspension of response or revocation of registration.
(Ord. passed 11-5-2012)
§ 90.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALARM SIGNAL. A detectable signal, either audible or visual, generated by an
alarm system, to which the Sheriff's Office may respond.
   ALARM SYSTEM.
      (1)   Any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the
occurrence of an illegal entry or other activity requiring immediate attention
and to which the Sheriff's Office responds, but does not include alarms
installed in motor vehicles or fire box alarms accessible to or able to be
activated by the general public.
      (2)   Further, alarm systems that are operated by the county, state or
federal government and installed on premises occupied or used by such entities
for governmental purposes (including schools) shall not be subject to this
chapter. The categories of alarms for which a Sheriff's Office response may be
requested for purposes of this chapter may include, but not necessarily be
limited to, burglary, holdup, robbery, duress, panic, fire or smoke.
   ALARM SYSTEMS COORDINATOR. The County Manager of Lincoln County or designee.
   ALARM USER. Any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, or any
other entity owning or leasing an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm
system is maintained for the protection of such premises.
   AUTOMATIC DIAL PROTECTION. An automatic dialing device or an automatic
telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system, which, upon being
activated, automatically initiates to the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office or to
the designated communications center a recorded message or code signal
indicating a need for Sheriff's Office response. This does not apply to a life
safety alert system utilizing residential transmitting equipment designated for
direct or indirect telephone access to dedicated control receiving equipment.
   DEFENSES TO FALSE ALARMS. An alarm user may raise, as an affirmative defense
to a false alarm service fee assessment, that a false alarm was caused by
action of the telephone company, telephone line outage, power outage lasting
longer than the life of a fully charged battery, or other extraordinary
circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user, subscriber
or proprietor alarm owner.
   FALSE ALARM.
      (1)   The activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic
failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm
user, his employees or agents, and signals activated to summon Sheriff's Office
personnel, which revealed upon inspection by the responding officer no evidence
indicating an entry without authorization, robbery, or that such other crime
was attempted in or on or against the premises, nor any evidence of fire or
smoke which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.
      (2)   A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be
determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of
nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably
subject to control by the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an
alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the
alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the user's alarm company
and/or the Communications Center. An alarm is not considered false as it
relates to this section, when said alarm is activated within five days of
initially becoming operable.
   SHERIFF. The Sheriff of Lincoln County or designee.
(Ord. passed 11-5-2012)
§ 90.03 RESPONSE TO ALARM; DETERMINATION OF VALIDITY.
   (A)   Sheriff's Office response. Whenever an alarm is activated in the
county and the Sheriff's Office responds, the investigating officer on the
scene of the activated alarm system shall inspect the area and shall determine
whether the Sheriff response was in fact necessary as indicated by the alarm
system or whether the alarm was false as defined by this chapter.
   (B)   Notification. If the investigating officer at the scene of the
activated alarm system determines the alarm to be false, the officer shall have
a notation added to the county's computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system of the
false alarm and the alarm system coordinator, or designee, shall notify the
owner by first-class mail.
(Ord. passed 11-5-2012)
§ 90.04 REVIEW OF FALSE ALARM DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Request for review. The alarm systems coordinator or designee shall,
when requested by an alarm user, review the determination that an alarm was
false. The alarm user requesting such review shall provide the following
information in writing:
      (1)   Alarm user's name;
      (2)   Address at which alarm is installed;
      (3)   Date of false alarm that is being contested;
      (4)   Facts upon which request for review of the false alarm
determination is made;
      (5)   Specific defenses to the false alarm assessment.
   (B)   The alarm system coordinator shall notify the owner of his decision in
writing within a reasonable time.
(Ord. passed 11-5-2012)
§ 90.05 SERVICE CHARGE ASSESSMENT FOR FALSE ALARMS.
   (A)   Excessive false alarms. It is hereby found and determined that four or
more false alarms within any 12-month period is excessive and constitutes a
public nuisance. (Only one false alarm per calendar day will be assessed for
each alarm system, upon finding common cause. COMMON CAUSE is defined as a
technical difficulty or malfunction causing the system to generate a series of
false alarms, all of which occurs within a calendar day. The series of false
alarms shall be counted as one false alarm only if the cause of the series of
alarms is repaired before generating additional false alarms during the next
24-hour calendar day.)
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   (a)   All excessive false alarms within a 12-month period shall be
charged the fines and charges set out below, which shall be considered a bill
owed by the alarm user to the county and may be collected from the alarm user
as a civil penalty. Each service charge incurred for false alarms at the
premises shall be paid within 30 days from the date of receipt of the invoice.
Failure to pay any such charge, bill or fee shall result in discontinuance of
Sheriff's Office response.
         (b)   Eligibility for Sheriff's Office response to alarm calls will be
made upon receipt of any prior unpaid, civil penalties assessed pursuant to
this section and receipt of the applicable charges as set forth below:
 
Number of False Alarms Penalty
4th through 5th        $25 per occurrence
6th through 8th        $50 per occurrence
9th through 11th       $100 per occurrence
12th or more           $200 per occurrence
 
   (C)   Year. For the purposes of this section, a year shall mean a 12-month

   (D)   Discontinuance of Sheriff's Office response. The failure of an alarm
user to make payment of any service charge imposed under this section within 30
days from the date of receipt on invoice shall result in discontinuance of
Sheriff's Office response to alarms that may occur at the premises described,
until payment is received. (With exception of receiving a separate indication
that there is a crime or incident in progress the premises, requiring a
Sheriff's Office response such as holdup alarm; panic alarm; duress alarm; or
other alarm indicating an authorized person(s) is on the premises and
intentionally activating the alarm to cause a Sheriff's Office response.)
   (E)   Responsibility to pay service fees or penalties subject to this
section shall be the responsibility of the alarm subscriber or alarm user,
jointly and severally. The owner of a proprietor alarm shall be solely
responsible.
   (F)   Penalty. Any violation of this section shall be subject to the

discretion for extensions of time if that is reasonable in view of the good-
faith progress of the owner in implementing the preventive measures.

§ 93.04 NUMBERING SYSTEM.
   (A)   All roads, whether public or private, shall be numbered uniformly and
consecutively along the roadway centerline. Numbers shall be assigned along the
entirety of all roads.
   (B)   The origin point of the numbering system shall be located at the
Lincoln County Courthouse Building, where the Old U.S. Highway 321 and North
Carolina Highway 27 radiate from the Courthouse Square.
   (C)   The Old U.S. Highway 321 is hereby designated as the north/south
baseline and the North Carolina Highways 27 and 73 are designated as the east/
west baseline for the numbering system.
   (D)   All roads having a north/south orientation will be numbered from the
east/west baseline. All roads having an east/west orientation will be numbered
from the north/south baseline.
   (E)   All roads, both public and private, shall be named and numbered if
three or more addressable structures, including mobile homes, are located on
and accessed by them. At the discretion of the Ordinance Administrator roads
with two addressable structures may be named and numbered upon request by the
residents along the road.
   (F)   (1)   The initial number for a road shall be determined by measuring
the perpendicular distance in feet between the appropriate baseline (division
(C) above) and the nearest terminus of the road, dividing this distance by 25,
rounding to the nearest integer, multiplying by two, and adding 100 to this
product:
         (a)   I = (2 * INT((1.5D - 0.0000065D2)/20)) + 100; and
         (b)   Where:
            1.   D = perpendicular distance to appropriate baseline;
            2.   I = initial number for the road; and
            3.   INT(D/20) = round to the nearest integer.
      (2)   The Ordinance Administrator shall have the authority to adjust the
initial number for a road to prevent the duplication of addresses along a mail
delivery route or within a postal district. The Ordinance Administrator shall
also have the authority to make adjustments from time to time as needed in the
formula stated in this section.
   (G)   A pair of natural numbers shall be assigned for each 20 feet of
roadway centerline. Odd-natural numbers shall be assigned to the left side of
the road in the direction of increasing numbers (movement away from the
baseline or origin). Even-natural numbers shall be assigned to the right side
of the road in the direction of increase.
   (H)   One block shall be 1,000 feet in length along the roadway centerline
(50 twenty-foot sections), and shall consist of 100 consecutive numbers.
   (I)   For numbering purposes, road orientation (north/south or east/west)
shall be based on the overall direction of gain between the terminus points of
the road. If the road is oriented at or near 45 degrees to the baselines, the
Ordinance Administrator shall determine the orientation of the roadway in
accordance with his or her best judgment.
   (J)   The county numbering system shall take precedence over all other

§ 93.05 ROAD NAMING.
   (A)   The Ordinance Administrator shall have sole authority to approve road
names for new development within the county, subject to the requirements
herein.
   (B)   Names for proposed or newly constructed roads may be submitted by the
owner or developer for approval by the Ordinance Administrator. However, in the
event that a proposed or newly constructed road crosses over property not owned
by the submitting owner or developer, then a petition to name the proposed road
must be submitted in accordance with the provisions as set forth in §
93.10 of this chapter.
   (C)   The Ordinance Administrator shall maintain a database of existing road
names, such that duplicate, sound-alike, and deceptively similar road names are
neither assigned nor approved.
   (D)   Road names shall be chosen that relate to the scale, location, and
history of a project area.
   (E)   Road names shall be pleasant sounding, appropriate, easy to read, and
should add pride to home ownership.
   (F)   Large developments should use a single, significant category for road
naming; small developments should use the same category within the immediate
vicinity, which helps establish location identity.
   (G)   Numerical names; alphabetical names; and frivolous, complicated, or
undesirable names are unacceptable. Compound names shall be used rarely and
shall not be used for short roads.
   (H)   The following road name suffixes are allowed: Avenue (AVE), Boulevard
(BLVD), Circle (CIR), Court (CT), Drive (DR), Highway (HWY), Lane (LN), Loop
(LOOP), Parkway (PKY), Place (PL), Road (RD), Street (ST), Trail (TRL), and Way
(WAY). Private roads shall be assigned the suffix Trail, Lane, or Way. All
other suffixes shall be reserved for public roads. If a suffix is used which is
not listed herein, the standard applied for the suffix will be obtained from
Appendix C of the Postal Addressing Standards Publication 28, November 1997, as
revised.
   (I)   Roads that cross either baseline shall bear different names on each
side of the baseline to avoid duplicating addresses along that road, and to
preserve the integrity of the county's numbering system.
   (J)   Each road shall bear the same name and uniform numbering as outlined
herein, along the entirety of the road. Exclusions from this standard shall
include the following:
      (1)   Split routes, also known as "dog-leg" or offset intersections.
Split routes shall be treated as separate roads with different names and
numbering to preserve the integrity and continuity of the numbering system; and
      (2)   Impasses or sections of a road that are impassable. Different names
and numbering ranges shall be assigned to each portion of the road on either
side of the impasse to preserve the integrity and continuity of the numbering
system and to prevent efforts in the dispatch of emergency services.
   (K)   Existing roads that are extended shall carry the same road name and
numbering order as the road from which they are extended. An example of this
would be a road extended through a cul-de-sac into a new, existing, or
additional phase of a subdivision. Extensions of roads that change the
character of the road (for example, changing a dead end to a connecting street
or road) shall be the responsibility of the developer making the extension, and
the developer shall bear all costs associated with any changes that may be
necessitated by the extension.

§ 93.06 ADDRESSING.
   (A)   Each structure shall be assigned a structure number based on the
number of the appropriate segment of roadway centerline. The structure number
shall be determined by the line perpendicular to the road centerline, which
intersects the main access or entrance to the structure. The number of the
centerline segment at the point of perpendicular intersection shall be the
number of the structure.
   (B)   If development on a private road exceeds the minimum structure
regulation (see §
93.04(E)), the road shall be named and numbered and structures re-addressed
according to the requirements herein. In such event, the petition process (as
set forth in §
93.10) shall be followed.
   (C)   One structure number shall be assigned to each structure whose units
share a common building entrance or parking area.
      (1)   Each unit within the structure shall be assigned a unit designator
such as "suite."
      (2)   Allowed unit designators include apartment numbers for apartments,
and numbers for commercial buildings.
      (3)   The unit designator shall be a number, and shall not include
alphabetic characters.
   (D)   A unique structure number shall be assigned to each unit within a
structure which provides individual driveway access to each unit.
   (E)   Mobile homes shall be assigned individual street addresses in
accordance with the requirements herein. No unit designator shall be allowed in
the address of mobile homes.
   (F)   Unit designators shall be assigned in a logical manner, with
increasing unit numbers corresponding to increasing road centerline numbering
as much as possible.
   (G)   The road name shall be the name of the road from which a structure is
numbered.
(Ord. passed 4-16-2001; Ord. 2010-18, passed 12-6-2010 ; Ord. passed 3-21-2022)
§ 93.07 POSTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Within 90 days after written notification by the Ordinance
Administrator of the assignment of or change of structure number for any
structure, the owner of the structure shall post the assigned structure number
in compliance with the requirements herein.
   (B)   All structure numbers shall be constructed of a durable material. The
color shall contrast with the color scheme of the structure and, if mounted on
glass, shall contrast with the background and be clearly visible.
   (C)   The minimum number size for a typical single-family or duplex
residential structure shall be three inches in height.
   (D)   The minimum number size for all other structures shall be six inches
in height.
   (E)   In all cases, a number size larger than the minimum size may be
required in any instance where the minimum size does not provide adequate
identification, as deemed appropriate by the Ordinance Administrator.
   (F)   For single-family residential or duplex structures, the structure
number shall be posted and maintained within a three-foot perimeter of the
front entrance of the structure, in a location visible and readable from the
road. As an alternative, the structure number may be posted on the mailbox for
the residence as long as the mailbox is located on the same side of the road as
the residence, and as long as the mailbox is a standalone box and is not in a
cluster of mailboxes. In such instance, the structure number must be
constructed of a reflective material and must be a minimum of three inches in
height.
   (G)   For all other structures, the structure number shall be posted on a
building face most readily visible from the road from which the number is
assigned. Unit designators shall be posted at each unit within a three-foot
perimeter of the front entrance of the unit.
   (H)   In the event that a structure or its posted number is not visible from
the road from which its number is assigned, as determined by the Ordinance
Administrator, the assigned structure number shall also be posted on the
property adjacent to the road at or near every driveway or access to the
structure, as deemed appropriate by the Ordinance Administrator. Again, as an
alternative the structure number may be posted on the mailbox for the
residence, as long as the mailbox is located on the same side of the road as
the residence and as long as the mailbox is a standalone box and is not in a
cluster of mailboxes. In such instance, the structure number must be
constructed of a reflective material and must be a minimum of three inches in
height.
   (I)   Following the posting of the assigned number as required herein, the
owner shall maintain the structure number at all times in compliance with the
requirements of this section. Structure numbers and unit designators, as viewed
from the public road, shall not be obstructed from view by landscaping, shrubs,
vegetation, saw doors, canopies, or any other plant or structure.
   (J)   For all waterborne structures, with the exception of community
boatslips, the street address assigned to the structure (including number and
road name) with which the dock or pier is associated shall be posted on a sign
on the waterborne improvement at the highest accessible point. If an addressed
structure does not exist on the parcel, then an address shall be assigned to
the waterborne structure. At such a time that a structure is placed on the
parcel, the structure shall inherit the assigned address. The street address
should be clearly visible from the water, with reflectivity to ensure
visibility at night. The minimum size of the sign containing the street address
shall be 12 inches in height and 18 inches in length, or 18 inches in height
and 12 inches in length. The sign shall be non-reflective blue in color and
contain reflective white lettering in a sans serif font, which should be a
minimum of two inches in height.
   (K)   Penalty. Violation of this section shall be punishable as a Class 3
misdemeanor, and any person convicted of the violation shall be subject to
punishment as provided in G.S. § 14-4. Each day a violation continues shall be
deemed a separate offense, and said violation may also be enforced as set forth
in §
93.99 herein.

   (D)   Nuisance burning.
      (1)   If, at any time during the burning, the smoke and/or odors create a
neighborhood nuisance by causing physical irritation exacerbating a documented
medical condition, visibility impairment, evidence of soot or ash on a property
or structure other than the property on which the burning is done, the smoke
and odors do not rise, hang close to the ground, cross a street or highway and
cause a hazard, and three or more separate businesses or homes complain, the
burning shall be ceased and all fires will be extinguished.
      (2)   If, at any time during the burning, the regulations regarding open
burning are not met or are neglected in any way, the fire shall be

§ 95.061 CIVIL CITATION FEES.
   (A)   State-certified fire inspectors of the County Fire Marshal’s office
are empowered to issue notices of violation and civil citations when they have
reasonable cause to believe that any person or business has violated any
provision of the NCFC, as amended, or this chapter. The notice of violation or
civil citation may be delivered in person to the violator or, if the violator
cannot be readily found, the notice of violation or civil citation may be
mailed by certified mail. The notice of violation or civil citation shall
specify the penalty to be imposed on the violator, and shall direct the

§ 95.076 FIRE HYDRANTS.
   (A)   No person shall remove, tamper with, paint (change the color of the
hydrant so that it does not meet the NFPA standards for hydrant marking), or
render any fire hydrant inoperative or inaccessible, except as may be necessary
during emergencies, maintenance, drills, training, prescribed testing, or when
permitted by the Fire Official.
   (B)   No person shall place or keep any fence, growth (trees, flowers,
shrubs, plants, and the like), stones, signs, trash, or other material near any
fire hydrant that would prevent it from being immediately discernible or in any
other manner hinder the Fire Department from gaining immediate access to it. A
clear space of not less than three feet shall be provided on all sides of a
fire hydrant.
   (C)   No person shall park a vehicle, boat, trailer, or any other item, or
permit it to stand, whether attended or unattended, within 15 feet in either
direction of a fire hydrant.
   (D)   Hydrants to be used as fire protection shall have as a minimum of two
two-and-one-half-inch outlets and one five-inch outlet. This would allow the
minimum requirements of the Insurance Service Office. Whenever possible, pipe
systems should be arranged in loops. The County Public Works Department will be
in charge of making the decision on the minimum water supply piping size to
ensure the necessary water pressure needed to meet the water flow requirements
at the hydrant. The size of the pipe is recommended to be as follows: (1) that
no pipe less than six inches in diameter is to be used as a main water supply
line; (2) no less than a six-inch pipe is to be used for two-outlet hydrants or
to supply the hydrant from the main; (3) eight-inch or larger pipe is to be
used if it is a dead-end main or if more than one hydrant is to be supplied;
and (4) 11-inch or larger pipe is to be used for the primary main as much as
possible. Hydrants should be set plumb, with the centerline of their outlets
about 18 inches above the ground. When hydrants are installed before grading is
complete, the final grade line and accessibility should be considered.
   (E)   Although the installation of fire hydrants is usually performed by
Public Works Department personnel, the Public Works Department shall confirm
with the Fire Marshal’s office the location, spacing, and distribution of fire
hydrants. This will ensure that NFPA standards and Insurance Service Office
requirements are met. By meeting these two requirements, the county will be
providing the most adequate water supply for fire protection for the citizens
of the county who live and work in that area. The maximum distance between
hydrants shall not exceed 1,000 feet. In closely-built areas, subdivisions,
townhouses, commercial/industrial with lot frontage 100 feet or less, 500 feet
or less will be the maximum distant between hydrants. Hydrants should be
located as close as possible to streets and intersections. Hydrants located in
areas subject to heavy traffic need protection against damage from collision.
(Hydrants must be inspected and approved prior to final plot approval.)
   (F)   Due to requirements by the Insurance Rating Services and other
requirements by the insurance industry, all hydrants shall be serviced a
minimum of once a year; twice a year, if possible, is the recommended service
schedule. The Public Works Department, fire departments, and the Fire Marshal’s
office will be overseeing this section. The following is a list of guidelines
to go by to perform those requirements:
      (1)   Clean around the hydrant (this would include removing weeds and the
like);
      (2)   Remove small caps and check gaskets in caps (rotate or replace as
necessary);
      (3)   Open the hydrant slowly and flush the hydrant with caps off;
      (4)   Close the hydrant slowly. (Do not over-tighten the hydrant when
closing);
      (5)   Brush or clean hydrant cap threads as needed and lubricant the cap
threads;
      (6)   Oil the hydrant. (The lubricant used to oil hydrant and cap threads
will be a food grade grease);
      (7)   Replace caps and energize (open slowly) the hydrant. Completely
open the hydrant slowly and wait ten to 15 seconds before closing the hydrant;
      (8)   Check for any leaks;
      (9)   Close the hydrant slowly;
      (10)   Fill out proper paperwork (hydrant maintenance sheet). Make any
notes of work that needs to be done; and
      (11)   Proceed to the next hydrant.
   (G)   Fire flow testing and marking of hydrants (when flow testing is
performed, the Public Works Department must be notified). Fire flow tests are
conducted on water distribution systems to determine the rate of flow available
at various locations for firefighting purposes. An additional benefit derived
from fire flow tests is the indication of possible deficiencies (such as
tuberculation of piping or closed valves, or both), which can be corrected to
ensure adequate fire flows as needed.
      (1)   Flow tests.
         (a)   All hydrants in each fire district shall be flow tested.
         (b)   All equipment used and the testing procedure need shall be done
by NFPA standards.
      (2)   Marking of hydrants. Once all flow tests have been completed and
the flows for each hydrant have been determined, then each hydrant will need to
be marked according to NFPA standards.
      (3)   Public hydrants.
         (a)   All barrels are to be chrome yellow, except in cases where
another color has already been adopted (for hydrants maintained by the County
Water Department, the barrels will be painted with a reflective-type, bright
yellow paint). The tops and nozzle caps should be painted with the following
capacity, indicating the color scheme to provide simplicity and consistency
with colors used in signal work for safety, danger, and intermediate condition:
 
Class AA (1,500 gpm or greater)  Light blue
Class A (1,000 gpm to 1,499 gpm) Green
Class B (500 gpm to 999 gpm)     Orange
Class C (less than 500 gpm)      Red
 
         (b)   For rapid identification at night, the top of the hydrant and
the caps shall be marked with a reflective-type material.
      (4)   Private hydrants. All private hydrants (yard hydrants) within
private enclosures shall be painted solid red, with caps colored coded as
required. When private hydrants are located on public streets, they shall be
painted solid red, with caps colored coded as required to distinguish them from
public hydrants. See reference manual for private hydrant-marking procedures.

§ 95.077 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISCLOSURE.
   (A)   Generally. Hazardous materials disclosure shall be as specified in
G.S. §§ 95-173 through 95-218.
   (B)   Hazard identification signs.
      (1)   The increasing use of a wide variety of chemicals, many of which
introduce problems other than flammability, lead to the need for a simple
hazard identification system. The purpose of such a system would be to
safeguard the lives of those individuals who may be concerned with fire and
spills occurring in these facilities or businesses. This system provides
simple, readily recognizable and easily understood markings, which will give,
at a glance, a general idea of the inherent hazards of any material and the
order of severity of these hazards as they relate to fire prevention, exposure,
and control. Its objectives are to provide an appropriate alerting signal and
on-the-spot information to safeguard the lives of the Fire Department, rescue
squad, EMS members, and law enforcement during emergencies at these facilities.
It will also make employees aware of the potential hazards and bring the
facility into compliance with the Hazardous Chemicals Right to Know Act.
      (2)   The 704 symbols are usually seen on the exterior surfaces of
buildings and aboveground storage tanks. The 704 symbols shall be required to
identify any area that is deemed to be a hazard. This determination is to be
made by the Fire Marshal.
         (a)   Signs required. Per the fire code, hazard and identification
signs as outlined in NFPA 704 shall be placed accordingly at all entrances to
and in locations where hazardous materials are stored, handled, or used in
excess of the exempt amounts.
         (b)   Size and type of signs. The size and type of signs used to
identify hazardous materials shall be of the type and size specified in NFPA
standard. A reference guide on the sizes of signs and signals will be made
available to the public from the Fire Marshal’s office upon request.
            1.   The NFPA adopted the 704 system of identifying hazardous
materials in 1961.
            2.   The 704 system provides hazards as they relate to fire
prevention, fire exposure, and fire control.
            3.   The colors, which are diamond shaped, indicate the following
type hazards:
               a.   Blue - Health;
               b.   Red - Flammability of the products;
               c.   Yellow - Reactivity of products; and
               d.   White - Specific information entered here.
            4.   Numbers range from zero through four and are inserted on the
diamond-shaped colors (blue, red, and yellow) to indicate the degree of hazards
present, with zero being the least hazardous and four being the most hazardous.
            5.   Notations are also used in the white diamond to indicate
special hazards. Materials demonstrating unusual reactivity with water shall be
identified with the letter “W” with a horizontal line through the center of the
“W.” Materials possessing oxidizing properties shall be identified by the
letters “OXY”. Materials possessing radioactivity hazards shall be identified
by the standard radioactivity symbol.
            6.   Symbols are indicated for the most dangerous hazardous
material when more than one type of hazardous material is present.
            7.   Although 704 symbols are subject to change, depending on
changes in the area of storage or use of hazardous materials, they should be
removed from an area only when hazardous materials are no longer present.
            8.   Symbols should be located where they can be readily seen by
responding fire departments and other emergency agencies, and as near as is
practical to the area of the hazard.
            9.   The sign must be easily seen from the roadway. The sign must
be a minimum of 30 by 30 inches in size (type and size specified in NFPA
standard).
            10.   A current Material Safety Data Sheet for all chemicals stored
on the property should be put in a waterproof container located near the
entrance to the property.
            11.   The owners of the business will be given 30 days from date of
inspection to comply.
            12.   Hazardous materials that, when mixed, react violently, or
evoke toxic vapors or gases, or that, in combination, become hazardous by
reason of toxicity, oxidizing power, flammability
or other properties, shall be separated from each other in storage by distance,
partitions or other approved manner so as to preclude accidental contact
between them.
            13.   The Fire Marshal may require warning signs wherever hazardous
materials are stored, processed, or handled. The warning signs shall be
conspicuously lettered in accordance with NFPA standard.
            14.   This section shall not apply to hazardous materials in
transport, which are placarded in accordance with Department of Transportation
regulations, or applicable provisions of other NFPA codes and standards listed
in the NFPA manuals.
   (C)   Warning signs required in coin-operated, dry-cleaning establishments.
Each coin-operated, dry-cleaning establishment using the solvent known as
“perchloroe-thylene” shall display, prominently upon or near each dry-cleaning
machine, a sign warning the public of the danger of excessive solvent vapor
inhalation, or that prolonged or repeated contact of skin or eyes can be

management of environmental issues as the county faces growth in the coming
years. It is the policy of this county to conserve, protect, and encourage the
development, improvement, and preservation of its agriculture land and forest
land for the production of food, fiber, and other products. When other land
uses extend into agricultural and forest areas, agricultural and forestry
operations often become the subject of nuisance suits. It is the purpose of
this subchapter to reduce potential nuisance suits by providing advance notice
to surrounding landowners of the presence of enhanced agricultural districts
and to encourage the preservation and protection of farm land from nonfarm
development, recognizing the importance of agriculture to the economic and
cultural life of the county.

§ 150.036 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses.
      (1)   Except as specifically provided in divisions (A)(1)(a) through (A)
(1)(c) below, no material change shall be made in the use of land, and no
structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established,
in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for
and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If the determination is in the affirmative, the
permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions
of this subchapter shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in
accordance with division (D) below.
         (a)   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
70 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain,
land contour, or topographic features, the tree or structure would extend above
the height limits prescribed for the zones.
         (b)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 70 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when the tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for the approach zones.
         (c)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for
any tree or structure less than 70 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when the tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or
topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the
transition zones.
      (2)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree, in excess of any of the height limits
established by this subchapter, except as set forth in §
150.033(B)(5). In the event a tree is allowed to grow in excess of the height
limits established by this subchapter, except as set forth in §
150.033(B)(5), the tree shall be removed, topped, trimmed, or otherwise
modified to bring into compliance with this subchapter. If the County Manager
or his or her designee determines that the tree adversely affects the safe use
of the airport, the county will pay for the direct cost to remove, top, trim,
or otherwise modify the tree to bring into compliance with this subchapter.
   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an airport obstruction that is a hazard to air
navigation or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a
greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this
subchapter, or any amendments thereto, or that it is when the application for a
permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall
be granted.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the County Manager
determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more
than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow the structure or tree to exceed the applicable height
limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (D)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this subchapter, may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance from the regulations. The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. The
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard
to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with
the spirit of this subchapter. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this subchapter may be considered by the Board of Adjustment
unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the County Manager for
advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the County Manager
does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the Board of
Adjustment may act on its own to deny the application.
   (E)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if the action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the Lincolnton-Lincoln
County Regional Airport Authority, at its own expense, to install, operate, and
maintain thereon the marking and lights as may be necessary.
   (F)   Permits. The Director of Development Services (the “Director”) shall
review all applications for development to ensure compliance with all
regulations of this subchapter. All applications shall be complete prior to
review by the Director. The Director, in his or her discretion, may request
that additional information be submitted as necessary to ensure a thorough and
complete review of the application. All applications shall be submitted with a
nonrefundable fee in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the Board of
Commissioners.
   (G)   Penalty. Any person found to be in violation of this subchapter shall
be subject to the penalties as provided in UDO § 11.2.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has in G.S. Chapter 143, Article 21, Part 6; G.S. §
153A-121; and G.S. § 160D-923, delegated to local governmental units the
responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners does ordain
as follows.
(Ord. passed 8-6-2007; Ord. passed 3-21-2022)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the county are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 8-6-2007)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve the uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 8-6-2007)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges)
that are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special
Flood Hazard Area.

not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual START
OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects

the reference level elevation, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the
reference level, in relation to mean sea level. Any work done within the seven-
day calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at
the permit holder's risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
certificate data submitted. Deficiencies detected by the review shall be
corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further work being
permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
         (c)   A final as-built elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is
required after construction is completed and prior to certificate of
compliance/occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of final as-built
construction of the elevation of the reference level and all attendant
utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by the review shall be corrected by the permit
holder immediately and prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy issuance.
In some instances, another certification may be required to certify corrected
as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate
of compliance/occupancy.
      (2)   Floodproofing certificate. If nonresidential floodproofing is used
to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a floodproofing
certificate (FEMA Form 81-65), with supporting data, an operational plan, and
an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start of
any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the floodproofed design
elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to
mean sea level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by
same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data, the
operational plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies
detected by the review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit
approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required
corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to
construct in accordance with the certified design shall be cause to withhold
the issuance of a certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (3)   Foundation certificate. If a manufactured home is placed within
Zone A, AO, AE, or A1-30 and the elevation of the chassis is more than 36
inches in height above grade, an engineered foundation certification is
required in accordance with the provisions of §
151.56(B)(3)(b).
      (4)   Watercourse. If a watercourse is to be altered or relocated, a
description of the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation; a
professional engineer's certified report on the effects of the proposed project
on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the effects to properties
located both upstream and downstream; and a map showing the location of the
proposed watercourse alteration or relocation shall all be submitted by the
permit applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit.
      (5)   Exemptions. The following structures, if located within Zone A, AO,
AE, or A1-30, are exempt from the elevation/floodproofing certification
requirements specified in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above:
         (a)   Recreational vehicles meeting requirements of §
151.56(B)(6)(a);
         (b)   Temporary structures meeting requirements of §
151.21(B)(7); and
         (c)   Accessory structures less than 150 square feet meeting
requirements of §
151.56(B)(8).

this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach any conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that the construction below
the Base Flood Elevation increases risks to life and property, and that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the Base Flood Elevation
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per $100
of insurance coverage. The notification shall be maintained with a record of
all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the state upon request.
   (I)   Conditions for variances:
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances;

the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation shall apply.
   (C)   Penalty. Any person found to be in violation of this subchapter shall
be subject to the penalties as provided in UDO § 11.2.
(Ord. passed 8-6-2007; Ord. passed 3-21-2022)
§ 151.56 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   (A)   Generally. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where Base Flood
Elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in §§
151.21 or
151.57, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
151.55, are required.
   (B)   Specifically.
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall
have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05. Structures located in A, AE, AO, and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall certify that the standards of this division (B)(2) are
satisfied. The certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator
as set forth in §
151.41(C), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
      (3)   Manufactured homes.
         (a)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05.
         (b)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State Regulations for Manufactured Homes adopted by the
Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15. Additionally, when the
elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above
the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or
engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in
height, an engineering certification is required.
         (c)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (B)(4) below.
         (d)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
      (4)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
         (a)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall
only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of the enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
         (b)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials; and/
or
         (c)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
            2.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
            3.   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
            4.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
            5.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
            6.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      (5)   Additions/improvements.
         (a)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:

improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more nonconforming than the existing structure; and/or
            2.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         (b)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction; and
         (c)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
            1.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; and/or
            2.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (6)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or
         (b)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
      (7)   Temporary nonresidential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of the structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood, or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
         (a)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. The time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
         (b)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual

entity responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
         (e)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the Special Flood Hazard Area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
      (8)   Accessory structures.
         (a)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, and the
like) are to be placed within a Special Flood Hazard Area, the following
criteria shall be met:
            1.   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas);
            2.   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
            3.   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood
damage potential;
            4.   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
            5.   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance
with the provisions of §
151.55(B)(1);
            6.   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed
in accordance with the provisions of §
151.55(B)(4); and
            7.   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation in conformance with the provisions of division (B)(4)(c) above.
         (b)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square
feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation
or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with §
151.41(C).
   (C)   Penalty. Any person found to be in violation of this subchapter shall

following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
151.55 shall apply.
   (B)   Specifically.
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20
feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream,
whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria.
         (a)   When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within the areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in §§
151.55 and
151.56.
         (b)   When floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other
source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway areas
shall also comply with the requirements of §§
151.56 and
151.59.
         (c)   All subdivision, manufactured home park, and other development
proposals shall provide Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. The
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance
with §
151.21 and utilized in implementing this chapter.
         (d)   When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be

§ 152.05 MANDATORY STANDARDS FOR LAND-DISTURBING ACTIVITY.
   No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this chapter shall be
undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards.
   (A)   Buffer zone; standard buffer. No land-disturbing activity during
periods of construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity
to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the
margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation
within the 25% of the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity.
      (1)   Projects on, over, or under water. This division (A) shall not
apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of
facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse.
      (2)   Buffer measurement. Unless otherwise provided, the width of a
buffer zone is measured horizontally from the edge of the water to the nearest
edge of the undisturbed area, with the 25% of the strip nearer the land-
disturbing activity containing natural or artificial means of confining visible
siltation.
   (B)   Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall
be no greater than the angle that can be retained by vegetative cover or other
adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices. In any event, slopes
left exposed will, within 21 calendar days of completion of any phase of
grading, be planted or otherwise provided with temporary or permanent ground
cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. The angle for
graded slopes and fills must be demonstrated to be stable. STABLE is the
condition where the soil remains in its original configuration, with or without
mechanical constraints.
   (C)   Fill material. Materials being used as fill shall be consistent with
those described in 15A NCAC 13B .0562, unless the site is permitted by the
Department’s Division of Waste Management to operate as a landfill. Not all
materials described in § .0562 may be suitable to meet geotechnical
considerations of the fill activity and should be evaluated accordingly.
   (D)   Ground cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity shall meet the
requirements for a plan approval (as defined herein), the person conducting the
land-disturbing activity shall install erosion and sedimentation control
devices and practices that are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by
the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during
construction upon and development of the tract, and shall plant or otherwise
provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after
completion of construction or development. Except as provided in §
152.08(B)(3)(b), provisions for a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain
erosion must be accomplished within 90 calendar days following completion of
construction or development.
   (E)   Prior plan approval. Whenever land-disturbing activity shall meet the
requirements for a plan approval (as defined herein), no person shall initiate
any land-disturbing activity unless, 30 or more days prior to initiating the
activity, a plan for the activity is filed with and approved by the county. An
erosion and sedimentation control plan may be filed less than 30 days prior to
initiation of a land-disturbing activity, if the plan is submitted under an
approved, express-permit program. The land-disturbing activity may be initiated
and conducted in accordance with the plan once the plan has been approved, and
a pre-construction conference has been held with the county. The county shall
forward to the Director of the Division of Water Resources a copy of each plan
for a land-disturbing activity that involves the utilization of ditches for the
purpose of de-watering or lowering the water table of the tract.
   (F)   Erosion and sedimentation control plan. The land-disturbing activity
shall be conducted in accordance with the approved erosion and sedimentation
control plan.

the District to submit its comments and recommendations within 20 days or
within any agreed-upon shorter period of time shall not delay final action on
the plan.
   (K)   Timeline for decisions on plans. The county will review each complete
plan submitted to it and, within 30 days of receipt thereof, will notify the
person submitting the plan that it has been approved, approved with
modifications, or disapproved. Failure to approve, approve with modifications,
or disapprove a complete plan within 30 days of receipt shall be deemed
approval. The county will review each revised plan submitted to it and, within
15 days of receipt thereof, will notify the person submitting the plan that it
has been approved, approved with modifications, or disapproved. Failure to
approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised plan within 15
days of receipt shall be deemed approval.
   (L)   Approval.  The county shall only approve a plan upon determining that
it complies with all applicable state and local regulations for erosion and
sedimentation control. Approval assumes the applicant’s compliance with the
federal and state water quality laws, regulations and rules. The county shall
condition approval of plans upon the applicant’s compliance with federal and
state water quality laws, regulations and rules.
   (M)   Disapproval for content.  The county may disapprove a plan or draft
plan based on its content. A disapproval based upon a plan’s content must
specifically state in writing the reasons for disapproval.
   (N)   Other disapprovals.  
      (1)   The county shall disapprove an erosion and sedimentation control
plan if implementation of the plan would result in a violation of rules adopted
by the Environmental Management Commission to protect riparian buffers along
surface waters.
      (2)   The county may disapprove an erosion and sedimentation control plan
or disapprove a transfer of a plan under division (K) of this section upon
finding that an applicant or a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of the
applicant:
         (a)   Is conducting or has conducted land-disturbing activity without
an approved plan, or has received notice of violation of a plan previously
approved by the Commission or a local government pursuant to this chapter and
has not complied with the notice within the time specified in the notice.
         (b)   Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to this
chapter or a local ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter by the time the
payment is due.
         (c)   Has been convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. § 113A-64
(b) or any criminal provision of a local ordinance adopted pursuant to this
chapter.
         (d)   Has failed to substantially comply with state rules or local
ordinances and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   In the event that an erosion and sedimentation control plan or a
transfer of a plan is disapproved by the county pursuant to division (J) of
this section, the local government shall so notify the Director of the Division
of Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources within ten days of the disapproval. The
county shall advise the applicant or the proposed transferee and the Director
in writing as to the specific reasons that the plan was disapproved.
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 152.17(A) of this chapter, the applicant
may appeal the county's disapproval of the plan directly to the Commission.
      (4)   For purposes of this division, an applicant’s record or the
proposed transferee’s record may be considered for only the two years prior to
the application date.
   (O)   Transfer of plans. The county administering an erosion and
sedimentation control program may transfer an erosion and sedimentation control
plan approved pursuant to this section, without the consent of the plan holder,
to a successor-owner of the property on which the permitted activity is
occurring or will occur as provided in this division.
      (1)   The county may transfer a plan if all of the following conditions
are met:
         (a)   The successor-owner of the property submits to the local
government a written request for the transfer of the plan and an authorized
statement of financial responsibility and documentation of property ownership.
         (b)   The county finds all of the following:
            1.   The plan holder is one of the following:
               a.   A natural person who is deceased;
               b.   A partnership, limited liability corporation, corporation,
or any other business association that has been dissolved;
               c.   A person who has been lawfully and finally divested of
title to the property on which the permitted activity is occurring or will
occur;
               d.   A person who has sold the property on which the permitted
activity is occurring or will occur;
            2.   The successor-owner holds title to the property on which the
permitted activity is occurring or will occur;
            3.   The successor-owner is the sole claimant of the right to
engage in the permitted activity;
            4.   There will be no substantial change in the permitted activity.
      (2)   The plan holder shall comply with all terms and conditions of the
plan until such time as the plan is transferred.
      (3)   The successor-owner shall comply with all terms and conditions of
the plan once the plan has been transferred.
      (4)   Notwithstanding changes to law made after the original issuance of
the plan, the county may not impose new or different terms and conditions in
the plan without the prior express consent of the successor-owner. Nothing in
this division shall prevent the county from requiring a revised plan pursuant
to G.S. § 113A-54.1(b).
   (P)   Notice of activity initiation.  No person may initiate a land-
disturbing activity before notifying the agency that issued the plan approval
of the date that land-disturbing activity will begin.
   (Q)   Preconstruction conference. If a plan approval is required under this
chapter, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity, or an agent of
that party, shall contact the County Natural Resources Division of Development
Services at least 48 hours before commencement of the land-disturbing activity.
The purpose of the preconstruction conference is to arrange an on-site meeting
with the Natural Resources Division of Development Services to review and
discuss the approved plan and the proposed land-disturbing activity.
   (R)   Display of plan approval.  A plan approval issued under this chapter
shall be prominently displayed until all construction is complete, all
temporary measures have been removed, all permanent sedimentation and erosion
control measures are installed, and the site has been stabilized. A copy of the
approved plan shall be kept on file at the job site.
   (S)   Required revisions.  After approving a plan, if the county, either
upon review of such plan or on inspection of the job site, determines that a
significant risk of accelerated erosion or off-site sedimentation exists, the
county shall require a revised plan. Pending the preparation of the revised
plan, work shall cease or shall continue under conditions outlined by the
appropriate authority. If, following commencement of a land-disturbing activity
pursuant to an approved plan, the county determines that the plan is inadequate
to meet the requirements of this chapter, the county may require any revision
of the plan that is necessary to comply with this chapter.
   (T)   Amendment to a plan.  Applications for amendment of a plan in written
and/or graphic form may be made at any time under the same conditions as the
original application. Until such time as an amendment is approved by the
county, the land-disturbing activity shall not proceed except in accordance
with the plan as originally approved.
   (U)   Failure to file a plan. Any person engaged in land-disturbing activity
who fails to file a plan in accordance with this chapter, or who conducts a
land-disturbing activity except in accordance with provisions of an approved
plan, shall be deemed in violation of this chapter.
   (V)   Self-inspections.  
      (1)   The landowner, the financially responsible party, or the
landowner’s or the financially responsible party’s agent shall perform an
inspection of the area covered by the plan after each phase of the plan has
been completed, and after establishment of temporary ground cover in accordance
with G.S. § 113A-57(2). In addition, weekly and rain-event self-inspections are
required by federal regulations that are implemented through the NPDES
Construction General Permit No. NCG 010000.
         (a)   The person who performs the inspection shall maintain and make
available a record of the inspection at the site of the land-disturbing
activity.
            1.   The record shall set out any significant deviation from the
approved erosion control plan, identify any measures that may be required to
correct the deviation, and document the completion of those measures.
            2.   The record shall be maintained until permanent ground cover
has been established as required by the approved erosion and sedimentation
control plan.
         (b)   The inspections required by this division shall be in addition
to inspections required by G.S. § 113A-61.1.
      (2)   Where inspections are required by this division or G.S. § 113A-54.1
(e), the following apply:
         (a)   The inspection shall be performed during or after each of the
following phases of the plan:
            1.   Initial installation of erosion and sediment control measures;
            2.   Clearing and grubbing of existing ground cover;
            3.   Completion of any grading that requires ground cover;
            4.   Completion of all land-disturbing activity, construction, or
development, including permanent ground cover establishment and removal of all
temporary measures; and
            5.   Transfer of ownership or control of the tract of land where
the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved and work has
begun. The new owner or person in control shall conduct and document
inspections until the project is permanently stabilized as set forth in
division (R) of this section.
         (b)   Documentation of self-inspections performed under division (V)(2
(a)) of this section shall include:
            1.   Visual verification of ground stabilization and other erosion
control measures and practices as called for in the approved plan;
            2.   Verification by measurement of settling basins, temporary
construction entrances, energy dissipators, and traps;
            3.   The name, address, organization affiliation, telephone number,
and signature of the person conducting the inspection, and the date of the
inspection shall be included, whether on a copy of the approved erosion and
sedimentation control plan or an inspection report. A template for an example
of an inspection and monitoring report is provided on the DEMLR website at:
https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/energy-mineral-land-resources/erosion-
sediment-control/forms. Any relevant licenses and certifications may also be
included. Any documentation of inspections that occur on a copy of the approved
erosion and sedimentation control plan shall occur on a single copy of the
plan, and that plan shall be made available on the site.
            4.   A record of any significant deviation from any erosion or
sedimentation control measure from that on the approved plan. For the purpose
of this rule, a SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION means an omission, alternation, or
relocation of an erosion or sedimentation control measure that prevents it from
performing as intended. The record shall include measures required to correct
the significant deviation, along with documentation of when those measures were
taken. Deviations from the approved plan may also be recommended to enhance the
intended performance of the sedimentation and erosion control measures.
      (3)   Except as may be required under federal law, rule or regulation, no
periodic self-inspections or rain gauge installation is required on individual
residential lots where less than one acre is being disturbed on each lot.
   (W)   Plan cancellations. Plans for which land-disturbing activity has not
commenced within two years from the initial plan approval are void.

§ 152.07 BASIC CONTROL OBJECTIVES.
   An erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved if the plan
fails to address the following control objectives.
   (A)   Identify critical areas.  On-site areas that are subject to severe
erosion, and off-site areas that are especially vulnerable to damage from
erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special
attention.
   (B)   Limit time of exposure.  All land-disturbing activities are to be
planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest time specified in G.S.
§ 113A-57, the rules of the aforementioned chapter, or as directed by the
approving authority.
   (C)   Limit exposed areas.  All land-disturbing activity is to be planned
and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time.
   (D)   Control surface water.  Surface water runoff originating upgrade of
exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during
the period of exposure.
   (E)   Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned
and conducted to prevent off-site sedimentation damage.
   (F)   Manage stormwater runoff. Plans shall be designed so that any increase
in velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity will
not result in accelerated erosion of the receiving stormwater conveyance or at
the point of discharge. Plans shall include measures to prevent accelerated
erosion within the project boundary and at the point of discharge.
(Ord. passed 1-22-2007; Ord. 2012-21, passed 10-1-2012; Ord. passed 12-18-2023)
§ 152.08 DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Except as provided in divisions (B)(2) and (C)(1) of this section,
erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be
planned, designed, and constructed to provide protection from the calculated
maximum peak rate of runoff from the ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be
calculated using the procedures in the latest edition of the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service’s
National Engineering Field Handbook or other acceptable calculation procedures.
   (B)   HQW zones. In high quality water (HWQ) zones, the following design
standards shall apply.
      (1)   Limit on uncovered area. Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be
limited at any time to a maximum total area of 20 acres within the boundaries
of the tract. Only the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW
zone shall be governed by this section. Larger areas may be uncovered within
the boundaries of the tract with the written approval of the Director, upon
providing engineering justification with a construction sequence that considers
phasing, limiting exposure, self-inspection reports submitted weekly, and a
more conservative design than the 25-year storm.
      (2)   Maximum peak rate of runoff protection. Erosion and sedimentation
control measures, structures, and devices within HQW zones shall be planned,
designed, and constructed to provide protection from the runoff of the 25-year
storm that produces the maximum peak rate of runoff, as calculated according to
procedures in the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources
Conservation Service’s National Engineering Field Handbook, or according to
procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or
any generally recognized organization or association.
      (3)   Sediment basin design.  
         (a)   Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and
constructed according to the following criteria:
            1.   Use a surface withdrawal mechanism, except when the basin
drainage area is less than one acre;
            2.   Have a minimum of 1,800 cubic feet of storage area per acre of
disturbed area;
            3.   Have a minimum surface area of 325 square feet per cfs of the
25-year storm (Q25) peak flow;
            4.   Have a minimum dewatering time of 48 hours;
            5.   Incorporate three baffles, unless the basin is less than 20
feet in length, in which case two baffles shall be sufficient.
         (b)   Upon a written request of the applicant, the Director may allow
alternative design and control measures in lieu of meeting the conditions
required in division (B)(3)(a)2. through 5. of this section, if the applicant
demonstrates that meeting all of those conditions will result in design or
operational hardships, and that the alternative measures will provide an equal
or more effective level of erosion and sediment control on the site.
Alternative measures may include quicker application of ground cover, use of
sediment flocculants, and use of enhanced ground cover practices.
      (4)   Grade. Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be
designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one
vertical, if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization, unless soil
conditions permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using
mechanical devices, structural devices, or other forms of ditch liners proven
as being effective in restraining accelerated erosion. In any event, the angle
for side slopes shall be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion.
   (C)   Design and performance standards for land-disturbing activities of 20
acres or greater. In addition to any other requirements of state, federal, and
local law, land-disturbing activity of 20 acres or more within Lincoln County
or the City of Lincolnton shall meet all of the following additional design
standards for sedimentation and erosion control.
      (1)   Sediment basins shall be planned, designed, and constructed to
provide protection from the runoff of the 25-year storm that produces the
maximum peak rate of runoff, as calculated according to procedures set out in
the latest edition of the United States Department of Agriculture Natural
Resources Conservation Service’s Engineering Field Handbook, found through
nrcs.usda.gov, or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of the
state or the United States.
      (2)   Construction entrances shall be planned, designed and constructed
at a minimum length of 100 feet.
      (3)   Sediment fence (silt fencing) used along all watercourses shall
planned, designed and constructed as double-row, high-hazard or super-silt
fence.

§ 152.09 STORM WATER OUTLET PROTECTION.
   (A)   Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land-disturbing
activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion
caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land-disturbing activity.
   (B)   Performance standard.  
      (1)   Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post-
construction velocity of the ten-year-storm runoff in the receiving watercourse
to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:
         (a)   The velocity established by the Maximum Permissible Velocities
Table set out within this division; or
         (b)   The velocity of the ten-year-storm runoff in the receiving
watercourse prior to development.
      (2)   If the condition of division (B)(1)(a) or (b) of this section
cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge
point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity
anywhere the velocity exceeds the “prior to development” velocity by 10%.
   MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE VELOCITIES TABLE
         The following is a table of the maximum permissible velocities for
storm water discharges in feet per second (F.P.S.) and meters per second
(M.P.S.).
Material F.P.S. M.P.S
Material                               F.P.S. M.P.S
Fine sand (noncolloidal)               2.5    0.8
Sandy loam (noncolloidal)              2.5    0.8
Silt loam (noncolloidal)               3.0    0.9
Ordinary firm loam                     3.5    1.1
Fine gravel                            5.0    1.5
Stiff clay (very colloidal)            5.0    1.5
Graded, loam to cobbles (noncolloidal) 5.0    1.5
Graded, silt to cobbles (Colloidal)    5.5    1.7
Alluvial silts (noncolloidal)          3.5    1.1
Alluvial silts (colloidal)             5.0    1.5
Coarse gravel (noncolloidal)           6.0    1.8
Cobbles and shingles                   5.5    1.7
Shales and hard pans                   6.0    1.8
 
         Source: Adapted from recommendations by Special Committee on
Irrigation Research, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1926, for channels
with straight alignment. For sinuous channels, multiply the allowable velocity
by 0.95 for slightly sinuous, by 0.9 for moderately sinuous channels, and by
0.8 for highly sinuous channels.
   (C)   Acceptable management measures. Measures applied alone or in
combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are
no objectionable secondary consequences. The county recognizes that the
management of storm water runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and
bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will
be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce
successful results. Some alternatives, while not exhaustive, are to:
      (1)   Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including
measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas
rendered impervious;
      (2)   Avoid increases in storm water discharge velocities by using
vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in place of closed drains and high
velocity paved sections:
      (3)   Provide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities
to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge;
      (4)   Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving
cross sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining; and
      (5)   Upgrade or replace the receiving device structure or watercourse
such that it will receive and conduct the flow to a point where it is no longer
subject to degradation from the increased rate of flow or increased velocity.
   (D)   Exceptions.  This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated to
the county that storm water discharge velocities will not create an erosion
problem in the receiving watercourse.

§ 152.10 BORROW AND WASTE AREAS.
   If the same person conducts the land-disturbing activity and any related
borrow or waste activity, the related borrow or waste activity shall constitute
part of the land-disturbing activity, unless the borrow or waste activity is
regulated under the Mining Act of 1971, G.S. Chapter 74, Article 7, or is a
landfill regulated by the Division of Waste Management. If the land-disturbing
activity and any related borrow or waste activity are not conducted by the same
person, they shall be considered by the approving authority as separate land-
disturbing activities.
(Ord. passed 12-18-2023)
§ 152.11 ACCESS AND HAUL ROADS.
   Temporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or
used in connection with any land-disturbing activity shall be considered a part
of that activity.
(Ord. passed 12-18-2023)
§ 152.12 OPERATIONS IN LAKES OR NATURAL WATERCOURSES..
   Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or
under a lake or natural watercourse shall minimize the extent and duration of
disruption of the stream channel. Where relocation of a stream forms an
essential part of the proposed activity, the relocation shall minimize changes
in the stream flow characteristics.
(Ord. passed 12-18-2023)
§ 152.13 RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
   During the development of a site, the person conducting the land-disturbing
activity shall install and maintain all temporary and permanent erosion and
sedimentation control measures as required by the approved plan or any
provision of this chapter, the Act, or any order adopted pursuant to this
chapter or the Act. After site development, the landowner or person in
possession or control of the land shall install and/or maintain all necessary
permanent erosion and sediment control measures, except those measures
installed within a road or street right-of-way or easement accepted for
maintenance by a governmental agency.
(Ord. passed 12-18-2023)

§ 152.19 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   (A)   Violation of local program. Whenever the county has reasonable cause
to believe that any person is violating or threatening to violate any
ordinance, rule, regulation or order adopted or issued by the county, or any
term, condition, or provision of an approved plan, it may, either before or
after the institution of any other action or proceeding authorized by this
chapter, institute a civil action, in the name of the county, for injunctive
relief to restrain the violation or threatened violation. The County Attorney
shall bring the action in the County Superior Court.
   (B)   Abatement of violation. Upon its determination that an alleged
violation is occurring or is threatened, a court shall enter any order or
judgment that is necessary to abate the violation, to ensure that restoration
is performed, or to prevent the threatened violation. The institution of an
action for injunctive relief under this section shall not relieve any party to
the proceedings from any civil or criminal penalty prescribed for violations of
this chapter.
(Ord. passed 1-22-2007; Ord. passed 12-18-2023)
§ 152.20 RESTORATION OF AFTER NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The county may require a person who engaged in a land-disturbing activity
and failed to retain sediment generated by the activity, as required by G.S. §
113A-57(3), to restore the waters and land affected by the failure so as to
minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting pollution by sedimentation.
This authority is in addition to any other civil or criminal penalty or
injunctive relief authorized under this chapter.
(Ord. passed 1-22-2007; Ord. passed 12-18-2023)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Civil penalty for a violation.  Any person who violates any of the
provisions of this chapter, or any rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to
this chapter, or who initiates or continues a land-disturbing activity for
which a plan is required except in accordance with the terms, conditions, and
provisions of an approved plan, is subject to a civil penalty. The maximum
civil penalty amount that the county may assess per violation is $5,000. A
civil penalty may be assessed from the date of the violation. Each day of a
continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. When the person has
not been assessed any civil penalty under this division for any previous
violation, and that person abated continuing environmental damage resulting
from the violation within 180 days from the date of the notice of violation,
the maximum cumulative total civil penalty assessed under this division for all
violations associated with the land-disturbing activity for which the erosion
and sedimentation control plan is required is $25,000.
      (2)   Repeat violations.  Repeat violators may be charged by a multiple
of the base penalty determined herein. The penalty for a repeat violator may be
doubled for each previous time that the repeat violator has been notified of a
violation of this chapter, or any other soil erosion and sedimentation control
ordinance within the state, within two years prior to the current violation.
However, in no case may the penalty exceed the maximum allowed by this chapter.
      (3)   Civil penalty assessment factors.  The County Natural Resources
Division of Development Services shall determine the amount of the civil
penalty based upon the following factors:
         (a)   The degree and extent of harm caused by the violation;
         (b)   The cost of rectifying the damage;
         (c)   The amount of money the violator saved by noncompliance;
         (d)   Whether the violation was committed willfully; and
         (e)   The prior record of the violator in complying of failing to
comply with this chapter.
      (4)   Notice of civil penalty assessment.  The County Natural Resources
Division of Development Services shall provide notice of the civil penalty
amount and the basis for assessment to the person assessed. The notice of
assessment shall be served by any means authorized under G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 4. A
notice of assessment by the county shall direct the violator to either pay the
assessment, contest the assessment within 30 days by filing a petition for a
hearing with the county (based upon the procedures herein), or file a request
with the County Erosion Control Division of Development Services for remission
of the assessment within 30 days of receipt of the notice of assessment. A
remission request must be accompanied by a waiver of the right to a contested
case hearing pursuant to G.S. Chapter 150B, and a stipulation of the facts on
which the assessment was based.
      (5)   Final decision. The final decision on contested assessments shall
be made by the County Environmental Review Board in accordance with this
chapter.
      (6)   Appeal of final decision.  Appeal of the final decision of the
County Environmental Review Board shall be to the County Superior Court. Such
appeals must be made within 30 days of the final decision of the County
Environmental Review Board.
      (7)   Remission of civil penalties. A request for remission of a civil
penalty imposed under G.S. § 113A-64 may be filed with the county Environmental
Review Board within 30 days of receipt of the notice of assessment. A remission
request must be accompanied by a waiver of the right to a contested case
hearing pursuant to G.S. Chapter 150B, and a stipulation of the facts on which
the assessment was based. The following factors shall be considered in
determining whether a civil penalty remission request will be approved:
         (a)   Whether one or more of the civil penalty assessment factors in
G.S. § 113A-64(a)(3) were wrongly applied to the detriment of the petitioner;
         (b)   Whether the petitioner promptly abated continuing environmental
damage resulting from the violation;
         (c)   Whether the violation was inadvertent or a result of an
accident;
         (d)   Whether the petitioner had been assessed civil penalties for any
previous violations;
         (e)   Whether payment of the civil penalty will prevent payment for
necessary remedial actions or would otherwise create a significant financial
hardship;
         (f)   The assessed property tax valuation of the petitioner’s property
upon which the violation occurred, excluding the value of any structures
located on the property.
      (8)   Collection.  If payment is not received within 30 days after it is
due, the county may institute a civil action to recover the amount of the
assessment. The civil action may be brought in the superior court of the county
where the violation occurred, or where the violator’s residence or principal
place of business is located. Such civil actions must be filed within three
years of the date the assessment was due. An assessment that is not contested
and a remission that is not requested is due when the violator is served with a
notice of assessment. An assessment that is contested or a remission that is
requested is due at the conclusion of the administrative and judicial review of
the assessment.
      (9)   Credit of civil penalties. The clear proceeds of civil penalties
collected by the county under this division shall be remitted to the Civil
Penalty and Forfeiture Fund in accordance with G.S. § 115C-457.2. Penalties
collected by the county may be diminished only by the actual costs of
collection. The collection cost percentage to be used shall be established and
approved by the State Office of State Budget and Management on an annual basis,
based upon the computation of actual collection costs by the county for the
prior fiscal year.
   (B)   Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any
provision of this chapter, or any rule or order adopted or issued by the
Commission or a local government, or who knowingly or willfully initiates or
continues a land-disturbing activity for which a plan is required except in
accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan,
shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor, which may include a fine not to
exceed $5,000 as provided in G.S. § 113A-64.

(Ord. passed 9-8-1992)
§ 153.036 INVENTORY.
   As a guide for the identification and evaluation of landmarks, the

property to be designated, and other relevant matters.
   (C)   The Committee, collectively and individually, shall refrain from any
indication of approval or disapproval, but shall not, for that reason, be
barred from reasonable discussion of the applicant's proposals. No advice or
opinion given, or reported as having been given, by any member of the Committee
at such informal meeting(s) shall in any way be official or binding upon the

§ 153.045 PUBLIC HEARING.
   When a proposed ordinance of designation is submitted, the Commission shall
hold a legislative hearing to determine if it will recommend the property for
designation as a historic landmark. If the Commission recommends the property
for designation as a historic landmark, based on the property being deemed and
found by the Commission to be of special significance in terms of its
historical, prehistorical, architectural, or cultural importance, and to
possess integrity of design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling, and/or
association, then the Commission shall request that the Board of Commissioners

light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features), nor above-
ground utility structure nor any type of outdoor advertising sign shall be
erected, altered, restored, moved, or demolished on the historic property until
after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior
features has been submitted to and approved by the Historic Preservation
Commission. The county shall require such a certificate to be issued by the
Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit or other permit granted
for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving, or demolishing structures,
which certificate may be issued subject to reasonable conditions necessary to
carry out the purposes of this section. A certificate of appropriateness shall
be required whether or not a building or other permit is required.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, EXTERIOR FEATURES shall include the
architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of
a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building
material, the size and scale of the building, and the type and style of all
windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, and other appurtenant fixtures. In the
case of outdoor advertising signs, EXTERIOR FEATURES shall be construed to mean
the style, material, size, and location of all the signs. The EXTERIOR FEATURES
may, in the discretion of the local governing board, include historic signs,
color, and significant landscape, archaeological, and natural features of the
area.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B) below, the Commission shall have
no jurisdiction over interior arrangement and shall take no action under this
section except to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration,
restoration, moving, or demolition of buildings, structures, appurtenant
fixtures, or outdoor advertising signs which would be incongruous with the
special character of the historic property.
   (B)   Interior spaces. Notwithstanding division (A) above, jurisdiction of
the Commission over interior spaces shall be limited to specific interior
features of architectural, artistic, or historical significance in publicly
owned landmarks; and of privately owned historic landmarks for which consent
for interior review has been given by the owner. The consent of an owner for
interior review shall bind future owners and/or successors in title, provided
the consent has been filed in the office of the Register of Deeds of the county
in which the property is located and indexed according to the name of the owner
of the property in the grantee and grantor indexes. The landmark designation
shall specify the interior features to be reviewed and the specific nature of
the Commission’s jurisdiction over the interior.
   (C)   Rules and standards. Prior to any action to enforce this chapter, the
Commission shall prepare and adopt rules of procedure, and may prepare and
adopt principles and guidelines not inconsistent with this section for new
construction, alterations, additions, moving, and demolition. Prior to issuance
or denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission shall take any
steps as may be reasonably required in this chapter and/or rules of procedure
to inform the owners of any property likely to be materially affected by the
application, and shall give the applicant and the owners an opportunity to be
heard. In cases where the Commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public
hearing concerning the application. All meetings of the Commission shall be
open to the public, in accordance with G.S. Chapter 143, Article 33C.
   (D)   Time for review. All applications for certificates of appropriateness
shall be reviewed and acted upon within a reasonable time, not to exceed 180
days from the date the application for a certificate of appropriateness is
filed, as defined by this chapter or the Commission’s rules of procedure. As
part of its review procedure, the Commission may view the premises and seek the
advice of the Division of Archives and History or any other expert advice as it
may deem necessary under the circumstances.
   (E)   Appeals.
      (1)   Appeals of administrative decisions allowed by regulation may be
made to the Commission.
      (2)   All decisions of the Commission in granting or denying a
Certificate of Appropriateness may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in
the nature of certiorari within times prescribed for appeals of administrative
decisions in G.S. § 160D-405(d). To the extent applicable, the provisions of
G.S. § 160D-1402 apply to appeals in the nature of certiorari to the Board of
Adjustment.
      (3)   Appeals from the Board of Adjustment may be made pursuant to G.S. §
160D-1402.
      (4)   Petitions for judicial review shall be taken within times
prescribed for appeal of quasi-judicial decisions in G.S. § 160D-1405. Appeals
in any such case shall be heard by the Lincoln County Superior Court.
   (F)   Public buildings. All of the provisions of this section are hereby
made applicable to construction, alteration, moving, and demolition by the
state, its political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities, provided,
however, they shall not apply to interiors of buildings or structures owned by
the state. The state and its agencies shall have a right of appeal to the State
Historical Commission or any successor agency assuming its responsibilities
under G.S. § 121-12(a) from any decision of a local Historic Preservation
Commission. The Commission shall render its decision within 30 days from the
date that the notice of appeal by the state is received by it. The current
edition of the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings shall be the sole principles
and guidelines used in reviewing applications of the state for certificates of
appropriateness. The decision of the Commission shall be final and binding upon
both the state and the Historic Preservation Commission.

§ 153.061 DELAY IN DEMOLITION OF HISTORIC PROPERTIES.
   (A)   An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the
demolition, destruction, or relocation of a designated landmark may not be
denied, except as provided in division (C) below. However, the effective date
of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the
date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall
be reduced by the Commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme
hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from the
property by virtue of the delay. During the period the Historic Preservation
Commission shall negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an
effort to find a means of preserving the building site. If the Commission has
voted to recommend designation of a property as a landmark and final
designation has not been made by the local governing board, the demolition or
destruction of any building, site, or structure located on the property of the
proposed historic property may be delayed by the Commission or planning agency
for a period of up to 180 days or until the local governing board takes final
action on the designation, whichever occurs first.
   (B)   The governing board may enact an ordinance to prevent the demolition
by neglect of any designated historic property (landmark). The ordinance shall
provide appropriate safeguards to protect property owners from undue economic
hardship.
   (C)   An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the
demolition or destruction of a building, site, or structure determined by the
State Historic Preservation office as having statewide significance as defined
in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may be denied,
except where the Commission finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship
or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return by virtue of the
denial.
(Ord. passed 9-8-1992; Ord. passed 3-21-2022)
§ 153.062 CERTAIN CHANGES NOT PROHIBITED.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a historic
property that does not involve a change in design, material, or outer
appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction,
alteration, restoration, demolition, or removal of any such feature when a
building inspector or similar official certifies to the Commission that the
action is required for the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous
condition. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a property owner from
making any use of his or her property not prohibited by other statutes,
ordinances, or regulations.
(Ord. passed 9-8-1992)
§ 153.063 REQUIRED PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Application submitted to appropriate administrative official. An

GENERAL REGULATIONS
§ 153.105 AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE HISTORIC PROPERTIES.
   Within the limits of its jurisdiction, the Historic Preservation Commission
(and with the approval of the local governing board) may acquire property

may be appropriated for that purpose. The county, pursuant to G.S. § 160D-942
(3), has the authority to acquire, maintain, manage, repair, restore, or
dispose of any buildings or structure designated as a historic property in any
order adopted pursuant to this chapter. In the event the property is acquired
under this section but is not used for some other governmental purpose, it
shall be deemed to be a MUSEUM under the provisions of G.S. § 160A-488,
notwithstanding the fact that the property may be or remain in private use, so
long as the property is made reasonable accessible to and open for visitation
by the general public.
(Ord. passed 9-8-1992; Ord. passed 3-21-2022)
§ 153.106 OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY.
   All lands, buildings, structures, sites, areas, or objects acquired by funds
appropriated by the local government shall be acquired in the name of the local
government, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Commissioners. So long as

maintained by or under the supervision and control of the local government.
However, all lands, buildings, or structures acquired by the Historic
Preservation Commission from funds other than those appropriated by the local
government may be acquired and held in the name of the Historic Preservation
Commission, the local government, or both in accordance with the General
Statutes of North Carolina as they may apply and as approved by the Board of
Commissioners.
