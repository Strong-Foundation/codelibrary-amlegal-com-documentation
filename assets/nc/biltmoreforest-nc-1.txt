CODE OF ETHICS
   The purpose of this code of Ethics is to establish guidelines for ethical
standards of conduct for the Town of Biltmore Forest Board of Commissioners and
to help determine what conduct is appropriate in particular cases. It should
not be considered a substitute for the law or for the Board member’s best
judgment.
   The Town of Biltmore Forest Board of Commissioners is comprised of the Mayor
and three Commissioners and all references in this Code of Ethics to
‘Commissioners’ is deemed to include the Mayor and the three Commissioners.
Commissioners Shall Obey the Law
All members of the Board of Commissioners of the Town of Biltmore Forest should
obey all laws applicable to their official actions as members of the Board.
Board members should be guided by the spirit as well as the letter of the law
in whatever they do.
Commissioners Shall Uphold the Integrity and Independence of the Office
All members of the Board of Commissioners of the Town of Biltmore Forest should
demonstrate the highest standard of personal integrity, truthfulness, honesty
and fortitude in all public activities in order to inspire public confidence
and trust in government. They should participate in establishing, maintaining,
and enforcing, and should observe high standards of conduct so that the
integrity and independence of the office may be preserved.
Commissioners Shall Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety in All
His or Her Activities
It is essential that government attract those citizens best qualified and
willing to serve. Commissioners have legitimate interests - economic,
professional and vocational - of a private nature. A Commissioner should not be
denied, and should not deny to other Commissioners or citizens, the opportunity
to acquire, retain and pursue private interests- economic or otherwise, except
when it conflicts with their responsibility to the public and cannot be
avoided. Each member of the Board of Commissioners should exercise his/her best
judgment to determine when this is the case. Members should respect and comply
with the law and conduct themselves, at all times in a manner that promotes
public confidence in the integrity of the office of Commissioner and of
government. Members should not allow family, social, or other relationships to
unduly influence his/her conduct or judgment and should not lend the prestige
of the office of Commissioner to advance the private interests of others; nor
should he/she convey or permit others to convey the impression that he/she is
in a special position to influence them. If a Commissioner believes that his/
her actions, while legal and ethical, may be misunderstood, the member should
seek the advice of the Attorney and should consider publically disclosing the
facts of the situation and the steps taken to resolve it.
Commissioners Shall Faithfully and Diligently Perform the Duties of the Office
Commissioners should perform the duties of the office as prescribed by law and
should give precedence to these duties over other activities. In the
performance of these duties, the following standards shall apply:
Legislative Responsibilities.
Commissioners should actively pursue policy goals they believe to be in the
best interests of their constituents within the parameters of orderly decision-
making, rules of the Board of Commissioners and open government. Commissioners
should respect the legitimacy of the goals and interests of other Commissioners
and shall respect the rights of others to pursue goals and policies different
from their own.
Adjudicative Responsibilities.
Commissioners should be faithful to the general and local laws pertaining to
the office and strive for professional competence in them. They should be un-
swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism.
Commissioners should demand and contribute to the maintenance of order and
decorum in proceedings before the Board of Commissioners. Commissioners should
be honest, patient, dignified and courteous to those with whom they deal in
their official capacity, and should require similar conduct of staff.
Commissioners should accord to every person who is legally interested in a
proceeding before the Commission, full right to be heard according to law.
Commissioners should dispose promptly of the business of the Town of Biltmore
Forest.
Administrative Responsibilities.
Commissioners should clearly distinguish legislative, adjudicatory and
administrative responsibilities and should refrain from inappropriate
interference in the impartial administration of affairs by employees.
Commissioners should diligently discharge those administrative responsibilities
that are appropriate, should maintain professional competence in the
administration of these duties and should facilitate the diligent discharge of
the administrative responsibilities of fellow Commissioners and other
officials. Commissioners should conserve the resources of the Town and employ
equipment, property, funds and personnel only in legally permissible pursuits
and in a manner that exemplifies excellent stewardship.
Commissioners Shall Conduct the Affairs of the Board in an Open and Public
Manner
Commissioners must be aware of the letter and intent of the State’s Open
Meetings Law, being G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 33C, and conduct the affairs of the
Board of Commissioners consistent with the letter and spirit of that law and
consistent with the need to inspire and maintain public confidence in the
integrity and fairness of government and the office of Commissioner. Consistent
with this goal of preserving public trust, Commissioners shall be aware of the
need for discretion in deliberations when the lack of discretion would pose a
threat to the resources of the Town, to the reputation of current or potential
employees, to orderly and responsible decision making, to the integrity of
other governmental processes or to other legitimate interests of the Town.
Commissioners should be informed concerning campaign finance, conflict of
interest and other appropriate state and federal laws and should scrupulously
comply with the provisions of such laws. Each member should refrain from
financial and business dealings that tend to reflect adversely on the Board or
on government or to interfere with the proper performance. Each member should
manage his/her personal financial interests to minimize the number of cases in
which he/she must ask to be excused from voting on matters coming before the
Board. Each member should not disclose any information acquired in his/her
official capacity as a Commissioner in financial dealings or for any other
purpose not related to official duties.
Commissioners Shall Refrain from Political Activity Inappropriate to His/Her
Office
Commissioners have a civic responsibility to support good government by every
available means, to continue to inform and educate the citizenry about the
affairs and processes of government and to make themselves available to
citizens of the so that they may ascertain and respond to the needs of the
community. In doing so, each member may join or affiliate with civic
organizations whether partisan or nonpartisan, may and should attend political
meetings, may and should advocate and support the principles or policies of
civic or political organizations consistent with the Constitution and laws of
the United States and North Carolina. Each member should maintain the dignity
appropriate to the office, and should encourage members of his/her family to
adhere to the same standards of political conduct that apply to the
Commissioners. Each member should refrain from making pledges or promises of
conduct in office that he/she cannot or will not perform or which would be
illegal if performed.
This Code of Ethics shall be effective upon its adoption. Adopted this the 10th
day of August, 2010.

§ 50.30 INTENT, PURPOSE, AND CONTROL.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   It is the intent of this subchapter to recognize that there are
varying degrees of hazard to potable water within the water main and water
supply systems.
      (2)   It is also the intent to apply the principle that the degree of
protection should be commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is:
      (1)   To protect public potable water supply of the town against actual
or potential cross-connections, backflow, and back-siphonage by isolating with
the premises or private property contamination or pollution that has occurred
or may occur because of some undiscovered or unauthorized cross-connection on
the premises or private property;
      (2)   To eliminate cross-connections, backflow, and back-siphonage or any
other source of water or process water used for any purpose whatsoever this may
jeopardize the safety of the public potable water supply of the town; and
      (3)   (a)   To establish a cross-connection, backflow, and back-siphonage
control program.
         (b)   Cross-connection, backflow, and back-siphonage control require
cooperation between the town and the consumer. The responsibilities and duties
of each shall be as set forth in the subchapter and other applicable
regulations.
(2013 Code, § 18.65)
§ 50.31 RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   (1)   The town is primarily responsible for the prevention of
contamination and pollution of the public water system. Such responsibility
begins at the point of origin of the public water supply and includes all of
the public water distribution system, and ends at the service connection to the
consumer’s water system.
      (2)   In addition, the town shall exercise reasonable vigilance to ensure
that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable
water system.
      (3)   When it is determined that a backflow prevention device is required
for the protection of the public system of the town, the town shall require the
consumer, at the consumer’s expense, to install an approved backflow prevention
device at each service connection.
   (B)   (1)   The consumer has the prime responsibility of preventing
contaminants and pollutants from entering his or her potable water system or
the public water system at his or her service connection. The consumer, at his
or her own expense, shall install, operate, and maintain an approved backflow
prevention device and the service connection as directed by the town.

   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AIR GAP SEPARATION. The unobstructed vertical distance through the free
atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water
to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flow leveling of the
receptacle. An approved AIR GAP SEPARATION shall be at least double the
diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the top rim of the
vessel.
   APPROVED. The term approved as herein used in reference to a water supply
system or backflow prevention device (or method) shall mean one that has been
approved by the Public Works Director.
   BACK-PRESSURE BACKFLOW. Backflow caused by a pump elevated tank boiler or
other means that could create pressure within the system greater than the
supply pressure.
   BACK-SIPHONAGE BACKFLOW. A reversal of the normal direction of flow in the
pipeline due to a negative pressure (vacuum) being created in the supply line
with the backflow source subject to atmospheric pressure.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE-TYPE - A. Any effective device, method, or
construction used to prevent backflow into a potable water system. The type of
device used shall be based on the degree of hazard either existing or
potential.
   CHECK VALVE-APPROVED. A check valve that is drip-tight in the normal
direction of flow when the inlet pressure is one P.S.I, and the outlet pressure
is zero. The check valve shall permit no leakage in a direction reverse to the
normal flow. The closure element (e.g. clapper) shall be internally weighted or
otherwise internally loaded to promote rapid and positive closure.
   CONSUMER. Any person, firm, or corporation using or receiving water from the
Town of Biltmore Forest water system.

industrial fluids or waste to a degree, which creates an actual hazard to the
public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.
   CROSS-CONNECTION. Any actual or potential connection of structural
arrangement between a public or a consumer’s potable water system and any other
source or system through which it is possible to introduce into any part of the
potable system any used water, industrial fluid, gas, or substance other than
the intended potable water with which the system is supplied. Bypass
arrangements jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or change-over
devices, and other temporary/permanent devices through which or because of
which backflow can or may occur are considered to be CROSS-CONNECTIONS.
   DOUBLE CHECK ASSEMBLY. An assembly composed of two single independently
acting approved check valves, including tightly closing shut-off valves located
at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the water-
tightness of each check valve.
   HAZARD - DEGREE OF. Plumbing type cross-connection in a consumer’s potable
water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker, air-gap
separation, or other device. Unprotected, plumbing type cross-connections are
considered to be a health hazard. They include, but are not limited to, cross-
connections to toilets, sinks, lavatories, wash trays, domestic washing
machines, and lawn sprinkling systems. Plumbing type cross-connections can be
located in many type of structures, including homes, apartment houses, hotels,
and commercial and industrial establishment.
   HAZARD POLLUTION. An actual or potential threat to the physical properties
of the water system or the potability of the public or the consumer’s potable
water system but which would not constitute a health or system hazard as

§ 52.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The stormwater management regulations of this chapter shall protect,
maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, environment, and general
welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the
adverse effects of stormwater runoff associated with new development.
   (B)   Proper management of stormwater runoff will protect property; control
stream channel erosion; prevent increased flooding associated with new
development; protect floodplains, wetlands, water resources, riparian, and
aquatic ecosystems; and otherwise provide for environmentally sound use of the
county’s natural resources.
(2013 Code, § 20-1)
§ 52.02 SCOPE.
   Except as otherwise expressly stated, the stormwater management regulations
of this chapter apply to all development within the incorporated area of the
town.
(2013 Code, § 20-2)
§ 52.03 APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The stormwater management regulations of this chapter do not apply to
any of the following development activities:

consultation meeting with the Stormwater Administrator or his or her designee
is required to assess necessary stormwater management measures, constraints,
opportunities, and potential approach.
   (E)   Two copies of the stormwater plan submittal shall be submitted to
Planning and Development for review.
   (F)   The Department shall review the plan for completeness and for
compliance with the requirements of this chapter. An incomplete or
nonconforming stormwater plan will be returned to the applicant prior to review
with an explanation of issues requiring resolution before plan review can be
initiated.
   (G)   Within 30 days of receipt of application for stormwater plan approval,
Planning and Development shall take action on the plan.
      (1)   Planning and Development shall forward a copy of the plan to the
County Soil and Water Conservation District who, within 20 days of receipt of
the plan, will review the plan and submit its comments and recommendations to
the Stormwater Administrator at the County Planning and Development Department.
      (2)   Failure of the Soil and Water Conservation District to submit its
comments and recommendations within 20 days shall not delay final action on the
plan. Planning and Development is solely responsible for plan(s) review and
will incorporate review comments and recommendations from the Soil and Water
Conservation District into its examination of the plan application.
   (H)   (1)   Approval, approval with modifications, or denial of the proposed
stormwater plan shall be in writing, in the case of denial, the reasons for
denial shall be clearly stated. The applicant may appeal the decision of the
Stormwater Administrator at the County Planning and Development Department to a
Plan Review Committee within 15 days after receipt of written notice of
disapproval or approval with modifications. Only the applicant can appeal the
decision of the Stormwater Administrator.
      (2)   A condition of plan approval will be the right to physical
inspection of the drainage structures and stormwater management measures during
and after construction.
   (I)   Hearings held pursuant to this section shall be conducted by a Plan
Review Committee consisting of the Director of Planning and Development, the
Director of the Soil and Water Conservation District, and the Director of
General Services within 30 days after the date of the appeal or request for
hearing.
   (J)   The Plan Review Committee shall decide appeals within 15 days after
the date of the hearing on any stormwater plan. If the Review Committee upholds
the disapproval or modification of a proposed plan following the hearing, the
person submitting the plan shall then be entitled to appeal the local Plan
Review Committee’s decision to the Board of Adjustment within 15 days.
   (K)   The Board of Adjustment will conduct a hearing in the nature of a
quasi-judicial proceeding with all findings of fact supported by material
evidence.
   (L)   Decisions appealing the final decision by the Board of Adjustment may
be filed in County Superior Court, to be reviewed by proceedings in the nature
of certiorari, within 30 days of the final decision of the Board of Adjustment.
   (M)   The Stormwater Administrator shall take action on revisions to a
stormwater plan which has been previously denied, within 15 days of receipt of
the revised plan application for approval.
   (N)   If a revised application is not re-submitted within 60 calendar days
from the date the applicant was notified, the application shall be considered
withdrawn, and a new submittal for the same or substantially the same project
shall be required along with the appropriate fee and pursuant to the current
standards.
   (O)   Application for an amendment to a stormwater plan in written and
graphic form may be made at any time. Until such time that any amendment is
approved by the Stormwater Administrator, it shall be unlawful to deviate from
the approved plan.
   (P)   An approved plan shall become null and void if the applicant has
failed to make progress on the site within six months after the date of
approval. The Stormwater Administrator may grant a single, six-month extension
of this time limit, for good cause shown, upon receiving a written request from
the applicant before the expiration of the approved plan.
(2013 Code, § 20-6)
§ 52.07 PERMIT APPLICATION AND PLANS.
   (A)   (1)   The stormwater permit application and plan shall refer to the

facilitate plan review and construction. The plan drawings shall be presented
at a scale no smaller than one inch equals 50 feet.
(2013 Code, § 20-8)
§ 52.08 MAINTENANCE MANUAL.
   (A)   The stormwater permit application and plan shall be accompanied by an
operations and maintenance manual. The manual shall contain a narrative
describing each installed measure and device and its design specifications. The
manual shall indicate for each installed measure and device what operation and
maintenance actions are needed and what specific quantitative criteria will be
used to determine when these actions will be taken. The manual must indicate
the steps that will be taken to restore a measure or device to the design
specifications if a failure occurs.
   (B)   After the permit and plan is approved and installation is complete, if
changes have been made to any installed measure or device, the manual shall be
revised to reflect these changes, and such changes shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Stormwater Administrator.
(2013 Code, § 20-9)
§ 52.09 AS-BUILT PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The designer of the stormwater control plans shall provide as-built
plans of all stormwater control and management plans showing the field
location, size, depth, and planted vegetation of all measures and devices as
installed. If the previously submitted plans remain unchanged, an as-built
certification to the existing plans will be required. No certificate of
compliance or occupancy shall be issued without said as-built plans.
   (B)   The designer shall certify, under seal, that the as-built stormwater
measures and devices and their installation are in compliance with the county’s
stormwater ordinance.
   (C)   The designer shall submit a final electronic file of the stormwater
plan that is readable by GIS systems.
(2013 Code, § 20-10)
§ 52.10 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   In order to reduce drainage-related damage and hazards, adequate
natural drainage systems or stormwater management installations are required to
collect and transmit stormwater flows into either existing drainage facilities
or a natural drainage system.
   (B)   All storm drainage facilities shall be designed, constructed, and
maintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with
surface waters as a result of such improvements, specifically:
      (1)   Off-site areas which drain to or across a site proposed for
development must be accommodated in the stormwater plans for the development.
The stormwater management system must be capable of conveying the existing off-
site flows through or around the development such that the volume and rate of
flow from the adjacent property is not altered. If brush flows are earned in
the site system any detention system shall be sized to accommodate this flow.
The flow must be released to the original drainage area; and
      (2)   Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to limit the discharge
from the site to the rate that existed prior to development of the site. For
projects that are redeveloping a developed site, the discharge will be limited
to that which occurs before any new development. The type and location of the
discharge will be as occurred before the current development unless the
discharge is to a human-made conveyance system.
   (C)   All site improvements shall be provided with a drainage system that is
adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the development
site.
   (D)   These goals for discharge can be accomplished by designing,
constructing, and maintaining all stormwater management installations to the
extent practicable:
      (1)   Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including
measures which promote the infiltration of stormwater;
      (2)   Maximize the time of concentration of stormwater runoff; and
      (3)   Promote the filtration and precipitation of pollutants from
stormwater runoff in order to protect the water quality of the receiving
watercourse.
   (E)   Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development site shall
coordinate with and connect to the drainage systems or drainage ways on
surrounding properties or streets. Permission must be received from other
applicable entities for connection.
   (F)   To the extent practicable, all site improvements shall conform to the
natural contours of the land, and without disturbance, utilize the preexisting
natural and pre-existing human-made drainage ways.
   (G)   To the extent practicable, lot boundaries within subdivisions shall be
made to coincide with natural and preexisting human-made drainage ways to avoid
creation of lots that can only be built upon by altering such drainage ways.
   (H)   Stormwater shall not be diverted from one natural drainage basin into
another.
   (I)   Stormwater shall not be channeled or directed into sanitarily sewers.
   (J)   Stormwater controls shall not be located within the designated
floodway.
   (K)   No built upon area shall be located within 30 feet landward from any
perennial and intermittent surface waters. A surface water shall be deemed
present if the feature is approximately shown on either the most recent version
of the soil survey map prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the most recent version of the
quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the USGS.
   (L)   Streams shall not be relocated unless it is demonstrated that the
relocation of the stream will have a positive impact on water quality while
reducing velocity. All other applicable permits must be received.
(2013 Code, § 20-11)
§ 52.11 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Standards generally. Design standards are established for the purpose
of promoting sound development practices which respect, preserve and enhance
the county’s watercourses and are not intended to prohibit the use of
innovative and alternative techniques which can be demonstrated to have the
potential for successfully achieving the objectives stated in §
52.01.
   (B)   Design storm.
      (1)   The measures shall control and treat the difference in stormwater
runoff volume leaving the project site between the pre- and post-development
conditions for, at a minimum, the one-year, 24-hour storm. Runoff volume
drawdown time shall be a minimum of 48 hours, but not more than 120 hours.
      (2)   All structural stormwater treatment systems used to meet the
requirements of this chapter shall be designed to have a minimum of 85% average
annual removal for total suspended solids (TSS).
      (3)   The hillside development standards of Ch. 70 of the county’s code
of ordinances (§ 20-70-68) apply. This chapter limits the density of disturbed
area and impervious surfaces on steep slopes.
      (4)   The design of drainage facilities in flood hazard areas shall be
consistent with the requirements of the county’s flood damage prevention
ordinance. No stormwater controls shall be allowed within the floodway. No
built upon area shall be within 30 feet landward of any perennial and
intermittent surface water.
      (5)   The computation of stormwater runoff shall follow established
engineering practice. Acceptable methods of computation include the rational
method, the peak discharge method as described in U.S.D.A. Technical Release
Number 55 (TR-55), and U.S. Geological Survey regression equations, where
applicable. If an alternate method is proposed, the method should be described
and justification for using this method should be provided. The same method
must be used for both the pre- and post-development conditions.
      (6)   Runoff coefficients shall be based on full development of the
project and of the watershed to the extent of the current zoning or land use
patterns, and shall include the complete development of the site through build-
out, including roof tops and other impervious areas that may be proposed.
      (7)   (a)   Stormwater detention shall be provided to ensure that the
rate of discharge does not exceed the pre-development rate of discharge.
         (b)   In order to demonstrate this, pre- and post-development
hydrographs will be submitted that demonstrate no increase in flow leaving the
site during the one-year 24-hour storm. Inflow-outflow calculations shall also
be submitted for any stormwater detention ponds.
      (8)   Stormwater controls that drain in whole or part to designated trout
waters shall be designed
and shall implement the best stormwater practices that do not result in a
sustained increase in the receiving water temperature, while still meeting the
other requirements of this chapter.
(2013 Code, § 20-12)
§ 52.12 STORMWATER DESIGN MANUAL.
   The County Planning and Development Department may furnish additional
guidance and standards for the proper implementation of the regulations of this
chapter and may provide such information in the form of a Stormwater Design
Manual. Stormwater management practices that are designed, constructed, or
maintained in accord with the Stormwater Design Manual must be presumed to
comply with these regulations; however, the Stormwater Administrator shall have
the right to consult other engineers and duly qualified professionals, and to
impose any conditions or require any modifications deemed necessary to meet the
purpose, intent and requirements of this chapter.
(2013 Code, § 20-13)
§ 52.13 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Stormwater management facilities shall be constructed in accordance
with approved plans and maintained in proper working condition. The applicant/
property owner is responsible for ensuring that the construction of drainage
structures and stormwater management measures are completed in accordance with
the approved plan and specifications. Inspections which may be performed by the
county during construction will not relieve the developer of the responsibility
to install stormwater management and drainage facilities in accordance with the
approved plan.
   (B)   In response to a complaint, or as a compliance check with the
requirements of the ordinance, the Stormwater Administrator or the designee
shall perform a physical inspection of the construction of drainage structures
and stormwater management measures, or monitor long-term maintenance
procedures.
   (C)   The property owner will be notified in writing of any substandard and/
or non-conforming work identified by the Stormwater Administrator. The
notification shall state the specific work that is out of compliance, the
specific reasons for noncompliance, and the corrective measures necessary to
bring the work into compliance.
   (D)   Failure of the property owner or developer to correct substandard and/
or nonconforming work identified by the Stormwater Administrator shall be
sufficient reason to refuse or revoke building permits, and/or deny occupancy
permits for buildings serviced by said work. Appeals on determination of
nonconforming or substandard work and/or the adequacy of the corrective
measures executed shall be made in accordance with §
52.06. Pending the ruling on the appeal, the determination of the Stormwater
Administrator remains in effect.
   (E)   Revisions which affect the intent of the design or the capacity of the
system shall require prior written approval by the Stormwater Administrator.
(2013 Code, § 20-14)
§ 52.14 PERFORMANCE SECURITY AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The county will require the submittal of a surety performance bond
made by a surety bonding company licensed and authorized to do business in the
state, a bond of the owner/developer with an assignment to the county of a
certificate of deposit as security for the bond, a bond of the owner/developer
by an official bank check drawn in favor of the county and deposited with the
county, or cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited with the county
prior to issue of a permit in order to ensure that the stormwater system is
installed by the developer and functions as required by the approved stormwater
plan.
   (B)   The amount of an installation performance security shall be the total
estimated construction cost of the system and devices approved under the
permit, plus 25%.
   (C)   The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for
failure, after proper notice, to complete work within the time specified, or to
initiate or maintain any actions which may be required of the applicant in
accordance with this chapter.
   (D)   Upon default of the applicant to construct, maintain, repair, and if
necessary reconstruct any stormwater device in accordance with the applicable
permit, the Stormwater Administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of
the security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate.
Such expenditure of funds shall only be made after requesting the applicant to
comply with the permit. In the event of a default triggering the use of
installation of performance security, the county shall not return any of the
unused deposited cash funds or other security, which shall be retained for
maintenance.
   (E)   If the county takes action upon such failure by the applicant, the
county may collect the difference should the amount of the reasonable cost of
such action exceed the amount of the security held. This difference will be
collected from the applicant.
   (F)   Within 60 days of the final approval, the installation performance
security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated.
(2013 Code, § 20-15)
§ 52.15 COMPLETION.
   The developer is responsible for completing all stormwater improvements in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter and other applicable ordinance
and laws.
(2013 Code, § 20-16)
§ 52.16 ASSURANCE THAT IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MAINTAINED.
   (A)   The county may not approve a record plat, or in the case of single-lot
development not requiring a record plat may not issue a building permit, until
those stormwater improvements required of the developer have been completed or
a performance guarantee has been provided.
   (B)   Upon completion of required improvements, the design professional must
submit as-built plans, or certify the existing plans as-built if no changes
have occurred, of the installed stormwater improvements to the Stormwater
Administrator. These plans must indicate that stormwater improvements were
constructed in accordance with the county ordinance and approvals.
(2013 Code, § 20-17)
§ 52.17 MAINTENANCE.
   All stormwater improvements must be maintained so they will continue to
serve their intended functions.
   (A)   The developer must maintain stormwater improvements until accepted by
a property owners association or lot owner. The developer must disclose which
party will be responsible for continued maintenance on the record plat and on
the stormwater management plan. The developer will be responsible for the
installation, operations, and maintenance of the stormwater controls until
ownership is conveyed. The responsibility and agreement for operations and
maintenance for the stormwater system is transferred with title, as each
property is conveyed.
   (B)   Before improvements are accepted for maintenance by the property
owner’s association or lot owner, the developer or the developer’s engineer or
landscape architect must certify to the property owners association or lot
owner and to the county that improvements are complete and functioning as
designed.
   (C)   The developer must record, and reference on the record plat, an
operations and maintenance plan that instructs the property owners association
or lot owner about the annual operations and maintenance tasks for at least a
20-year period.
   (D)   (1)   The person responsible for maintenance of any stormwater
structure or feature installed pursuant to this chapter shall submit to the
Stormwater Administrator an inspection report annually from a qualified
registered state professional engineer, surveyor, or landscape architect
performing services only in their area of competence.
      (2)   The report shall contain the following:
         (a)   The name and address of the laud owner;
         (b)   The recorded book and page number of the lot of each stormwater
control;
         (c)   A statement that an inspection was made of all stormwater
controls and features;
         (d)   The date the inspection was made;
         (e)   A statement that all inspected controls and features are
performing properly and are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the
approved maintenance agreement required by this chapter; and
         (f)   The signature and seal of the engineer, surveyor, or landscape
architect.
      (3)   All inspection reports shall be on forms supplied by the Stormwater
Administrator. An original inspection report shall be provided to the
Stormwater Administrator beginning one year from the date of as-built
certification and each year thereafter on or before the date of the as-built
certification.
      (4)   It will be the responsibility of the property owners association or
lot owner to update the plan annually.
   (E)   The developer must record and reference on the record plat a
maintenance agreement, or restrictive covenant that sets forth the property
owner’s association’s or lot owner’s continuing responsibilities for

towed only after notice to the registered owner or person entitled to
possession of the vehicle. In the case of a nuisance vehicle or a junked motor

entided to the possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee, or occupant of
the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be ascertained in the

mail. Reasonable diligence shall include notification to the registered owner
of the vehicle at his or her last known address according to the latest

vehicle which has been determined to be an abandoned vehicle on private
property, nuisance vehicle or junked motor vehicle who has received a notice

case of notice for removal of a junked motor vehicle where the determination
has been made that the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the
burdens on the private property owner, in accordance with §

motor vehicle may appeal that determination. Any appeal shall be made within
ten days upon receipt of the notice for removal of the vehicle as provided in

Commissioners in writing. Appeals held pursuant to this section shall be
conducted by the Town Board of Commissioners within 45 days after the receipt

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Pursuant to authority granted by the State Legislature as contained in G.S.
Ch. 143, Art. 21, pt. 6; Ch. 160A, Art. 19, pts. 3, 5, and 8; and Ch. 160A,
Art. 8, delegated local governmental units have the authority and
responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners, does ordain
as follows.
(2013 Code, Ch. 21)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(2013 Code, Ch. 21)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the conduction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(2013 Code, Ch. 21)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges)
that are located in flood-prone areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.
(2013 Code, Ch. 21)

   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05. Structures located in A, AE, AO, and A1-30 Zones may be flood-proofed
to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation; provided,
that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are water-tight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall certify that the standards of this division (B) are satisfied.
Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set
forth in §
151.41(C), along with the operational maintenance plans.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the state regulations for manufactured homes adopted by the
Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15. Additionally, when the
elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above
the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or
engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in
height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of §
151.41(C).
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with an approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed areas, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      (3)   (a)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, flood openings

area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
            4.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
            5.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
            6.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefor, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:

   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20
feet each side from top bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever
is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined based on the following criteria.
      (1)   When the base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or flood-proofed in accordance with standards in §§
151.26 and
151.29.
      (2)   When floodway or non-encroachment data is available from a federal,

or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development
within such areas:
   (A)   Standards of §§
151.25 and
151.26; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.

§ 151.29 FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   (A)   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located
within the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.07. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles.
   (B)   The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in §§
151.25 and
151.26, shall apply to all development within such areas.
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice, and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         (b)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion
of the proposed encroachment.
      (2)   If division (B)(1) above is satisfied, all development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   No new manufactured homes shall be permitted. Replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be
permitted, provided, the following provisions are met:
         (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
151.26(C); and
         (b)   The no encroachment standards of division (B)(1) above.
      (4)   No new habitable structures, included structures used for working,
sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom facilities, shall be permitted in
floodways and non-encroachment areas.

counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter.
      (2)   Following the hearing, the Floodplain Administrator may issue an
order affirming modifying or rescinding the original finding or may enter such
other finding or order as the Floodplain Administrator may deem just and proper
consistent with the provisions of this chapter including, but not limited to,
order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
applicable.
   (C)   Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of this chapter, he or she shall issue
an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation
within a specified time period, not less than 60 calendar days, nor more than
180 calendar days. Where the Floodplain Administrator finds that there is

      (1)   Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may
appeal the order to the Board of Adjustment by giving notice of appeal in
writing to the Floodplain Administrator and Clerk within ten days following

is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
      (2)   Functionally dependent facilities if determined to meet the
definition as stated in §
151.05, provided provisions of divisions (I)(2), (I)(3), and (I)(5) below have

variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief; and
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval; and

system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing principal streets
shall be extended.
      (2)   (a)   All proposals for street extensions or proposals for

or property line and the front line of the building, projected to the side lot
lines of the lot. Driveways, to the extent possible, shall enter the property
through the front yard. In the case of a lot with frontage on more than one
street, the side of the lot with the most street frontage shall be considered
the FRONT YARD; however, in the consideration and determination of applications
for special use or variance on such a lot, the Board of Adjustment shall take
into account and consider the visibility of both the FRONT and side yards to
the street and adjoining properties in any determination.
      YARD, REAR. An open, unoccupied space on the same lot with a principal
building, extending the full width of the lot and situated between the rear
line of the lot and the rear line of the building projected to the side lines
of the lot.
      YARD, SIDE. An open, unoccupied space on the same lot with a principal
building extending the full width of the lot and being situated between the
building and the side lot line and extending from the rear line of the front
yard to the front line of the rear yard. Notwithstanding the above definition,
for the purposes of determining compliance with minimum yard setback of §
153.007, the SIDE YARD shall be the entire length of each side lot line
extending from the front lot line to the rear lot line and shall equally apply
to lots with a principal building, lots without a principal building and vacant
lots. Driveways shall not be located in the side yard setback.
      ZONING ADMINISTRATOR. An official or designated person of the Town of
Biltmore Forest charged with enforcing and administering the zoning ordinance.

§ 153.005 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP.
   (A)   Use districts. For the purpose of this chapter, the town is hereby
divided into the following use districts:
      (1)   R-1 Residential District;
      (2)   R-2 Residential District;
      (3)   R-3 Residential District;
      (4)   R-4 Residential District;
      (5)   R-5 Residential District; and
      (6)   P-S Public Service District.
   (B)   Establishment of district boundaries. The boundaries of these
districts are hereby established as shown on the official zoning map of the
town.
   (C)   Establishment of zoning map. A zoning map, entitled the “Official
Zoning Map of the Town of Biltmore Forest,” depicts all approved use districts
and their respective boundaries. Such map is hereby made a part of this chapter
and shall be maintained by the Town Zoning Administrator and updated to reflect
changes and amendments to this zoning ordinance. This map shall be available
for inspection by interested persons during normal business hours of the Town
Zoning Administrator. It shall be the duty of the Town Zoning Administrator to
maintain the map and post any changes thereto as they may be made.
   (D)   Rules governing district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with
respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the
zoning map, the following shall apply:
      (1)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways, alleys, streams, rivers, or other bodies of water, shall be
construed to follow such lines;
      (2)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines;
      (3)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following town limit lines
shall be construed as following such town limit lines;
      (4)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways or railroads, or
rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being
parallel thereto and at such distance therefor as indicated on the zoning map.
If no distance is given on the map, such dimension shall be determined by the
use of the scale shown on said zoning map; and
      (5)   Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with
those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered
by divisions (D)(1) through (D)(4) above, the Board of Adjustment shall
interpret the district boundaries.
   (E)   Statement of district intents.
      (1)   R-1 Residential District.
         (a)   The R-1 Residential District encompasses most of the town’s
developed residential areas and contains residential structures of historical
and architectural significance in a most unique residential environment. The
intent of the R-1 District is to preserve and enhance the character of existing
neighborhoods and generally to provide a pleasant living environment. These
neighborhoods consist of single-family owner occupied detached dwelling units
placed on relatively large lots with considerable open spaces between
structures, thus creating a low-density residential environment.
         (b)   Nonresidential uses, including home occupations, have been
limited in this District as a means of maintaining the character of these
neighborhoods. Likewise, dimensional requirements pertaining to lot size,
building setbacks, yard requirements, and height limitations have been
established to promote the general welfare and preservation of the community.
         (c)   Future construction and alteration of existing structures should
be oriented at maintaining and enhancing the existing character of the
residential neighborhoods. Therefore, structures should be compatible in
materials, height, siting, color, texture, scale, and proportion to the other
structures in the neighborhood. The R-1 District also contains undeveloped
areas to provide locations for future single-family subdivisions.
         (d)   Consistent with, and to protect the existing character of the
neighborhoods in this District, home stays and short term rentals are not
allowed.
      (2)   R-2 Residential District.
         (a)   The R-2 Residential District is established to protect and
maintain existing neighborhoods, which are characterized by single-family
residences with smaller lots, and thus greater residential densities than found
in the R-1 District.
         (b)   As in the R-1, nonresidential uses, including home occupations,
have been limited in this District as a means of assuring a pleasant
residential atmosphere.
         (c)   Consistent with and to protect and preserve the character of the
neighborhoods in this District, home stays and short term rentals are not
allowed.
      (3)   R-3 Residential District.
         (a)   The R-3 Residential District is intended to provide locations
that will accommodate future residential growth south of the Blue Ridge
Parkway. This District is intended to provide locations for future subdivisions
and for planned unit residential developments as special uses when design plans
show that such developments will be compatible with the surrounding development
and available public services.
         (b)   This District is primarily a low-density residential district;
however, to accommodate contemporary design and building practices, it includes
residential planned unit developments as a conditional use at a maximum density
of eight dwelling units per acre. Nonresidential uses, including home
occupations, will also be limited in the R-3 District in order to maintain the
same quiet and pleasant living environment as found in the R-1 and R-
2 Districts.
         (c)   Consistent with and to protect and preserve the character of the
neighborhoods in this District, home stays and short term rentals are not
allowed.
      (4)   R-4 Residential District.
         (a)   The R-4 Residential District provides areas for residential
uses, and for special uses professional offices and commercial services. Urban
sprawl, strip commercial development, and congestion will be discouraged by
promoting good design and clustered development. These areas should provide
sufficient space for ample off-street parking and well designed entrances and
exits to avoid traffic congestion and safety hazards.
         (b)   Land uses in this District, other than single-family detached
dwelling units, will require a special use permit as a means of assuring and
promoting safety and good design. The integrity of residential uses in this
zone will be preserved by requiring a 20-foot wide buffer strip between
residential and nonresidential uses.
         (c)   Consistent with and to protect and preserve the character of the
neighborhoods in this District, home stays and short term rentals are not
allowed.
      (5)   R-5 Residential District.
         (a)   The medium-density district is established as a district where
both residential and business uses are accommodated. In addition, a wide range
of community facilities and services are also available. It is intended that
nonresidential uses, including business uses, shall be compatible with and
exist in harmony with the community in which they are located and that adequate
standards will be maintained pertaining to the public health, safety, and
welfare.
         (b)   In addition, these areas should provide sufficient space for
ample off-street parking and well designed entrances and exits to avoid
congestion and safety hazards. Most land use in this District will require a
special use permit as a means of assuring and promoting safety and good design.
         (c)   Consistent with and to protect and preserve the character of the
neighborhoods in this District, home stays and short term rentals are not
allowed.
      (6)   P-S Public Service District.
         (a)   This District is designed to provide for open green spaces,
including forestation and other natural vegetation throughout the jurisdiction.
         (b)   It is to be used to protect the ambiance of the community by
providing a series of natural buffers between residential and nonresidential
development.
         (c)   It is expressly intended that any structures and/or buildings
shall be prohibited except as associated with a public park or recreational
area. Any land-disturbing activity such as driveway connections or landscaping
shall be approved by the Board of Adjustment.

   (B)   General provisions. The following are footnotes applicable to the
table in division (A).
      (1)   Footnote 1. The minimum lot area for lots not served by public
water and/or sewer shall be subject to approval by the County Health Department
to ensure the proper operation of septic tanks and wells. In no case, however,
shall minimum lot area be less than those specified in the table in division
(A).
      (2)   Footnote 2. The minimum lot width at the street line shall be 125
feet in the R-1 District, and 80 feet in the R-2, R-3, and R-4 Districts.
      (3)   Footnote 3. On all corner lots, a 30-foot side yard setback is
required.
      (4)   Footnote 4. Accessory structures, including driveways, shall meet
all setback requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, setback requirements
for driveway entrance columns or driveway entrance walls may be waived or
modified by the Board of Adjustment with the granting of a special use permit
in accordance with §
153.110(C), without the need for a variance pursuant to §
153.110(D).
      (5)   Footnote 5. Height requirements may be varied upon approval of the
Board of Adjustment.
      (6)   Footnote 6. Whichever is greater, 20,000 square feet, or twice the
gross floor area of the building.
      (7)   Footnote 7. An increase in the side and rear yard setbacks is
required for homes (structures) that exceed 25 feet in height. Homes
(structures) greater than 25 feet in height shall be setback from the side and
rear property lines an additional one and one-half feet for each one foot, or
portion thereof, that the home (structure) exceeds 25 feet in height.
      (8)   Footnote 8. Structures exceeding a roof coverage area of 7,000
square feet shall be set back from side and rear property lines an additional
20% of the required setback for each 500 square feet, or increment thereof,
that the roof coverage areas exceeds 7,000 square feet.
         Example:   The rear setback for a single story 8,200 square foot house
in the R-1 District would be calculated as follows:
                  8,200 - 7,000 = 1,200
                  1,200/500 = 2.4 (round to 3 to account for increment of
change)
                  3 x 20% = 60%
                  60% x 20 = 12
                  25 + 12 = 37
                  Rear setback will be 37 feet

§ 153.008 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Purpose. The following special uses might not be appropriate without
specific standards and requirements to assure that such uses are compatible
with the other uses permitted in the designated districts. Such uses may be
permitted in a zoning district as special uses if the provisions of this and
all other sections of this chapter have been met.
   (B)   Development plan/site plan requirement.
      (1)   All applications for special use permits shall include a
development plan or site plan.
      (2)   If the special use request is for a subdivision or planned unit
development, the development plan shall contain a map or maps drawn to scale,
with the date of preparation, and shall contain, where applicable, the
following information:
         (a)   Existing site conditions, including contours, watercourses,
identified flood hazard areas, any unique natural or human-made features;
         (b)   Boundary lines of the proposed development, proposed lot lines,
and plot designs;
         (c)   Proposed location and use of all existing and proposed
structures;
         (d)   Location and size of all areas to be conveyed dedicated or
reserved as common open space, parks, recreational areas, school sites, and
similar public or semi-public uses;
         (e)   The existing and proposed street system, including location and
number of off-street parking spaces, service areas, loading areas, and major
points of access to public right-of-way. Notations of proposed ownership of the
street system (public or private);
         (f)   Approximate location of proposed utility systems, including
documentation approving the proposed water and sewer systems from the
appropriate local and state agencies. Documentation of an approved
sedimentation and erosion control plan shall also be submitted where required.
Provisions for stormwater drainage shall be shown;
         (g)   Location and/or notation of existing and proposed easements and
rights-of-way;
         (h)   The proposed treatment of the perimeter of the development,
including materials and/or techniques such as screens, fences, and walls;
         (i)   Information on adjacent land areas, including land use, zoning
classifications, public facilities, and any unique natural features;
         (j)   Where applicable, the following written documentation shall be
submitted:
            1.   A legal description of the total site proposed for
development, including a statement of present and proposed ownership;
            2.   The zoning district or districts in which the project is
located;
            3.   A development schedule indicating approximate beginning and
completion dates of the development, including any proposed stages;
            4.   A statement of the applicant's intentions with regard to the
future selling and/or leasing of all or portions of the development;
            5.   Quantitative data for the following: proposed total number and
type of residential dwelling units; parcel size; residential densities
(dwelling units per acre); and total amount of open space; and
            6.   Plan for maintenance of common areas, recreation areas, open
spaces, streets, and utilities.
         (k)   Any additional information required by the Board of Adjustment
in order to evaluate the impact of the proposed development. The Board of
Adjustment may waive a particular requirement if, in its opinion, the inclusion
is not essential to a proper decision of the project.
   (C)   Special use standards.
      (1)   Generally, the following standards are applied to specific special
uses. Before issuing a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment shall find
that all standards for specific uses listed in these sections as well as all
standards or requirements listed in division (B) above and § 153.110(C)( 1)
have been met.
      (2)   Planned unit developments.
         (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this division is to encourage and
provide for flexibility and innovation in the design and location of structures
and land development, to provide for mixtures of housing types, to provide for
the most efficient use of land resources, and to provide an opportunity to
develop land areas in a manner different from the standard arrangement of one
principal building on one lot. Residential densities are calculated on a
project basis, thus allowing the clustering of buildings in each proposed
planned unit development project in order to create useful open spaces and
preserve natural site features. It is further intended that a planned unit
development will be in harmony with the character of the district in which it
is located.
         (b)   Planned unit development defined. In this chapter, a PLANNED
UNIT DEVELOPMENT means a development where more than one principal building is
proposed to be constructed on a single tract or a clustered housing development
or any residential complex containing at least six or more units or any
building with a gross floor area of 50,000 square feet or more, shall be deemed
a PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD). Multi-family structures shall have no less
than three dwelling units per structure. Residential units within a planned
unit development may include single-family detached or attached units,
townhouse developments, condominiums, and other multi- family type residential
units, excluding time sharing units, mobile homes, and mobile home parks.
         (c)   Land development standards.
            1.   The following land development standards shall apply for all
planned unit developments.
            2.   These planned unit developments may be located only in certain
specified districts as special uses, subject to a finding by the Board of
Adjustment that the following conditions be met.
               a.   Ownership control. The land in a planned unit development
shall be under single ownership or management by the applicant before final
approval and/or construction, or proper assurances (legal title or execution of
a binding sales agreement) shall be provided that the development can be
successfully completed by the applicant.
               b.   Land uses permitted and location of PUDs. The uses
permitted within a planned unit development are limited to residential uses,
including multi-family residential units, and those land uses normally allowed
(as either permitted or special) in the zoning district within which the PUD is
located. PUDs shall be permitted in the R-3, R-4, and R-5 Districts. All PUDs
must be compatible with and not violate the intent of the zoning districts.
               c.   Density requirements. The proposed residential density of a
planned unit development (dwelling units per acre as shown in § 153.007) shall
conform to that permitted in the district in which the development is located.
If the planned unit development lies in more than one district, the number of
allowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each portion of the
planned unit development that is in a separate district and must be combined to
determine the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire planned unit
development.
               d.   Frontage requirements. Planned unit developments shall have
access to a highway or road suitable for the scale and density of development
being proposed.
               e.   Minimum requirements.
                  i.   Waiver. The normal minimum lot size, setbacks, and
frontage requirements are hereby waived for the planned unit development;
provided, that the spirit and intent of this section are complied with in the
total development plan, as determined by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of
Adjustment shall exercise ultimate discretion as to whether the total
development plan does comply with the spirit and intent of this section.
                  ii.   Height limitations. No building or structure shall
exceed the height limitations of the district in which it is located, except as

this chapter where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably
likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact
on the member. A governing board member shall not vote on any zoning amendment

of due process include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion
prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex
parte communications, a close familial, business, or other associational
relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of
the matter.
   (F)   Resolution of objection. If an objection is raised to a board member's

a prepared driveway/parking surface (asphalt/pavement, concrete, pavers,
gravel, pebbles) located on the lot or tract, or located on any adjoining lots
or tracts, of the principal residence or structure. Parking on grassed areas,
dirt/soil areas, mulched areas, landscaped areas, or any other natural areas of
a lot or tract is expressly prohibited. This provision is applicable to all
zoning districts within the town.
         (b)   Temporary parking (less than five hours per day) is excepted
from the requirements of this section for vehicles operated by persons who are
visiting the owners or occupiers of the residence.
         (c)   Nothing herein shall be deemed to modify or impact, in any way,
the requirements found under §

§ 153.040 NO LOT SUBDIVISION OF PLATTED AND RECORDED LOTS.
   (A)   It is the express intention and purpose of this chapter to preserve
the town as primarily a low- density residential area. To this end, subject to
§
153.042, the number of lots within the town shall be limited to those lots as
shown on plats recorded in the County Register of Deeds. Therefore, upon
adoption of this chapter, all lots in the town that have been previously
platted and recorded with the County Register of Deeds shall be deemed and
established as individual lots, and shall remain individual lots, and shall not
be subdivided.
   (B)   If an owner has acquired contiguous or adjoining lots, and the
terminology of the deeds or other instruments of conveyance expresses intent
that the lots shall be joined together as one residential lot, the lots shall
thereafter be considered as one residential lot and shall not be subdivided
into individual lots. If an owner of contiguous or adjoining lots develops the
lots together, locating a residence on such lot or lots, and has landscaped the
same or located other improvements, structures, or amenities on the lots so
that from the standpoint of utility or appearance the lots seem to constitute
one residential site, then the property shall not thereafter be subdivided, nor
revert back to individual, separate lots.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall preclude property owners from subdividing
unimproved previously platted and recorded lots, so as to enlarge existing
residential lots or building sites. This subdivided lot shall not thereafter be
reestablished as a separate residential lot.

TREE PRESERVATION
§ 153.050 PURPOSE.
   (A)   In order to maintain the unique characteristics of the town as a
residential neighborhood with a history beginning as part of the Vanderbilt
Estate, it is necessary to preserve the traditional appearance of Biltmore
Forest as a true forest. This is particularly true of trees along the roads and
around the perimeter of lots. Trees provide buffer and a natural canopy, and
are a hallmark of the town requiring protection. The town is focused on
maintaining the current health of the forest and increasing species diversity,
with a primary goal to replace hardwood trees, other native trees, and trees of
preference more quickly. Trees provide shade, cooling, noise and wind
reduction, prevent soil erosion, produce oxygen, filter dust, and absorb carbon
dioxide. Trees also provide natural habitat and aesthetic enhancement in the
town.
   (B)   Preservation and appropriate replacement of trees is the intent of
this chapter. This chapter shall apply to all properties within the town except
as noted in division (C) below.
   (C)   This chapter does not apply to properties owned, leased, or controlled
by the town. This chapter does not apply to properties that perform forestry
activity on forestland taxed on the basis of its present-use value as
forestland under G.S. Article 12, Chapter 105. Once an active forestry
management plan is no longer in place, the exception for the property will be
removed. Property owners with an active forestry management plan shall provide
a current copy of this plan to the town each calendar year by January 31.
   (D)   This subchapter applies to residential and non-residential tree
removal that does not involve construction activity. Refer to §
153.034 for landscaping plan requirements and §
153.061 for tree removal and replacement guidelines related to all construction
activity.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.051 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   NON-RESIDENTIAL USES. For the purposes of this chapter, non-residential uses
may include specific uses found throughout the town that do not encompass
single-family or multi-family residential dwellings. These uses may exist
within a residential zoning district, but by actual use, are not residential in
nature. Examples of these uses include, but are not limited to, public or
private schools; country, athletic, and social clubs; medical or dental offices
and campuses.
   ORDINANCE ADMINISTRATOR. For the purposes of this chapter, the ordinance
administrator charged with administration, inspection, review, and enforcement
is the Town Manager or his or her designee.
   OUTDOOR RECREATION ACTIVITIES. Leisure-time activities, usually of a formal
nature and often performed with others, requiring equipment, and taking place
at prescribed non-residential places, sites, or fields. Active recreational
uses and supporting services include swimming, tennis, golf, baseball and other
field sports, track, and playground activities.
   PROTECTED TREE. A protected tree is any tree six inches or more in diameter
at a height of four and one-half feet from the ground (DBH-diameter at breast
height) that is in sound, healthy condition.
   RECOMMENDED PLANTING LIST (RPL). A list developed and updated by the town
arborist that includes preferred species based on the tree being removed and
acceptable replacement locations. For all replanting requirements, a minimum of
50% of the total replacement trees must come from the RPL with 25% of the total
replacement trees being those species identified as trees of preference, as
defined below. A minimum of one tree scheduled for replacement shall come from
the tree of preference (TOP) list as defined below. The replanting list may be
updated periodically and is available on the town’s website.
   RESIDENTIAL USES. For the purposes of this chapter, residential uses include
single-family detached dwelling units found within the R-1, R-2, and R-3 zoning
districts and includes attached multi-family residential units found within the
R-1, R-2, and R-3 zoning districts.
   SETBACKS. The minimum yard setback requirement found in §
153.007. INSIDE SETBACK AREA is the length found from the street or property
line, and OUTSIDE SETBACK AREA is the remainder of the property area. An
example of setback locations are shown below.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1017.jpg]
   TREES OF PREFERENCE (TOP ). Trees that warrant additional attention and
regulation due to being a preferred native species or having distinctive height
and/or diameter. TREES OF PREFERENCE include any healthy, living tree with the
following characteristics.
      (1)   Has a trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) of 36 inches or more;
      (2)   Any tree native to North Carolina per the United States Department
of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service Plants Database with a
trunk DBH of 30 inches or more.
   UNPROTECTED TREE. A tree that is six inches or more in diameter at a height
of four and one-half feet from the ground, and is dead, produces no foliage
during normal growing seasons, or a tree that is diseased or damaged to the
extent that it is structurally compromised and poses a safety hazard, or a tree
that, for any other reason, poses a safety hazard. Safety hazard concerns are
evaluated by the town arborist in accordance with best management practices
developed by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA).
   UNREGULATED TREE. A tree that is less than six inches in diameter,
regardless of height or species, is to be unregulated and not subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.052 REMOVAL OF PROTECTED TREES.
   (A)   No person shall remove or in any way damage any protected tree on a
property without receiving approval from the appropriate regulatory review body
for the removal and paying any applicable fee. Any protected trees removed
shall be replaced as outlined in §
153.057 below.
   (B)   If the Ordinance Administrator concludes the removal of the number of
protected trees requested would be undesirable, and not within the letter or
intent of this chapter, he or she may refuse to approve such removal, or permit
the removal of a lesser number of protected trees. Further, in his or her
discretion, the Ordinance Administrator may require that the applicant provide
a tree survey showing the location, size, and type of protected trees on a
property, including common scientific names. The tree survey shall clearly
indicate which protected trees are indicated for removal and which will be left
undisturbed. In the case of new construction, the site plan must show the
location of building, driveways, terraces, and other structures on the
property. All protected trees must be clearly tagged as to retention or
removal. The Ordinance Administrator may also require an applicant to provide
documentary evidence, in the form of a survey or other documentation
sufficient, in the opinion of the Ordinance Administrator, to confirm that the
protected tree(s) are on the applicant’s property. An applicant has the right
to appeal a decision of the Ordinance Administrator to the Board of Adjustment
within five business days of the decision.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.053 APPLICATIONS FOR REMOVAL OF MORE THAN TEN PROTECTED TREES.
   An application to remove more than ten protected trees in 12 successive
months shall be made to the appropriate regulatory review authority as shown
below. A fee for this application shall be paid along with the application.

§ 153.054 REMOVAL OF UNPROTECTED TREES.
   (A)   An unprotected tree may be removed by the property owner after
notifying the town of the plans to remove the tree(s) and receiving approval to
do so from the Ordinance Administrator.
   (B)   The Ordinance Administrator may require the property owner to retain a
certified arborist to render an opinion as to the health and structural
integrity of the tree(s) in question and report the findings, in writing, to
the town before final approval is given. The town reserves the right to consult
with its own tree specialist to confirm the health and condition of any tree(s)
prior to removal.
   (C)   Any unprotected trees removed shall be replaced as defined in §
153.057 below.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.055 ENFORCEMENT.
   Any unauthorized removal, cutting, or damage to protected or unprotected
tree(s) may result in the Ordinance Administrator placing a stop-work order on
any activity on the property. This order shall remain in effect until all
corrections are made to bring the property into compliance with this chapter,
up to and including a final landscaping plan showing the full tree replacement
as required by §
153.057 below.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.056 DRIP LINE PROTECTION.
   The health of protected trees requires the prevention of soil disturbance
within the drip line of the trees. Covering this area with pavement or other
materials, including excess soil, can affect the health of the tree. Final
landscape plans shall protect this area around the tree and denote tree save
areas on the plan.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.057 REPLACEMENT OF TREES.

T   If removed trees include identified trees of preference (TOP)
species, replanting requirements will follow 36"+ DBH requirements
 
   (B)   A replacement tree may be planted up to one year prior to the removal
of any tree in order to count toward replacement. Replacement trees planted
after existing tree removal shall be in the ground within six months of removal
of the original tree. The Ordinance Administrator may, for good cause shown,
and in his or her sole discretion, extend this period for an additional six
months.
   (C)   The town’s recommended planting list (RPL) shall be utilized by
applicants when determining what species of trees are to be replanted. A
minimum of 50% of the total replacement trees shall come from the RPL with a
minimum of 25% of total replacement trees coming from the trees of preference
(TOP) list. A minimum of one tree scheduled for replacement shall come from the
tree of preference (TOP) list. Variation from these requirements must be
granted by the Ordinance Administrator prior to approval and planting.
   (D)   See the above charts for the minimum replacement size for all
deciduous trees. Evergreen trees that are planted as replacement trees shall be
a minimum of six feet in height at the time of planting.
   (E)   (1)   Depending on the proximity of other trees and/or structures,
lesser quantities of replacement trees may be authorized by the Ordinance
Administrator or by the Board of Adjustment (in the case of an appeal to the
town) or the Ordinance Administrator may authorize the replanting or
replacement of trees in a location or locations where such replacement trees
are more likely to survive. For existing residential lots where mature canopies
remain after tree removal, replacement requirements may be amended regarding
location and species to provide the best opportunity for healthy growth. This
replacement requirement discretion is meant solely to allow for maintenance of
existing residential lots where the canopy is thick and growing new trees would
be impractical and/or difficult. This allowance is not intended for new
residential construction.
      (2)   For non-residential lots, if replanting inside the setback results
in an adverse condition to town roads, other public property, other private
property, or results in an undue hardship for an outdoor recreation activity, a
variance application may be filed with the Board of Adjustment to replant the
appropriate number of trees in a different location.
      (3)   Non-residential properties that include an outdoor recreation
activity as a primary purpose, as defined above, are provided a tree removal
allowance not to exceed net 50 trees outside the setback of the property in a
calendar year. Net removal is defined as the number of protected trees removed
minus the number of trees re-planted on the property where the outdoor
recreation activity occurs. Prior to removal of trees pursuant to this section,
the property owner should submit to the Ordinance Administrator notice of the
tree(s) to be removed. For purposes of this net removal allowance, a property
owner needs only to submit to the Ordinance Administrator documentation of any
protected trees removed and any trees replanted as a record of same for each
calendar year. Unprotected trees outside the setback of a non-residential
property with an outdoor recreation activity as a primary purpose may be
removed without replacement, provided that notice is given to the Ordinance
Administrator regarding the necessity for removal.
   (F)   The town encourages a diversity of species during replanting, with a
focus on replenishing hardwood trees within the forest. However, to provide
appropriate screening and buffering, particularly among non-residential uses,
trees that have a lower canopy (height) at maturity are also encouraged for
inclusion in a replanting plan. This combination will ensure the canopy is
varied in both height and species.
   (G)   Replacement trees shall not be planted within the town’s right-of-way
or in an area to obstruct the view of traffic.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.058 INSPECTIONS, APPEALS, BOND, AND PENALTY.
   (A)   All protected trees designated to remain, pursuant to a tree survey,
plus any replacement trees shall be inspected by the Ordinance Administrator
six months following any construction to ensure the trees are in a healthy
condition. The Ordinance Administrator may require replacement or replanting of
replacement trees if the appropriate replacement trees are not in place during
this review.
   (B)   Any person aggrieved by a decision made under this subchapter by the
Ordinance Administrator may file, within five days after the date of such
decision, a petition to have such decision reviewed and acted upon by the Board
of Adjustment. The decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be subject to
review by the Board of Commissioners.
   (C)   At the option of the town, a bond or other type of guarantee can be
required of the property owner and/or applicant when submitting a tree removal
application to ensure all replanting requirements are met to the satisfaction
of the town.
   (D)   Any violation of this chapter shall be subject to the penalty
provisions found in §
153.999.
(Ord. 2023-06, passed 10-9-2023)
BUFFERS, SCREENING, AND LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS
§ 153.060 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The town has an abundant and diverse tree and vegetative cover that is
essential to the aesthetic value of the town and provides numerous ecological
and economic benefits.
   (B)   Landscape requirements for new construction and substantial additions
are set forth below, in order to:
      (1)   Encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation on
undeveloped residential lots and ensure the reforestation of the lot when tree
removal is required for any construction activities.
      (2)   Ensure landscape plans presented to the town include considerations
for native species, reforestation, environmental protection, and effective
stormwater management.
   (C)   The landscape and buffering standards set forth below require buffers
and landscaping between dissimilar land uses, along public rights-of-way, and
within parking lots, in order to:
      (1)   Encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation and
replenish removed vegetation;
      (2)   Protect and improve the visual quality of the town and minimize the
negative impacts of development such as noise, dust, litter, glare of lights,
traffic, heat, overcrowding, odor, and views of unsightly parking lots,
utilities, and mechanical systems and buildings;
      (3)   Provide environmental benefits such as climate modification,
decreased energy consumption, reduced stormwater runoff, decreased erosion,
improved water and air quality, and protection of wildlife habitat;
      (4)   Provide a transition between dissimilar land uses to protect
abutting properties from potential negative impacts of neighboring development
and to preserve the character and value of property and to provide a sense of
privacy; and
      (5)   Improve standards for quantity, location, size, spacing,
protection, and maintenance of plants and other screening materials to assure a
high level of quality in the appearance of the town while allowing flexibility
to promote well-designed and creative landscape plantings.

   (D)   Alternative compliance.
      (1)   The landscape requirements are intended to set minimum standards
for quality development and environmental protection and are not intended to be
arbitrary or inhibit creative solutions. Site conditions or other reasons may
justify the need to request an alternate method of compliance with the
landscape requirements. The Board of Adjustment, in consultation with the
Design Review Board, may alter the requirements of this section as long as the
existing or added landscape features of the development site comply with the
intent of this chapter.
      (2)   Requests for alternative compliance shall be accepted if one or
more of the following conditions are met.
         (a)   Topography, geologic features, drainage channels or streams,
existing natural vegetation, overhead or underground utilities, or other
conditions make it unreasonable or meaningless to plant a buffer or meet other
landscape requirements;
         (b)   Space limitations, unusually shaped lots, unique relationships
to other properties, and/or prevailing practices in the surrounding
neighborhood (such as use of a specific type of vegetation) may justify
alternative compliance when changing the use type of an existing building in an
established mature neighborhood; or
         (c)   An alternative compliance proposal is equal or better than
normal compliance in its ability to fulfill the intent of the ordinance, and
exhibits superior design quality.
      (3)   The property owner must submit a plan of the area for which
alternative compliance is requested to the Town Manager 14 days prior to the
meeting of the Design Review Board at which the request will be considered. The
site plan shall show existing site features and any additional material the
property owner will plant or construct to meet the intent of the buffer, street
tree, and parking lot tree requirements.
      (4)   In addition, the applicant must submit a written statement
explaining and justifying the need for alternative compliance. Upon
recommendation from the Design Review Board following their review, alternative
compliance plan shall then be considered by the Board of Adjustment.
Alternative compliance shall be limited to the specific project being reviewed
and shall not establish a precedent for acceptance in other cases.

§ 153.062 EXISTING VEGETATION IN R-4 OR R-5 ZONES.
   (A)   Preserving trees can improve the aesthetic quality of the site and
improve property values, provide environmental benefits, and mitigate the
impacts of development on the community. It is recommended that groups of trees
be preserved, as well as individual trees. Existing trees and shrubs designated
for preservation may be credited towards required buffer trees, street trees,
and parking lot trees at the discretion of the Ordinance Administrator as
described below.
   (B)   As required in §
153.052, no person shall remove or in any way damage any protected trees
without first filing an application for the removal and receiving approval from
the town. This requirement is applicable to both residential and non-
residential uses within the town.
   (C)   Special attention shall be given to protected trees located within 20
feet of the of the rear or side property line of property meeting the
definition of an incompatible land use.
      (1)   Credits and other incentives to preserve vegetation within non-
residential land use.
         (a)   Vegetation located in the buffer strip. One existing evergreen
shrub over four feet high located in the buffer strip may be credited for two
new shrubs, also on a case-by-case basis by the Board of Adjustment.
         (b)   Vegetation located elsewhere on the property.
            1.   Trees designated for preservation may be credited at the rate
of the following.
 
Two-inch to six-inch caliper tree = one tree
Seven-inch to 12-inch caliper tree = two trees
Thirteen-inch to 18-inch caliper tree = three trees
Nineteen-inch to 24-inch caliper tree= four trees
Twenty-five-inch and greater= five trees
 
            2.   One existing shrub over four feet high may be credited for two
new shrubs. In order to receive credit, vegetation designated for preservation
shall be in good health and condition. Trees and shrubs designated to be
preserved shall be indicated on the landscape and grading plan, as well as all
protective barriers. If a tree or shrub designated for preservation dies within
five years of the project’s completion, it must be replaced with the total
number of trees or shrubs which were credited to the existing tree or shrub
within six months from removal of the dead trees or shrubs.
      (2)   Protection of existing trees and shrubs during construction.
         (a)   1.   No grading or other land-disturbing activity shall occur on
a site with existing trees or shrubs which are designated to be preserved in
order to meet the landscaping requirements until the landscape and grading plan
has been approved by the Board of Adjustment and protective barriers are
installed by the developer and approved by the Zoning Administrator. Trees
designated for preservation which are counted toward the landscape and
buffering requirements shall be protected by barriers, while trees designated
for preservation which do not count toward the landscape and buffering
requirements are encouraged to be protected by barriers. The diameter of the
trees designated for preservation and the location of protective barriers shall
be shown on the landscape and grading and site plans with the dimensions
between the tree trunk and barrier indicated.
            2.   Protective barriers shall be placed around the root protection
zone of trees designated for preservation that are within 50 feet of any
grading or construction activity. Protected ground areas for shrubs shall
consist of an area twice the diameter of the shrub. All protective barriers
shall be maintained throughout the building construction process.
         (b)   1.   All contractors shall be made aware of the areas designated
for protection.
            2.   No disturbance shall occur within the protective barriers,
including:
               a.   Grading;
               b.   Filling, unless an aeration system which is certified by a
registered landscape architect, certified arborist, or state cooperative
extension specialist is installed to protect the tree from suffocation;
               c.   Temporary or permanent parking;
               d.   Storage of debris or materials, including topsoil;
               e.   Disposal of hazardous wastes or concrete washout; and
               f.   Attaching of nails, ropes, cables, signs, or fencing to any
tree designated for preservation.
            3.   If any area within the root protection zone will be disturbed
for any reason, a registered landscape architect, certified arborist, or state
cooperative extension specialist shall recommend measures to minimize any
potential impact and certify that the activity will not damage the tree under
normal circumstances.
            4.   The developer shall coordinate with the utility companies
early in the design process to resolve potential conflicts about the placement
of utilities and buffer and screening requirements in §
153.063(B)(5). The Zoning Administrator shall approve the placement of the
utilities either outside of the root protection zone or tunneled at least two
feet directly below the tree roots to minimize root damage.
            5.   If silt fencing is requited to control sedimentation, the
fencing must be placed along the uphill edge of a tree protection zone in order
to prevent sediment from accumulating in the drip line area.
         (c)   Tree protection zone signs shall be installed on the tree
protection barriers visible on all sides of the protection area (minimum one on
each side and/or every 300 linear feet). The size of each sign shall be a
minimum of two feet by two feet and shall contain the following language: “TREE
PROTECTION ZONE, KEEP OUT” or “TREE SAVE AREA, KEEP OUT”.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.063 BUFFER STRIP AND SCREEN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Certain land uses are defined in this chapter as being an incompatible
land use when developed adjacent to other less intensive land uses. A buffer
strip can serve to lessen adverse impacts when development occurs.
   (B)   The installation of the applicable buffer strip shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the developing land use. Buffer strips shall be
located on the property of the developing land use between the property line
and any vehicular use areas, buildings, storage, service areas, or other area
of activity. The buffer strip shall extend along the entire rear and/or side
property line which abuts an incompatible land use, up to any required street
tree planting strip.
      (1)   Use of buffer strips. Required buffers shall not be disturbed for
any reason except for approved driveway openings and other passive or accessory
uses compatible with the general separation of land uses and; provided, that
the total number of required plantings are still met. Approval from the Town
Manager is required prior to initiating any disturbance of the buffer.
      (2)   Placement of buffer plantings. The exact placement of the required
plants shall be the decision of the developer or designer, but shall be
reviewed by the Town Manager and approved by the Board of Adjustment. Plants
shall be placed in a manner to serve as an effective screen year-round when
viewed from any area accessible to the public or from adjacent properties.
Trees or shrubs should be planted at least five feet away from the property
line to ensure maintenance access and to avoid encroaching upon neighboring
property.
      (3)   Composition of buffer plantings. A buffer consisting of two
staggered rows of evergreen shrubs or sheared evergreen trees, planted 48
inches apart (as measured from the central stem) in a 20-foot wide strip shall
be installed to screen the nonresidential use from neighboring residential
properties. The trees or shrubs shall be between four and five feet high at
time of planting. During times of extended dry weather, the applicant may
petition the Board of Adjustment to reduce the required size of vegetation to
be planted in order to better ensure its survival. It is suggested that a
mixture of two to three shrubs selected from the recommended species list be
planted to encourage healthier plants.
      (4)   Coordination with stormwater drainage provisions. If the buffer
strip is to be used as part of the area for required stormwater runoff
absorption as outlined in
Chapter 52 of this code, then the shrubs and trees within the buffer shall be
water tolerant.
      (5)   Coordination with utility easements. In circumstances when the
property to be developed is adjacent to a utility easement, the buffer
requirement of division (C) above maybe altered to be only ten feet wide at the
discretion of the Board of Adjustment, based on the factors of space,
feasibility, and other considerations which may make it difficult to provide a
20-foot buffer.
      (6)   Additional buffering. The Board of Adjustment has the authority to
require that a wall or fence be constructed next to property used for
residential purposes when the Board determines that the buffer strip alone does
not provide adequate buffering. The fence or wall shall be constructed in a
durable fashion of wood, stone, masonry materials, or other materials if deemed
appropriate and shall be built of material compatible with the principal
building. When concrete block is utilized, it shall be finished with stucco on
both sides. The materials and design shall be approved by the Board of
Adjustment on a case-by-case basis. The finished side of the fence or wall
shall face the abutting property. A chain link fence may not be used to satisfy
the requirements of this section. Shrubs shall be planted on the applicant’s
side of the property at the rate of 25 per 100 linear feet; their placing and
arrangement shall be the decision of the applicant.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.064 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.

   (A)   There shall be a continuously-maintained growing strip planted with
grass or similar low-growing vegetation, measured from the back of the curb and
extending ten feet perpendicular to the road. The purpose of this growing strip
is to provide a clear line of sight for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists
entering and leaving commercial properties.
   (B)   (1)   Where parking areas with more than five spaces adjoin a public
right-of-way, a landscaped planting strip ten feet wide shall be established
and continuously maintained between the growing strip and parking area(s).
      (2)   Street trees shall be planted within the landscaped planting strip
in accordance with §
153.066 and parking areas within 50 feet of the right-of-way shall have a
visually modifying screen or barrier that meets one of these standards.
         (a)   Evergreen shrubs shall be planted 36 inches apart as measured
from the center and attain a height of at least 48 inches within four years of
installation;
         (b)   There shall be a fence or wall three feet high constructed of
the same material as the principal building; or
         (c)   There is an earthen berm at least two feet high, with a minimum
crown width of two feet and a width to height ratio of no greater than 2:1;
shrubs shall be planted on top of the berm that will attain a height of at
least 36 inches within four years of installation and shall be planted 36
inches apart.
      (3)   No screen is required at parking lot entrances or exits, and no
screen shall obstruct vision within 50 feet of an entrance, exit, or
intersection. The landscaped planting strip shall be covered with living
material, including groundcover and/or shrubs, except for mulched areas
directly around the trees, so that no soil is exposed.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   Parking areas with more than five spaces shall have at
least one large-maturing deciduous tree for every three parking spaces, with
some appropriate clustering of trees permitted, and six-foot by 18-foot
projecting landscaped islands generally between ten and 12 parking spaces.
         (b)   Whenever possible, interior parking spaces should have a
continuous planter strip six feet wide between rows of parking.
      (2)   Where appropriate, provisions shall be made to ensure that adequate
pedestrian paths are provided throughout the landscaped areas. In all cases, at
least one large maturing deciduous tree shall be provided for a parking lot
regardless of the number of spaces provided. No parking space shall be located
more than 50 feet from the trunk of a large-maturing deciduous tree. When
calculating the number of trees required, the applicant shall round up to the
nearest whole number.
   (D)   All landscaped areas shall be bordered by a concrete curb that is at
least six inches above the pavement and six inches wide or a granite curb that
is at least six inches above the pavement and four inches wide.
   (E)   To increase the parking lot landscaped area, a maximum of two feet of
the parking stall depth may be landscaped with low-growth, hearty materials in
lieu of asphalt, allowing a bumper overhang while maintaining the required
parking dimensions.
   (F)   When more than the required number of parking spaces is provided, the
applicant shall provide two times the required number of trees for the spaces
provided above the ordinance requirement.

structures visible from a public street or adjacent property line shall be
screened unless already screened by an intervening building or buffer strip.
Landscaping shall not interfere with the access and operation of any such
structure or facility. Trash and storage areas shall be well-maintained,
including prompt repair and replacement of damaged gates, fences, and plants.
   (B)   Openings of trash enclosures shall be oriented away from public view
or screened with sturdy gates wide enough to allow easy access for trash
collection, where practical. The consolidation of trash areas between
businesses and the use of modern disposal techniques is encouraged. All
dumpsters shall be located a minimum of 50 feet from a residential dwelling.
All unenclosed outdoor storage areas greater than 25 square feet shall also be
screened from adjacent properties and streets.

      (1)   A continuous hedge of evergreen shrubs planted in a five-foot strip
spaced a maximum of 36 inches apart; and
      (2)   A wall or fence six feet high, with the finished side of the fence
or wall facing the abutting property or street. Fences longer than 25 linear
feet shall be landscaped with trees and/or shrubs planted in a minimum five-
foot planting area, except around access areas, spaced no farther than eight
feet apart in order to screen at least 50% of the fence or wall.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 10-9-2023)
§ 153.066 STREET TREES.
   (A)   (1)   Street trees are required for all developments meeting the

property or the person undertaking the work or activity. The notice of
violation may be posted on the property. The person providing the notice of
violation shall certify to the local government that the notice was provided,

(Ord. passed 10-19-1983; Ord. passed 6-8-2021)
§ 153.110 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   The powers and duties of the Board of Adjustment shall be as follows:
   (A)   Interpretation. To interpret zoning maps and pass upon disputed
questions of lot lines or district boundary lines and any other questions of
interpretation that may arise in the administration of this chapter;
   (B)   Administrative review.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for special
use permits, variances, and appeal of decisions of the Town Manager. The term
DECISION includes any final and binding order, requirement, or determination.
The Board of Adjustment shall follow quasi-judicial procedures when deciding
appeals and requests for special uses and variances. The Board of Adjustment
may hear and decide all matters upon which it is required to pass under any
statute or ordinance that regulates land use or development in the town.
      (2)   Notice of hearings conducted pursuant to this division (B) shall be
mailed to the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request is the
subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the
hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels
of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to
any other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by the zoning or
unified development ordinance. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the
town may rely on the county tax listings to determine owners of property
entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least
ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of hearing. Within that
same time period, the town shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing
on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or
highway right-of-way. If an evidentiary hearing is set for a given date and a
quorum of the Board is not then present, the hearing shall be continued until
the next regular Board meeting without further advertisement.
      (3)   The Board of Adjustment shall determine contested facts and make
its decision within a reasonable time. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be
based upon competent, material, and substantial evidence in the record. The
Board of Adjustment must allow parties with standing to participate fully in
the evidentiary hearing, including presenting evidence, cross-examining
witnesses, objecting to evidence, and making legal arguments. The Board may
allow parties without standing to present competent, material, and substantial
evidence that is not repetitive. If an objection arises at the hearing as to
the inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials, the Board Chair must
rule on this objection at the hearing. An appeal of this ruling may be
considered by the full Board pursuant to G.S. § 160D-406(d). Each quasi-
judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Board's
determination of contested facts and their application to the applicable
standards. The written decision shall be signed by the Chair or other duly
authorized member of the Board. A quasi-judicial decision is effective upon
filing the written decision with the Town Manager. The decision shall be
delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first class mail to the
applicant or property owner as may be applicable, and to any person who has
submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes
effective. The Town Manager shall certify that proper notice has been made.
      (4)   Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the
Superior Court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari (G.S. § 160D-406(k)).
A petition for review shall be filed with the Clerk of Superior Court within
the period specified by G.S. § 160D-1405(d).
      (5)   Members of the Board of Adjustment exercising quasi-judicial
functions shall not have a fixed opinion on a matter prior to hearing; shall
not have undisclosed ex-parte communication with an applicant, a close
familial, business, or other associational relationship with an applicant or a
financial interest in the outcome. If an objection is raised to a member's
participation and that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining
members shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
      (6)   The Chair of the Board of Adjustment or any member acting as Chair
and the Town Manager are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any
matter coming before the Board. Any person who, while under oath during a
proceeding before the Board of Adjustment, willfully swears falsely is guilty
of a Class I misdemeanor.
      (7)   The Chair of the Board of Adjustment or anyone acting as Chair, may
subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. Any person with
standing under G.S. § 160D-406(g) may make a written request to the Chair
explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be
compelled. The Chair or person acting as the Chair shall issue requested
subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope
and not oppressive. The Chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a
subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the Chair may be appealed to
the full Board of Adjustment. If a person subpoenaed fails to obey the
subpoena, the Board of Adjustment or the party that requested the subpoena may
apply to the General Court of Justice for an order requiring that its subpoena
be obeyed.
   (C)   Special uses.
      (1)   Upon application, the Board of Adjustment may grant in particular
cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, permits for special
uses as authorized by this chapter, and set forth as special uses under the
various use districts.
      (2)   A special use permit may be granted by the Board of Adjustment only
after making the following findings:
         (a)   An application for the special use has been submitted as
prescribed by this chapter;
         (b)   1.   If the Board of Adjustment finds, in the particular case in
question, that the use, including any proposed structures:
               a.   Will not materially endanger the public health or safety if
located where proposed and developed according to the plan as submitted and
approved;
               b.   Meets all required conditions and specifications of this
chapter and other applicable rules, regulations, and standards;
               c.   Will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or
abutting property;
               d.   Will be in general conformity with the plan of development
of the town and its environs;
               e.   Will be reasonably compatible with significant natural and
topographic features on the site and within the immediate vicinity of the site
given the proposed site design and structure design;
               f.   Will be in harmony with scale, bulk, height, coverage,
density, and character of the area or neighborhood in which it is located; or
               g.   Is appropriately located with respect to transportation
facilities, water supply, fire and police protection, waste disposal, and
similar facilities, and will not cause undue traffic congestion or create a
traffic hazard.
            2.   In granting such a permit, the Board of Adjustment may
designate such conditions in connection therewith that will, in its opinion,
assure that the proposed use will conform to the requirements and spirit of
this chapter. However, the Board of Adjustment shall not impose conditions on
special use permits that the town is not statutorily allowed to impose.
         (c)   Before any special use permit is issued, the Board shall make
written findings certifying compliance with the specific rules governing the
individual special use (see §
153.008), and that satisfactory provision and arrangement has been made for at
least the following, where applicable:
            1.   Satisfactory ingress and egress to property and proposed
structures thereon, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian
safety and convenience, traffic flow, and control;
            2.   Provision of off-street parking and loading areas where
required, with particular attention to the items in division (C)(2)(c)1. above,
and the economic, noise, and odor effects of the special use on adjoining
properties in the area;
            3.   Adequate and proper utilities, with reference to locations,
availability, and compatibility;
            4.   Buffering, with reference to type, location, and dimensions;
            5.   Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting, with reference
to glare, traffic safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with
properties in the district;
            6.   Playgrounds, open spaces, yards, landscaping, access ways,
pedestrian ways, with reference to location, size, and suitability;
            7.   Buildings and structures, with reference to location, size,
and use;
            8.   Hours of operation, with particular reference to protecting
and maintaining the character of the neighborhood;
            9.    With the exception of Americans with Disabilities Act, being
42 U.S.C. § 12101, lighting requirements and street lighting, the design
standards as outlined in §
153.047,"Site Design and Form and Mass Commercial Buildings," shall apply when
exterior lighting is proposed and/or required;
            10.   A site plan has been submitted as required in §
153.008; and
            11.   The applicant/landowner must provide written consent to
conditions placed on a special use permit by the Board of Adjustment.
         (d)   1.   The Zoning Administrator shall make periodic inspections
during construction as well as a final inspection after construction is
complete to determine whether the conditions imposed and agreements made in the
issuance of the permit have been met as well as whether all other requirements
of this chapter have been met. The Zoning Administrator shall report his or her
findings to the Board of Adjustment.
            2.   If at any time after a special use permit has been issued, the
Board of Adjustment determines that the conditions imposed and agreements made
have not been or are not being fulfilled by the holder of a special use permit,
the permit shall be terminated and the operation of such use discontinued.
            3.   If a special use permit is terminated for any reason, it may
be reinstated only after reapplying for a special use permit.
   (D)   Variances. Upon application, when unnecessary hardships would result
from carrying out the strict letter of a zoning ordinance, the Board of
Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the ordinance upon a showing of
all of the following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the public may not be the
basis for granting a variance;
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship; and
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial
justice is achieved.

§ 153.111 APPEALS AND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Types of appeals and applications.
      (1)   Appeals. The Board shall hear and decide all appeals from any
decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Applications. All applications for variances and special use
permits shall first be presented to the Zoning Administrator, who in turn shall
refer the application to the Board of Adjustment. Applications for variances
and special use permits must be made by a person with a property interest in
the property or a contract to purchase the property.
   (B)   Appeals.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from
decisions of the Town Manager.
      (2)   The following apply to all appeals heard by the Board of
Adjustment:
         (a)   Any person who has standing under G.S. § 160D-406(d) or the town
may appeal a decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing
a notice of appeal with the Town Manager. The notice of appeal shall state the
grounds for the appeal.
         (b)   The Town Manager shall give written notice to the owner of the
property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who sought the
decision, if different from the owners. The written notice shall be delivered
by personal delivery, first-class mail, or other electronic forms. If provided
via electronic form, the file must be protected from further editing.
         (c)   The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the
written notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing
to appeal shall have 30 days from the receipt from any source of actual or
constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.
         (d)   It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing
to appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign
containing the words “zoning decision” or “subdivision decision” in letters at
least six inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for
information about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is
the subject of the decision, provided, the sign remains on the property for at
least ten days. Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice.
Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant.
Verification of the posting shall be provided to the official who made the
decision. Absent an ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall
not be required.
         (e)   The Town Manager shall transmit to the Board all documents and
exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed from are taken.
The Town Manager shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and
to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant
is not the owner.
         (f)   1.   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement
order stays enforcement of the action appealed from unless the Town Manager
certifies to the Board of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that
because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril
to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay
would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance.
            2.   In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed
except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement
proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the Town Manager a
request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment
shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed.
            3.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a
permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent
with the ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for
permits or permissions to use such property; in these situations the appellant
may request and the Board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit
applications or building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
         (g)   Subject to the provisions of division (B)(2)(f) above, the Board
of Adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
         (h)   1.   During the conduct of a hearing, any party may appear in
person or by agent or by attorney at the hearing.
            2.   The order of business for the hearing shall be as follows:
               a.   The Chair, or such person as he or she shall direct, shall
give a preliminary statement of the case;
               b.   The applicant shall present the argument in support of the
appeal or application;
               c.   Persons opposed to granting the appeal or the application
shall present their argument against the application;
               d.   Both sides will be permitted to present rebuttals to
opposing testimony; and
               e.   The Chair or such person as he or she shall direct shall
summarize the evidence which has been presented, giving the parties the
opportunity to make objections or corrections. Witnesses may be called and
factual evidence may be submitted, but the Board shall not be limited to only
consideration of only such evidence as would be admissible in a court of law.
The Board may place parties and witnesses under oath and the opposing party may
cross-examine them. The Town Manager, or other town official who filed the
notice of violation, shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The
appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice
of appeal. If any party or the town would be unduly prejudiced by the
presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board shall
continue the hearing. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any order,
requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The Board shall
have all the powers of the Town Manager.
         (i)   When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. § 160A-400.9(e) or any
other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the
record below and the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. § 160A-393
(k).
         (j)   The parties to an appeal that has been made under this division
(B) may agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution.
The ordinance may set standards and procedures to facilitate and manage such
voluntary alternative dispute resolution.
   (C)   Hearings.
      (1)   Time. After receipt of notice of an appeal or an application, the
Board Chairperson shall schedule a time for a hearing which shall be within 36
days from the filing of such notice of appeal or application. Any additional
appeal or application shall be received not less than two weeks prior to a
scheduled meeting.
      (2)   Notice. In any application for projects involving planned unit
developments, the Board shall give notice of the hearing in a newspaper having
general circulation in the county five days prior to the date of the hearing.
For all other applications and appeals, the Board shall send by first class
mail notices of the hearing to the affected parties and to such other persons
as the Zoning Administrator shall direct, at least ten days prior to the
hearing. Such notice shall state the location of the building or lot, the
general nature of the question involved in the appeal or application, and the
time and place of the hearing.
      (3)   Re-hearings. An application for a rehearing may be made in the same
manner as provided for an original hearing. Evidence in support of the
application shall initially be limited to that which is necessary to enable the
Board to determine whether there has been a substantial change in the facts,
evidence, or conditions of the case. The application for rehearing shall be
denied by the Board if from the record it finds that there has been no
substantial change in facts, evidence, or conditions. If the Board finds that
there has been a change, it shall thereupon treat the request in the same
manner as any other appeal or application.
   (D)   Decisions.
      (1)   Time. A decision by the Board shall be made within 30 days from the
time of hearing.
      (2)   Form.
         (a)   Written notice by certified or registered mail of the decision
in a case shall be given to the applicant or appellant by the Secretary as soon
as practical after the case is decided. In addition, written notice shall be
given to owners of the subject property and to other persons who have made
written request for such notice. The final decision of the Board shall be shown
in the record of the case as entered in the minutes of the Board and signed by

DESIGN REVIEW BOARD
§ 153.125 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The Town Board of Commissioners finds that new development has a
substantial impact on the character of the area in which it is located. Some
harmful effects of one land use upon another can be prevented through zoning,
subdivision controls, and building codes. Other aspects of development are more
subtle. Among these are the general form of the land before and after
development and the spatial relationships of the structures and open spaces as
they contribute to an area as it is being developed. Such matters require the
timely exercise of judgment in the public interest by people qualified to
evaluate the design of new development.
   (B)   The design review process is intended to encourage residential and
commercial developments which exemplify the best professional design practices
and to promote the historic character of the town. The procedure is established
to encourage individual identity for specific uses and structures; to enhance
property values in the town and adjoining neighborhoods; to respect each
individual site and its environmental qualities; and to minimize visual
disharmony resulting from unrelated and poorly designed development.
   (C)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish minimum standards for
the exterior design of commercial, office, and residential structures, and to
ensure high quality of development, redevelopment, and compatibility with
evolving architecture or planning themes that contribute to a community image
of quality, visual aesthetics, permanence, and stability which are in the best
interest of the citizens of the town. These standards are intended to prevent
use of materials that are unsightly, rapidly deteriorate, contribute to
depreciation of area property values, or cause urban blight.
   (D)   These standards are further intended to ensure coordinated design of
building exteriors, additions and accessory structures’ exteriors in order to
prevent visual disharmony; minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties from
buildings which are or may become unsightly, and buildings that detract from
the character and appearance of the area. It is not the intent of this
subchapter to unduly restrict design freedom when reviewing and approving
project architecture in relationship to the proposed land use, site
characteristics, and interior building layout.

§ 153.126 COMPOSITION OF DESIGN REVIEW BOARD AND MEETING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Town Board of Commissioners hereby establishes a Design Review
Board.
   (B)   The Town Board of Commissioners shall appoint five resident members. A
minimum of two members shall come from the disciplines of architecture,
landscape architecture, landscape contractor, licensed general contractor, or
like disciplines.
   (C)   Members of the Design Review Board shall serve for terms of three
years, and may be reappointed. The terms of the original members may be

   (D)   The Board shall meet when it has business to discuss, and otherwise
has no set meeting schedule.
   (E)   The Board of Commissioners shall also appoint one alternate member to
serve on the Design Review Board in the absence, for any cause, of any regular
member. Such alternate member, while attending any regular and or special
meeting of the Board and serving in the absence of any regular member, shall
have and exercise all powers and duties of such regular member so absent.

DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
§ 153.145 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
   Pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D, Art. 12, the Town of Biltmore Forest may
enter into a development agreement with developers, subject to the procedures
outlined below.
   (A)   Before entering into a development agreement, a local government shall
conduct a legislative hearing on the proposed agreement. The notice provisions
of G.S. § 160D-602 applicable to zoning map amendments shall be followed for
this hearing. The notice for the hearing must specify the location of the
property subject to the development agreement, the development uses proposed on
the property, and must specify a place where a copy of the proposed development
agreement can be obtained. (2019-111, s. 2.4; 2020-3, s. 4.33(a); 2020-25, ss.
25, 51(a), (b), (d).)
   (B)   Content and modification. A development agreement shall, at a minimum,
include all of the following:
      (1)   A description of the property subject to the agreement and the
names of its legal and equitable property owners.
      (2)   The duration of the agreement. However, the parties are not
precluded from entering into subsequent development agreements that may extend
the original duration period.
      (3)   The development uses permitted on the property, including
population densities and building types, intensities, placement on the site,
and design.
      (4)   A description of public facilities that will serve the development,
including who provides the facilities, the date any new public facilities, if
needed, will be constructed, and a schedule to assure public facilities are
available concurrent with the impacts of the development. In the event that the
development agreement provides that the local government shall provide certain
public facilities, the development agreement shall provide that the delivery
date of such public facilities will be tied to successful performance by the
developer in implementing the proposed development, such as meeting defined
completion percentages or other performance standards.
      (5)   A description, where appropriate, of any reservation or dedication
of land for public purposes and any provisions agreed to by the developer that
exceed existing laws related to protection of environmentally sensitive
property.
      (6)   A description, where appropriate, of any conditions, terms,
restrictions, or other requirements for the protection of public health,
safety, or welfare.
      (7)   A description, where appropriate, of any provisions for the
preservation and restoration of historic structures.
   (C)   A development agreement may also provide that the entire development
or any phase of it be commenced or completed within a specified period. If
required by ordinance or in the agreement, the development agreement shall
provide a development schedule, including commencement dates and interim
completion dates at no greater than five-year intervals; provided, however, the
failure to meet a commencement or completion date does not, in and of itself,
constitute a material breach of the development agreement pursuant to G.S. §
160D-1008 but must be judged based upon the totality of the circumstances. The
developer may request a modification in the dates as set forth in the
agreement.
   (D)   If more than one local government is made party to an agreement, the
agreement must specify which local government is responsible for the overall
administration of the development agreement. A local or regional utility
authority may also be made a party to the development agreement.
   (E)   The development agreement also may cover any other matter, including
defined performance standards, not inconsistent with this chapter. The
development agreement may include mutually acceptable terms regarding provision
of public facilities and other amenities and the allocation of financial
responsibility for their provision, provided any impact mitigation measures
offered by the developer beyond those that could be required by the local
government shall be expressly enumerated within the agreement, and provided the
agreement may not include a tax or impact fee not otherwise authorized by law.
   (F)   Consideration of a proposed major modification of the agreement shall
follow the same procedures as required for initial approval of a development
agreement. What changes constitute a major modification may be determined by
ordinance adopted pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1003 or as provided for in the
development agreement.
   (G)   Any performance guarantees under the development agreement shall
comply with G.S. § 160D-804.1. (2019-111, s. 2.4; 2020-3, s. 4.33(a); 2020-25,
ss. 26, 51(a), (b), (d).)
(Ord. passed 6-8-2021)
§ 153.146 VESTING.
   (A)   Unless the development agreement specifically provides for the
application of subsequently enacted laws, the laws applicable to development of
the property subject to a development agreement are those in force at the time
of execution of the agreement.
   (B)   Except for grounds specified in G.S. § 160D-108(c) or G.S. § 160D-
108.1(f), a local government may not apply subsequently adopted ordinances or
development policies to a development that is subject to a development
agreement.
   (C)   In the event state or federal law is changed after a development
agreement has been entered into and the change prevents or precludes compliance
with one or more provisions of the development agreement, the local government
may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or
federal law has a fundamental effect on the development agreement.
   (D)   This section does not abrogate any vested rights otherwise preserved
by law. (2019-111, s. 2.4; 2020-3, s. 4.33(a); 2020-25, ss. 27, 51(a), (b),
(d).)
(Ord. passed 6-8-2021)
§ 153.147 BREACH AND CURE.
   (A)   Procedures established pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1003 may include a
provision requiring periodic review by the Zoning Administrator or other
appropriate officer of the local government, at which time the developer shall
demonstrate good-faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement.
   (B)   If the local government finds and determines that the developer has
committed a material breach of the agreement, the local government shall notify
the developer in writing setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature
of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding and determination and
providing the developer a reasonable time in which to cure the material breach.
   (C)   If the developer fails to cure the material breach within the time
given, then the local government unilaterally may terminate or modify the
development agreement, provided the notice of termination or modification may
be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in the manner provided by G.S. § 160D-
405.
   (D)   An ordinance adopted pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1003 or the development
agreement may specify other penalties for breach in lieu of termination,
including, but not limited to, penalties allowed for violation of a development
regulation. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to abrogate or impair
the power of the local government to enforce applicable law.
   (E)   A development agreement shall be enforceable by any party to the
agreement notwithstanding any changes in the development regulations made
subsequent to the effective date of the development agreement. Any party to the
agreement may file an action for injunctive relief to enforce the terms of a
development agreement. (2019-111, s. 2.4; 2020-3, s. 4.33(a); 2020-25, s. 51
(a), (b), (d).)
(Ord. passed 6-8-2021)
§ 153.148 AMENDMENTS.
   Subject to the provisions of G.S. § 160D-1006(e), a development agreement
may be amended or terminated by mutual consent of the parties. (2019-111, s.
2.4; 2020-3, s. 4.33(a); 2020-25, s. 51(a), (b), (d).)
(Ord. passed 6-8-2021)
§ 153.149 CHANGE OF JURISDICTION.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, any development
agreement entered into by a local government before the effective date of a
change of jurisdiction shall be valid for the duration of the agreement or
eight years from the effective date of the change in jurisdiction, whichever is
earlier. The parties to the development agreement and the local government
assuming jurisdiction have the same rights and obligations with respect to each
other regarding matters addressed in the development agreement as if the
property had remained in the previous jurisdiction.
   (B)   A local government assuming jurisdiction may modify or suspend the
provisions of the development agreement if the local government determines that
the failure of the local government to do so would place the residents of the
territory subject to the development agreement or the residents of the local
government, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or
both. (2019-111, s. 2.4; 2020-3, s. 4.33(a); 2020-25, s. 51(a), (b), (d).)
(Ord. passed 6-8-2021)
§ 153.150 RECORDATION.
   The developer shall record the agreement with the Register of Deeds in the
county where the property is located within 14 days after the local government
and developer execute an approved development agreement. No development
approvals may be issued until the development agreement has been recorded. The
burdens of the development agreement are binding upon, and the benefits of the
agreement shall inure to, all successors in interest to the parties to the
agreement.
(Ord. passed 6-8-2021)
§ 153.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter, for which no other
penalty is provided, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of §
10.99.
   (B)   Unless extraordinary and reasonably unforeseeable delaying factors not
resulting from the owner’s action or inaction can be clearly demonstrated and
proven, failure to have the construction or remodeling substantially complete
at the end of the two-year time period shall subject the property owner to a
fine of $250 per day.
