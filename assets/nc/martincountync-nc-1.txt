authorized by this subsection must be in accordance with the provisions of this
section. Martin County may not levy a tax under this subsection unless it also
levies the tax authorized under subsection (a) of this section.

this section shall, on and after the effective date of the levy of the tax,

shall be added to the sales price and shall be passed on to the purchaser
instead of being borne by the operator of the business. The county shall
design, print, and furnish to all appropriate businesses and persons in the
county the necessary forms for filing returns and instructions to ensure the

fifteenth day of each month, prepare and render a return on a form prescribed
by the county. The return shall state the total gross receipts derived in the

required by law. - A tax levied under this section shall be levied,
administered, collected, and repealed as provided in G.S. 153A-155. The

(d) Penalties. A person, firm, corporation, or association who fails or refuses
to file the return required by this section shall be subject to and pay a
penalty of ten dollars ($10.00) for each day's omission. In case of failure or
refusal to file the return or pay the tax for a period of 30 days after the
time required for filing the return or for paying the tax, there shall be an
additional tax, as a penalty, of five percent (5%) of the tax due in addition
to any other penalty, with an additional tax of five percent (5%) for each
additional month or fraction thereof until the tax is paid. The board of
commissioners may, for good cause shown, compromise or forgive the additional
tax penalties imposed by this subsection.
Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade a tax imposed under
this section or who willfully fails to pay the tax or make and file a return
shall, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000), imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both.

CHAPTER 1135
HOUSE BILL 1626
AN ACT TO PERMIT CERTAIN COUNTIES, CITIES AND TOWNS TO ENTER INTO LONG-TERM
CONTRACTS FOR DISPOSAL OF SOLID WASTE.
Whereas, the Boards of County Commissioners of the counties listed in Section 6
of this act, and the Councils of many of the cities and towns located in such
counties, have become increasingly concerned about the costs of collection and
disposal of solid waste generated by private businesses and homes. The labor
and transportation costs to pick up solid waste and transport them to an
incinerator or landfill are skyrocketing. Land costs for landfills, as with all
land costs, are rising rapidly. Indications are that labor, transportation and
land costs will continue to spiral. Environmental regulations relating to
disposal of solid waste, although certainly beneficial to our citizens, add
substantial cost to the process of solid waste disposal. Material additional
expenditures must be incurred in the immediate future to prevent leaching in
many landfills. Public opposition to landfills is growing; and
Whereas, the Boards of County Commissioners in the counties listed in Section 6
of this act, and the councils of many of the cities and towns located in such
counties, have been advised that one new and very significant innovation in
solid waste disposal is the "waste to energy" technology and equipment which
has already been implemented in several areas of the United States. This
technology and equipment converts solid waste (garbage) into energy in the form
of steam. A waste to energy system is usually owned and operated either by a
governmental unit that can utilize the steam energy or by a private person,
firm or corporation that harnesses the steam for use in a manufacturing
process; and
Whereas, the disposition of solid waste is a public purpose and is a vitally
important public service; and
Whereas, the utilization of the new waste to energy technology would be
economically and socially beneficial to the counties, cities, and towns and to
the people of North Carolina; and
Whereas, a very substantial capital investment is required by a private person,
firm or corporation to purchase and install a waste to energy system; and
Whereas, a private person, firm or corporation will not expend the large
amounts of capital required to purchase and install a waste to energy system
unless the private person, firm or corporation can be assured of an adequate
long-term supply of solid waste from a municipality for the waste to energy
system under the terms of an enforceable long-term contract; Now, therefore,
The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:
Section 1. The Boards of County Commissioners on behalf of counties and city
councils on behalf of cities and towns are hereby authorized to enter into
contracts with any private person, firm or corporation to dispose of by sale or
otherwise, solid waste generated within their geographic boundaries or brought
into their geographic boundaries. Without intending to limit the provisions
which may be included in such contracts, the contracts may specifically include
provisions for:
(1)   payment by the county, city or town of a fee or other charge to the
private person, firm or corporation to accept and dispose of the solid waste;
(2)   periodic increases or adjustments in the fees or other charges to be paid
by the counties, cities or towns to the private person, firm or corporation;
(3)   warranties from the counties, cities or towns with respect to the
quantity of the solid waste it will deliver and transfer to the private person,
firm or corporation and warranties relating to the content or quality of the
solid waste;
(4)   legal and equitable title to the solid waste passing to the private
person, firm or corporation upon delivery of the solid waste to the private
person, firm or corporation; and
(5)   a long term of duration up to a period of 60 years.
Sec. 2. As used in this act, the term "solid waste" shall include but not be
limited to trash, debris, garbage, litter, discarded cans or receptacles or any
other type of waste or garbage material whatsoever.
Sec. 3. Counties, cities and towns may enter into long-term contracts as
described in Section 1 of this act notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 153A-
136 limiting a franchise granted by a Board of County Commissioners for the
collection and disposal of solid waste to a term of no more than seven years
and notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 160A-319 limiting a franchise
granted by a city for the collection and disposal of solid waste to a term of
no more than 60 years.
Sec. 4. The Department of Human Resources must approve all contracts entered
into pursuant to this act before such contract may become effective.
Sec. 5. Approval of any contract under this act by the Board of County
Commissioners or City Council shall be governed by G.S. 153A-46 as to counties
or by G.S. 160A-76 as to cities and towns.
Sec. 6. This act shall apply only to Beaufort County, Craven County, Edgecombe
County, Hyde County, Lenoir County, Martin County, Pamlico County, Pitt County,
Washington County, Wilson County, and to any and all incorporated cities and
towns situated within the foregoing counties.
Sec. 7. This act shall become effective July 1, 1980.

Sec. 1-6. General penalty; continuing violations; ordinance enforcement.
   (a)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, violation of any provision of
this Code or any other county ordinance shall subject the offender to the
remedies hereinafter provided; except, that where the General Statutes of North
Carolina provide specific civil remedies for violations of provisions of this
Code adopted pursuant to such statutes, such remedies available to the county
for enforcement of this Code shall be in addition to the remedies hereinafter
stated; provided that no criminal penalties shall be applicable unless
hereinafter stated in this section as being applicable to specific chapters or
provisions of this Code.
   (b)   Unless otherwise specifically identified, violations of any provision
of the chapters and sections of this Code shall be a misdemeanor and punishable
as provided by G.S. 14-4.
   (c)   In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this
section, any provision of this Code or any other county ordinance may be
enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent
jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have
jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a
defense to the application of the county for equitable relief that there is an
adequate remedy at law.
   (d)   In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this
section, any provision of this Code or any other county ordinance that makes
unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced
by injunction and order of abatement, and the general court of justice shall
have jurisdiction to issue such orders. When a violation of such a provision
occurs, the county may apply to the appropriate division of the general court
of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement
commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the
unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by
the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil
Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular.
   (e)   In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of
abatement as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of abatement may
direct that:
      (1)   Buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished
or removed;
      (2)   Fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from
buildings on the property;
      (3)   Grass and weeds be cut;
      (4)   Improvements or repairs be made; or
      (5)   Any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property
into compliance with this Code or such ordinance.
If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order
of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for
contempt, and the county may execute the order of abatement. The county shall
have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in
the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure
cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings
and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with
sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the
judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the
defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a
time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not
suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith.
   (f)   The provisions of this Code and any other county ordinances may be
enforced by one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed
by this section, except that any provision the violation of which incurs a
civil penalty shall not be enforced by criminal penalties.
   (g)   Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing
violation of any provision of this Code or any other county ordinance shall be
a separate and distinct offense.
   (h)   Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Code, the
penalty for which is a civil penalty, the county shall cause a warning citation
to be issued to the violator, setting out the nature of the violation, the
section violated, the date of the violation and an order to immediately cease
the violation or, if the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which
an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, stating a
reasonable period of time in which the violation must be abated. The warning
citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty.
   (i)   Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation, a civil
citation shall be issued by the appropriate official of the county and either
served directly on the violator or his duly designated agent, or registered
agent if a corporation, in person or posted in the United States mail service
by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as
contained in the records of the county, or obtained from the violator at the
time of issuance of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have
been served upon the mailing of such citation. The citation shall direct the
violator to appear before the county treasurer, located in the county hall,
within 15 days of the date of the citation or alternatively to pay the citation
by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been
corrected by the time the citation is paid, otherwise, further citations shall
be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the
prohibited activity is ceased or abated. If the violator fails to respond to a
citation within 15 days of its issuance and pay the penalty prescribed therein,
the county may institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the
appropriate division of the general court of justice for the collection of the
penalty.
Sec. 1-7. Amendments to Code; amendatory language.
   (a)   All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal or
in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering
system hereof and printed for inclusion herein. When subsequent ordinances
repeal any chapter, section or subsection or any portion thereof, such repealed
portions may be excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages. The
subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of
repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such
time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted
as a new code by the board of commissioners.
   (b)   Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by
amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this
Code in the following language: "That section of the Code of Ordinances, Martin
County, North Carolina, is hereby amended to read as follows:…. " The new
provisions shall then be set out in full as desired.
   (c)   If a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added,
the following language shall be used: "That the Code of Ordinances, Martin
County, North Carolina, is hereby amended by adding a section, to be numbered
_____, such section to read as follows:…." The new provisions shall then be set
out in full as desired.
   (d)   All sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed
must be specifically repealed by section, article or chapter number, as the
case may be.
Sec. 1-8. Supplementation of Code.
   (a)   By contract or by county personnel, supplements to this Code shall be
prepared on an annual basis. A supplement to the Code shall include all
substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the board of
commissioners during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made
thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they
will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which
have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so
prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through
the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.
   (b)   In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which
have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from
reprinted pages.
   (c)   When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the
person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make
formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included
in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a
unified code. For example, the codifier may:
      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions.
      (2)   Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections
and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes
in such catchlines, headings and titles.
      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be
inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change
existing section or other subdivision numbers.
      (4)   Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to
"this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or
to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the
sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the Code).
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case
shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.
Sec. 1-9. Ordinances not affected by Code.
   (a)   Nothing in this Code, or the ordinance adopting this Code, shall
affect:
      (1)   Any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture
incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective
date of the ordinance adopting this Code;
      (2)   Any ordinance or resolution promising or guaranteeing the payment
of money for the county, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the county

grades of any county roads or streets;

specific locations, prescribing through streets, parking limitations, parking
prohibitions, one-way traffic, limitations on loads of vehicles or loading
zones, not inconsistent with this Code;
      (13)   Any ordinance or resolution fixing utility rates and charges, or
any valid comprehensive fee schedule;
      (14)   Any ordinance of agreement with another political subdivision;

      (16)   Any ordinance in effect which establishes a requirement or
procedure to obtain a county permit or license to conduct any commercial
activity, construct or alter a building or structure, or otherwise obtain
county permission or sanction, or undergo inspection, as a precondition;
      (17)   Any ordinance in effect at time of adoption of this Code that
imposes a tax;
      (18)   Any ordinance, resolution or order of the governing body accepting
the designation by a state or federal entity to administer or enforce state or
federal laws, regulations, or orders;
      (19)   Any ordinance establishing water conservation regulations.
   (b)   Any other ordinance or resolution, or part thereof, which is not of a
general and permanent nature; or which is referred to elsewhere in this Code as
continuing in effect; and all such ordinances and resolutions are hereby
recognized as continuing in full force and effect to the same extent as if set
out at length in this Code. Such ordinances and resolutions are on file in the
clerk's office.

DIVISION 3. COUNTY PLANNING BOARD
Sec. 2-109. Re-establishing the county planning board.
   A county planning board was established by county ordinance in 1971 for the
specific purpose of organizing and administering land use surrounding the
county airport such that proper clear air space was maintained, but said board
has not functioned nor been organized for a number of years. It appears to be
advantageous to the welfare of the county that the comprehensive and continuous
planning program be further defined and enabled. The board of commissioners
needs the active assistance and constant cooperation of many civic-minded
citizens in its efforts to serve the best interests of the people and to direct
physical development of the county.
(Ord. No. 1991-2, § 1, 6-3-1991)
Sec. 2-110. Powers and duties.
   It shall be the function and duty of the planning board to make
comprehensive surveys and studies of existing conditions and probable future
developments and prepare such plans for physical, and economic growth, as will
best promote the public health, safety, convenience or the general welfare as
well as efficiency and economy in the development of the county. In general,
the planning board shall have the power and duty to:
      (1)   Make studies of the area within its jurisdictions and surrounding
areas.
      (2)   Determine objectives to be sought in the development of the county.
      (3)   Prepare and adopt plans for achieving objectives.
      (4)   Develop and recommend policies, ordinances, administrative
procedures, and other means for carrying out plans in a coordinated and
efficient manner.
      (5)   Advise the board of commissioners concerning the use and amendment
of means for carrying out plans.
      (6)   Exercise any functions in the administration and enforcement of
various means for carrying out plans that the board of commissioners may direct
(i.e., zoning, subdivision development regulations, etc.).
      (7)   Perform any other related duties that the board of commissioners
may direct.
      (8)   The planning board shall review upon request and make
recommendations to the board of commissioners upon the extent, location and
design of all public structures and facilities, on the acquisition of public
properties, on the opening, abandonment, widening, extension, narrowing or
other change to streets and other public ways, and on the construction,
extension, expansion or abandonment of utilities whether publicly or privately
owned.
      (9)   The planning board may consult with the county manager, with the
county soil and water conservation district and with the economic development
commission as necessary on issues of mutual concern. The planning board may
coordinate planning activities with adjoining jurisdictions, to include
coordination through and cooperation with the Mid-East Commission.
      (10)   The planning board may conduct such public hearings as may be
required to gather information necessary for the drafting, establishment, and
maintenance of the comprehensive land use plan.
      (11)   The planning board shall have power to promote public interest in
and an understanding of its recommendations and to that end it may publish and
distribute copies of its recommendations and may employ such other means of
publicity and education as it may deem necessary.
      (12)   Members of the planning board may attend planning conferences or
meetings of planning institutes or hearings upon pending planning legislation,
and the county may pay, from within the planning board's budget, the reasonable
traveling expenses incidental to such attendance.
(Ord. No. 1991-2, § 2, 6-3-1991)
Sec. 2-111. Membership and vacancies.
   (a)   The planning board shall consist of ten members who reside within the
county (one member from each township).
   (b)   Members shall be appointed for terms of three years. Vacancies
occurring for reasons other than expiration of terms shall be filled for the
period of the unexpired term. Vacancies shall be filled by the board of county
commissioners.
   (c)   Faithful attendance at the meetings of the board is considered a
prerequisite for the maintenance of membership on the board. Failure to attend
three consecutive meetings shall be deemed adequate cause for summary removal
from the planning board by the board of commissioners.
   (d)   The county manager or designee shall serve as a non-voting
representative of the board of commissioners to the planning board. He will
attend planning board meetings and shall be allowed to participate in all
discussions and deliberations of the board. At the request of the planning
board, he shall obtain or prepare any needed materials such as maps, draft
documents, and conduct needed analyses or studies to be used by the planning
board in conducting its assigned duties.
(Ord. No. 1991-2, § 3, 6-3-1991)
Sec. 2-112. Organization, rules, meetings and records.
   Within 30 days after appointment, the planning board shall meet and review
its bylaws adjusting the terms of its chairperson and vice-chairperson.
Thereafter, the term of the chairperson and vice-chairperson shall be one year,
with eligibility for reelection for one additional term. No one person shall
serve as chairperson for more than two consecutive terms. The board may adopt
rules for transaction of its business and shall keep a record of its members'
attendance and of its discussions, findings, and recommendations. All records
shall be a public record. All of its meetings shall be open to the public. A
quorum shall consist of six members for the purpose of taking any official
action required by this division. All members of the board shall have voting
power on all matters of business. However, any member who is a party at

(Ord. No. 2001-9-1, § 1, 10-10-2001)
Sec. 4-82. Intent.
   The intent of this article is to provide a uniform system of controlling and
managing beavers throughout the county's jurisdiction in order to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and to eliminate economic losses to
bottom land timber, agricultural crops, roadways, and personal property caused
by beavers.

Sec. 4-84. Beaver season.
   The county establishes this beaver control management program to coincide
with the state trapping season from November 1 until March 31. If the state
wildlife commission changes the dates of the trapping season for beavers, the
county controlled management program will coincide with the state beaver
trapping season. The county will fund in an amount as determined by the board
of commissioners for this program for each beaver season and the program will
remain in effect for any beaver season until such funds are depleted or until
the county no longer funds the program or until the beaver season ends,
whichever shall first occur.
(Ord. No. 2001-9-1, § 4, 10-10-2001)
Sec. 4-85. Permits.
   Each trapper will need a beaver controlled management program permit issued
by the county and also each trapper must be licensed by the state and must be a
resident of the county in order to acquire a county permit. The cost of said
permit will be in an amount as determined by the board of commissioners from
time to time. Each trapper will have to submit a signed application indicating

permit will be numbered and recorded at the county office.
(Ord. No. 2001-9-1, § 5, 10-10-2001)
Sec. 4-86. Fines.
   It is expressly understood and agreed that the payment per beaver tail in an
amount as determined by the board of commissioners from time to time, applies
strictly to beaver tails acquired in the county. A fine will be imposed on
anyone bringing beaver tails from outside the county in an amount as determined
by the board of commissioners from time to time, for the first illegal beaver
tail and then an additional amount to be determined by the board of
commissioners from time to time, for each additional illegal beaver tail. Each
illegal beaver tail will be considered a separate violation and also will
result in a loss of permit issued by the county. A reward in an amount as
determined by the board of commissioners from time to time, will be given to
anyone who has any information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone
bringing in beaver tails from outside the county and trying to or collecting a
bounty on them. Any rewards that are paid will be deducted from the fiscal year
amount funded for this program. The county will pursue any violation of state
criminal statutes for the taking of beaver tails outside the county and
receiving payment for same, including, but not limited to, obtaining property
by false pretense, or any other violation of state law concerning criminal
violations. Violation of this article is a misdemeanor punishable as provided
in G.S. 14-4 plus a fine in an amount as determined by the board of
commissioners from time to time, per beaver tail brought in from outside of the
county for collection.

Sec. 4-88. Payments.
   A collection site for beaver tails captured in the county will be the animal
control office located at the county landfill off of McCaskey Road. The beaver
tail will have to be turned in before it is counted. The enforcement officer
will receive the beaver tails and give a receipt to each trapper at that time.
The receipt issued by the enforcement officer will have to be turned into the
county's finance office. The enforcement officer will also have to record each
receipt. All checks will be mailed and will not be hand delivered to any
individual trapper. Payment for each beaver tail turned in will be established
by the board of commissioners during the annual budget development.

   There will be an enforcement officer monitoring the beaver program. He has
the authority to check all trappers at any given time or any given place and,
if any trapper refuses to cooperate or permit the enforcement officer to check,
the trapper's permit will be revoked immediately. Permits will have to be
carried by the trappers at all times and any violation will be handled by the
county sheriff's department.

Sec. 4-90. Landowner forms.
   Landowner permission forms will be available at the county manager's office
when the permit is bought and any trapper will have to have signed proof that
he has permission to trap on each farm. A form signed by the landowner stating
the number of beaver tails that were collected off his farm and the farm number
will have to be presented and turned in before payment will be made. This has
to be done at the same time beaver tails are turned in and no receipts shall be
issued unless beaver tails and form of proof from landowner are turned in at
the same time. These forms will be available at the county manager's office.

(Ord. No. 1993-5, § 12, 5-19-1993)
Sec. 6-235. Inspections; duty of owners and occupants.
   (a)   For the purpose of making inspections, the officer is hereby
authorized to enter, examine and survey at all reasonable times all dwellings,
dwelling units, roominghouse or rooming units and the premises associated
therewith. The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, roominghouse
or rooming unit or the person in charge thereof may give the officer free
access to such dwelling and its premises at all reasonable times for the
purposes of such inspection, examination and survey.
   (b)   Every occupant of dwelling, dwelling unit, roominghouse or rooming
unit shall give the owner thereof, or his agent or employee, access to any part
of such dwelling or dwelling unit and its premises at all reasonable times for
the purposes of making such repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect
compliance with the provisions of this article or with any lawful order
pursuant to the provisions of this article.
(Ord. No. 1993-5, § 13, 5-19-1993)
Sec. 6-236. Procedure for enforcement.
   (a)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is
filed with the officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of
the county charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human
habitation, he shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for
such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties of
interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit, a complaint stating the charges and
containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the officer at a place
therein fixed, not less than ten, nor more than 30 days after the serving of
the complaint. The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file
an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give
testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of such hearing
shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating
to such dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give
evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing
in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the
officer.
   (b)   Procedure after hearing. After such notice and hearing, if the public
officer determines that the dwelling under consideration is unfit for human
habitation, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of that
determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an
order:
      (1)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling can be
made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling (an
ordinance of the city may fix a certain percentage of this value as being
reasonable), requiring the owner, within the time specified, to repair, alter
or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation. The
order may require that the property be vacated and closed only if continued
occupancy during the time allowed for repair will present a significant threat
of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of the necessary repairs,
alterations, or improvements; the current state of the property; and any
additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors under the age of 18
or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. The order shall state that
the failure to make timely repairs as directed in the order shall make the
dwelling subject to the issuance of an unfit order under this section; or
      (2)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling cannot be
made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling (an
ordinance of the county may fix a certain percentage of this value as being
reasonable), requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to
remove or demolish such dwelling. However, notwithstanding any other provision
of law, if the dwelling is located in a historic district and the historic
district commission determines, after a public hearing as provided by
ordinance, that the dwelling is of particular significance or value toward
maintaining the character of the district, and the dwelling has not been
condemned as unsafe, the order may require that the dwelling be vacated and
closed consistent with G.S. 160A-400.14(a).
   (c)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or
improve or to vacate and close the dwelling, the public officer may cause the
dwelling to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed; the
public officer may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling so
closed, a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human
habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is
prohibited and unlawful." Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a
Class 1 misdemeanor. The duties of the public officer set forth in this
subsection shall not be exercised until the board of commissioners shall have
by ordinance ordered the public officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of
this article with respect to the particular property or properties which the
public officer shall have found to be unfit for human habitation and which
property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. The ordinance shall
be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the county wherein the
property is located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in
the grantor index.
      (2)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish
the dwelling, the public officer may cause such dwelling to be removed or
demolished. The duties of the public officer set forth in this subsection shall
not be exercised until the board of commissioners shall have by ordinance
ordered the public officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article
with respect to the particular property or properties which the public officer
shall have found to be unfit for human habitation and which property or
properties shall be described in the ordinance. No such ordinance shall be
adopted to require demolition of a dwelling until the owner has first been
given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with the housing
code. The ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in
the county wherein the property is located and shall be indexed in the name of
the property owner in the grantor index.
   (d)   Failure of occupant to vacate a dwelling.
      (1)   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling,
the public officer may file a civil action in the name of the city to remove
such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of
summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as
parties-defendant any person occupying such dwelling. The clerk of superior
court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a
magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten days from the
issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint
shall be served as provided in G.S. 42-29. The summons shall be returned
according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly
served, and if at the hearing the public officer produces a certified copy of
an ordinance adopted by the board of commissioners authorizing the officer to
proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment
ordering that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The
judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be enforced in the same
manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under G.S. 42-30. An
appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be taken as
provided in G.S. 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be stayed as
provided in G.S. 7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a
tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding
pursuant to this subsection unless such occupant was served with notice at
least 30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the
board of commissioners has ordered the public officer to proceed to exercise
his duties under this section to vacate and close or remove and demolish the
dwelling.
      (2)   Whenever a determination is made pursuant to this section that a
dwelling must be vacated and closed, or removed or demolished, under the
provisions of this section, notice of the order shall be given by first class
mail to any organization involved in providing or restoring dwellings for
affordable housing that has filed a written request for such notices. A minimum
period of 45 days from the mailing of such notice shall be given before removal
or demolition by action of the public officer to allow the opportunity for any
organization to negotiate with the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase
the property for the purpose of providing affordable housing. The public
officer or clerk shall certify the mailing of the notices, and the
certification shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. Only an organization
that has filed a written request for such notices may raise the issue of
failure to mail such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order requiring
the public officer to wait 45 days before causing removal or demolition.
   (e)   Appeals from orders of officer.
      (1)   An appeal from any decision or order of the officer may be taken by
any person aggrieved thereby. Any appeal shall specify the grounds upon which
the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the officer shall
forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of
the officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his
decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When an appeal is
from a decision of the officer requiring the person aggrieved to do the act,
the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the
hearing by the board, unless the officer certifies to the board, after the
notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of
his requirement shall not be suspended except for due cause shown upon not less
than one day's written notice to the officer, by the board, or by a court of
record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 153A, and subsection (f) of this
section.
      (2)   The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all
appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its
decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent
or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision or order as in
its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all
the powers of the officer, but the concurring vote of four members of the board
shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the officer.
The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where
there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of
the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the
ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial
justice done.
      (3)   Every decision of the board shall be subject to review by
proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the
decision of the board, but not otherwise.
   (f)   Petition to superior court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the officer or a decision rendered by the board shall have the right,
within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision, to
petition the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the officer
pending a final disposition of the cause, as provided by G.S. 153A.
(Ord. No. 1993-5, § 14, 5-19-1993)
Sec. 6-237. Methods of service of complaints and orders.
   Complaints or orders issued by the officer shall be served upon persons
either personally or by registered or certified mail. If the whereabouts of
such person are unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the officer in
the exercise of reasonable diligence, the officer shall make an affidavit to
that effect, and the serving of such complaint or order upon such person may be
made by publishing the same at least once no later than the time at which
personal service would be required under the provisions of this article in a
newspaper having general circulation in the county. Where service is made by
publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises affected by the complaint or order.
(Ord. No. 1993-5, § 15, 5-19-1993)
Sec. 6-238. Costs; a lien on premises.
   (a)   As provided by G.S. 153A, the cost of any repairs, alterations, or
improvements or of vacating and closing, or removal or demolition caused to be
made or done by the officer pursuant to this article shall be a lien against
the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall be filed,
having priority, and be collected in the same manner as the lien for special
assessments established by article 10, chapter 153A of the General Statutes.
   (b)   If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the public officer, he
shall sell the materials of the dwelling, and any personal property, fixtures
or appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall credit the
proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition, and any
balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the public
officer, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall be
disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final
order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
impair or limit in any way the power of the county to define and declare
nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or
otherwise.
(Ord. No. 1993-5, § 17, 5-19-1993)
Sec. 6-239. Alternative remedies.
   Neither this article nor any of its provisions shall be construed to impair
or limit in any way the power of the county to define and declare nuisances and
to cause their abatement by summary action or otherwise, or to enforce this
article by criminal process as authorized by G.S. 14-4, and the enforcement of
any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the enforcement of any other
remedy or remedies provided herein or in other ordinances or laws.
(Ord. No. 1993-5, § 18, 5-19-1993)
Sec. 6-240. Board of adjustment to hear appeals.
   (a)   The county board of commissioners shall act as the board of
adjustment.
   (b)   All appeals which may be taken from decisions or orders of the officer
pursuant to section
6-236(e) shall be heard and determined by the board of adjustment. As the
appeals body, the board shall have the power to fix the times and places of its
meetings, to adopt necessary rules and regulations for the proper discharge of
its duties. The board shall perform the duties prescribed by section
6-236(e) and shall keep an accurate journal of all its proceedings.
(Ord. No. 1993-5, § 19, 5-19-1993)
Sec. 6-241. Conflict with other provisions.
   In the event any provision, standard, or requirement of this article is
found to be in conflict with any provision of any other ordinance or code of
the county, the provision which establishes the higher standard or more
stringent requirements for the promotion and protection of the health and
safety of the residents of the county shall prevail.
(Ord. No. 1993-5, § 20, 5-19-1993)
Sec. 6-242. Violations; penalty.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling or dwelling unit to
fail, neglect, or refuse to repair, alter, or improve the same, or to vacate
and close and remove or demolish the same, upon order of the officer duly made
and served as herein provided, within the time specified in such order. Each
day that any such failure, neglect, refusal to comply with such order continues
shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.

misdemeanor, as provided by G.S. 14-4, and shall carry a penalty of a fine of
an amount as established by the board of commissioners from time to time, for
each separate occurrence.
   (d)   In addition to the penalty established by subsection (c) of this
section, and the remedies provided by other provisions of this article, this
article may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 12-21. Exceptions to applicability.
   (a)   Nothing contained herein shall repeal, modify, or amend any federal or
state law or regulation, or any ordinance or regulation pertaining thereto
except any ordinance which these regulations specifically replace; nor shall
any provision of this article amend, modify, or restrict any provisions of this
Code; however, the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is
derived, shall and does amend any and all ordinances, resolutions, and
regulations in effect in the county at the time of the adoption of the
ordinance from which this article is derived that may be construed to impair or
reduce the effectiveness of this article or to conflict with any of its
provisions.
   (b)   It is not intended that these regulations interfere with any easement,
covenants or other agreements between parties. However, if the provisions of
these regulations impose greater restrictions or higher standards for the use
of a building or land, then the provisions of these regulations shall control.
   (c)   Existing development, as defined in this article, is not subject to
the requirements of this article. Expansions to structures classified as
existing development must meet the requirements of this article; however, the
built-upon area of the existing development is not required to be included in
the density calculations.
   (d)   If a nonconforming lot of record is not contiguous to any other lot
owned by the same party, then that lot of record shall not be subject to the
development restrictions of this article if it is developed for single-family
residential purposes. Any lot or parcel created as part of a family subdivision
after the effective date of these rules shall be exempt from these rules if it
is developed for one single-family detached residence and if it is exempt from
local subdivision regulation. Any lot or parcel created as part of any other
type of subdivision that is exempt from a local subdivision ordinance shall be
subject to the land use requirements (including impervious surface
requirements) of these rules, except that such a lot or parcel must meet the
minimum buffer requirements to the maximum extent practicable.

   This article in part carries forward by re-enactment, some of the Watershed
Ordinance of Martin County, North Carolina (adopted by the board of
commissioners on December 23, 1993), and it is not the intention to repeal but
rather to re-enact and continue in force such existing provisions so that all
rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are preserved and may be
enforced. All provisions of the watershed ordinance which are not re-enacted
herein are hereby repealed. All suits at law or in equity and/or all
prosecutions resulting from the violation of any ordinance provisions
heretofore in effect, which are now pending in any court of this state or of
the United States, shall not be abated or abandoned by reason of the adoption
of the ordinance from which this article is derived, but shall be prosecuted to
their finality the same as if the ordinance from which this article is derived
had not been adopted; and any and all violations of the existing watershed
protection ordinance, prosecutions for which have not been instituted, may be
hereafter filed and prosecuted; and nothing in this article shall be so
construed as to abandon, abate or dismiss any litigation or prosecution now
pending and/or which may heretofore have been instituted or prosecuted.

business, or use in or about the premises. In addition, the state environmental
management commission may assess civil penalties in accordance with G.S. 143-
215.6(a). Each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
   (b)   If the watershed administrator, hereinafter referred to as chief code
enforcement officer or his designee, finds that any of the provisions of this
article are being violated, he shall notify in writing the person responsible
for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation, and ordering the
action necessary to correct it. He shall order discontinuance of the illegal
use of land, buildings or structures; removal of illegal buildings or
structures, or of additions, alterations or structural changes thereto;
discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or shall take any action

activities that require an erosion/sedimentation control plan under state law
or approved local program are required to meet the provisions of this division
when located in a WS-IV watershed. In order to address a moderate to high land
use intensity pattern, single-family residential uses are allowed at a maximum
of two dwelling units per acre. All other residential and nonresidential
development shall be allowed at a maximum of 24 percent built-upon area. New
residuals application sites and landfills are specifically prohibited.
      (1)   Allowed uses.
         a.   Agriculture. Subject to the provisions of the Food Security Act
of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 and the
rules and regulations of the soil and water conservation commission.
         b.   Silviculture. Subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices
Guidelines Related to Water Quality (15 NCAC 1I.0101-.0209).
         c.   Residential.
         d.   Nonresidential development. Excluding:
            1.   Landfills; and
            2.   Sites for land application of residuals or petroleum
contaminated soils.
      (2)   Density and built-upon limits.
         a.   Single-family residential. Development shall not exceed two
dwelling units per acre on a project by project basis. No residential lot shall
be less than one-half acre (or 20,000 square feet excluding roadway right-of-
way), except within an approved cluster development.
         b.   All other residential and nonresidential. Development shall not
exceed 24 percent built-upon area on a project by project basis. For the
purpose of calculating the built-upon area, total project area shall include
total acreage in the tract on which the project is to be developed.
   (b)   WS-IV Watershed areas; protected area (WS-IV-PA). Only new development
activities that require an erosion/sedimentation control plan under state law
or approved local government program are required to meet the provisions of
this division when located in a WS-IV watershed. In order to accommodate
moderate to high land use intensity, single-family residential uses shall
develop at a maximum of two dwelling units per acre. All other residential and
nonresidential development shall be allowed at a maximum of 24 percent built-
upon area. A maximum of three dwelling units per acre or 36 percent built-upon
area is allowed for projects without a curb and gutter street system.
      (1)   Uses allowed.
         a.   Agriculture. Subject to the provisions of the Food Security Act
of 1985 and the Food, Agricultural, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990.

hazardous materials unless a spill containment plan is implemented.
      (2)   Density and built-upon limits.
         a.   Single-family residential. Development shall not exceed two
dwelling units per acre, as defined on a project by project basis. No
residential lot shall be less than one-half acre (or 20,000 square feet
excluding roadway right-of-way), or one-third acre for projects without a curb
and gutter street system, except within an approved cluster development.
         b.   All other residential and nonresidential. Development shall not
exceed 24 percent built-upon area on a project by project basis. For projects
without a curb and gutter street system, development shall not exceed 36
percent built-upon area on a project by project basis. For the purpose of
calculating built-upon area, total project area shall include acreage in the
tract on which the project is to be developed. When the total project involves
the development of public streets, the built-upon area in those new streets is
included in the calculation of the built-upon area for the project. As a
result, the allowable built upon area for the remaining lot or lots shall be
adjusted to account for the built-upon area of the street. Any final
subdivision plat, zoning permit and conditional use permit for the project
shall indicate the maximum permitted square feet of built-upon area for each
parcel.
   In addition to the development allowed under subsections (2)a and (2)b of
this section, new development and expansions to existing development may occupy
up to ten percent of the protected area with up to 70 percent built-upon area
on a project by project basis, when approved as a special intensity allocation
(SIA). The chief code enforcement officer is authorized to approve SIAs
consistent with the provisions of this division. Projects must, to the maximum
extent practicable, minimize built-upon surface area, direct stormwater away
from surface waters and incorporate best management practices to minimize water
quality impacts. For the purpose of calculating built-upon area, total project
area shall include total acreage in the tract on which the project is to be
developed.

Sec. 12-81. Cluster development.
   Cluster development is allowed in all watershed areas under the following
conditions:
      (1)   Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster
development projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the
number of lots allowed for single-family detached developments in section
12-80. Density or built-upon area for the project shall not exceed that allowed
for the critical area, balance of watershed or protected area, whichever
applies.
      (2)   All built-upon area shall be designed and located to minimize
stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated
stormwater flow, maximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas, and
maximize the flow length through vegetated areas.
      (3)   Areas of concentrated density development shall be located in
upland area and away, to the maximum extent practicable, from surface waters
and drainageways.
      (4)   The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural
state. The title to the open space area shall be conveyed to an incorporated
homeowners association for management; to a local government for preservation
as a park or open space; or to a conservation organization for preservation in
a permanent easement. Where a property association is not incorporated, a
maintenance agreement shall be filed with the property deeds.
      (5)   Cluster developments that meet the applicable low density
requirements shall transport stormwater runoff by vegetated conveyances to the
maximum extent practicable.
(Ord. No. 2014-1, § 303, 8-14-2013)
Sec. 12-82. Buffer areas required.
   (a)   A minimum 100-foot vegetative buffer is required for all new
development activities that are approved for a special intensity allocation
(SIA); otherwise, a minimum 30-foot vegetative buffer for development
activities is required along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent
versions of U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as
determined by local government studies. Desirable artificial streambank or
shoreline stabilization is permitted.
   (b)   No new development is allowed in the buffer except for water dependent
structures, other structures such as flag poles, signs and security lights
which result in only diminutive increases in impervious area and public
projects such as road crossings and greenways where no practical alternative
exists. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff
away from the surface waters and maximize the utilization of stormwater best
management practices.
(Ord. No. 2014-1, § 304, 8-14-2013)
Sec. 12-83. Rules governing the interpretation of watershed area boundaries.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of the watershed areas, as
shown on the watershed map, the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Where area boundaries are indicated as approximately following
either street, alley, railroad or highway lines or centerlines thereof, such
lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
      (2)   Where area boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot
lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. However, a
surveyed plat prepared by a registered land surveyor may be submitted to the
county as evidence that one or more properties along these boundaries do not
lie within the watershed area.
      (3)   Where the watershed area boundaries lie at a scaled distance more
than 25 feet from any parallel lot line, the location of watershed area
boundaries shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the watershed
map.
      (4)   Where the watershed area boundaries lie at a scaled distance of 25
feet or less from any parallel lot line, the location of watershed area
boundaries shall be construed to be the lot line.
      (5)   Boundaries of watershed districts indicated as approximately
following the ridge lines shall be construed as the actual ridge line as
determined by accepting surveying practices. The property owner shall bear the
expense of any surveys.
      (6)   Where other uncertainty exists, the chief code enforcement officer
shall interpret the watershed map as to location of such boundaries. This
decision may be appealed to the board of commissioners.

however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required to be
included in the built-upon area calculations.
      (1)   Occupied lots. This category consists of lots, occupied for
residential purposes at the time of the adoption of this division. These lots
may continue to be used provided that whenever two or more adjoining lots of
record, one of which is occupied, and such lots individually or together have
less area than the minimum requirements for residential purposes for the
watershed area in which they are located, such lots shall be combined to create
lots which meet the minimum size requirements or which minimize the degree of
nonconformity.
      (2)   Uses of land. This category consists of uses existing at the time
of adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived, where such
use of the land is not permitted to be established hereafter in the watershed
area in which it is located. Such uses may be continued except as follows:
         a.   When such use of land has been changed to an allowed use, it
shall not thereafter revert to any prohibited use.
         b.   Such use of land shall be changed only to an allowed use.
         c.   When such use ceases for a period of at least one year, it shall
not be re-established.
      (3)   Reconstruction of buildings or built-upon areas. Any existing
building or built-upon area not in conformance with the restrictions of this
division, that has been damaged or removed, may be repaired and/or
reconstructed, except that there are no restrictions on single-family
residential development, provided:
         a.   Repair or reconstruction is initiated within 12 months and
completed within two years of such damage.
         b.   The total amount of space devoted to built-upon area may not be
increased unless stormwater control that equals or exceeds the previous
development is provided.
(Ord. No. 2014-1, § 307, 8-14-2013)
Sec. 12-86. Watershed protection permit.
   (a)   Except where a single-family residence is constructed on a lot deeded
prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is
derived, no building or built-upon area shall be erected, moved, enlarged or
structurally altered, nor shall any building permit be issued nor shall any
change in the use of any building or land be made until a watershed protection
permit has been issued by the chief code enforcement officer. No watershed
protection permit shall be issued except in conformity with the provisions of
this article.
   (b)   Watershed protection permit applications shall be filed with the chief
code enforcement officer. The application shall include a completed application

Sec. 12-87. Building permit required.
   No watershed protection permit is required for a single-family residence
constructed on a lot of record prior to the effective date of the ordinance
from which this article is derived. No permit required under the state building
code shall be issued for any activity for which a watershed protection permit
is required until that permit has been issued.
(Ord. No. 2014-1, § 309, 8-14-2013)
Sec. 12-88. Watershed protection occupancy permit.
   (a)   The chief code enforcement officer shall issue a watershed protection
occupancy permit certifying that all requirements of this article have been met
prior to the occupancy or use of a building hereafter erected, altered or moved
and/or prior to the change of use of any building or land.
   (b)   A watershed protection occupancy permit, either for the whole or part
of a building, shall be applied for coincident with the application for a
watershed protection permit and shall be issued or denied within ten days after
the erection or structural alterations of the building.
   (c)   When only a change in use of land or existing building occurs, the
chief code enforcement officer shall issue a watershed protection occupancy
permit certifying that all requirements of this article have been met
coincident with the watershed protection permit.
   (d)   If the watershed protection occupancy permit is denied, the chief code
enforcement officer shall notify the applicant in writing stating the reasons

(Ord. No. 2014-1, § 506, 8-14-2013)
Sec. 12-147. Powers and duties of the board of commissioners in its role as the
watershed review board.
   In exercising the powers in this article, the board may reverse or affirm,
wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or
determination of the watershed administrator, and may direct the issuance of a
watershed permit.
      (1)   Administrative review. The board of commissioners shall hear and
decide appeals from any decision or determination made by the chief code
enforcement officer in the enforcement of this article.
      (2)   Variances. The board of commissioners shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, minor variances from the terms of this article as
will not be contrary to the public interests where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of this article will result in practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this article shall
be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
In addition, the county shall notify and allow a reasonable comment period for
all other local governments having jurisdiction in the designated watershed
where the variance is being considered.
         a.   Applications for a variance shall be made on the proper form
obtainable from the chief code enforcement officer and shall include the
following information:
            1.   A site plan, drawn to a scale of at least one inch to 40 feet,
indicating the property lines of the parcel upon which the use is proposed; any
existing or proposed structures; parking areas and other built-upon areas;
surface water drainage. The site plan shall be neatly drawn and indicate north
point, name and address of person who prepared the plan, date of the original
drawing, and an accurate record of any later revisions.
            2.   A complete and detailed description of the proposed variance,
together with any other pertinent information which the applicant feels would
be helpful to the board of commissioners in considering the application.
            3.   The chief code enforcement officer shall notify in writing
each local government having jurisdiction in the watershed and the entity using
the water supply for consumption. Such notice shall include a description of
the variance being requested. Local governments receiving notice of the
variance request may submit comments to the chief code enforcement officer
prior to a decision by the board of commissioners. Such comments shall become a
part of the record of proceedings of the board of commissioners.
         b.   Before the board of commissioners may grant a variance, it shall
make the following three findings, which shall be recorded in the permanent
record of the case, and shall include the factual reasons on which they are
based:
            1.   There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
the way of carrying out the strict letter of this article. In order to
determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the
board must find that the five following conditions exist:
               (i)   If he complies with the provisions of this article, the
applicant can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his
property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be
made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in
granting a variance. Moreover, the board shall consider whether the variance is
the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this article that will make
possible the reasonable use of his property.
               (ii)   The hardship results from the application of this article
to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or
other hardship.
               (iii)   The hardship is due to the physical nature of the
applicant's property, such as its size, shape, or topography, which is
different from that of neighboring property.
               (iv)   The hardship is not the result of the actions of an
applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates the ordinance, or who purchases
the property after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article
is derived, and then comes to the board for relief.
               (v)   The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property,
rather than the result of conditions that are widespread. If other properties
are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a
variance would be a special privilege denied to others, and would not promote
equal justice.
            2.   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of the ordinance and preserves its spirit.
            3.   In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare
have been assured and substantial justice has been done. The board shall not
grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the
public health, safety, or general welfare.
         c.   In granting the variance, the board may attach thereto such
conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of the
proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of
the purpose of this article. If a variance for the construction, alteration or
use of property is granted, such construction, alteration or use shall be in
accordance with the approved site plan.
         d.   The variance or request requires a four-fifths vote by the board
of commissioners for approval.
         e.   The board of commissioners shall refuse to hear an appeal or an
application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been
no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or
application.
         f.   A variance issued in accordance with this section shall be
considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit
or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant
within six months from the date of the decision.
         g.   If the application calls for the granting of a major variance,
and if the board of commissioners decides in favor of granting the variance,
the board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate
speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall include:
            1.   The variance application;
            2.   The hearing notices;
            3.   The evidence presented;
            4.   Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings
on them;
            5.   Proposed findings and exceptions;
            6.   The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be
added to the permit.
         h.   The preliminary record shall be sent to the environmental
management commission for its review as follows:
            1.   If the environmental management commission concludes from the
preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that:
               (i)   The property owner can secure no reasonable return from,
nor make any practical use of the property unless the proposed variance is
granted; and
               (ii)   The variance, if granted, will not result in a serious
threat to the water supply, then the environmental management commission shall
approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with
conditions and stipulations. The environmental management commission shall
prepare a commission decision and send it to the board of commissioners. If the
environmental management commission approves the variance as proposed, the
board shall prepare a final decision granting the proposed variance. If the
environmental management commission approves the variance with conditions and
stipulations, the board shall prepare a final decision, including such
conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance.
            2.   If the environmental management commission concludes from the
preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that:
               (i)   The property owner can secure a reasonable return from or
make a practical use of the property without the variance; or
               (ii)   The variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat
to the water supply, then the environmental management commission shall deny
approval of the variance as proposed. The environmental management commission
shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the board of commissioners.
The board shall prepare a final decision denying the variance as proposed.
      (3)   Subdivision approval. See division 2 of this article.
      (4)   Public health. See division 4 of this article.

Sec. 12-180. Purpose.
   (a)   It is recognized that excessive noise endangers the physical and
emotional health and welfare of the people, interferes with legitimate business
and recreational activity, depresses property values, offends the senses,
creates public nuisances, and in other respects reduces the quality of life.
   (b)   It is further recognized that a substantial body of science and
technology exists by which excessive sound may be measured and substantially
abated. Because excessive noise may jeopardize human health or welfare or
substantially degrade the quality of life, it is the purpose of this article to
prevent, prohibit, and provide for the regulation and abatement of excessive
noise, which may injure the physical and emotional health or welfare of its
citizens or degrade the quality of life.

level meters (ANSI S1.41971 or the latest approved version thereof). If the
frequency weighting employed is not indicated, the A-weighting shall also
apply.
   Sound source means any person, animal, device, operation, process, activity,
or phenomenon, which emits or causes sound.
   Tenant means one who resides on or has the temporary use or occupation of
real property owned by another person. In the case of residential property, the
term tenant shall be construed to mean any individual actually residing at the
residential location, whether such person is listed on a lease or not.
   Unreasonably loud noise means any excessive or unusually loud sound or any
sound which disturbs the peace and quiet of any neighborhood or which does
disturb, injure or endanger the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of any
reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities or causes damage to property.
(Ord. No. 2008-2, § 2, 5-14-2008; Ord. - -)
Sec. 12-182. Maximum permitted sound levels by use occupancy.
   (a)   The use of sound amplifying equipment is limited to the conditions
specified in this section.
   (b)   Outdoor amplified sound, including a live musical group or individual
using sound amplifying equipment, may be produced only if an authorized agent
of the sponsoring business, organization, group or person has been granted an
outdoor amplified sound permit. This permit must be signed by a representative
of the business, organization or group holding or sponsoring the event at which
the outdoor amplified sound will be produced, as well as the applicant if
different from the business, organization or group holding or sponsoring the
event.
   (c)   Except as allowed in subsection (d) of this section, no person shall
operate, or cause to be operated, any source of sound in such a manner as to
create a sound level which, at its peak, exceeds the limits set forth for the
use occupancy categories in Table 1 when measured at or beyond the property
line of the property from which the sound originates. For purposes of
measurement, the back of the curb, the outside edges of driveways, fences,
hedges, or other physical features commonly associated with property boundaries
are presumed to be at a point which is at or beyond the property line. In all
cases the maximum sound level permitted by use occupancy shall be determined on
the basis of the use occupancy of the property from which the sound originates
and not by the use occupancy of any surrounding property. Sound, which
originates from a dwelling unit in a duplex or other multifamily housing unit
shall be measured from any point, which is at least 25 lineal feet, whether
inside or outside a building, from the nearest point of the enclosed or
habitable space of the dwelling unit from which the sound originates.

Sec. 12-189. Owner responsibility for noise violations.
   (a)   No property owner shall allow a noise-related nuisance or health or
safety hazard to be created or maintained by or on account of tenants of the
property owner. For purposes of this section, a noise-related nuisance or
health or safety hazard shall be deemed to exist when a tenant or group of
tenants at a specific location receives a third citation for a noise ordinance
violation pursuant to this article. A property owner may be held liable for the
costs of abating the nuisance or remedying the health or safety hazard only if
the property owner has been notified in writing of the first two ordinance
violations. A property owner shall be liable for the costs of abating the
nuisance or remedying the health or safety hazard upon the third and any
subsequent action by the same tenant at a specific location, provided the third
violation occurs at least 15 days from the date of actual receipt of notice of
the second violation. It shall be a complete defense to a citation under this
subsection if the owner of the real property involved can prove that the
property owner is actively pursuing an eviction process according to law, and
that the eviction process was begun prior to the date of the third or any
subsequent violation by the same tenant at a specific location.
   (b)   Owners, property managers, agents, management companies, employees of
the owner, property manager, agent or management companies, and their family
members shall be responsible and liable for any violations of this article by
tenants, guests, or licensees on the premises if the owners, property managers,
agents, management companies, employees of the owner, property manager, agent
or management companies, or their family members are present at the time of the
violation.
   (c)   Notice of any previous violations pursuant to this section shall be
affected by registered or certified mail and by regular mail sent concurrently.
Alternately, notice may be affected by personal hand delivery and
acknowledgment of receipt by the owner or agent of the owner. If the certified
or registered notification is returned, but the regular mail notification is
not returned, it will be presumed the addressee received the notification. The
burden shall be on the addressee to establish that such notification was not
received.
(Ord. No. 2008-2, § 10, 5-14-2008; Ord. - -)
Sec. 12-190. Violations.
   (a)   When it is reasonable and practical to do so, a person believed to be
violating any portion of this article may be given an oral order to cease or
abate the noise immediately, or as soon as is reasonable or practical, prior to
being charged with a violation.
   (b)   If the order to cease or abate the noise is not complied with, the
person or persons responsible for the violation may be charged with a violation
of this article.
(Ord. No. 2008-2, § 11, 5-14-2008; Ord. - -)
Sec. 12-191. Penalties and enforcement.
   (a)   Civil penalty. Any violation of the provisions of this article shall
subject the offender to a civil penalty in the amount as shall be determined by
the board of commissioners from time to time. In the event there is more than
one violation within any 30-day period, then the civil penalty shall be
increased for each additional violation over one during such period, as
follows. The date of the first violation shall establish the beginning date for
the initial 30-day period. The next violation within that 30-day period shall
be considered the second violation. Any violations that follow within that 30-
day period shall be numbered sequentially. The penalty shall be:
      (1)   A second offense within same 30-day period shall be subject to a
fine in the amount as specified by the board of commissioners from time to
time.
      (2)   Third and subsequent offenses within same 30-day period shall be
subject to a fine in the amount as specified by the board of commissioners from
time to time.
      (3)   Once the 30-day period has run from the first violation, the next
violation shall be considered to be a first violation for the purposes of
establishing a new 30-day period. Each subsequent violation that follows more
than 30 days from the previous first violation shall be a new first violation
for the purpose of establishing a new 30-day period. Violators shall be issued
a written citation, which must be paid within 72 hours of the issue date and
time, which penalty may provide for an additional delinquency charge in an
amount as specified by the board of commissioners from time to time, for each
72-hour period thereafter upon nonpayment until paid in full. The county
attorney, or his or her designee, is authorized to file suit on behalf of the
county to collect any unpaid citations and any delinquency charge, and the
sheriff, or his or her designee, is authorized to verify and sign complaints on
behalf of the county in such suits. A county law enforcement officer or other
employee authorized by the county manager to enforce the noise control
ordinances may issue a citation for violations of this article. If litigation
is required to recover the penalties and delinquency charges, the county
attorney or his or her designee in addition to the penalties and delinquency
charges may recover reasonable attorney's fees and other costs incurred in
bringing the action and collecting the judgment.
   (b)   Remedies. This article may also be enforced through equitable remedies
including, but not limited to, nuisance abatement procedures as issued by a
court of competent jurisdiction.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 14-1. Statutory authorization.
   The legislature of the State of North Carolina has in part 6, article 21 of
chapter 143; parts 3 and 4 of article 18 of chapter 153A; and part 121, article
6 of chapter 153A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local
governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(Ord. No. 2007-4, art. 1, § A, 9-12-2007)
Sec. 14-2. Findings of fact.
   (a)   The floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of the county are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. No. 2007-4, art. 1, § B, 9-12-2007)
Sec. 14-3. Statement of purpose.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that
may increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. No. 2007-4, art. 1, § C, 9-12-2007)
Sec. 14-4. Objectives.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges)
that are located in floodprone areas;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of floodprone areas; and
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a
special flood hazard area.
(Ord. No. 2007-4, art. 1, § D, 9-12-2007)
Sec. 14-5. Definitions.
   The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
   Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Garages, carports and storage
sheds are common urban accessory structures. Pole barns, hay sheds and the like
qualify as accessory structures on farms, and may or may not be located on the
same parcel as the farm dwelling or shop building.
   Addition (to an existing building) means an extension or increase in the
floor area or height of a building or structure.
   Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   Area of shallow flooding means a designated Zone AO on a community's flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths determined to be from one to
three feet. These areas are located where a clearly defined channel does not
exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where
velocity flow may be evident.
   Area of special flood hazard. See Special flood hazard area (SFHA).
   Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   Base flood elevation (BFE) means a determination of the water surface
elevations of the base flood as published in the flood insurance study. When
the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area, it may be
obtained from engineering studies available from a federal, state, or other

administrator shall review the certificate data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and
prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy issuance. In some instances,
another certification may be required to certify corrected as-built
construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required
corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate of
compliance/occupancy.
      (2)   Floodproofing certificate. If nonresidential floodproofing is used
to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a FEMA
floodproofing certificate, with supporting data, an operational plan, and an
inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start of any
new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the
floodplain administrator a certification of the floodproofed design elevation
of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to mean sea
level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. The
floodplain administrator shall review the certificate data, the operational
plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit approval. Failure to
submit the certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause
to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to construct in accordance
with the certified design shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (3)   Placement of a manufactured home in a floodprone area. If a
manufactured home is placed within Zone A, AO, AE, or A1-30 and the elevation
of the chassis is more than 36 inches in height above grade, an engineered
foundation certification is required in accordance with the provisions of
section
14-73(3)b.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourse. If a watercourse is to be altered or
relocated, a description of the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation;
a professional engineer's certified report on the effects of the proposed
project on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the effects to
properties located both upstream and downstream; and a map showing the location
of the proposed watercourse alteration or relocation shall all be submitted by
the permit applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit.
      (5)   Certification exemptions. The following structures, if located
within Zone A, AO, AE or A1-30, are exempt from the elevation/floodproofing
certification requirements specified in subsection (c)(1) and (2) of this
section:

counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
      (3)   That following the hearing, the floodplain administrator may issue
an order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
applicable.
   (c)   Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the floodplain administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of this chapter he shall issue an order
in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within a
specified time period, not less than 60 calendar days, nor more than 180
calendar days. Where the floodplain administrator finds that there is imminent
danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken
in such lesser period as may be feasible.
   (d)   Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice of
appeal in writing to the floodplain administrator and the clerk within ten days
following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order
of the floodplain administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall
hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or
revoke the order.
   (e)   Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no appeal has
been made or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an
appeal, the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished at the
discretion of the court.

submitted with the application for a variance.
   (f)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
   (g)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. Such
notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance.
   (h)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and

the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation shall apply.
(Ord. No. 2007-4, art. 5, § A, 9-12-2007)
Sec. 14-73. Specific standards.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in section
14-7, or section
14-74, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of section
14-72, are required:
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall
have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in section
14-5.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in section
14-5. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AO, and A1-30 may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of actual elevation, provided
that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation, are watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied.
Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set
forth in section
14-46(c), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
      (3)   Manufactured homes.
         a.   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in section
14-5.
         b.   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the state regulations for manufactured homes adopted by the
commissioner of insurance pursuant to G.S. 143-143.15. Additionally, when the
elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above
the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or
engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in
height, an engineering certification is required.
         c.   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of subsection (4) of this section.
         d.   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within floodprone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the floodplain administrator and the
local emergency management coordinator.
      (4)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed areas, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which are below the lowest floor:
         a.   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall
only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
         b.   Shall be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials at
least to the regulatory flood protection elevation;
         c.   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE, and Al-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
            2.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
            3.   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
            4.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
            5.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
            6.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      (5)   Additions/improvements.
         a.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
            1.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more nonconforming than the existing structure.
            2.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         b.   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
         c.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
            1.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction.
            2.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (6)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
         a.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or
         b.   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
      (7)   Temporary nonresidential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the floodplain administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
floodplain administrator for review and written approval:
         a.   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
         b.   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
         c.   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
         d.   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the
entity responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
         e.   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
      (8)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, etc.) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the
following criteria shall be met:
         a.   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
         b.   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
         c.   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
         d.   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
         e.   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
the provisions of section
14-72(1);
         f.   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of section
14-72(4); and
         g.   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation in conformance with the provisions of section
14-73(4)c.
   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet that
satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or
floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with section
14-46(c).
(Ord. No. 2007-4, art. 5, § B, 9-12-2007)
Sec. 14-74. Standards for floodplains without established base flood
elevations.
   Within the special flood hazard areas designated as approximate Zone A and
established in section
14-7, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the
following provisions, in addition to the provisions of section
14-72, shall apply:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20
feet, each side, from top of bank or five times the width of the stream,
whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria:
         a.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in sections
14-72 and
14-73.
         b.   When floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other
source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway areas
shall also comply with the requirements of sections
14-73 and
14-76.
         c.   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such
base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance
with section
14-7 and utilized in implementing this chapter.
         d.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be
elevated or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in section
14-5. All other applicable provisions of section
14-73 shall also apply.
(Ord. No. 2007-4, art. 5, § D, 9-12-2007)
Sec. 14-75. Standards for riverine floodplains with BFE but without established
floodways or non-encroachment areas.
   Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available

identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report,
the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
      (1)   Standards of sections
14-72 and
14-73; and
      (2)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated,
no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.
(Ord. No. 2007-4, art. 5, § E, 9-12-2007)
Sec. 14-76. Floodways and non-encroachment areas.
   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within
the special flood hazard areas established in section
14-7. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards
outlined in sections
14-72 and
14-73, shall apply to all development within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         a.   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the floodplain administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         b.   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by
FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of
the proposed encroachment.
      (2)   If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all development
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this
chapter.
      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
provided the following provisions are met:
         a.   The anchoring and the elevation standards of section
14-73(3); and
         b.   The no encroachment standard of subsection (1) of this section.

of 500 gallons or more. The decal shall be of a size and located on the tank at
a point which is readily visible to emergency response forces and commensurate
with tank design. A number indicating the level of hazard will be affixed or
imprinted within each of the three areas (blue, red, and yellow) designed for
such, and any approved additional information applicable shall be affixed or
imprinted within the designated fourth (white) area of the decal or placard.

Sec. 20-119. Enforcement.
   This section is adapted in part from G.S. 20-219.11.
   This article will be enforced through the following procedures:
   The Martin County manager, Martin County building inspector and any Martin
County law enforcement officer may issue citations for violation of this
article;
   If the vehicle owner can be located, they will receive two letters of
warning. The first letter will serve as a formal request to relocate the
vehicle, and the owner will have 30 days to move the vehicle before the county
takes additional action. The second letter will be a certified letter
identifying the vehicle as abandoned and that the owner will have ten days to
move the vehicle before it is towed.
   Ten days after sending the certified letter identifying the abandoned
vehicle, the county manager, building inspector or law enforcement officer
shall placard the motor vehicle as abandoned. After the placard has remained on
such abandoned motor vehicle for 48 hours, a directed tow may be ordered. The
towing company will remove the vehicle and relocate the vehicle to a storage
space deemed appropriate by the company.
   Whenever a vehicle with a valid registration plate or registration is towed
as provided in G.S. 20-219.10, the authorizing person shall immediately notify
the last known registered owner of the vehicle of the following:
      (1)   A description of the vehicle;
      (2)   The place where the vehicle is stored;
      (3)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;
      (4)   The procedure the owner must follow to have the vehicle returned to
him; and
      (5)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable cause
hearing on the towing.
   If the vehicle has a North Carolina registration plate or registration,
notice shall be given to the owner within 24 hours; if the vehicle is not
registered in this state, notice shall be given to the owner within 72 hours.
This notice shall, if feasible, be given by telephone. Whether or not the owner
is reached by telephone, notice shall be mailed to his last known address
unless he or his agent waives this notice in writing.
   Whenever a vehicle with neither a valid registration plate nor registration
is towed as provided in G.S. 20-219.10, the authorizing person shall make
reasonable efforts, including checking the vehicle identification number, to
determine the last known registered owner of the vehicle and to notify him of
the information listed in subsections (1) through (5). Unless the owner has
otherwise been given notice, it is presumed that the authorizing person has not
made reasonable efforts, as required under this subsection, unless notice that
the vehicle would be towed was posted on the windshield or some other
conspicuous place at least seven days before the towing actually occurred;
except, no pre-towing notice need be given if the vehicle impeded the flow of
traffic or otherwise jeopardized the public welfare so that immediate towing
was necessary.
(Ord. of 09-09-2020(1))
Sec. 20-120. Selecting the towing company.
   The towing company chosen to move the vehicle will be determined by the
Martin County Communications Center, which rotates through a list of towing
companies to use in these situations.
(Ord. of 09-09-2020(1))
Sec. 20-121. Procedures after towing.
   This section is adapted in part from G.S. 20-219.11, 20-219.12, 20-219.13,
and 20-219.14.
   The vehicle owner will be responsible for the towing cost; if the owner or
person lawfully entitled to custody of any vehicle does not obtain the
vehicle's release within seven days of its possession by the towing company,
the towing company shall file for a mechanic's lien. Once the company has
obtained the lien, the company shall sell the vehicle to recover the cost of
the tow and storage. The towing company may retain any additional funds
resulting from the vehicle's sale that are left over after the fees are paid.
   The owner or any other person entitled to claim possession of the vehicle
may request in writing a hearing to determine if probable cause existed for the
towing. The request shall be filed with the magistrate in the county where the
vehicle was towed. If there is more than one magistrate's office in that
county, the request may be filed with the magistrate in the warrant-issuing
office in the county seat or in any other office designated to receive requests
by the chief district court judge. The magistrate shall set the hearing within
72 hours of his receiving the request. The owner, the person who requested the
hearing if someone other than the owner, the tower, and the person who
authorized the towing shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing.
   The owner, the tower, the person who authorized the towing, and any other
interested parties may present evidence at the hearing. The person authorizing
the towing and the tower may submit an affidavit in lieu of appearing
personally, but the affidavit does not preclude that person from also
testifying.
   The only issue at this hearing is whether or not probable cause existed for
the towing. If the magistrate finds that probable cause did exist, the tower's
lien continues. If the magistrate finds that probable cause did not exist, the
tower's lien is extinguished.
   Any aggrieved party may appeal the magistrate's decision to district court.
   At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause
hearing, the owner may obtain possession of his vehicle by:
      (1)   Paying the towing fee, or
      (2)   Posting a bond for double the amount of the towing fee. (1983, c.
420, s. 2.)
   The tower may seek to enforce his lien or the owner may seek to contest the
lien pursuant to G.S. ch. 44A. (1983, c. 420, s. 2.)
   Every agency whose law enforcement officers act pursuant to this article,
G.S. 115D-21, 116-44.4, 116-229, 153A-132, or 160A-303 shall by contract or
rules provide compensation to the tower if a court finds no probable cause
existed for the towing. (1983, c. 420, s. 2.)

ARTICLE V. NONCONFORMITIES
Sec. 25-71. Nonconforming conditions/nonconformities.
   A nonconforming condition occurs when an existing lot, structure, or use of
an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the current
regulations applicable to the area in which the lot or structure is located.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2023)
Sec. 25-72. Continuance of nonconforming conditions.
   (a)   Any nonconforming conditions, which were legally existing at the time
of adoption or amendment of this chapter, may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful subject to the conditions provided in this section.
   (b)   Conditions for continuance of nonconforming uses of land. Such
nonconforming use of land shall be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use
unless such use is determined to be of equal or less intensity. In determining
whether a nonconforming use is of equal or less intensity, the Board of
Adjustment shall consider all aspects deemed relevant to the situation.
      (2)   If any nonconforming use of land/structure ceases for any reason
for a continuous period of more than 180 days, any subsequent use of the land
shall comply with the regulations of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2023)
Sec. 25-73. Modification of a nonconforming condition.
   No nonconforming condition shall be extended, enlarged, replaced, or
relocated except regarding the following circumstances.
   (a)   Any single-family residential nonconforming use (which may be a
manufactured home) may be enlarged or replaced with a similar single-family
residential structure of the same size or of a larger size, so long as the
enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the
extent of existing nonconformities with respect to setback requirements.
   (b)   The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a
nonconforming use exists may be increased.
   (c)   Any other nonconforming use may be extended, enlarged, or replaced
only upon the decision of the Board of Adjustment. The BOA must find that there
would be no increase in the total amount of lot area devoted to the
nonconforming use, and that no new nonconforming conditions would be created.
   (d)   No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way,
which increases its dimensional deficiencies; however, any nonconforming
structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its dimensional
deficiencies. Any enlargement of the structure shall conform to the current
dimensional requirements.
   (e)   Where a nonconforming structure is destroyed or damaged by fire,
flood, wind, other similar causes, the structure may be repaired or restored to
its original dimensions and conditions as long as a building permit for the
repair or restoration is issued within 180 days of the date of the damage,
subject to compliance with the requirements of the North Carolina State
Building Code. After such time passes, the lot or structure would have to
comply with the current regulations of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2023)

based on the type of development.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2023)
Sec. 25-82. Fences, walls, and hedges.
   Fences and walls shall not be located within a public street right-of-way
nor placed or retained in such a manner as to obstruct vision at any
intersection with public or private roads. Nothing in this section shall
preclude, however, the installation of temporary fences around construction
works, erected, or maintained pursuant to the North Carolina Building Code or
soil erosion and sedimentation control requirements. No fences shall be located
within a utility easement without review and approval by the utility provider.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2023)
Sec. 25-83. Manufactured/mobile homes.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   No person shall locate, relocate or cause to be located or
relocated any mobile home intended for use as a dwelling, other than one in a
mobile home park with an approved sewage disposal system, or in an area served
by a public or community sewage disposal system without first obtaining an
improvement permit from the Martin-Tyrrell-Washington District Health
Department. Martin-Tyrrell-Washington District Health Department will issue the
permit after deciding that a septic tank or other ground absorption sewage
disposal system can be installed in accordance with local and state health
regulations.
      (2)   After the improvements permit has been issued and the work has been
completed on the ground absorption sewage disposal system, the Martin-Tyrrell-
Washington District Health Department will make a final inspection. If it finds
that the system has been properly installed, it will issue a certificate of
completion. A mobile home may not lawfully be occupied until this certificate
has been issued.
      (3)   Any person locating or relocating a mobile home in the county must
secure a building permit. The County Building Inspector shall issue a building
permit upon receipt of an application which includes the name and mailing
address of the owner; description of the mobile home to include the name of the
manufacturer; year of construction, and wind zone; and the proposed location of
the mobile home. This requirement excludes dealers of mobile homes who place
mobile homes upon their sales lot.
   (b)   Design standards. The Building Inspector shall inspect each mobile
home to determine compliance with the following:
      (1)   All mobile homes shall be anchored in a manner approved by the
State of North Carolina Regulations for manufactured homes, published, and
amended by the North Carolina Department of Insurance. The anchoring shall be
completed within six months of the issuance of the building permit. In no event
shall electricity be approved to the structure prior to completion of tie down
and approved inspection of electrical, plumbing, and mechanical systems as well
as underpinning. Compliance with the floodplain certification must also be
approved if a home is in a flood zone.
      (2)   At minimum manufactured homes shall have a vinyl product of a 92-
ounce density (0.042-0.044 gauge) panel, installed per manufacturer’s
instructions. All mobile home skirting/underpinning shall be installed within
90 days of the final inspection by the Building Inspector. However, the county
shall not require a masonry curtain wall or masonry skirting for manufactured
homes located on land leased to the homeowner per G.S. 160D-910.
      (3)   All mobile homes shall be installed according to the manufacturers’
printed instructions and all applicable state and federal regulations. The
mobile home manufacturer’s instructions should be designed by a licensed
architect or engineer. Instructions should be designed by a licensed architect
or engineer. Instructions shall specify the location and required stabilizing
devices (tie-downs, piers, blockings, etc.) on which the design of the
fastening devices attached to the home is based. If such instructions do not
exist, the standards included in the “State of North Carolina Regulations for
Manufactured Homes” shall apply.
      (4)   Compliance with the FEMA floodplain set-up based on an elevation
certificate prepared by a professional surveyor, is required if the location is
determined to be in a floodplain after a site plan review by the Planning
Administrator. The after-construction survey must be completed and approved by
the Floodplain Administrator prior to allowing electricity to be supplied.
      (5)   It shall be unlawful for an individual, partnership, firm or
corporation to allow any electric current for use in any manufactured home to
be turned on or to continue to furnish electricity for use in such mobile home
without having first ascertaining that a label of compliance is attached to
said mobile home, unless owner has satisfactory evidence on file with the North
Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles that the home was manufactured prior to
September 1, 1971.

structures shall meet the following setback requirements from front, side, and
rear lot lines.
 
Yard  Setback from Lot Line
Front 30 feet
Side  10 feet
Rear  20 feet
 
   (b)   Multiple residential structures on a lot.
      (1)   Up to three principal residential structures are permitted on a
single, unsubdivided tract pursuant to a site plan approved by the Planning
Administrator, provided that the tract contains sufficient lot area, lot width,
and building setbacks for each dwelling. The location of the dwellings on the
single tract shall be such that, if the tract is subdivided, each dwelling unit
will be situated on a freestanding lot that meets all the dimensional
requirements. The addition of a fourth residential structure shall warrant
either a subdivision or shall follow the procedure of becoming a manufactured
home park, or travel trailer/RV park.
      (2)   Variances on setback requirements may be granted in situations
where two or more closely spaced residential structures exist on a single lot,
and a subdivision would not be reasonably possible without creating a setback
related nonconformity.

ARTICLE VII. SUBDIVISIONS
Sec. 25-91. General.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines and
standards for subdivisions within the county. As previously defined, a
subdivision is any division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots,
building sites, or other divisions when any of those divisions are created for
sale or development, either immediately or in the future. The definition of a
subdivision also includes any division of land that involves the dedication of
a new street or change in existing streets.
   (b)   Exemptions. The following shall not be included within the definition
of a subdivision, nor be subject to the regulations authorized by this article:
      (1)   The combination or recombination of portions of previously
subdivided and recorded lots where the total number of lots is not increased
and the resultant lots are equal to or exceed the standards of the local
government as shown in its subdivision regulations.
      (2)   The division of land into parcels greater than ten acres where no
street right-of- way dedication is involved.
      (3)   The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for the
widening or opening of streets or for public transportation system corridors.
      (4)   The division of a tract in single ownership whose entire area is no
greater than two acres into not more than three lots, where no street right-of-
way dedication is involved and where the resultant lots are equal to or exceed
the standards of the local government, as shown in its subdivision regulations.
      (5)   The division of a tract into parcels in accordance with the terms
of a probated will or in accordance with intestate succession under G.S. ch.
29.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2023)
Sec. 25-92. General requirements.
   (a)   Approval of the final plat by the Planning Board is subject to the
subdivider having installed the improvements required by applicable county
ordinances and this chapter. Each subdivision shall contain the improvements in
~ Article VI.
   (b)   Suitability of land. Land subject to periodic flooding, irregular
drainage conditions, excessive erosion or topographical and other reasons
unsuitable for residential use as determined by the appropriate board or
agency, shall not be platted for residential use nor for any other use by a
citizen that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or
property unless the hazards can be and are corrected; however, a limited amount
of land that is within an unsuitable zone may be included on a plat so long as
sufficient area for building sites and improvements are included for each lot,
and so long as the area of the unsuitable zone is disclosed to the buyer. The
100-year flood plan established for the county by FEMA and the current adopted
building code require certain elevations.
   (c)   Fill areas. Areas that have been used for the disposal of solid waste
or liquid shall not be subdivided into commercial or residential building
sites. This shall include those areas that have been used for disposal of
trash, demolition waste, chemical waste, and other waste materials. Fill areas
can be accepted when using suitable soils as found in USDA Textural
Classifications or in Unified Soil Classification Systems for fill materials.
Any appropriate soil test or load bearing test may be required by the Building
Inspector.
   (d)   Name duplication. The name of the subdivision or street in the
subdivision shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing
subdivision or street within the county.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2023)
Sec. 25-93. Improvements installation.
   (a)   Completion of improvements. Prior to final plat submission or
approval, the subdivider shall complete and dedicate in a manner satisfactory
to the Planning Board, all required improvements as specified either on the
approved preliminary plat or on that portion of the approved preliminary plat
which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time. The subdivider
shall certify in writing the dedication of said improvements as shown below.
   (b)   Certificate of dedication and maintenance. The certificate of
dedication and maintenance shall stipulate the following:
      (1)   That all property and improvements are owned by the subdivider and
free of any encumbrances or lien except as enumerated.
      (2)   That the subdivider has freely dedicated or reserved in writing,
all required right-of-way easements, streets, utilities, open spaces, or other
improvements to public or private use as noted on the approved preliminary plat
and has freely established minimum building setback lines. A purchaser of a lot
shown thereon accepts the lot subject to said dedication, reservations, and
restrictions.
      (3)   This certificate shall be filed with the final plat and forwarded
to the Register of Deeds to be recorded.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2023)
Sec. 25-94. Design standards.
   (a)   General. The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the
minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the
subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated.
   (b)   Utilities. All lots to be subdivided must be capable of being served
by on-site wells and septic tank systems or public sanitary sewer and water
facilities or private community water and sewage disposal systems approved by
the appropriate local and state agencies.
   (c)   Individual on-site wells and septic tank systems.
      (1)   Wells should be no closer than approved by the Martin-Tyrrell-
Washington District Health Department to any septic tank or filter field
whether on the same lot or another lot.
      (2)   Water supply and sewage facilities shall comply with applicable
state, county, and municipal public health laws and regulations in all aspects
not specifically mentioned in this chapter.
      (3)   The subdivider, at his/her own expense, shall have the site
investigated under the supervision of the Martin-Tyrrell-Washington District
Health Department and shall present written proof to the Planning Board, or its
appointed agent, that required and appropriate soil tests have been conducted
and that each lot in the subdivision not served by public water and public
sewage disposal systems meets standards set by the Martin-Tyrrell-Washington
District Health Department for individual waste supplies and individual sewage
disposal systems. This action shall be taken prior to approval of the
preliminary plat.
   (d)   Public sanitary sewer and water facilities or private community
sanitary sewer and water facilities.
      (1)   Upon submittal of a preliminary plat, plans and specifications
prepared and sealed by a North Carolina licensed engineer and/or surveyor shall
be provided by the subdivider to the Planning Administrator’s Office showing
necessary sanitary sewer lines, water mains and items accessory to each that
lie wholly within the rights-of-way in the subdivisions. After approval of the
preliminary plat and these plans and specifications by the Planning Board and
applicable agencies, installation of the improvements by the subdivider can
begin. The County Building Inspector or his/her designee shall act as inspector
to see that the approved plans and specifications are faithfully and completely
carried out. Where existing sanitary sewer lines and water mains are within a
reasonable distance, proposed sanitary sewer lines and water mains shall
connect with the existing system in accordance with prescribed and approved
specifications. Where sanitary sewer lines and water mains are not within a
reasonable distance, but plans have been formulated for their installation, the
sanitary sewer lines and water mains may be required at the Board’s discretion.
When sanitary sewer lines and water mains are not within a reasonable distance,
and plans do not exist, the installation of such facilities will not be
required.
      (2)   The use of a private water or sanitary sewage disposal system
approved by the Martin-Tyrrell-Washington District Health Department and other
authorizing agencies will be permitted by the subdivider. The total cost of
installation of any sanitary sewer and water distribution improvements and
accessories is to be borne by the subdivider. Each deed describing a lot within
a subdivision served by a private water or sanitary sewage disposal system
shall state that the system is private in nature and shall state the party or
parties responsible for maintenance of the system.
   (e)   Sedimentation and erosion control. Persons engaged in land disturbing
activities shall take all reasonable measures to protect public and private
property from damage by such activities. Land disturbing activities are defined
in G.S. 113A.52, as amended and supplemented, and may mean any use of land that
results in a change in the natural cover or topography and that may change or
contribute to sedimentation. When any land disturbing activity is to be
undertaken on a tract where more than one contiguous acre is to be uncovered,
the subdivider shall notify the North Carolina Sedimentation Control Commission
to determine whether a sedimentation and erosion control plan is required.
Violators of the North Carolina Sedimentation and Pollution Control Act of 1973
(G.S. 113A.50 et seq.) may be fined pursuant to statute.
   (f)   Blocks. The location, lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be
determined with due regard to: provision of adequate building sites suitable to
the special needs of the type of permitted use contemplated; requirements as to
lot sizes and dimensions; needs for vehicular and pedestrian circulation,
control, and safety of roadway traffic; limitations and opportunities of
topography; and convenient access to adequate water supplies. Blocks shall not
be less than 500 feet, nor more than 1,500 feet, in length.
   (g)   Private roads. Access to lots or parcels formed by a tract of land
constituting a subdivision may be served by a private road. A private road
shall meet the most current design and construction criteria as referenced in

existing street.
      (5)   Appropriate street name signs, which meet the Division of Highways
policies, shall be installed by the developer at all street intersections.
      (6)   Stop and yield traffic signs shall be installed by the developer at
appropriate street intersections as required by the Division of Highways. Any
supplemental signs deemed necessary to safety and welfare by the Planning Board
shall also be required for installation.
      (7)   The subdivider shall pave the first 25 feet into the subdivision
from the public road.
      (8)   Each deed conveying a lot within a subdivision served by a private
road shall state that the road serving said lot is private in nature, and is
not constructed to the present minimum standards of the North Carolina
Department of Transportation for admission to the State Highway System, thus is
not eligible for state maintenance, unless said road is constructed and paved
according to current Department of Transportation standards, and unless the
requisite number of parties receiving access from the road pursuant to statute
consent, in writing, to the road becoming public. It shall contain the name,
address, and telephone number of the party or parties responsible for
maintenance and shall further state that the county accepts no liability to
provide any maintenance or improvement assistance whatsoever for said road. In
addition, the deed, as a condition precedent to being recorded, shall contain a

existing street.
      (5)   Appropriate street name signs, which meet the Division of Highways
policies, shall be installed by the developer at all street intersections.
      (6)   Stop and yield traffic signs shall be installed by the developer at
appropriate street intersections as required by the Division of Highways. Any
supplemental signs deemed necessary to safety and welfare by the Planning Board
shall also be required for installation.
   (i)   Subdivision streets disclosure statement. Each deed describing a lot
within a subdivision served by a public road which is not yet a part of the
state-maintained highway system, shall state that the road serving said lot is
public in nature, and is constructed to present standards of the North Carolina
Department of Transportation for admission to the State Highway System, but is
not yet eligible for state maintenance. It shall reveal the party or parties
responsible for maintenance until the road is taken over by the North Carolina
Department of Transportation and shall further state that the county accepts no
liability to provide any maintenance or improvement assistance for said road.

Planning Board’s approval of the final plat for recordation.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2023)
Sec. 25-95. Easements.
   (a)   The subdivider shall convey written easements in recordable form to
the county or appropriate utility company for both underground and overhead
utility installation where needed. Easements shall be a minimum of 30 feet
wide, or wider if required by utility companies, and normally centered along
the front lot lines. Wider easements may be required if the topography along
the proposed right-of-way is such that maintenance equipment cannot reasonably
operate within the 30 feet wide easement, or if primary voltage lines or
transmission lines are within the subdivision. The conveyance of the easement
may be made after the approval of the final plat.
   (b)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a water source, drainage way,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a written storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way in recordable form conforming substantially with the
lines of such watercourse and such further width or construction, or both, as
will be adequate for the purpose of managing storm water runoff in a manner
that will safeguard the health and property of the citizens of the county.

have been established in accordance with the requirements set forth in this
section.
   (a)   Subdivision corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision shall
be designed by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference
marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Geodetic Survey or North
Carolina Coordinate Grid System coordinated monument, or Martin County
coordinated system if such exists, then this corner shall be marked with a
monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on
the map with a statement identifying this monument to an accuracy of at least
1:10,000. When such a monument is not available, the tie shall be made to some
pertinent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical
object, or structure. However, if in the opinion of the Planning Board, a
subdivision is of such small size, or if there is an existing tie within a
reasonable distance of the subdivision, this shall not be required.
   (b)   Monuments. Within each block of a subdivision, at least two monuments
designed and designated as control corners shall be installed. The surveyor
shall employ additional monuments, if required. All monuments shall be
constructed of concrete and shall be at least four inches in diameter or square
and not less than three feet in length. A monument shall be set 30 inches in
the ground, unless this requirement is impractical because of unusual
conditions. All monuments shall be shown on the final plat.
   (c)   Property markers. A steel or wrought iron pipe or the equivalent of
not less than three-fourths inches in diameter and at least 30 inches in length
shall be set at all corners, except those located by monuments. A marker shall
also be set at a point of curve, and point of tangency, unless a monument has
already been placed at said points.

AIRPORT HEIGHT 1
AIRPORT HEIGHT ORDINANCE
MARTIN COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA
   An ordinance regulating and restricting the height of structures and objects
of natural growth, and otherwise regulating the use of property, in the
vicinity of the Martin County Airport by creating the appropriate zones and
establishing the boundaries thereof; providing for changes in the restrictions
and boundaries of such zones; defining certain terms used herein; referring to
the Martin County Airport Height Ordinance Map which is incorporated in and
made a part of this ordinance; providing for enforcement; establishing a Board
of Appeals; and imposing penalties.
   This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by the Martin
County Board of Commissioners. It is hereby found that an obstruction has the
potential for endangering the lives and property of users of the Martin County
Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction
may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums of the Martin
County Airport; and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available
for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy
or impair the utility of the Martin County Airport and the public investment
therein. Accordingly, it is declared:
      1.   That the creation or establishment of an obstruction has the
potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the
Martin County Airport;
      2.   That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public
safety, and the general welfare that the creation or establishment of
obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented; and,
      3.   That the prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to
the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation.
   This ordinance repeals all prior airport zoning regulations in effect prior
to October 8, 2014. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul,
impair or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions,
agreements, rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued
pursuant to law. Whenever regulations imposed by this ordinance are less
restrictive than regulations imposed by any governmental authority through
regulations, rule or restriction, the regulations imposed by that authority
shall govern. Regardless of any other provisions, no land shall be developed or
used, and no structure shall be erected or maintained in violation of any state
or federal regulations.
   It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment
of hazards to air navigation, the elimination, removal, alteration or
mitigation of hazards to air navigation, or the marking and lighting of
obstructions are public purposes for which a political subdivision may raise
and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.
   It is hereby ordained by the County of Martin as follows:

(Ord. of 10-8-2014(1))
SECTION III. AIRPORT ZONES
   In order to carry out the provisions of this Ordinance, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and
conical surfaces as they apply to the Martin County Airport. Such zones are
shown on the Martin County Airport Height Ordinance Map consisting of one (1)
sheet, prepared by MICHAEL BAKER ENGINEERING, INC., and dated September, 2011,
which is attached to this Ordinance and made a part hereof. An area located in
more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone
with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby
established and defined as follows:
      1.   Approach Zone (AHD-A).
         a.   Runway 3—The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the
width of the primary surface and is five hundred (500) feet wide. The approach
zone expands outward uniformly to a width of three thousand five hundred
(3,500) feet at a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet from the
primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the
runway.
         b.   Runway 21—The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the
width of the primary surface and is five hundred (500) feet wide. The approach
zone expands outward uniformly to a width of three thousand five hundred
(3,500) feet at a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet from the
primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the
runway.
      2.   Transitional Zone (AHD-T). The transitional zones are the areas
beneath the transitional surfaces.
      3.   Horizontal Zone (AHD-H). The horizontal zone is established by
swinging arcs of ten thousand (10,000) feet radii from the center of each end
of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by
drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the
approach and transitional zones.
      4.   Conical Zone (AHD-C). The conical zone is established as the area
that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward to a
height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation.
      5.   Airport Protection Zone (AHD-P). The airport protection zone is
established at an elevation of four hundred twenty-six (426) feet above mean
sea level.
(Ord. of 10-8-2014(1))
SECTION IV. AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS
   Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, no structure shall be
erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any
zone created by this Ordinance to a height in excess of the applicable height
limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are
hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:
      1.   Approach Zone (AHD-A).
         a.   Runway 3—Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet along the
extended runway centerline.
         b.   Runway 21—Slopes thirty-four (34) feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface
and extending to a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet along the
extended runway centerline.
      2.   Transitional Zone (AHD-T). Slopes seven (7) feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred
fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation which is seventy-six (76) feet
above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established
height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending
to where they intersect the conical surface.
      3.   Horizontal Zone (AHD-H). Established at one hundred fifty (150) feet
above the airport elevation or at a height of two hundred twenty-six (226) feet
above mean sea level.
      4.   Conical Zone (AHD-C). Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone at one hundred (150)
feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred
fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation.
      5.   Airport Protection Zone (AHD-P). Established at an elevation of
three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation to a height of four
hundred twenty-six (426) feet above mean sea level and extending outside the
conical zone throughout the county.
      6.   Excepted Height Limitations. Nothing in the Ordinance shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or
growth of any tree to a height up to one hundred (100) feet above the surface
of the land.
(Ord. of 10-8-2014(1))
SECTION V. USE RESTRICTIONS
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, no use may be made
of land or water within any zone established by this Ordinance in such a manner
as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
(Ord. of 10-8-2014(1))
SECTION VI. NONCONFORMING USES
   1.   Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
Ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations
as of the effective date of this Ordinance, or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any
change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of
this Ordinance, and is diligently prosecuted.
   2.   Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Enforcement Officer to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the County of Martin.
(Ord. of 10-8-2014(1))
SECTION VII. PERMITS
   1.   Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in a, b, and c hereunder,
no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be
erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone
hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and
granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the
permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined
whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations
herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit
shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance
with Section VII, 4.
      a.   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
one hundred (100) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      b.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet
from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than one hundred (100) feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such approach zones.
      c.   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than one hundred (100) feet of vertical height above the
ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour,
or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for
such transition zones.
   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any
structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this Ordinance except as set forth in Section IV, 6.
   2.   Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation that it was on
the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is
when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all
applications for such a permit shall be granted.
   3.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Enforcement
Officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or
more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed,
no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed
the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   4.   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this Ordinance, may apply to the Board of
Appeals for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
grant, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to
air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the
spirit of this Ordinance. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this Ordinance may be considered by the Board of Appeals unless
a copy of the application has been furnished to the Federal Aviation
Administration and the North Carolina Division of Aviation for advice as to the
aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Federal Aviation Administration or
the North Carolina Division of Aviation does not respond to the application
within sixty (60) days after receipt, the Board of Appeals may act on its own
to grant or deny said application.
   5.   Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this Ordinance
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain,
at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the Board of Appeals, this condition may be modified to require the
owner to permit the County of Martin, at its own expense, to install, operate,
and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
(Ord. of 10-8-2014(1))
SECTION VIII. ENFORCEMENT
   It shall be the duty of the Enforcement Officer to administer and enforce
the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall
be made to the Enforcement Officer upon a form published for that purpose.
Applications required by this Ordinance to be submitted to the Enforcement
Officer shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. Application for
action by the Board of Appeals shall be forthwith transmitted by the
Enforcement Officer.

SECTION IX. BOARD OF APPEALS

appointed, one (1) shall be appointed for a term of one (1) year, two (2) for a
term of two (2) years, and two (2) for a term of three (3) years. Members shall
be removable by the appointing authority for cause, upon written charges, after
a public hearing.
   3.   The Board of Appeals shall adopt rules for its governance in harmony
with the provisions of this Ordinance. Meetings of the Board of Appeals shall
be held at the call of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board of
Appeals may determine. The Chairperson or, in the absence of the Chairperson,
the Acting Chairperson may administer oaths and compel the attendance of
witnesses. All hearings of the Board of Appeals shall be public. The Board of
Appeals shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member
upon each question; or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and
shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which
shall immediately be filed in the office of the Enforcement Officer and on due
cause shown.
   4.   The Board of Appeals shall make written findings of facts and
conclusions of law giving the facts upon which it acted and its legal
conclusions from such facts in reversing, affirming, or modifying any order,
requirements, decision, or determination which comes before it under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
   5.   The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Board of
Appeals shall be sufficient to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Enforcement Officer or decide in favor of the applicant on
any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance, or to effect
variation to this Ordinance.
(Ord. of 10-8-2014(1))

provided by the rules of the Board of Appeals, by filing with the Enforcement
Officer a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Enforcement
Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Appeals all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   3.   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Enforcement Officer certifies to the Board of Appeals,
after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts
stated in the certificate a stay would in the opinion of Enforcement Officer
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed except by the order of the Board of Appeals on notice to the
Enforcement Officer and on due cause shown.
   4.   The Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals,

circumstances.

prescribed in this Ordinance and any other regulations applicable to the same

or requirement shall govern and prevail.
(Ord. of 10-8-2014(1))
