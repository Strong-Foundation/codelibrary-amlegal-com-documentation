   The governing body of the Town of Surf City shall consist of five (5)
commissioners. Municipal elections in the Town of Surf City shall be held on
the second Saturday in May, 1964, and biennially thereafter. The three (3)
candidates receiving the greatest number of votes in the first election shall

   Pursuant to G.S. 160A-101 and G.S. 160A-102, the Charter of the Town of Surf
City as set forth in chapter 829 of the 1963 Session Laws of North Carolina, as
amended, is hereby further amended to provide that the mayor shall be elected

(Ord. No. 1990-2, § 1, 2-6-90; Ord. No. 2003-04, 5-6-03)
Editor's note—Session Laws 1971, chapter 835 enacted subchapter IX of chapter
163 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, which now governs municipal
election procedures. Section 3 of that act provides as follows:
      "It is the intent of this act to make uniform the laws governing the
registration of voters for and the conduct of elections in cities, towns,
incorporated villages, and special districts in this state. To this end, all
laws and clauses of laws, whether general, private, special or local are
repealed to the extent that they are in conflict with or superseded by this
act, except that provisions of town or city charters providing for elections
during the calendar year 1972 shall continue in effect until such 1972
elections have been conducted and their results declared."
   Section 163-279 of the General Statutes of North Carolina now governs the
time of municipal elections and supersedes the second sentence of the first
paragraph of this section.
   By adoption of the council-manager form of government (see section
1.1 of this Charter) the term "commissioner" is no longer used. The governing
body is now referred to as "the council" and the members as "councilmembers."
This change will be reflected throughout the Code of Ordinances.
Sec. 1.1. Council-manager form of government.
   Pursuant to G.S. 160A-101 and 160A-102, the Charter of the Town of Surf
City, North Carolina, as set forth in chapter 829 of the 1963 Session Laws of
North Carolina, as amended, is hereby further amended to provide that the Town
of Surf City, North Carolina, shall operate under the council-manager form of
government in accordance with Part 2 of Article 7 of G.S. Chapter 160A and any
Charter provisions not in conflict therewith.
(Ord. No. 1980-6, § 1, 10-7-80)
State law reference— Form of government, G.S. 160A-59 et seq.
Sec. 2. Corporate powers.
   The Town of Surf City shall have all the rights, privileges, powers,
immunities and liabilities which are conferred upon and are incident to
incorporated cities and towns by virtue of the laws of the State of North
Carolina, and all such as are created, limited, modified, or extended by this
act; but whenever this act shall be in conflict with, or repugnant to, the
general laws of the state applicable to cities and towns, then this act shall
govern and control insofar as the rights, privileges, powers, immunities and
liabilities of the Town of Surf City are concerned.
Sec. 3. Corporate boundaries.
   The corporate limits of said town shall be as follows:
   Beginning at a stake in the Atlantic Ocean, said stake being located 309

of the J. T. Bland Division reaches the water's edge at the Atlantic Ocean;
running thence eastwardly the Bland line continued 1,000 feet in the Atlantic
Ocean; thence parallel with the shoreline northeastwardly 29,140 feet, more or

County line northwestwardly to a stake in the eastern edge of the Intracoastal
Waterway; thence along and with the eastern edge of the Intracoastal Waterway
southwardly to a stake located 500 feet northwardly from the centerline of
North Carolina Highways 50 and 210 where they cross the eastern edge of the
right-of-way of the Intracoastal Waterway; running thence north 32 degrees west
across the Intracoastal Waterway 2,000 feet; thence south 60 degrees and 30
minutes west across North Carolina Highways 50 and 210, 1,000 feet to a stake;
thence south 32 degrees east 2,000 feet, more or less, across the Intracoastal

southwardly direction with Topsail Inlet Channel to a point where the Ward-
Humphrey line reaches the waters of the channel; thence along and with the
Ward-Humphrey line south 27 degrees 15 minutes east to a stake in the Atlantic

Editor's note—Ordinances annexing territory have not been set out or listed
herein but are on file and available for inspection in the offices of the town.
Sec. 4. Duties of mayor.
   The mayor shall be the chief executive officer of the town, and subject to
the supervision of the board of commissioners, shall perform all duties
pertaining to such office. He shall do and perform all duties provided or
prescribed by law or by the ordinances of the town, not expressly delegated to
any other person. He shall have general supervision and oversight over the
departments, and offices of the town government and shall be the chief
representative of the town and shall report to the board any failure on the
part of any of the officers of his or any other department to perform their
duties, and shall preside at all meetings of the board of commissioners, except
that the mayor pro tem shall preside in his absence. He shall sign all
contracts on behalf of the town, unless otherwise provided by law or ordinance
or resolution of the board of commissioners; he shall have charge of, and cause
to be prepared and published, all statements and reports required by law or
ordinance or by resolution of the board of commissioners.
Sec. 5. Purchases.
   It shall be the duty of each commissioner to recommend to the town
purchasing agent the purchase of goods and contracts for all things necessary
to be contracted for in his department, and these recommendations shall be
submitted to the board of commissioners for its order with respect thereto.
Sec. 6. Duties of board of commissioners generally.
   The board of commissioners has and shall exercise all legislative powers,
functions and duties conferred upon the town or its officers. It shall make all
orders for the doing of work or the making or construction of any improvements,
bridges or buildings. It shall levy all taxes, apportion and appropriate all
funds, audit and allow all bills and accounts, payrolls and claims, and order
payment thereof. It shall make all assessments for the cost of street
improvements, sidewalks, sewers, and other work, improvements, or repairs which
may be specially assessed. It shall make or authorize the making of all
contracts and no contract shall bind or be obligatory upon the town unless
either made by ordinance or resolution adopted by the board of commissioners
and reduced to writing and approved by said board, or expressly authorized by
ordinance or resolution adopted by the board. All heads of departments, agents
and employees are the agents of the board of commissioners only, and all their
acts shall be subject to review and to approval or revocation by the board of
commissioners. The head of departments, superintendent, agent, employee, or
officer shall from time to time, as required by law or ordinance, or when
requested by the board of commissioners, or sooner if said agent shall deem it
necessary for the good of the public service, report to the board of
commissioners in writing respecting the business of his department, officers,
or employment, all matters connected therewith. The board of commissioners may,
by ordinance or resolution, assign to a head of a department, or officer,
additional employment and such service shall be rendered without additional
compensation. The board of commissioners shall elect and have authority over
the town clerk who shall be the clerk of the board of commissioners.
   Sec. 7. Execution of duties by commissioners.
Each member of the board of commissioners shall devote such of his time and
attention to the performance of the public duties herein mentioned as is
necessary to fully carry out the same.
Secs. 8 to 11. Deleted.
Editor's note—The deleted sections all dealt with municipal elections and have
been deleted pursuant to section 3 of Session Laws 1971, chapter 835, which
enacted subchapter IX of chapter 163 of the General Statutes of North Carolina,
which now governs municipal elections. For a fuller explanation of the effect
of such act on municipal Charter provisions, see the editor's note following
section 1 of this Charter. Deleted section 8 concerned residence requirements
for candidates for office; section 9 concerned procedures for filing for
office; section 10 concerned a tie vote runoff election; and section 11
concerned eligibility of voters. All of the deleted sections were from Session
Laws 1963, ch. 829, the original act enacting a Charter for the Town of Surf
City.
Sec. 12. Deleted.
Editor's note—The deleted section concerned the compensation of the mayor and
commissioners. This is now set by the board of commissioners pursuant to G.S.
160A-64, which repeals all Charter provisions in effect as of January 1, 1972,
fixing the compensation or allowances of municipal officers or employees.
Sec. 13. Present officers to serve until succeeded.
   The present mayor and commissioners of the Town of Surf City shall hold
office until 12:00 midnight on the thirtieth day of June 1964, and until their
successors have qualified.
Sec. 14. Filling vacancies.
   Should a vacancy occur by resignation or otherwise, the remaining
commissioners may appoint a successor who, upon being sworn in by the clerk of
said town or some other person duly authorized, may take office and discharge
the duties of said office until the term has expired as herein provided.
Secs. 15 and 16. Deleted.
Editor's note—The deleted sections dealt with the applicability of article 3 of
old chapter 160 of the General Statutes of North Carolina to elections in the
town (section 15) and with violations of election laws (section 16). Both
sections have been superseded by subchapter IX of chapter 163 of the General
Statutes of North Carolina. For an explanation of the effect of such subchapter
IX on municipal charter provisions, see the editor's note following section 1
of this Charter.
Sec. 17. Acts relative to taxation ratified and validated.
   All acts of the commissioners of the Town of Surf City since its
incorporation in 1949 in levying and collecting taxes are hereby ratified and
validated.

   This act shall apply only to the Town of Surf City in Pender County.
Sec. 19. Repeal of conflicting laws.
   All laws and clauses of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.
Sec. 20. Effective date.
   This act shall be in full force and effect from and after its ratification.

Code adopted pursuant to such statutes, such remedies available to the town for

hereinafter stated in this section as being applicable to specific chapters or
provisions of this Code.

this Code shall be a misdemeanor and punishable as provided by section 14-4 of

12-5—

   (c)   Violations of the following provisions of this Code shall subject the
offender to a civil penalty upon the issuance of a citation for such violation
as hereinafter provided. The civil penalty, if not paid to the town within
fifteen (15) days of the issuance of a citation, may be recovered by the town
in a civil action in the nature of debt. Unless otherwise provided by a
specific provision of this Code, such civil penalties shall be in the amount of

ordinances of this Code, the civil penalty provisions and procedures therein
shall apply. The provisions of this Code which shall subject the offender to a
civil penalty are as follows: All provisions of this Code of Ordinances except
those enumerated in subsection (b) of this section or any violation of this
Code which is declared to be a misdemeanor by the State of North Carolina.
   (d)   In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this
section, any provision of this Code or any other town ordinance may be enforced
by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent
jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have
jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a
defense to the application of the town for equitable relief that there is an
adequate remedy at law.
   (e)   In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this
section, any provision of this Code or any other town ordinance that makes
unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced
by injunction and order of abatement, and the general court of justice shall
have jurisdiction to issue such orders. When a violation of such a provision
occurs, the town may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of
justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement
commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the
unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by
the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil
Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular.
   (f)   In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of
abatement as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of abatement may
direct that:
      (1)   Buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished
or removed;
      (2)   Fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from
buildings on the property;
      (3)   Grass and weeds be cut;
      (4)   Improvements or repairs be made; or
      (5)   Any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property
into compliance with this Code or such ordinance.
   If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an
order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for
contempt, and the town may execute the order of abatement. The town shall have
a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the
nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure
cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings
and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with
sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the
judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the
defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a
time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not
suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith.
   (g)   The provisions of this Code and any other town ordinances may be
enforced by one (1), all or a combination of the remedies authorized and
prescribed by this section; except, that any provision the violation of which
incurs a civil penalty shall not be enforced by criminal penalties.
   (h)   Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing
violation of any provision of this Code or any other town ordinance shall be a
separate and distinct offense.
   (i)   Any ordinances hereafter adopted by the council of the town, the
violation of which shall incur a penalty, shall specify whether the enforcement
shall be pursuant to the civil penalty or criminal penal provisions of this
section.
   (j)   Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Code, the
penalty for which is a civil penalty, the town shall cause a warning citation
to be issued to the violator, setting out the nature of the violation, the
section violated, the date of the violation and an order to immediately cease
the violation or, if the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which
an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, stating a
reasonable period of time in which the violation must be abated. The warning
citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty.
   (k)   Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation, a civil
citation shall be issued by the appropriate official of the town and either
served directly on the violator or his duly designated agent, or registered
agent if a corporation, in person or posted in the United States mail service
by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as
contained in the records of the town, or obtained from the violator at the time
of issuance of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been
served upon the mailing of such citation. The citation shall direct the
violator to appear before the town treasurer, located in the town hall, within
fifteen (15) days of the date of the citation or alternatively to pay the
citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been
corrected by the time the citation is paid; otherwise, further citations shall
be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the
prohibited activity is ceased or abated.
   (l)   If the violator fails to respond to a citation within fifteen (15)
days of its issuance and pay the penalty prescribed therein, the town may
institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of
the North Carolina General Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty.

repeal any chapter, section or subsection or any portion thereof, such repealed
portions may be excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages. The

repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such

unified Code. For example, the codifier may:

and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes
in such catchlines, headings and titles.

"this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or
to "section ____________ to ____________" (inserting section numbers to
indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the
ordinance incorporated into the Code).
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case
shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

to coastal areas and are a tourist attraction as well as a protective barrier
against the dangers of wind, flood, and erosion. The sand dunes make a vital
contribution to the nature and character of the town as a resort coastal
community, and the town believes the sand dunes should be preserved and
development on the sand dunes within the town controlled in a manner compatible
with the preservation of the sand dunes.
      (2)   This section is adopted to promote the protection of the town by
maintaining the existence of natural and constructed dunes which help protect
it from the danger of flooding and erosion and to preserve the land against the
actions of sand, wind, and water. The practice of destroying sand dunes and
removing vegetation within the town constitutes a serious threat to the safety
of adjacent properties. This section is, therefore, adopted for the health,
safety, and welfare of persons living, visiting, or sojourning to and in the
town, and for protection of public and private property.
   (b)   Conflicts with state rules. If any provision of this section is in
conflict with a rule adopted by the State Coastal Resource Commission dealing
with ocean front erosion control, then the rule or regulations shall control
and apply in lieu of the provision of this section in conflict therewith.
   (c)   Territorial applicability. This section shall apply to sand dunes
within the corporate limits and boundaries of the town.

value in such amounts as may be carried upon the person.
      (2)   Any activity authorized or allowed by G.S. 113A-103(5)(b)5 for
emergency maintenance and repair.
      (3)   Any activity conducted by a federal or state agency for beach
renourishment and protection.
   (e)   Enforcement. This section shall be enforced by the Surf City Code
Enforcement Officer and Surf City Police Department.
   (f)   Damaging sand dunes.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person other than the owner, invitees
or renters of that property thereof to walk over or cross over any dune at any
place except at an authorized marked cross over of designated beach access.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful for any person except the owner to damage,
destroy, or remove any sand dune or part thereof, or to kill, destroy, or
remove any trees, shrubbery, or other vegetation growing on sand dunes except
in the following locations:
         a.   The area within the foundation perimeter of any existing
structure or any structure to be constructed, as shown on a survey or site plan
on file or previously submitted to the Building Inspector as part of the
building permit application process or to the Planning Board as part of the
site plan review process.
         b.   An area around the perimeter of an existing building or proposed
principal building not to exceed a width of twelve (12) feet from the building

reviewing town officials.
         d.   On commercial, multifamily, group development, or planned unit

Council, if required), those areas delineated and designated on the site plan
for land disturbing activity is also undertaken pursuant to Coastal Area
Management Act.
         e.   In hard surfaced, designated recreation areas.

following:
         a.   Landscaping activities and garden plots, provided the original
dune contour is not altered.
         b.   Water, sewage, or wastewater disposal systems.
   (g)   Penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any division
of this section shall be liable to the town for a civil penalty of not less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and damages caused to the dune. Any person,

authority granted under this section shall obtain, at its own expense, all
permits and licenses required by applicable law, ordinance, rule, regulation or
code, and must maintain the same, in full force and effect, for as long as
required by the town or other governmental entity or agency having jurisdiction
over the applicant.
   (28)   Unless such is proven to be technologically impracticable, the town
requires the co-location of new antenna arrays on existing structures, as
opposed to the construction of a new complex or support structure or increasing
the height, footprint or profile of a facility or complex beyond the conditions
of the approved special use permit for an existing facility or complex. In
instances not qualifying for the Streamlined process the applicant shall submit
a comprehensive report inventorying ail existing structures more than fifty
feet (50') in height within one-half (½) mile of the location of any proposed
new facility or complex.

technologically needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the
town, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown in the form of
clear and convincing evidence.
   (31)   DAS systems that are owned or operated by a commercial carrier and
are part of a commercial wireless system, or are used for commercial purposes,
are expressly included in the context of this Section, regardless of the
location or whether the Facility or any of its components is located inside or
outside a structure or building.
   (32)   The existence of a lease or an option to lease shall not be deemed
justification for not complying with the siting priorities set forth in this
section. An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority solely because
the site proposed is under lease or an option to lease exists. If a site other
than the number 1 priority is proposed, the applicant must explain to the
reasonable satisfaction of the town why co-location is technically or
commercially impracticable. Build-to-suit agreements between carriers and a
proposed tower owner shall not be a valid basis for any claim of exemption,
exception or waiver from compliance with this section.
   (33)   Any technical information must be provided in such a manner, form and
with such content that it is able to be verified by a third party using the
information used and provided by the applicant.

days in advance of the first test date in a newspaper with a general
circulation in the town and as agreed to by the town. The applicant shall
inform the town in writing, of the dates and times of the test, at least
fourteen (14) days in advance. The balloon shall be flown for at least four (4)
consecutive hours between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on the dates chosen. The
primary date shall be on a week-end, but the second date, in case of poor
visibility on the initial date, may be on a week day. A report with pictures
from various locations of the balloon shall be provided with the application.
      d.   The applicant shall notify all property owners and residents located
within one-thousand five hundred feet (1,500) of the nearest property line of
the subject property of the proposed construction of the tower and facility or
complex and of the date(s) and time(s) of the balloon test. Such notice shall
be provided at least fourteen (14) days prior to the conduct of the balloon
test and shall be delivered by first-class mail.
      e.   The wireless telecommunications facility or complex shall be
structurally designed to accommodate at least four (4) antenna arrays, with
each array to be flush mounted or as close to flush-mounted as is reasonable
possible.

structural analysis and report, including all calculations, showing that the
facility or complex will be constructed to meet all local, state and federal
structural requirements for loads, including wind and ice loads and including,
but not limited to all applicable ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
TIA 222 guidelines. In the event of a conflict the more stringent shall apply.
   (9)   The applicant shall furnish a visual impact assessment, which shall
include:
      a.   A computer generated “zone of visibility map” at a minimum of one
mile radius from the proposed structure shall be provided to illustrate
locations from which the proposed installation may be seen, with and without
foliage;

historic sites normally open to the public, and from any other location where
the site is visible to a large number of visitors, travelers or residents.
Guidance will be provided concerning the appropriate key viewpoints at the
preapplication meeting. In addition to photographic simulations to scale
showing the visual impact, the applicant shall provide a map showing the
locations of where the pictures were taken and the distance(s)of each location
from the proposed structure;
   (10)   The applicant shall provide a description in writing and a visual
rendering demonstrating how it shall effectively screen from view the bottom
fifteen feet (15') of the facility or complex and all related equipment and
structures associated with the facility or complex.
   (11)   A building permit shall not be issued for construction of a new tower
or other support structure until there is an application for or by a specific
carrier that documents that the facility or complex is necessary for that
carrier to serve the community and that co-location on an existing structure is
not feasible.
   (12)   Co-location on an existing structure is not reasonably feasible if
co-location is technically or commercially impractical or the owner of the
structure is unwilling to enter into a contract for such use at fair market
value. Sufficient documentation in the form of clear and convincing evidence to
support such claims shall be submitted with an Application for the first
carrier in order to determine whether co-location on existing structures is
reasonably feasible and to document the need for a specific stated height, and
that less height will serve to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of service.
   (k)   Expedited application process for substantial modifications and
substantial co-locations. An applicant for a substantial modification or
substantial co-location, but expressly not for a new tower or other new support
structure, may request a special expedited application process in which the
application shall be acted upon within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of a
complete application. To be granted such status and treatment, the applicant
shall pay to the town a special expedited treatment fee of $7,500 for and prior
to the grant of such status and treatment in addition to all other required
fees.

possible given the facts and circumstances involved, and thereby have the least
adverse visual effect, all antennas attached to a Tower or other structure
shall be flush mounted or as near to flush mounted as is possible so as to
create the smallest profile reasonably possible under the facts and
circumstances, unless it can be proven that such would prohibit or serve to
prohibit the provision of service or be technologically impracticable.
   (m)   Location of wireless telecommunications facilities.
   (1)    No tower or other new support structure more than 101 taller than
existing surrounding structures shall be permitted in any existing or planned
(i.e. platted) residential neighborhood, nor within one-half mile of such.
Applicants shall locate, site and erect all facilities and associated equipment
in accordance with the following priorities, in the following order:
      a.   On existing structures without increasing the height of the tower or
structure.
      b.   On town-owned properties or facilities.
      c.   On existing structures without increasing the height of the
structure by more than is technically needed.
      d.   On properties in areas zoned for business use.
      e.   On properties in areas zoned for rural use.
      f.   On properties in designated historic districts without increasing
the height of the support structure and only if camouflaged or stealthed to the
satisfaction of the Planning Director.
      g.   On properties in areas zoned for Residential use without increasing
the height of the support structure and only if camouflaged or stealthed to the
satisfaction of the Planning Director.
   (2)   If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed
above, then a detailed narrative and technical explanation shall be provided as
regards why a site from all higher priority designations was not selected. The
person seeking such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or
reasons why a special use permit or administrative authorization should be
granted for the proposed site.
   (3)   Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, the town may approve
any site located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that
the town finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health,
safety and welfare of the town and its inhabitants and will not have a
deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and
neighborhood. Conversely, the town may direct that the proposed location be
changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this
section and the public interest as determined by the town and that serves the
intent of the applicant.
   (4)   Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of
highest priority or highest available priority, the town may disapprove an
application for any of the following reasons:
      a.   Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements,
including but not limited to setback and fall zone requirements;
      b.   Non-compliance with zoning or land use regulations;
      c.   The placement and location of facilities which would create an
unacceptable safety risk to residents or the general public, employees and
agents of the town or employees of the service provider or other service
providers, physical or financial damage to or trespass on private property, or
the reasonable possibility of such;
      d.   The placement and location of a facility or complex would result in
a conflict with, compromise in or change in the nature or character of the
adjacent surrounding area, and expressly including but not limited to loss in
value as measured from the end of calendar year prior to the application having
been filed;
      e.   Conflicts with the provisions of this section;
      f.   Failure to submit a complete application as required under this
section within sixty (60) days after proper notice and opportunity to make the
application complete is sent to the applicant.
   (5)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, for good
cause shown such as the ability to utilize a snorter, smaller or less intrusive
facility or complex elsewhere and still accomplish the primary service
objective, if the relocation could result in a less intrusive facility or
complex, singly or in combination with other locations, the town may require
the relocation of a proposed site, including allowing for the fact that
relocating the site chosen by the applicant may require the use of more than
one (1) site to provide substantially the same service.
   (n)   Type and height of towers.
   (1)   All new towers shall be of the monopole type. No new towers of a
lattice or guyed type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly
granted.
   (2)   The maximum permitted total height of a new tower or other proposed
support structure shall be one hundred feet (100') above pre-construction
ground level, unless it can be shown by clear and convincing technical evidence
from a carrier that such height would prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area within the
town.
   (3)   The policy decision has been made that more facilities of a shorter
height is in the public interest, as opposed to fewer but taller facilities.
Spacing or the distance between facilities shall be such that the service may
be provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height.
   (4)   If proposed to be taller than the maximum permitted height, the
applicant for a new tower or support structure shall submit clear and
convincing technical evidence by a carrier or wireless service provider
justifying the total height of the proposed tower or other support structure
requested and the basis therefore, as well as a copy of a lease or a commitment
to use the facility. If the applicant chooses to provide evidence in the form
of propagation studies, such must include all modeling information and support
data used to produce the studies at the requested height and a minimum often
feet (10') lower to enable verification of the Need for the requested height.
   (5)   The town reserves the right to require a drive test to be conducted
under the supervision of the town or its delegate as evidence of the technical
Need for what is requested.
   (6)   At no time shall a Tower or other support structure be of a height
that requires lighting by the FAA.
   (7)   Towers shall be structurally designed to support a minimum of four (4)
carriers using functionally equivalent equipment to that used by the first
carrier attaching to a Tower or other support structure and that can be
increased in height if needed.
   (o)   Visibility and aesthetics.
   (1)   No tower or support structure that is not a building and is
constructed after the effective date of this section shall be tall enough to
require lighting by the FAA.
   (2)   Stealth: all new facilities, including but not limited to towers,
shall utilize stealth or camouflage siting techniques that are acceptable to
the Town, unless such can be shown to be either commercially or technologically
impracticable.
   (3)   Finish/color: towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-
preventive paint of an appropriate color to harmonize with the surroundings and
shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this section.
   (4)   Lighting: notwithstanding the prohibition of lighting, in the event
lighting is subsequently required by the FAA, the Applicant shall provide a
detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as unobtrusive and inoffensive an
effect as is permissible under state and federal regulations. For any facility
or complex for which lighting is required under the FAA’s regulations, or that
for any reason has lights attached, all such lighting shall be affixed with
technology that enables the light to be seen as intended from the air, but that
prevents the ground scatter effect so that it is not able to be seen from the
ground to a height of at least 20 degrees vertical for a distance of at least 1
mile in a level terrain situation. Such device shall be compliant with or not
expressly in conflict with FAA regulations. A physical shield may be used, as
long as the light is able to be seen from the air, as intended by the FAA.
   (5)   Retrofitting: in the event a tower or other support structure that is
lighted as of the effective date of this section is modified, at the time of
the modification, the town may require that the tower be retrofitted so as to
comply with the lighting requirements of this section or be reduced to a height
that does not require lighting.
   (6)   Flush mounting: except for omni-directional whip antennas, all new or
replacement antennas, shall be flush-mounted or as close to flush-mounted on
the support structure as possible, unless it can be demonstrated by clear and
convincing technical evidence that such has the effect of prohibiting the
provision of service to the intended service area, alone or in combination with
another site(s), or unless the applicant can prove that it is technologically
impracticable.
   (7)   Placement on building: if attached to a building, all antennas shall
be mounted on the facie of the building and camouflaged so as to match the
color and, if possible, the texture of the building, or in a manner so as to
make the antennas as visually innocuous and undetectable as is possible given
the facts and circumstances involved.
   (p)   Security. All facilities shall be located, fenced or otherwise secured
in a manner that prevents unauthorized access. Specifically:
   (1)   All facilities, including antennas, towers and other supporting
structures, such as guy anchor points and guy wires, shall be made inaccessible
to unauthorized individuals and shall be constructed or shielded in such a
manner that they cannot be climbed or collided with; and
   (2)   Transmitters and telecommunications control points shall be installed
so that they are readily accessible only to persons authorized to operate or
service them.
   (q)   Signage. Facilities shall contain a sign no larger than four (4)
square feet and no smaller than two (2) square feet in order to provide
adequate warning to persons in the immediate area of the presence of RF
radiation. A sign of the same size is also to be installed bearing the name(s)
of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the antenna(s) as well as emergency phone
number(s). The sign shall be on the equipment shelter or cabinet of the
applicant and must be visible from the access point of the facility or complex
and must identify the equipment owner of the shelter or cabinet. On tower
sites, an FCC registration sign, as applicable, is also to be present. The
signs shall not be lighted, unless applicable law, rule or regulation requires
lighting. No other signage, including advertising, shall be permitted.
   (r)   Setback and fall zone.
   (1)   All proposed towers and any other proposed wireless support structures
shall be set back from abutting parcels, recorded rights-of-way and roads and
streets by the greater of the following distances: I) a distance equal to the
height of the proposed tower or support structure plus ten percent (10%) of the
height of the tower or other structure, otherwise known as the fall zone; or
ii) the existing setback requirement of the underlying zoning district,
whichever is greater. Any accessory structure shall be located within the
fenced compound area as approved in the special use permit and so as to comply
with the applicable minimum setback requirements for the property on which it
is situated. The fall zone or setback shall be measured from the nearest
portion of the tower to the nearest portion of the right-of-way of any public
road or thoroughfare and any occupied building or domicile, as well as any
property boundary lines. Further, the nearest portion of any private access
road leading to a facility shall be no less than ten (10) feet from the nearest
property line.
   (2)   There shall be no development of habitable buildings within the
setback area or fall zone.
   (s)   Retention of expert assistance cost to be borne by applicant.
   (1)   To prevent the taxpayers from having to bear the cost related to the
issue of permitting and regulating wireless telecommunications facilities, an
applicant shall pay to the town fees as set forth in the town’s fee schedule.
The fees are intended to cover all reasonable costs of the town’s expert
assistance in connection with the review of any application and the permitting,
inspection, construction or modification requested under this section,
application pre-approval evaluation requested by the applicant and, when
applicable, any lease negotiations. The payment of the expert assistance fees
to the town shall precede any work being done that is related to the intended
application, including a pre-application meeting or site visit.
   (2)   The town may hire any consultant of its choice to assist the town in
reviewing and evaluating applications, provided the consultant has at least
five (5) years experience working exclusively for the public sector regulating
towers and wireless facilities.
   (3)   The total amount of the funds needed for expert assistance as set
forth in the town’s fee schedule may vary with the scope and complexity of the
application, the completeness of the application and other information as may
be needed to complete the necessary review, analysis and inspection of any
construction or modification or the amount of time spent responding to an
applicant’s arguments as regards its application or the requirements of this
section.
   (4)   The town will maintain accounting for the expenditure of all such
funds.
   (5)   Pursuant to state law, if an application is amended, or a waiver or
relief is requested from any local regulations, at any time prior to the grant
of the certificate of completion required under this section, the town reserves
the right to require additional payment for review and analysis equal to, but
not exceeding, the cost created for the town by the applicant or its
application. Such amount shall be paid to the town prior to the issuance of the
special use permit or administrative authorization or the certificate of
completion, whichever is procedurally needed next.
   (t)   Procedural requirements for a granting a special use permit.
   (1)   The following procedures shall apply where a special use permit, is
requested.

applicable law, rule or regulation. The town shall not set a date for a hearing
if the application is not complete or if there are unresolved issues of non-
compliance. The town may, at any stage prior to issuing a special use permit or
administrative authority, require such additional information as it deems
necessary and that is not expressly prohibited from being required by
applicable law as relates to the issue of the siting, construction or
modification of or at a wireless telecommunications facility or complex.
   (3)   Upon Board review and approval, a special use permit shall be issued
for a new or substantially modified wireless support structure or substantial
co-location. Notwithstanding the preceding, the building permit for a new tower
or other proposed support structure shall not be issued until an applicant has
provided clear and convincing substantiating documentation under division (j)
of this section governing the placement of the first antenna array prior to
construction of a new wireless telecommunications facility.

by, the required special use permit, or administrative authorization, and the
special permit or administrative authorization may be revoked.
      d.   If the town makes such a determination as noted in subsections (2)
or (3) of this section, then the town shall notify the holder of the permit or
administrative authorization for the facility or complex that said facility or
complex is to be removed.
      e.   The holder of the special use permit or administrative
authorization, or its successors or assigns, shall dismantle and remove such
facility or complex and all associated structures and equipment from the site
and restore the site to as close to its original condition as is possible, such
restoration being limited only by physical or commercial impracticability.
Restoration shall be completed within ninety (90) days of receipt of written
notice from the town. However, if the owner of the property upon which the
facility or complex is located wishes to retain any access roadway to the
facility or complex, the owner may do so with the approval of the town.
      f.   If a facility or complex has not been removed, or substantial
progress has not been made to remove the facility or complex, within ninety
(90) days after the permit holder has received notice, then the town may order
officials or representatives of the town to remove the facility or complex at
the sole expense of the owner or special use permit holder.
      g.   If the town removes, or causes facilities to be removed, and the
owner of the facility or complex does not claim and remove it from the site to
a lawful location within ten (10) days, then the town may take steps to declare
the facility or complex abandoned, and sell them and their components.
      h.   Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the town
may approve a temporary use permit/agreement for the facility or complex for no
more than ninety (90) days duration, during which time a suitable plan for
removal, conversion, or re-location of the affected facility or complex shall
be developed by the holder of the special use permit, subject to the approval
of the town, and an agreement to such plan shall be executed by the holder of
the special use permit or administrative authorization and the town. If such a
plan is not developed, approved and executed within the ninety (90) day time
period, then the town may take possession of and dispose of the affected
facility.
   (ee)   RF emissions.
   (1)   To assure the protection of the public health and safety the town
expressly reserves the right to require that an applicant, a user of a facility
or complex or the owner of the facility or complex verify compliance with the
FCC’s regulations regarding RF emissions as may be deemed appropriate from time
to time, and that all users of the facility or complex cooperate with the party
responsible for such verification. Failure to cooperate shall be deemed a
violation of this section and subject the non-cooperating party to all fines,
penalties and other remedies at law or tort.
   (2)   With respect to support structures other than towers, if any section
or portion of the structure to be attached to or area within 100 feet of such,
is not in compliance with the FCC’s regulations regarding RF radiation, that

requirement of this section shall address and identify such at the pre-
application meeting. The relief or exemption must be contained in the submitted
application for either a special use permit or administrative authorization, or
in the case of an existing or previously granted special use permit or
administrative authorization, a request for modification of the facility or
complex and/or equipment. Such relief may be temporary or permanent, partial or
complete.
   (2)   The burden of proving the need for the requested relief, waiver or
exemption shall be solely on the applicant to prove.
   (3)   The applicant shall bear all costs of the town in considering the
request and the relief, waiver or exemption.
   (4)   No relief or exemption shall be approved unless the applicant
demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that, if granted, the relief,
waiver or exemption will have no significant affect on the health, safety and
welfare of the town, its residents and other service providers.
   (gg)   Adherence to state and/or federal rules and regulations.
   (1)   To the extent that the holder of a special use permit or
administrative authorization for a wireless telecommunications facility or
complex has not received relief or is otherwise exempt, from appropriate state

Sec. 8-1. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives.
   (a)   Statutory authorization. Municipal: The Legislature of the State of
North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Article 6 of Chapter
153A; Article 8 of Chapter 160A; and Article 7, 9, and 11 of Chapter 160D of
the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the
authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare. Therefore, the Town Council of the Town of Surf City,
North Carolina, does ordain as follows.
   (b)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities
and by the occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other
hazards.
   (c)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that
may increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (d)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life, safety, and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges) that are located in floodprone areas;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood-prone areas;
      (7)   To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a
special flood hazard area;
      (8)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
      (9)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the
national flood insurance program; and
      (10)   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains.

interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   Area of shallow flooding means a designated zone AO on a community's flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths determined to be from one (1)

(OPA).
   Coastal high hazard area means a special flood hazard area extending from
offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and
any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic
sources. The area is designated on a FIRM, or other adopted flood map as
determined in section 8-3(b) of this chapter, as zone VE.
   Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.

manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities
for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community, dated September 29, 1987.
   Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
   (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   Flood insurance means the insurance coverage provided under the national
flood insurance program.
   Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, on which both the special flood
hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community are

appropriate), flood hazard risk zones, and other flood data in a community
issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The flood insurance study
report includes flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs).
   Flood-prone area. See "floodplain."
   Flood-resistant material means any building product [material, component or
system] capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum seventy-
two (72) hours) with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more
than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not
resistant to alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-
grade use, is not flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-
resistant lumbers are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring
coverings that restrict evaporation from below and materials that are
impervious, but dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that
absorb or retain water excessively after submergence are not flood-resistant.
Please refer to Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials
Requirements, and available from the FEMA. Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced
therein, are acceptable flood-resistant materials.
   Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from
any source.
   Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed by the community in
this chapter to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

conformance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
   Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but
not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
   Floodplain management regulations means this chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation
facilities, structures, and their contents.
   Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.
   Flood zone means a geographical area shown on a flood hazard boundary map or
flood insurance rate map that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the
area.
   Freeboard means the height added to the base flood elevation (BFE) to
account for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater that the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, blockage of bridge openings, and the
hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. The base flood elevation
plus the freeboard establishes the "regulatory flood protection elevation."
   Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for
its intended purpose unless it is located in close proximity to water, limited
to a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo
or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-
term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   Hazardous waste facility means, as defined in G.S. ch. 130, art. 9, a
facility for the collection, storage, processing, treatment, recycling,
recovery, or disposal of hazardous waste.
   Highest adjacent grade (HAG) means the highest natural elevation of the
ground surface, prior to construction, immediately next to the proposed walls
of the structure.
   Historic structure means any structure that is:

district designated by a community with a "certified local government (CLG)
program."
   Certified local government (CLG) programs are approved by the U.S.
Department of the Interior in cooperation with the state department of cultural
resources through the state historic preservation officer as having met the
requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended in
1980.
   Letter of map change (LOMC) means an official determination issued by FEMA
that amends or revises an effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance
study. Letters of map change include:
   (1)   Letter of map amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to
an effective national flood insurance program map. A LOMA is based on technical
data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being in the
floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
   (2)   Letter of map revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that
may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, special flood hazard area
boundaries and floodway delineations, and other planimetric features.
   (3)   Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F): A determination that a
structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is,
therefore, no longer located within the special flood hazard area. In order to
qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in
accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations.
   (4)   Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP
requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood
hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map or
flood insurance study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built
documentation, a letter of map revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the
effective FIRM.
   Light duty truck means any motor vehicle rated at eight thousand five
hundred (8,500) pounds gross vehicular weight rating or less which has a
vehicular curb weight of six thousand (6,000) pounds or less and which has a
basic vehicle frontal area of forty-five (45) square feet or less as defined in
40 CFR 86.082-2 and is:
   (1)   Designed primarily for purposes of transportation of property or is a
derivation of such a vehicle;
   (2)   Designed primarily for transportation of persons and has a capacity of
more than twelve (12) persons; or
   (3)   Available with special features enabling off-street or off-highway
operation and use.
   Limit of moderate wave action (LiMWA) means the boundary line given by FEMA

   Lowest Adjacent Grade (LAG) means the lowest elevation of the ground,
sidewalk or patio slab immediately next to the building, or deck support, after
completion of the building. Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest
enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure,
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in
an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor,
provided that such an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in
violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   Map repository means the location of the official flood hazard data to be
applied for floodplain management. It is a central location in which flood data
is stored and managed; in North Carolina, FEMA has recognized that the
application of digital flood hazard data products carry the same authority as
hard copy products. Therefore, the NCEM's floodplain mapping program websites
house current and historical flood hazard data. For effective flood hazard
data, the NC FRIS website (http://FRIS.NC.GOV/FRIS) is the map repository, and
for historical flood hazard data the Flood NC website (http://FLOOD.NC.GOV/
NCFLOOD) is the map repository. Lowest adjacent grade (LAG) means the lowest
elevation of the ground, sidewalk or patio slab immediately next to the
building, or deck support, after completion of the building.
   Market value means the building value, not including the land value and that
of any accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may
be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value), or
adjusted tax assessed values.

commenced on or after the effective date of the initial floodplain management
regulations for that site and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   Non-encroachment area means the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
(1) foot as designated in the flood insurance study report.
   OPA means an otherwise protected area.
   Post-FIRM means construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after May 2, 1977, the effective date of the
initial flood insurance rate map for the site.
   Pre-FIRM means construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred before May 2, 1977, the effective date of the initial
flood insurance rate map for the site.
   Primary frontal dune means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge
of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward
and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high
tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary
frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a
relatively steep slope to a relatively mild slope.
   Principally above ground means that at least fifty-one (51) percent of the
actual cash value of the structure is above ground.
   Public safety and/or nuisance means anything which is injurious to the
safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable
number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the
customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or
basin.
   Recreational vehicle (RV) means a vehicle, which is:
   (1)   Built on a single chassis;
   (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
   (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   Reference level is the top of the lowest floor or the bottom of the lowest
attendant utility, whichever is lower, for structures within special flood
hazard areas designated as zone A1-30, AE, A, A99 or AO. The reference level is
the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor for
structures within special flood hazard areas designated as zone VE.
   Regulatory flood protection elevation means the "base flood elevation" plus
the "freeboard." In "special flood hazard areas" where base flood elevations
(BFEs) have been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus two (2) feet
of freeboard. In "special flood hazard areas" where no BFE has been
established, this elevation shall be at least two (2) feet above the highest
adjacent grade.
   Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into
compliance with state and community floodplain management regulations, or, if
this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that
impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected
development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the
ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   Salvage yard means any non-residential property used for the storage,
collection, and/or recycling of any type of equipment, and including but not
limited to vehicles, appliances and related machinery.
   Sand dunes means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or

facility means, as defined in G.S. 130A-290(a)(35), any facility involved in
the disposal of solid waste.
   Solid waste disposal site means, as defined in G.S. 130A-290(a)(36), any
place at which solid wastes are disposed of by incineration, sanitary landfill,
or any other method. Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means the land in the
floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of being flooded in
any given year, as determined in section 8-3(b) of this chapter.
   Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other
improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas,
liquid, or liquefied gas storage tank that is principally above ground.
   Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
during any one-year period whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred. See definition of
"substantial improvement." Substantial damage also means flood-related damage
sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period
for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
during any one (1) year period for which the cost equals or exceeds fifty (50)
percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
   (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure
and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to section 8-4(e),
Variance procedures.
   Technical bulletin and technical fact sheet means a FEMA publication that
provides guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP,
which are contained in Title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at
Section 60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by
state and local officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP
regulations and by members of the development community, such as design
professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing
bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create
regulations; rather they provide specific guidance for complying with the
minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations. It should be noted that
technical bulletins and technical fact sheets provide guidance on the minimum
requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or community requirements that
exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design professionals should contact
the community officials to determine whether more restrictive state or local
regulations apply to the building or site in question. All applicable standards
of the state or local building code must also be met for any building in a
flood hazard area.
   Temperature controlled means having the temperature regulated by a heating
and/or cooling system, built-in or appliance.
   Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter.
   Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in sections
6-4 and
6-5 is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
   Water surface elevation (WSE) means the height, in relation to mean sea
level of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of
coastal or riverine areas.
   Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

Sec. 8-3. General provisions.
   (a)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction, including extra-territorial
jurisdictions (ETJs) if applicable, of the town and within the jurisdiction of
any other community whose governing body agrees, by resolution, to such
applicability.
   (b)   Basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas. With the
following: The special flood hazard areas are those identified under the
cooperating technical state (CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina
and FEMA in its FIS dated January 17, 2025, for Pender/Onslow County and
associated DFIRM panels, including any digital data developed as part of the
FIS, which are adopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance, and
all revisions thereto.
   (c)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities within special
flood hazard areas determined in accordance with the provisions of section
8-3(b) of this chapter.
   (d)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (e)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (f)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
   (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (g)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and
will occur. Actual flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard
areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the town or by
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (h)   Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or
special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates
this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon
conviction thereof, be fined not more than fifty dollars ($50.00) or imprisoned
for not more than thirty (30) days, or both. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the town from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.

issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      b.   Floodproofing certificate: If non-residential floodproofing is used
to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a floodproofing
certificate (FEMA form 81-65), with supporting data and an operational plan, is
required prior to the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator a
certification of the floodproofed design elevation of the reference level and
all attendant utilities, in relation to NAVD 1988 or subsequent datum.
Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. The
floodplain administrator shall review the certificate data and the operational
plan. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant
prior to permit approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to
make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development
permit. Failure to construct in accordance with the certified design shall be
cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate of compliance/occupancy.
         1.   A final finished construction floodproofing certificate (FEMA
Form 086-0-34), with supporting data, an operational plan, and an inspection
and maintenance plan are required prior to the issuance of a certificate of

floodplain management program for that area;
      i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and

conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   (5)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (6)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
   (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance
coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (8)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the state upon request.
   (9)   Conditions for variances:
      a.   Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
      b.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or non-
encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge.
      c.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      d.   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit approval.
      e.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (10)   A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities,
hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage
facilities that are located in special flood hazard areas provided that all of
the following conditions are met.
      a.   The use serves a critical need in the community.

      a.   Replacements part of a substantial improvement must also meet the
above provisions.
      b.   Replacements that are for maintenance and not part of a substantial
improvement, may be installed at the original location provided the addition
and/or improvements comply with the standards for new construction consistent
with the code and requirements for the original structure.
   (5)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   (6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
   (7)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (8)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
   (9)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this
chapter and located totally or partially within the floodway, non-encroachment
area, or stream setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the
regulatory flood protection elevation in the floodway, non-encroachment area,
or stream setback, and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or
replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter.
   (10)   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in section
8-4(e)(10). A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an
allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater
treatment facility may be located in a special flood hazard area only if the
structure or tank is either elevated or flood proofed to at least the
regulatory flood protection elevation and certified according to the provisions
of section
8-4(b)(3) of this chapter.
   (11)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   (12)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have

   (13)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (14)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which
approval is required by federal or state law, including section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334.
   (15)   When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard area,
the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
   (16)   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation shall apply.
   (b)   Specific standards. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in section
8-3(b) or section
8-5(d), the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of section
8-5(a), are required:
   (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in section
8-2 of this chapter.
   (2)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in section
8-2 of this chapter. Structures located in A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-30 zones may
be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of
elevation provided that ail areas of the structure, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection
elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water, using structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO zones,
the floodproofing elevation shall be in accordance with section
8-5(h)(3). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in section
8-4(b)(3), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
   (3)   Manufactured homes.
      a.   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the
reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in section
8-2 of this chapter.
      b.   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation systems or in accordance with the current
Edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured Homes,
adopted by the commissioner of insurance pursuant to G.S. 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis
thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall
be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation
of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height, an engineering
certification is required.
      c.   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of section
8-5(b)(4).
      d.   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents
of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home
parks or subdivisions located within floodprone areas. This plan shall be filed
with and approved by the floodplain administrator and the local emergency
management coordinator.
   (4)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed areas of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which are below the lowest floor:
      a.   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      b.   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      c.   Shall include, flood openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To
meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional
engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum design criteria:
         1.   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         2.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one (1)
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         3.   If a building has more than one (1) enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         4.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than
one (1) foot above the adjacent grade;
         5.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         6.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings.
      d.   Shall, in coastal high hazard areas (zones VE) and Coastal A zones,
either be free of obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls, open wood
latticework or insect screening, provided they are not part of the structural
support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway under abnormally
high tides or wave action without causing damage to the elevated portion of the
building or supporting foundation system or otherwise jeopardizing the
structural integrity of the building. The following design specifications shall
be met:
         1.   Material shall consist of open wood latticework or insect
screening; or
         2.   Breakaway walls shall meet the following design specifications:
            (i)   Design safe loading resistance shall be not less than ten
(10) nor more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot; or
            (ii)   Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance
of twenty (20) pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by
state or local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of
the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and
nonstructural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with
the base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the
North Carolina State Building Code.
   (5)   Additions/improvements.
      a.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         1.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure.
         2.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      b.   Additions to post-FIRM structures except in Coastal A and VE zones,
with no modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in
the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards
for new construction.
      c.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         1.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure.
         2.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
   (6)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      a.   Be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days
and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently
attached additions); or
      b.   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
   (7)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the floodplain administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
floodplain administrator for review and written approval:
      a.   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified should not exceed three (3) months, renewable up to
one (1) year;
      b.   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      c.   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of seventy-two (72) hours before landfall of a hurricane
or immediately upon flood warning notification);
      d.   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      e.   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside the
special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (8)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, etc.) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the
following criteria shall be met:
      a.   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
      b.   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
      c.   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
      d.   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
      e.   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with the
provisions of section
8-5(a)(1);
      f.   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of section
8-5(a)(4); and
      g.   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces shall be provided in conformance with the provisions of section
8-5(b)(4)c.
      An accessory structure with a footprint less than one hundred fifty (150)
square feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an
elevation or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing
certifications are required for all other accessory structures in accordance
with section
8-4(b)(3).
   (9)   Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within a
special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met:
      a.   Underground tanks. Underground tanks in flood hazard areas shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads during conditions of the design flood,
including the effects of buoyancy assuming the tank is empty;
      b.   Above-ground tanks, elevated. Above-ground tanks in flood hazard
areas shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation
on a supporting structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement during conditions of the design flood. Tank-supporting
structures shall meet the foundation requirements of the applicable flood
hazard area;
      c.   Above-ground tanks, not elevated. Above-ground fuel tanks that do
not meet the elevation requirements of this ordinance shall not be permitted in
VE or Coastal A Zones. Fuel tanks may be permitted in other flood hazard areas,
and septic tanks may be permitted in any flood-hazard area, provided the tanks
are designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist all flood-related
and other loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of the
design flood and without release of contents in the floodwaters or infiltration
by floodwaters into the tanks. Tanks shall be designed, constructed, installed,
and anchored to resist the potential buoyant and other flood forces acting on
an empty tank during design flood conditions.
      d.   Tank inlets and vents. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and vents
shall be:
         1.   At or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or fitted
with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the
contents of the tanks during conditions of the design flood; and
         2.   Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of
the design flood.
   (10)   In coastal high hazard areas, development activities other than
buildings and structures shall be permitted only if also authorized by the
appropriate state or local authority; if located outside the footprint of, and
not structurally attached to, buildings and structures; and if analyses
prepared by qualified registered design professionals demonstrate no harmful
diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave reflection that would increase
damage to adjacent buildings and structures. Such other development activities
include but are not limited to:
      a.   Bulkheads, seawalls, retaining walls, revetments, and similar
erosion control structures;
      b.   Solid fences and privacy walls, and fences prone to trapping debris,
unless designed and constructed to fail under flood conditions less than the
design flood or otherwise function to avoid obstruction of floodwaters.
      c.   Reserved.
      d.   Standards for floodplains without established base flood elevations.
Within the special flood hazard areas designated as approximate zone A and
established in section
8-3(b), where no base flood elevation (BFE) data is available, the following
provisions, in addition to the provisions of sections
8-5(a) and (b), shall apply:
         1.   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of twenty
(20) feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream,
whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         2.   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be determined based on one (1) of the following criteria:
            (i)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in sections
8-5(a) and (b).
            (ii)   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other
development proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if
development is greater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/
manufactured home sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted
by reference in accordance with section
8-3(b) to be utilized in implementing this chapter.
            (iii)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from
a federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall
be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined
in section
8-2.
      e.   Standards for riverine floodplains with BFE but without established
floodways or non- encroachment areas. Along rivers and streams where BFE data
is provided by FEMA or is available from another source but neither floodway
nor non-encroachment areas are identified for a special flood hazard area on
the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all
development within such areas:
         1.   Standards of sections
8-5(a) and (b); and
         2.   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is
designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless certification
with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at
any point within the community.
      f.   Floodways and non-encroachment areas. Areas designated as floodways
or non- encroachment areas are located within the special flood hazard areas
established in section
8-3(b). The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards
outlined in sections
8-5(a) and (b), shall apply to all development within such areas:
         1.   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
            (i)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the floodplain administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
            (ii)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been
approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon
completion of the proposed encroachment.
         2.   If section
8-5(f)(1) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
         3.   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
provided the following provisions are met:
            (i)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of section
8-5(b)(3); and
            (ii)   The no encroachment standard of section
8-5(f)(1).
      g.   Coastal high hazard areas (zones VE) and Coastal A zones are special
flood hazard areas established in section
8-3(b). These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity
waters from storm surges or seismic activity and, therefore, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following provisions
in addition to the provisions of section
8-5(a) and (b):
         1.   All new construction and substantial improvement shall:
            (i)   Be located landward of the reach of mean high tide;
            (ii)   Be located landward of the first line of stable natural
vegetation; and
            (iii)   Comply with all applicable CAMA setback requirements.
         2.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation. Floodproofing shall not be utilized on any
structures in coastal high hazard areas to satisfy the regulatory flood
protection elevation requirements.
         3.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the lowest floor free of obstruction so as not to impede the flow
of flood waters, with the following exceptions:
            (i)   Open wood latticework or insect screening may be permitted
below the lowest floor for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash
away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with the provisions
of section
8-5(b)(4)d.1. Design plans shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions
of section
8-4(b)(1)d.3.(ii); or
            (ii)   Breakaway walls may be permitted provided they meet the
criteria set forth in section
8-5(b)(4)b. and d. Design plans shall be submitted in accordance with the
provisions of section
8-4(b)(1)d.3.(i).
         4.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
securely anchored to pile or column foundations. All pilings and columns and
the structure attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all building components.
            (i)   Water loading values used shall be those associated with the
base flood.
            (ii)   Wind loading values used shall be those required by the
current Edition of the North Carolina State Building Code.
         5.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance
with the provisions of section
8-4(b), section
8-5(g)(3), section
8-5(g)(4), and section
8-5(g)(6) of this chapter on the current state "National Flood Insurance
Program V-zone certification" form.
         6.   Fill shall not be used for structural support. Limited non-
compacted and non- stabilized fill may be used outside the perimeter of a
building provided it is demonstrated through coastal engineering analysis that
the proposed fill would not result in any increase in the base flood elevation
and not cause any adverse impacts by wave ramping or deflection to the subject
structure or adjacent properties.
         7.   There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase
potential flood damage.
         8.   No manufactured homes shall be permitted except in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be
placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided
the anchoring and elevation standards of this subsection have been satisfied.
         9.   Recreational vehicles may be permitted in coastal high hazard
areas provided that they meet the recreational vehicle criteria of section
8-5(b)(6)a.
      h.   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (zone AO). Located within
the special flood hazard areas established in section
8-3(b), are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3)
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to section
8-5(a) and (b), all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet
the following requirements:
         1.   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the
depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of zero (0) feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two
(2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
         2.   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in section
8-5(h)(1) so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required in accordance with section
8-4(b)(3) and section
8-5(b)(2).
         3.   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

Sec. 8-6. Legal status provisions.
   (a)   Effect on rights and liabilities under the existing flood damage
prevention ordinance. This chapter in part comes forward by re-enactment of
some of the provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance enacted
September, 29, 1987 as amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but
rather to re-enact and continue to enforce without interruption of such

complaint. Notice of such hearing shall also be given to at least one (1) of
the persons signing a petition relating to such dwelling. Any person desiring
to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being
heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be

   (b)   Procedure after hearing. After such notice and hearing, the code
enforcement officer shall state in writing his determination whether such
dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation and, if so, whether it
is deteriorated or dilapidated. If the code enforcement officer determines that
the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he shall state in writing his
findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to
be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to
repair, alter and improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the
minimum standards of fitness established by this chapter within a specified
period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days. Such order may also direct and
require the owner to vacate and close such dwelling or dwelling unit until such
repairs, alterations and improvements have been made. If the code enforcement
officer determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is dilapidated, he shall
state in writing his findings of fact to support such determination and shall
issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and
requiring the owner to either repair, alter and improve such dwelling or
dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by
this chapter, or else vacate and remove or demolish the same within a specified
period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days.
   (c)   Failure to comply with order. 
      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or
dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the code enforcement
officer to repair, alter or improve the same within the time specified therein,
or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling shall fail to comply with an order of
the code enforcement officer to vacate and close and remove or demolish the
same within the time specified therein, the code enforcement officer shall
submit to the board of commissioners at its next regular meeting a resolution
directing the town attorney to petition the superior court for an order
directing such owner to comply with the order of the code enforcement officer,
as authorized by state law.
      (2)   In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated dwelling
or dwelling unit or of a dilapidated dwelling to comply with an order of the
code enforcement officer within the time specified therein, if injunctive
relief has not been sought or has not been granted as provided in paragraph (1)
of this subsection, the code enforcement officer shall submit to the board of
commissioners an ordinance ordering the code enforcement officer to cause such
dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered, improved or vacated and
closed and removed or demolished, as provided in the original order of the code
enforcement officer, and pending such removal or demolition, to placard such
dwelling as provided by state law and section
9-57 
   (d)   Appeals from orders of code enforcement officer. An appeal from any
decision or order of the code enforcement officer may be taken by any person
aggrieved thereby. Any appeal from the code enforcement officer shall be taken
within ten (10) days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order
and shall be taken by filing with the code enforcement officer and with the
zoning board of adjustment a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds
upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the
code enforcement officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When
appeal is from a decision of the code enforcement officer refusing to allow the
person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force
until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the code
enforcement officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal
shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the
board, unless the code enforcement officer certifies to the board, after the
notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant, a suspension of
his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may
be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one (1) day's written notice
to the code enforcement officer, by the board or by a court of record upon
petition made pursuant to state law and subsection (e) of this section. The
board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give
due notice to all the parties and shall render its decision within a reasonable
time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order
appealed from and may make such decision and order as, in its opinion, ought to
be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the code
enforcement officer, but the concurring vote of four (4) members of the board
shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the code
enforcement officer. The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals,
in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, to adapt the
application of this chapter to the necessities of the case to the end that the
spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and
substantial justice done. Every decision of the board shall be subject to
review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within fifteen
(15) days of the decision of the board, but not otherwise.
   (e)   Petition to superior court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the code enforcement officer or a decision rendered by the board
shall have the right, within thirty (30) days after the issuance of the order
or rendering of the decision, to petition the superior court for a temporary
injunction restraining the code enforcement officer pending a final disposition
of the case, as provided by state law.

the inspector in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the code enforcement
officer shall make an affidavit to that effect, and the serving of such
complaint or order upon such person may be made by publishing the same once
each week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper circulating in the town.
Where service is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall

order of the code enforcement officer issued pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, and upon adoption by the board of commissioners of an ordinance
authorizing and directing him to do so, as provided by state law and section
9-55(c), the code enforcement officer shall proceed to cause such dwelling or
dwelling unit to be repaired, altered or improved to comply with the minimum
standards of fitness established by this chapter or to be vacated and closed
and removed or demolished, as directed by the ordinance of the board of
commissioners, and shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of such
dwelling or dwelling unit a placard with the following words: "This building is
unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human
habitation is prohibited and unlawful." Occupation of a building so posted
shall constitute a misdemeanor. Each such ordinance shall be recorded in the
office of the register of deeds in the county wherein the property is located
and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index, as
provided by state law.

9-57 shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was
incurred. Such lien shall be filed, have the same priority and be enforced and
the costs collected as provided by the General Statutes.

or limit in any way the power of the town to define and declare nuisances and
to cause their abatement by summary action or otherwise, or to enforce this
chapter by criminal process as authorized by G.S. 14-4 and section
9-4, and the enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the
enforcement of any other remedy provided herein or in other ordinances or laws.
(Code 1977, § 13-19)
Sec. 9-60. Zoning board of adjustment to hear appeals.
   All appeals which may be taken from decisions or orders of the inspector
pursuant to section
9-55(d) shall be heard and determined by the zoning board of adjustment. As the
appeals body, the board shall have the power to fix the times and places of its
meetings and to adopt necessary rules of procedure and any other rules and
regulations which may be necessary for the proper discharge of its duties. The
board shall perform the duties prescribed by section
9-55(d) and shall keep an accurate journal of all its proceedings.

(Ord. No. 2021-14, § 1, 7-22-2021)
Sec. 11-23. Noise measurement techniques.
   (a)   Sound level meters.
      (1)   For the purpose of determining decibels, (dB(A)s) as referred to in
this chapter, noise shall be measured using the A-weighting scale on a sound
level meter of standard design and quality having characteristics established
by the American National Standards Institute.
      (2)   The sound level meter should be certified to meet or exceed the
American National Standards Institute or its successor bodies and shall be
serviced, calibrated and operated as recommended by the manufacturer. Persons
utilizing the sound level meter for purposes of this chapter shall be familiar
with sound level measurement and the operation of sound level measurement
equipment, and shall operate the sound level meter in accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions.
   (b)   Alternative measurement techniques.
      (1)   In the event that the noise cannot be measured on a sound level
meter operated on the "A" weighting network (scale) or it is otherwise
impractical to utilize this measurement technique under the circumstances:
         a.   The complaints of two or more persons, at least one of whom
resides in a different location from the other complaining person, when
combined with the complaint of an authorized investigating officer, shall be
prima facie evidence that the sound is unreasonably loud, disturbing or
excessive noise; and/or
         b.   If the noise is of such a nature that a reasonable person with
normal sensitivities should have known that the noise was creating an
unreasonably loud, disturbing or excessive noise the same shall be prima facie
evidence of a violation of this chapter. Sound emission decibel measurements
shall not be required for establishment of a violation under the circumstances
set out above and the same shall be deemed to be a noise disturbance.
      (2)   In determining whether a noise, under this section, is of such
character as to be noise disturbance the investigating officer shall consider
the following nonexclusive list of factors:
         a.   Does the noise cross property lines?
         b.   Complaints of neighbors regarding the noise;
         c.   Effect on neighbors complaining about the noise;
         d.   Time of day at which the noise takes place;
         e.   The intensity and duration of the noise;
         f.   The type of noise produced;
         g.   The reason or reasons for the noise; and
         h.   Alternative means available which will not produce excessive
noise.
   (c)   Location of measurement.
      (1)   Except for noise within multi-family or multi-tenanted structures,
all noise measurements shall be made at or beyond the furthest point of the
property line of the property from which the noise originates to determine if
the noise creates a disturbance. For purposes of measurement, the back of the
curb, the outside edges of driveways, fences, hedges or other physical features
commonly associated with property boundaries are presumed to be at a point
which is at or beyond the property line.
      (2)   In the case of noise within multi-family or multi-tenanted
structures, noise measurements shall be made in the complaining unit with all
windows and doors closed and at a point that is approximately the center of the
room in the complaining unit that is nearest the unit from which the noise
originates. If access to the complaining unit is not possible, then the
measurement shall be at least twenty-five feet from the nearest point of
habitable space of the unit from which the noise originates.

collection of paid parking are subject to change from time-to-time by the town
council. All parking spaces are available for temporary parking only. No

      d.   The Town Manager or his designee may immobilize by the use of wheel
locks and tow any vehicle which is illegally parked in violation of this
chapter or is parking in a town parking space and has three (3) or more
outstanding violations. Ability for immobilization will occur upon issuance of
the third citation with the first two being unpaid and issued on separate days.
For the purpose of determining whether an illegally parked vehicle has had
issued against it three (3) or more, unpaid parking tickets issued on at least
three (3) separate days, it shall be sufficient if the license plate number of
the illegally parked vehicle and the license plate number of the vehicle having
received the tickets are the same.
      e.   If a wheel lock is attached to a vehicle, a notice shall be affixed
to the windshield or other part of the vehicle so as to be readily visible. The
notice shall include the following:
         1.   A warning that the vehicle has been immobilized and that any
attempt to move the vehicle may result in damage to the vehicle. The town shall
not be responsible for any damage to an immobilized illegally parked vehicle
resulting from unauthorized attempts to free or move the vehicle.
         2.   An immobilization fee and any additional parking fees pursuant to
the town's annually adopted rate and fee schedule shall be charged for the
removal of the wheel lock.
         3.   The address and telephone number to be contacted to pay such
charges to have the wheel lock removed.
      f.   If civil penalties are due and the immobilization fee as herein
provided are not paid, or satisfactory arrangements in lieu of payment are not
made, within twenty-four (24) hours of the attachment of the wheel lock, such
vehicle may be towed to any public or private impoundment lot which complies
with the provisions of article IV, section 17 of this chapter. If a private
contractor tows and stores the vehicle he may impose against the vehicle his
customary fees and charges for such services. Once a vehicle has been towed,
the town manager or his designee shall mail or cause to have mailed, a notice
of towing to the registered owner and lien holders, if any are known, at the
address or addresses reported to the town by the state department of motor
vehicles.
      g.   Upon payment of all civil penalties and overdue and unpaid parking
tickets issued for the vehicle and of all other charges authorized by this
section, including immobilization, towing, and storage fees, the vehicle shall
be released to the owner or any other person legally entitled to claim
possession of the vehicle.
      h.   All towing and storage charges incurred in connection with impounded
vehicles shall constitute a lien upon such vehicles as provided in G.S. 44A-2.
      i.   The owner or other person entitled to possession of the vehicle
which has been immobilized pursuant to this section may submit a request for
hearing to the police chief, or his designee by certified mail, electronically,
or personal delivery within ten (10) days from the receipt of the notice
provided for in subsection (f) of this section; if a request for a hearing is
not made within the allotted time, the right to a hearing shall have been
waived. If a hearing is requested, a town dispute statement shall be sent to
the requesting party to inform him of the time and place of the hearing, of the
basis of the vehicle's immobilization and towing, of the rules governing
conduct of the hearing, of the right to present evidence as to why the vehicle
should not have been immobilized and towed, and of the right to be represented
by counsel. The owner or other person entitled to possession may also submit
evidence and statement for review without appearing during the hearing. The
chief of police or his designee shall then prepare a written report within
three (3) days of the hearing. The report shall state findings and conclusion
as to whether the vehicle was properly immobilized and towed and the reasons
underlying the committee's conclusion. If it is concluded that the vehicle was
improperly immobilized and towed then any improper charges shall be canceled,
or if paid, rebated.
      j.   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to remove
from a vehicle a wheel lock thereon pursuant to this section or to remove from
impoundment any vehicle placed therein pursuant to this section without all
civil penalties, immobilization fees and other applicable charges (i.e. parking
citation and damage to wheels locks) having first been paid or an approved
payment plan having been made.
      k.   The Town Manager is authorized to establish guidelines to adjust the
amount of civil penalties imposed pursuant to this section to promote the

delinquent parking tickets.

council.
      d.   Business employee parking passes can be purchased by businesses
complying with the business registration program and that are located in the

notice but has denied the alleged violation; then the town may require that the
user cease to discharge into a public sanitary sewer, upon a hearing by the
town manager, for up to thirty (30) days. The suspension shall be only for the
purpose of clearly determining the operational effect of the user's discharge
and the suspension shall not be made if it will likely endanger the public
health, safety, or welfare or otherwise create a public health or safety
nuisance. Depending upon the results of the suspension on the operation of the
wastewater treatment facilities the town may take appropriate action to either
restore service or discontinue further service.

persons, or is likely to cause the disruption or inhibition of the operation of
the town's treatment facilities, the town manager may immediately, upon written
notice or verbal notification to the user, discontinue service to said owner/
customer. In such event, the town shall serve written notice to the owner/
customer after discontinuation of service and shall, where feasible, follow the
procedural requirements of this chapter. If, upon fulfillment of such

Sec. 18-31. Complaints; adjustments.
    (a)   If the owner/customer believes his bill to be in error, he shall
present his claim in person at the town office before the bill becomes
delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not
be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as provided in this
section. The owner/customer may pay such bill under protest, and such payment
shall not prejudice his claim.
   (b)   The town will make special meter readings at the request of the owner/
customer for a fee for each meter; provided, that if such special reading
discloses that the meter was overread, no charge will be made.
   (c)   Meters will be tested at the request of the owner/customer upon
payment to the town of the actual cost of making the test; provided, that if
the meter is found to over register beyond five (5) percent of the correct
volume, no charge will be made.
   (d)   If the seal of a meter is broken by other than the town's
representative or if the meter fails to register correctly or is stopped for
any cause, the owner/customer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of
his previous bills or from other proper data.

manager for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Actual evidence of a water leak in which the water did not enter
the sewer system; in such instances, the sewer charges may be adjusted based on
the estimated volume of water that did not enter the sewer system.
      (2)   A determination that an unusual meter reading was caused by or
could reasonably have been caused by a meter malfunction.
      (3)   A determination that principles of fairness, equity, basic cost
recovery, and/or service quality will be best or reasonably served by an
adjustment.
      (4)   One-time high bill adjustment. A single-unit commercial or
residential property as being defined as one (1) water meter serving one (1)
residence or business, may be eligible for a one-(1)-time, one-(1)-bill
reduction due to unexplained reasons and for which no other applicable Surf
City policy or ordinance exists. The high bill must be at least three (3) times
higher than the comparable water usage from the same month from the previous
two (2) years. At the customer's request, the town will adjust the high bill.
The new adjusted bill will exclude water and sewer use charges attributable to
twenty-five (25) percent of the water and sewer use in excess of the comparable
months in previous years. Eligible customers may receive such an adjustment
only once per account, for one (1) billing period.

premises or location where the work is being done. Should the permit be lost or
destroyed, the department will supply a duplicate, for which a charge will be
made. Water must not be turned on or used until the permit shall be posted as
above required. In case it shall be discovered that the water has been turned
on or used before the posting of the permit, the water will be turned off by
the department. Should it appear that the applicant for water to be used in the
construction or repair of buildings or other construction or repair of
buildings or other construction work has misrepresented the quantity of work to
be done, the supply of water to such party shall immediately be shut off and
not be turned on again until a true and revised estimate of the quantity of
such work is submitted, nor until the charge for the water for the additional
work shall be paid to the department.

   (a)   Extensions to approved subdivisions or developed property.
      (1)   When application is received requesting the extension of water and
sewer service to serve property within the corporate limits which is developed
or has been previously approved as a subdivision, or where streets have
previously been dedicated and accepted by the town, and where such area is not
part of a new subdivision which has not been approved by the town, the town
clerk or other persons designated by the council shall estimate the cost of the
project and present the application for such extension, the estimated cost and
other required information to the council for their consideration. If the
application is approved by the council and subject to the availability of
funds, the town will install, or have installed by contract under its
supervision, the extensions which have been approved, and such extensions shall
be financed in accordance with this subsection.
      (2)   When an approved water or sewer extension project has been
completed and the total cost thereof has been determined, one hundred (100)
percent of the total cost of the extension shall be assessed against the
benefitting property owners, using one of the methods of assessment authorized
under G.S. Chapter 160A.
      (3)   Any property owner shall have the opportunity to pay his
proportionate share of the cost of such extensions after the assessment roll is
confirmed rather than paying his share in equal annual installments with
interest as required by state law.
   (b)   Extensions to proposed development or subdivisions.
      (1)   When an application is received requesting the extension of water
and sewer service to proposed developments or subdivisions within the corporate
limits which have not been approved by the council, the town clerk or other
person designated by the council, shall estimate the cost of the project and
present the application for such extension, the estimated cost and other
required information to the council for their consideration. If the application
is approved and subject to the approval of the development or subdivision by
the town, and subject to the availability of funds, the town may install, or
have installed by contract under its supervision, such extensions, which shall
be financed in accordance with this subsection.
      (2)   Prior to the beginning of any construction, the property owner
shall advance to the town an amount equal to one hundred (100) percent of the
total estimated cost of the proposed extensions. Upon receipt of such funds, a
written contract shall be entered into by and between the town and the property
owner, under which the town will use funds upon the following terms and
conditions:
         a.   The funds shall be deposited in a special account of the town for
which a separate accounting will be made.
         b.   At the time construction of the extension is completed and the
total cost thereof is determined; if the amount deposited exceeds the total
cost, that portion in excess of the amount deposited will be refunded to the
owner without interest; if the amount deposited is less than the total cost,
the owner shall pay such additional amount to the town, and this condition
shall be part of the written contract.
         c.   In lieu of depositing funds, the owner may provide a surety bond
acceptable to the town or some other form of security that will insure payment
to the town of the owner's proportionate share of the cost of the extensions in
accordance with this division.
         d.   No refund or reimbursement of funds shall be made to the owner
who pays the total cost of extension under the requirements of this subsection,
except as provided in subparagraph b. of this section.
         e.   All administration, legal and engineering costs involved in the
town's accomplishment of such extensions shall be considered a part of the
total cost and shall be included in all estimates and accountings under this
division.
   (c)   Facilities excluded in determining owner's share of cost.
      (1)   When the town determines that it is advisable to install larger
facilities than are necessary to serve the property requesting such extension,
as set out above, the difference in the cost of the larger facility over the
cost of the facilities required to serve the property requesting such extension
shall be paid for by the town and excluded from the total cost to be shared by
the property owner and the town as provided herein. All mains up to eight (8)
inches in size, or engineer’s recommended main size in order to maintain
current or better water quality and fire prevention standards in accordance
with Surf City Specifications, shall be considered as being required to serve
the property requesting such extensions.
   (d)   Exceptions authorized. Nothing in this division shall prevent the

Sec. 18-91.   Cross connection control, backflow prevention assemblies
required, program established.
   (a)   Application, purpose, authorization. This section applies to all
persons who use, or connect in any way to, the public potable water
distribution system of the town ("public water system"). The purpose of this
article is to protect the public water system from contaminants and pollution
"backflowing" into the public water system from private water systems by:
      (1)   Requiring the installation of backflow prevention assemblies which
will minimize the possibility of contamination by confining within the
customer's private water system those contaminants or pollutants, which could,
under adverse conditions, back flow or back siphon through uncontrolled cross
connections into the public water system; and
      (2)   Establishing a backflow prevention program.
   (b)   Definitions. As used in this article, the following definitions apply:
      Backflow prevention assembly (sometimes "BPA". A device used to prevent
backflow into the public water system from a customer's water service
connection. The type of BPA required by this article to be used shall depend on
whether the hazard, which can be an existing hazard or a potential hazard,
presented by backflow from a particular private system is a "pollution" (non-
health) hazard or a "contamination" (health) hazard. An approved backflow
prevention assembly is a BPA that has been approved by the American Society of
Sanitary Engineers (ASSE) or the American Water Works Association (AWWA), or
USC, or the Foundation for Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Research,
whichever is most restrictive.
      Certified backflow prevention assembly technician (sometimes
"technician"). Any person who has received from the state a certificate to
install, test, repair, overhaul, or maintain approved backflow prevention
assemblies. A backflow prevention assembly technician certificate will be
issued to any person who:
         a.   Demonstrates knowledge of applicable laws, rules, and regulations
applying to backflow prevention assemblies in the State of North Carolina, and
         b.   Holds a certificate of completion from an approved training
program in the installation, testing, repair, overhaul and maintenance of
backflow prevention assemblies.
      Consumer. Any customer of the town's public water system, or any person,
firm, or entity using or receiving water from the town's public water system or
owning or possessing property or facilities that receive water from, or
connecting to the town's public water system.
      Contamination hazard. Represents the type of existing or potential hazard
presented by a private system and means an existing or potential impairment of
the quality of the water, which creates a potential or actual hazard to the
public health through the introduction of hazardous or toxic substances or
waterborne health hazards in the form of physical or chemical contaminants or
biological organisms and pathogens.
      Cross connection. Any unprotected actual or potential connection or
structural arrangement between the town's public water system and any other
pipe, conduit, source or system through which it is possible to introduce any
contamination or pollution other than the intended potable water with which the
system is supplied. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable
sections, swivel or changeover devices, and other temporary or permanent
devices or arrangements through which or because of which backflow can or may
occur are considered to be cross connections.
      Degree of hazard. Whether the hazard or potential hazard is a "pollution"
(non-health) hazard, or a "contamination" (health) hazard. The degree of hazard
shall be determined by the town from the evaluation of conditions within a
private water system and the use to which a property connected to public system
is put.
      Health hazard. An actual or potential threat of contamination of a
physical, chemical, biological, pathogenic or toxic nature to the public or
private water system to such a degree or intensity that there would be a danger
to health. Examples of waterborne health hazards include, but are not limited
to:
         a.   Physical: radioisotopes/radionuclide's;
         b.   Chemical: lead, mercury and other heavy metals, organic
compounds, other toxins and hazardous substances;
         c.   Biological: microorganisms and pathogens like Cryptosporidium,
typhoid, cholera and E. Coli.
      Imminent hazard. A health hazard situation that is likely to cause an
immediate threat to human life, an immediate threat of serious physical injury,
an immediate threat of serious adverse health effects, or a serious risk of
irreparable damage to the environment if no immediate action is taken.
      Pollution or non-health hazard. An actual or potential threat to the
quality of water of the town's public system or a private potable water system.
A non-health hazard is one that, if introduced into the public water supply
system, could be a nuisance to water users, but would not adversely affect
human health.
      Private water system. That part of a water service connection to the
town's public water system which is located on the consumer's side of the
town's water meter. A private water system may be a water service line to a
single premise or structure or it may be a privately owned and maintained water
distribution system, which serves more than one structure or premises. For the
purpose of this article, once water from the town's public water system passes
through the meter to the customer's side, that water is considered part of the
private water system.
      Public water system. The town's water system and includes all of the
system for the provision to the public of potable water for human consumption
through pipes or other constructed conveyances and includes:
         a.   Any collection, treatment, storage or distribution facility and
all appurtenance to those facilities under control of the town and used
primarily in connection with the town's water system; and
         b.   Any collection, treatment, storage or distribution facility and
all appurtenances to those facilities not under the control of the town that is
used primarily in connection with the town's water system.
   (c)   New unprotected cross-connections prohibited, existing cross-
connections to be protected. No contamination or pollution of public water
system. All consumers and any other person or entity receiving water from the
town's public water system shall be in violation of this article if they fail

   (a)   It is intended that the division include provisions for prohibiting
the discharge by any wastewater customer into a public sanitary sewer of
substances which may endanger the public health and safety; or of unpolluted
waters which do not require treatment and therefore reduce the effectiveness of
the biological operations of a treatment facility.
   (b)   It is further understood that the biological and chemical operations
which can be designed for wastewater treatment do, by their scientific nature,
limit the types of constituents in wastewater which may be treated by
facilities, constructed and maintained within a reasonable cost to the public.
Consequently, the treatment facilities are designed for the primary purpose of
treating domestic wastewater in sufficient manner to protect public health.
Certain industrial wastewater constituents can be treated without interference
at the wastewater facilities, but only in a limited quantity or concentration.
To ensure that discharges of industrial wastewater into the public sanitary
sewer are within such quantity, and concentration limits, reasonable and
adequate regulations are provided in this article.

activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption
foodstuffs and that use one (1) of more of the following preparation
activities: Cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling,
sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching,
roasting, toasting, or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing,
barbecuing, and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, non
consumable food product in or on a receptacle that requires washing.
      (4)   Noncooking establishments. Those establishments primarily engaged
in the preparation of precooked foodstuffs that do not include any form of
cooking. These include but not limited to cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs
preparation and serving establishments.
      (5)   Minimum design capability. The design features of a grease
interceptor and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and
retain greases from grease-laden wastewaters discharged to the public sanitary
sewer.

from the public utilities director for grease interceptor sizing prior to
submitting plans for a building permit. (All existing food service
establishments, determined by the public utilities director to have a
reasonable potential to adversely impact the town's sewer system will be
notified of their obligation to install a grease interceptor within the
specified period set forth in the notification letter.)
      (3)   Variance from grease interceptor requirements: Grease interceptors
required under this section shall be installed unless the public utilities
director authorizes the installation of an indoor grease trap or other
alternative pretreatment technology and determines that the installation of a
grease interceptor would not be feasible. The food service establishment bears
the burden of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor is
not feasible. The public utilities director may authorize the installation of
an indoor grease trap where the installation of a grease interceptor is not
feasible due to space constraints or other considerations. If an establishment
believes the installation of a grease interceptor is infeasible, because of
documented space constraints, the request of an alternate grease removal device
shall contain the following information:
         a.   Location of sewer main and easement in relation to available
exterior space outside building.
         b.   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for
all services at that site.
         (Alternative pretreatment technology includes, but is not limited to,
devices that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from wastewater and
prevent it from being discharged into the sanitary sewer collection system. All
alternative pretreatment technology must be appropriately sized and approved by
the public utilities director.)

be easily accessible for inspections, cleaning, and removal of intercepted
grease. The grease interceptor may not be installed in any part of the building
where food is handled. Location of the grease interceptor must meet the
approval of the public utilities director and Pender County Health Department.
      (4)   All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of
accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design
capability or effective volume. These devices should be inspected at least
monthly by user. Users who are required to maintain a grease interceptor shall:
         a.   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time in accordance with
the Uniform Plumbing Code (or other applicable plumbing code used by local
agency).
         b.   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required.
Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as
grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags,
etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective
volume of the device.
      (5)   The user shall maintain a written record of inspection and
maintenance for three (3) years. All such records will be made available for
on-site inspection by representative of the town during all operating hours of
user.
      (6)   Sanitary wastes are not allowed to be connected to sewer lines
intended for grease interceptor service.
      (7)   Except as provided herein, for a period of one (1) year following
adoption of this section, although installation of grease interceptors will be
required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
section for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease
interceptors. If, during this one (1) year period an obstruction of a sewer
main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the
environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer
collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an
accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the town will take appropriate
enforcement actions, as stipulated in the section 18-134(h) and/or 18-133(h),
"Enforcement", against the generator or contributor of such grease.
      (8)   Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of twenty-four (24)
inches, shall be provided over each grease interceptor chamber and sanitary
tee. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be

removal, and wastewater sampling activities. Manhole covers must be traffic
rated if placed within any parking areas. Manhole covers are to be of a weight
class of less than one hundred (100) pounds.
   (f)   Grease trap requirements.
      (1)   Upon approval by the public utilities director, a grease trap
complying with the provisions of this section must be installed in the waste
line leading from sinks, drains, and other fixtures or equipment in food
service establishments where grease may be introduced into the drainage or
sewage system in quantities that can affect line stoppage or hinder sewage
treatment or private sewage disposal.
      (2)   Grease traps sizing and installation shall conform to the Uniform
Plumbing Code or other applicable plumbing code used by local agency.
      (3)   No grease trap shall be installed which has a stated rate flow of
more than fifty-five (55) gallons per minute, nor less than twenty (20) gallons
per minute, except when specifically approved by the public utilities director.
      (4)   Grease traps shall be maintained in efficient operating conditions
by periodic removal of the accumulated grease. No such collected grease shall
be introduced into any drainage piping, or public or private sewer.
      (5)   No food waste disposal unit or dishwasher shall be connected to or
discharge into any grease trap.
      (6)   Wastewater in excess of one hundred-forty degrees Fahrenheit by
sixty degrees Celsius (140°F)/(60°C) shall not be discharged into a grease
trap.
      (7)   Except as provided herein, for a period of one (1) year following
adoption of this section, although installation of grease traps will be
required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
section for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease
interceptors. If, during this one (1) year period an obstruction of a sewer
main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the
environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer
collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an
accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the town will take appropriate
enforcement actions, as stipulated in the section 18-134(h) or as stipulated in
18-133(h), "Enforcement", against the generator or contributor of such grease.
   (g)   Grease interceptor maintenance, recordkeeping, and grease removal.
      (1)   Users shall install grease interceptors as required by the town.
Grease interceptors shall be installed at the user's expense. Grease
interceptors may also be required in noncooking or cold dairy and frozen food
service establishments and other industrial or commercial establishments when
they are deemed necessary by the town public utilities director for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease, no user shall allow wastewater
discharge concentration from subject grease interceptor to exceed seventy-five
(75) mg/l. All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design, and capacity
approved by the town and shall be readily and easily accessible for user
cleaning and town inspection. All such grease interceptors shall be serviced
and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain
minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but
not less often than every thirty (30) days. Users who are required to pass
water through a grease interceptor shall:
         a.   Have a capacity and design in compliance with the following
equations:
            i.   Restaurants:
               (S) X (20) x (HR/12) x (LF) = capacity in gallons
               S = number of seats in dining area
               HR = number of hours open
               LF = loading factor:
               1.27 Recreational areas
               0.8 Main highways
               0.7 Other highways
            ii.   Hospitals, nursing homes, other types of kitchens with varied
seating capacity:
               M x (5) x (LF) = capacity in gallons
               M = meals per day
               LF = loading factor
               1.0 With dishwasher
               0.5 Without dishwasher
            Except that no grease trap shall be smaller than seven hundred
fifty (750) gallons, no single separator shall be larger than three thousand
(3,000) gallons and where requirements exceed three thousand (3,000) gallons
multiple units shall be used. In cases of certain fast-food restaurants or
establishments with potential to discharge large quantities of grease and oil,
capacity requirements greater than twenty-five (25) gallons per seat may be
required. Prepackaged or manufactured grease traps may be approved by the town
with proper engineering and application review.
         b.   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required,
but at intervals of no longer than thirty (30) days at the user's expense.
Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as
grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags,
etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective
volume of the grease interceptor.
         c.   Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said
device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently achieved.
"Consistent" shall mean any wastewater sample taken from said grease
interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described
in subsection (g)(1). If a previously established business desires, because of
documented space constraints, an alternative to an out-of-building grease
interceptor, the request for an alternative location shall contain the
following information:
            i.   Location of town sewer main and easement in relation to
available exterior space outside building.
            ii.   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing
for all services at that site.
         d.   Understand and agree that: The use of biological additives as a
grease degradation agent is not permissible.
         e.   Understand and agree that: The use of automatic grease removal
systems is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the
director, the lead plumbing inspector of the town, and the Pender County
Department of Health. Any establishment using this equipment shall operate the

limit, as measured from the unit's outlet, is consistently achieved.
         f.   Understand and agree that: The director reserves the right to
make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy and need, based on review of
all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility
site and building plan review and to require repairs to, or modification or
replacement of such traps.
      (2)   The user shall maintain a written record of interceptor maintenance
for three (3) years. All such records will be available for inspection by the
town at all times.
      (3)   No non-greaseladen sources are allowed to be connected to sewer
lines intended for grease interceptor service.
         Provide manholes, with a minimum diameter of twenty-four (24) inches,
over each chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes shall extend at least
to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or
infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily removable covers to
facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater sampling activities.
Manhole covers must be traffic rated if place within any parking areas. Manhole
covers are to be of a weight class of less than one hundred (100) pounds.
   (h)   FOG variance.
      (1)   The town public utilities developed a variance study to allow food
preparation and service establishments an avenue to provide substantial
evidence so as to reduce maintenance of the grease interceptor as required by
this section.
      (2)   A food preparation/service establishment can apply for a variance
to the scheduled service requirements of this section. A food preparation/
service establishment that believes the service schedule of once every thirty
(30) days is excessive, and feels that the grease interceptor service frequency
can be extended, without violating this section can apply. Food preparation/
service establishments who wish to use biological or chemical additives for the
removal of fats, oils, and grease from a grease separation device or a plumbing
system may also apply for a variance to the service schedule.
         a.   A copy of the Town of Surf City Grease Interceptor Service
Schedule Variance Request Form can be obtained from the town. The request form
must be signed by the food preparation/service owner(s).
         b.   Read, understand, and agree with the town's grease interceptor
service schedule variance (see Appendix A), and the town's grease interceptor
service schedule variance request form, (see Appendix B).
         c.   Mail a completed town's grease interceptor service schedule
variance request form to:
            Town of Surf City
            Public Utilities Department
            P.O. Box 2475
            Surf City, NC 28445-9821
            Utilities@surfcitync.gov
         d.   The Town of Surf City will review all variance request forms and
contact the food preparation/service establishment accepting or rejecting the
variance request. The food preparation/service establishment once authorized by
the Town of Surf City to begin the variance study procedure may contact a
grease interceptor service provider to schedule a grease interceptor cleaning.
         e.   The food preparation/service establishment must contact the Town
of Surf City Public Utility Department two (2) working days prior to the grease
interceptors schedule cleaning.
         f.   Additional monitoring events or pollutants may be required if
deemed necessary by the town's public utility department. Variance studies
shall not exceed a period of ninety (90) days.
         g.   After a minimum of three (3) site samples are collected and all
sampling results are obtained, the town's public utilities department will
analyze all data. After all data is reviewed by the town, the town will submit
in writing the results of the variance study only to the facility requesting
said study.
         h.   Enforcement:
            1.   When an establishment is fifteen (15) days past required
cleaning date, the establishment will be in violation. If the establishment
cannot provide proof that they have maintained compliance with the fats, oils,
and grease ordinance, a three-hundred-dollar ($300.00) fine will be added to
the establishment water bill.
            2.   If a sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) occurs and can be traced
back to an establishment, the establishment will be in violation. If this SSO
occurred through neglect of the grease discharge a three-hundred-dollar
($300.00) fine will be added to the next billing cycle.
            3.   Termination of (sewer) service (TOS). Termination of service
(TOS) is the revocation of a food service establishment's privilege to
discharge wastewater from food preparation processes into the sanitary sewer
system. TOS is used when the discharge from the establishment presents imminent
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or the environment or
threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW collection system. TOS is
also used as an escalating enforcement action when a noncompliant food service
establishment fails to respond adequately to previous enforcement actions. TOS
may be accomplished by physical severance of the FSE's connection to the
sanitary sewer system, which compels the establishment to immediately terminate
its discharge, or a court ruling.
            4.   The Public Utilities Director reserves the right to assess the
maximum penalty for any violation.

General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR, Part 403). The objectives of this
section are:
         a.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
         b.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass-through the system, inadequately treated,
into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
         c.   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludges from the municipal system;
         d.   To protect both municipal personnel who may be affected by
sewage, sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as
protecting the general public;
         e.   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and
         f.   To ensure that the municipality complies with its NPDES or non
discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other
federal or state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject.
      This section provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the issuance of
permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein.
      This section shall apply to all users of the municipal wastewater system,

hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the
system) be more than five (5) percent nor any single reading over ten (10)
percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter.
         Pollutants, substances, wastewater, or other wastes prohibited by this
section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be
discharged to the municipal wastewater system. All floor drains located in
process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's
pretreatment facility before connecting with the system.
         When the POTW director determines that a user(s) is contributing to
the POTW, any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts which may
cause or contribute to interference of POTW operation or pass-through, the POTW
director shall:
            1.   Advise the user(s) of the potential impact of the contribution
on the POTW in accordance with subsection (h)(1); and
            2.   Take appropriate actions in accordance with subsection (d) for

incorporated herein.
         a.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
POTW director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
         b.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the POTW director
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e).
         c.   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
         d.   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical
standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.

      Industrial waste survey information will be used to develop user-specific
local limits when necessary, to ensure that the POTW's maximum allowable
headworks loading are not exceeded for particular pollutants of concern. User-
specific local limits for appropriate pollutants of concern shall be included
in wastewater permits. The POTW director may impose mass-based limits in
addition to, or in place of concentration-based limits.
      (4)   State requirements. State requirements and limitations on
discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those in this section.
      (5)   Right of revision. The town reserves the right to establish
limitations and requirements which are more stringent than those required by
either state or federal regulation if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives presented in subsection (a)(1), of this section or the general and
specific prohibitions in subsection (b)(1), of this section, as is allowed by
40 CFR 403.4.

EPA, the state, or the POTW director, whichever is more stringent. Any
facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained
at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the town for review and shall be
approved by the POTW director before construction of the facility. The review
of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from
the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the town under the provisions of this section. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall
be reported to and be approved by the POTW director prior to the user's
initiation of the changes.
         b.   Additional pretreatment measures.
            1.   Whenever deemed necessary, the POTW director may require users
to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this section.
            2.   The POTW director may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.

permitted by the POTW director, and at such times as are established by the
POTW director. Such waste shall not violate subsection (b)(1), of this section
or any other requirements established by the town. The POTW director may
require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits.
         b.   The POTW director shall require haulers of industrial waste to
obtain wastewater discharge permits. The POTW director may require generators
of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The POTW
director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The
discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of
this section.
         c.   The industrial waste hauler must provide a waste analysis of any
load prior to discharge.
         d.   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for
every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

in the volume or character of the wastewater prior to introduction in the
system.
               xiv.    Requirements for the prior notification and approval by
the POTW director of any change in the manufacturing and/or pretreatment
process used by the permittee.
               xv.    Requirements for immediate notification of excessive,
accidental, or slug discharges, or any discharge which could cause any problems
to the system.
               xvi.   A statement that compliance with the permit does not
relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with all applicable
federal and state pretreatment standards, including those which become
effective during the terms of the permit.
               xvii.   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the POTW
director to ensure compliance with this section, and state and federal laws,
rules, and regulations.
         k.   Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five (5) years. A permit may be issued for a period less
than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date.
         l.   Permit transfer. Wastewater permits are issued to a specific user
for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned
or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new
or changed operation.
         m.   Permit reissuance. A significant industrial user shall apply for
permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application in accordance
with subsection (d)(2) a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the
expiration of the existing permit.
   (e)   Reporting requirements.
      (1)   Baseline monitoring reports.

permits held by or for the facility.
            3.   Description of operations. A brief description of the nature,
average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the
operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should include a
schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from
the regulated processes.
            4.   Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average
daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated
process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined
waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
            5.   Measurement of pollutants.
               i.   The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each
regulated process.
               ii.   The results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the
POTW director, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated
process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or
mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of
daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in
subsection (e)(10), of this section.
               iii.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures
set out in subsection (e)(11), of this section.
            6.   Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized
representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
            7.   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by
which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule
pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection (e)
(2), of this section.
            8.   Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (d)(2)c., of this
section.
      (2)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions
shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (e)(1)b.7, of
this section:
         a.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);
         b.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
         c.   The user shall submit a progress report to the POTW director no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
         d.   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the POTW director.
      (3)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the POTW director a report containing the information described in section (e)
(1)b.4.—6. of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (d)(2)c., of
this section.
      (4)   Periodic compliance reports. Municipalities may sample and analyze
user discharges in lieu of requiring the users to conduct sampling and
analysis.
         a.   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined
by the POTW director but in no case less than twice per year (in June and
December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
subsection (d)(2)c., of this section.
         b.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
         c.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW director,
using the procedures prescribed in subsection (e)(10), of this section, the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
      (5)   Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the POTW
director as prescribed in subsection (d)(2)j.2.xiii. of any planned significant
changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the
change.
         a.   The POTW director may require the user to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection (d)
(2), of this section.
         b.   The POTW director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
subsection (d)(2) of this section or modify an existing wastewater discharge
permit under subsection (d)(2), of this section in response to changed
conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
      (6)   Reports of potential problems.
         a.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW director
of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken
by the user.
         b.   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the POTW director, submit a detailed written report describing
the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as
a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this section.
         c.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in paragraph a., above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
      (7)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the POTW
director as the POTW director may require.
      (8)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the POTW
director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the POTW director within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the POTW
director monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the POTW
director samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives
the results of this sampling.
      (9)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. The town
prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification and
approval of the POTW director.
         a.   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one
hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharge during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All
notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e)(5), of this
section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (e)(1), (3),
and (4), of this section.
         b.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph a.,
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
         c.   In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW
director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety
(90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
         d.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
         e.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this section, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
      (10)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
      (11)   Sample collection.
         a.   Except as indicated in subsection b., below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the POTW
director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of
four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
         b.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
      (12)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on
the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a
mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt
of the report shall govern.
      (13)   Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
section shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this section and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available
for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the town, or
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by
the POTW director.
   (f)   Compliance monitoring.
      (1)   Monitoring facilities.
         a.   The town requires the user to provide and operate at the user's
own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
         b.   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
         c.   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the requirements
of the town and all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written
notification by the town.
      (2)   Inspection and sampling. The town will inspect the facilities of
any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this section is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the town, approval authority
and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The town,
approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements
with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the town, approval authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities. Denial of the POTW director's approval authority's,
or EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this section.
      (3)   Search warrants. If the POTW director, approval authority, or EPA
has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part
thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be
a violation of this section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample
as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the town designed to
verify compliance with this section or any permit or order issued hereunder, or
to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then
the POTW director, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the court having jurisdiction within the town.
   (g)   Confidential information.
      (1)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW director that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be
asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
      (2)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this section, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, non discharge
permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions
of a report shall be available for use by the State or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
      (3)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards
shall be made available to officials of the approval authority and EPA upon
request.
   (h)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Administrative remedies.
         a.   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW director finds that
any user has violated or is violating this section, wastewater permit, or any
prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other
pretreatment requirement the POTW director may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within thirty (30) days
from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the town by the user.
Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any
violations    occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
         b.   Consent orders. The POTW director is hereby empowered to enter
into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by
the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an
administrative order issued pursuant to subsection (h)(1)d., below.
         c.   Show cause hearing.
            1.   The POTW director may order any user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this section or is in
noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW director
determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service
may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
            2.   The POTW director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
            3.   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite
to the assessment of a civil penalty under subsection (h)(2) nor is any action
or inaction taken by the POTW director under this section subject to an
administrative appeal under subsection (d)(2)h.
         d.   Administrative orders. When the POTW director finds that user has
violated or continues to violate this section, permits or orders issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW director may issue an
order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in
noncompliance to do any of the following:
            1.   Immediately comply with all requirements;
            2.   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth
in the order;
            3.   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of
a continuing or threatened violation;
            4.   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a
specified time period.
         e.   Emergency suspensions.
            1.   The POTW director may suspend the wastewater treatment service
and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or mon discharge permit.
            2.   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within fifteen (15) days of the notice of
suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's
waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW director shall take such steps
as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The POTW director shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the
wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant
discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the POTW director prior to the date of the
above-described hearing.
         f.   Termination of permit. Any user, who violates the following
conditions of this section, or applicable state and federal regulations, is
subject to having its permit terminated:
            1.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his discharge;
            2.   Failure to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
            3.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring; or,
            4.   Violation of conditions of the permit.
      Noncompliant users will be notified of the proposed termination of their
wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under
subsection (h)(1), of this section why the proposed action should not be taken.
      (2)   Civil penalties.
         a.   Any user who is found to have failed to comply with any provision
of this section, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued
hereunder, may be fined up to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per day
per violation.
            1.   Penalties between ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per day per violation may be assessed
against a violator only if:
               a.   For any class of violation, only if a civil penalty has
been imposed against the violator within the five (5) years preceding the
violation, or
               b.   In the case of failure to file, submit, or make available,
as the case may be, any documents, data, or reports required by this section,
or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, only if the
POTW director determines that the violation was intentional and a civil penalty
has been imposed against the violator within the five (5) years preceding the
violation.
         b.   In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the POTW director
shall consider the following:
            1.   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to
the public health, or to public or private property resulting from the
violation;
            2.   The duration and gravity of the violation;
            3.   The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or
on-air quality;
            4.   The cost of rectifying the damage;
            5.   The amount of money saved by noncompliance;
            6.   Whether the violation was committed willfully or
intentionally;
            7.   The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to
comply with the pretreatment program;
            8.   The costs of enforcement to the town.
         c.   Appeals of civil penalties assessed in accordance with this
section shall be as provided in subsection (d)(2)h.
      (3)   Other available remedies. Remedies, in addition to those previously
mentioned in this section, are available to the POTW director who may use any
single one (1) or combination against a noncompliant user. Additional available
remedies include, but are not limited to:
         a.   Criminal violations. The district attorney for the applicable
judicial district may, at the request of the town, prosecute noncompliant users
who violate the provisions of G.S. 143-215.6B. [Note: Under North Carolina law,
it is a crime to negligently violate any term, condition, or requirement of a
pretreatment permit, or negligently fail to apply for a pretreatment permit,
issued by local governments (G.S. 143-215.6B(f)), to knowingly and willfully
violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or
knowingly and willfully fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by
local governments (G.S. 143-215.6B(g)), to knowingly violate any term,
condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit issued by local governments,
or knowingly fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that
a person is placed in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, (G.S.
143-215.6B(h)), and to falsify information required under G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 21
(G.S. 143-215.6B(i)).]
         b.   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user is in violation of the
provisions of this section or an order or permit issued hereunder, the POTW
director, through the town attorney, may petition the Superior Court of Justice
for the issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent
injunction which restrains or compels the activities in question.
         c.   Water supply severance. Whenever a user is in violation of the
provisions of this section or an order or permit issued hereunder, water
service to the user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the
user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated ability to comply.
         d.   Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent
limitations of this section or of a permit or order issued hereunder, is hereby
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the
POTW director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions of the appropriate ordinances of the town governing such nuisances,
including reimbursing the POTW for any costs incurred in removing, abating or
remedying said nuisance.
      (4)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this section
are not exclusive. The POTW director may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the town's enforcement response
plan. However, the POTW director may take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant. Further, the POTW director is empowered to take more
than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
   (i)   Annual publication of significant noncompliance. At least annually,
the POTW director shall publish in the largest daily newspaper circulated in
the service area, a list of those users which were found to be in significant
noncompliance, also referred to as reportable noncompliance in 15A NCAC 2H
.0903(b)(10), with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, during
the previous twelve (12) months.
   (j)   Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
      (1)   Upset.
         a.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subparagraph b., below, are met.
         b.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
            1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of
the upset;
            2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
            3.   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW
director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five (5) days]:
               i.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
               ii.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected
to continue; and
               iii.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate,
and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
         c.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
         d.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
         e.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
      (2)   Prohibited discharge standards defense. A user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection (b)(1)a., of this
section or the specific prohibitions in subsections (b)(1)b.2., 3., and 5.—7.
of this section if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know,
that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources,
would cause passthrough or interference and that either:
         a.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-
through or interference; or
         b.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
[the town] was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
      (3)   Bypass.
         a.   1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the POTW director, at least ten (10) days before
the date of the bypass, if possible.
            2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of this time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW director may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty-four (24) hours.
         b.   1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW director may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
               i.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
               ii.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
               iii.   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph b.
of this section.
            2.   The POTW director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW director determines that it will
meet the three (3) conditions listed in subparagraph b.1., of this section.

Sec. 18-151. Generally.
   (a)   Any person who owns or operates a facility producing or proposed to
produce wastewater of any quantity, strength, or other quality which would not,
or may not, meet the conditions and limitations set forth in this article, and
who is connected to, or desires to make connection to the public sanitary
sewer, shall make application to the director for a waste discharge permit
authorizing continued discharge, or an industrial connection for discharging,
of the described attendant wastewater. No industrial waste, pretreated waste,
or any waste other than normal wastewater shall be permitted to connect to the
town's sanitary sewer system without the prior approval of the director of
public utilities.
   (b)   The building inspector will not issue a building permit or certificate
of compliance for any structure for an industrial user until the applicant
presents to him a certified copy of a completed and approved industrial sewer
connection and waste discharge application.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-152. Required.
   All persons whose plants, buildings, or premises are connected to the public
sanitary sewer from and after February 10, 1987, who may be subject to the
provisions herein, and who have not heretofore obtained an industrial waste
discharge permit shall have thirty (30) calendar days after notification within
which to make application to the town for a permit as required.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-153. Application.
   Users seeking a waste discharge permit shall complete and file with the
director an application on a form prescribed by the director, accompanied by
the applicable fees. The director may further require that the application
include any additional information deemed necessary by the director in order to
determine if pretreatment will be required to meet the conditions and
limitations of this article, or to meet EPA/DEM pretreatment standards. The
director may further require any information which is required by EPA/DEM.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-154. Pretreatment requirements.
   (a)   The director will determine through review of the industrial discharge
permit application and in cooperation with the applicant whether the waste
produced shall be pretreated by the applicant before it is discharged into the
town sewer. When appropriate, at facilities already in operation, sampling of
wastes to determine characteristics may be performed by the town at the
applicant's cost. The director shall advise the applicant of the level of
pretreatment required and of a compliance schedule. If the director determines
that such waste must be pretreated, the applicant shall submit to the director
for approval, plans and specifications of the proposed pretreatment facilities.
   (b)   If such plans and specifications are approved as submitted, or amended
by the director, the applicant shall proceed according to an agreed schedule to
provide such pretreatment facilities.
   (c)   The construction plans for such pretreatment plants or facilities
shall after their approval be placed on file in permanent reproducible form
with the director without cost to the town.
   (d)   If the pretreatment facilities are completed according to the approved
plans and specifications, and the applicant demonstrates its effective use and
provides a proper sewer connection and industrial waste discharge application,
the director shall issue the applicant a waste discharge permit. The permit
shall authorize such connection and permit the applicant to discharge such
waste into the public sewer at the rate and in the quantity and/or connection
stated herein. These pretreatment facilities shall be maintained continuously
in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (e)   The conditions and limits in this article shall be used as
pretreatment plant design criteria and shall be applied to the maximum
estimated rate of flow through the plant. The minimum pretreatment for
industrial or other wastewater, which is consistently within pH limits but
requires pretreatment, shall be to pass wastewater through a grease trap or
other interceptor providing a minimum detention period of ten (10) minutes
between the influent and effluent baffles with twenty (20) percent of the total
volume of the grease trap or interceptor being allowed for a sludge pocket.
This sludge pocket shall be serviced as required, but at intervals of no longer
than thirty (30) days at the owner's expense. It shall be kept free of
inorganic solids which settle into the required sludge pocket, and all grease
or other floating material shall be skimmed from the trap or basin tank at
intervals of a frequency sufficient to avoid accumulation of scum covering the
surface of the liquid, but not less frequently than each thirty (30) days.
   (f)   Upon written notification by the director that a grease interceptor is
required for a given discharge, the user will have a period of one hundred
twenty (120) days for compliance. Such compliance consists of the provision to
the director of detailed plans and specifications for approval and the method
of installation and operability of a grease trap or other interceptor device.
Failure to comply will result in the implementation of the enforcement
procedures of this article.
   (g)   There shall be a debris screen included in pretreatment facilities
immediately preceding or following the grease interceptor through which all
industrial waste, excepting flow from toilet and personal sanitary facilities,
shall pass. A debris screen may be required as the final feature of a
pretreatment facility with a maximum size opening necessary to protect the
public sewer system.
   (h)   The solid matter removed from any interceptor or that which is
retained by the debris screen shall be disposed of in lawful manner, without
nuisance, by the owner at his expense, but shall in no case be placed in the
town's wastewater system.
   (i)   Should the wastewater system customer operate a grease trap, an
interceptor or other pretreatment device in which inorganic sludge is collected
and stored, such inorganic sludge shall not be placed in the town's wastewater
system and all effluent from such pretreatment plant or device must pass-
through the required debris screen.
   (j)   If it is determined that an applicant discharges wastewater which does
not require pretreatment, the applicant will be issued a permit permitting the
applicant to discharge wastewater to the public sewer at a publicly provided
access point at a rate, and in the quantities and qualities stated in the
permit.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-155. Cancellation of permit.
   If any industrial user is in violation of any condition of his waste
discharge permit, or any other provision of this article, and it is determined
pursuant to this article that the user's service shall be disconnected, the
waste discharge permit shall be cancelled upon the disconnection. Any
industrial user whose permit has been cancelled may receive a publicly provided
access to the public sanitary sewer only after making an application for a new
waste discharge permit.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-156. Fees.
   Each waste discharge permit issued under the provisions of this article
shall terminate at the expiration of one (1) year from the date of its
issuance. Permit fees for initial permit issuance, annual permit renewal and
restoration of the permit shall be as set forth in the fee schedule.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-157. Ownership changes.
   If an industrial user authorized to connect to the wastewater system for
industrial waste disposal under the provisions hereof is sold, leased, or its
ownership is otherwise changed or the industrial operation thereof is operated
by a person other than that named in the permit, a new application for a waste
discharge permit shall be made by the new owner. No permit issued under the
provisions hereof shall be assignable to any other person.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-158. Effect of approvals.
   (a)   Any approval by the director of a type, kind, or capacity of a
pretreatment facility installation shall not relieve a person of the
responsibility of subsequently revamping, enlarging or otherwise modifying such
pretreatment installation to accomplish the original intended purpose or to
meet new or revised standards. Nor shall any written or oral agreement as to
limits of waste constituents or volumes of wastewaters be considered as final
approval for continuing operation or otherwise prevent the town from
subsequently withdrawing its approval. These limits will be subject to
monitoring, study and change as considered necessary to serve their intended
purpose.
   (b)   Changes in the characteristics or volumes of wastewater of any permit
holder will constitute a basis for the director's requiring a new application
for a waste discharge permit. Furthermore, permits issued may be modified as
may be necessary due to changes in pretreatment requirements by EPA/DEM.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-159. Property rights.
   The issuance of a permit by the director does not convey any property rights
in either real or personal property, or any exclusive privileges, nor does it
authorize any injury to private property or any invasion of personal rights,
nor violation of applicable federal, state, or local laws, ordinances or
regulations.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-160. Prior approval required.
   No industrial waste, pretreated waste or any waste other than normal
wastewater shall be permitted to connect to the town's sanitary sewer system
without the prior approval of the director of public utilities.

Sec. 18-183. BOD limit.
   The admission into the public sewers of any wastewaters having a five-day
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) in excess of having two hundred fifty (250)
mg/l by weight on a twenty-four (24)-hour composite sample basis, or, for any
sample taken at random (grab sample), having a five-day biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD5) in excess of three (3) times the average influent valve for the
affected wastewater treatment facility during the previous calendar year, will
be subject to review by the director. When, in the opinion of the director,
discharge of wastewater into the public sewer system in strength exceeding the
limits stated above may not be treatable at the publicly owned treatment works
according to standards or as required by EPA/DEM, or when such discharge may
interfere with the operation of the treatment works, the user shall, at his own
expense, provide and operate pretreatment facilities and pretreat wastes to be
discharged as may be required to meet the limits stated in this section. When
the discharge of wastewater of strength exceeding these limits is permitted by
the director, the user may, in addition to any other remedy, be assessed
surcharge rates.

Sec. 18-186. Flow equalization.
   (a)   The admission into the public sewers of any wastewater in volumes, or
with constituents, such that the transportation of such wastewater through the
public sewer to the treatment facility will not sufficiently dilute such
wastewater to prevent interference with treatment or to prevent endangerment of
public health and safety at the treatment facility shall be prohibited.
   (b)   Where necessary, facilities for varying the rate of discharge may be
required as part of the building sewer in order to bring constituents or volume
of flow discharged within the limits previously prescribed or to an otherwise
acceptable level, and/or to hold or equalize flows such that no peak flow
conditions may hamper the operation of any unit of the public sewer or
treatment facility. Such equalization unit shall have a capacity suitable to
serve its intended purpose, and be equipped with acceptable outlet control
facilities to provide flexibility in operation and accommodate changing
conditions in the waste flow. Equalizing facilities shall be provided to
prevent flows from exceeding the following limits:
 
Average Flow Gallons/Day Allowable Ratio of Peak to Average Flow
10,000 to 100,000        3
100,000 to 500,000       2
More than 500,000        1.5

Sec. 18-187. Deleterious discharges.
   (a)   If any wastewater is discharged, or is proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which contains the constituents or possesses the
characteristics enumerated in the preceding sections of this article, and which
may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater collection system, wastewater
treatment processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create
a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the director may as a
condition to the waste discharge permit:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities, concentrations or rates of
discharges; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of receiving, handling, and
treating the wastes not covered by current charges of fees for wastewater
service.
   (b)   If the director permits or requires the pretreatment or equalization
of waste flows, the design, installation of the plants and equipment and their
effective operation shall be subject to the prior review and approval of the
director and the local, state, and federal agencies having jurisdiction and
shall be subject to the requirements of all other applicable rules,
regulations, ordinances and laws.
   (c)   In the event a spill or loss into the building sewer of any
deleterious materials is threatened or occurs, the owner shall promptly notify
the director of the nature of the spill or threatened spill, the quantity, and

Sec. 18-188. Water quality changes.
   (a)   The director shall, from time to time, have tests made to determine
the quality of waste being discharged into the public sewer from individual
users of the wastewater system or from connections of building sewers carrying
composite waste from domestic users and/or industrial users and from
connections including the premises of industrial waste discharge permit holders
under the provisions hereof. If, at any time, such waste becomes of such a
quality and/or quantity, that requires pretreatment, then the director shall
have the authority to require that proper permits be obtained and proper
pretreatment facilities be installed by the permit holder at his expense.
   (b)   In the event of a significant change in a wastewater system user's
wastes being discharged to the public sanitary sewer; the user shall promptly
notify the director of the nature of the change in quality or strength and in
volume. These changes shall be subject to verification by the town. Appropriate
remedies for the adequate treatment of such wastes thus tested may be required
by the director. "Significant" is defined here to mean a change of ten (10)
percent or more in strength and/or volume of wastes, based on the average flow.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-189. Standards of waste discharge and delivery.
   (a)   The delivery of all effluent from a user to the public sanitary sewer
shall be at a reasonable and uniform discharge rate, as produced without
storage except that which is necessary in the pretreatment or equalization
facilities of the waste producer.
   (b)   Wastes will be accepted which have satisfactory conditions or quality
after pretreatment by the industrial user in a pretreatment facility and/or by
a process which has been approved by the director, and which is continuously
maintained and operated by the producer at no cost to the town and which is
continuously subject to inspection by the director or his designated
representative.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-190. Septic tank and portable toilet wastes.
   From and after February 10, 1987, the discharge of septic tank waste into
the public sanitary sewer system by any means shall be prohibited.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-191. Quality determination; effluent sampling.
   (a)   Periodic measurements of flow, suspended solids, BOD and other
appropriate waste characteristics for surcharge determination and other
purposes shall be made by those permittees specifically designated by the
director. The director shall determine the number of twenty-four (24)-hour flow
measurements and samples required. Continuous monitoring may be required by the
director in cases involving large fluctuations in quantity or quality of
wastes, or if the wastewater appears to have characteristics which may damage
the receiving system.
   (b)   All public sanitary sewer users whose total average sewage discharge
is greater than fifty thousand (50,000) gallons per day, or whose total average
discharge has a flow or pollutant loading requiring utilization of greater than
five (5) percent of the design capacity of the town's collection system, shall,
unless exempted by the director, install and maintain, at the user's expense,
facilities for continuously measuring and sampling the total waste discharge.
This requirement may be waived for a particular user only when the quantity,
flow rate, and characteristics of the wastewater can be adequately determined
without such structures; when the physical arrangement of industrial plant
facilities with respect to sewer facilities make such an arrangement unusually
costly and other means of ascertaining the quantity, flow rate, and
characteristics can be devised; or when previous sampling facilities have been
built by with the town or a prior owner. When the director shall determine that
such facilities discharging less than fifty thousand (50,000) gallons per day
that the nature of the discharge and/or conditions of the permit warrant
continuous monitoring and sampling, the director may require such user to
install and maintain sampling facilities as stated heretofore. Any sampling
facility previously built by the town shall become the maintenance
responsibility of the user after the adoption of the ordinance from which this
article derives unless the director shall determine that it is in the best
interest of the town for the town to continue maintenance.
   (c)   All flow measurements, sampling, and analysis shall be performed by
qualified personnel; all laboratory analyses of industrial wastewater samples
shall be performed by an EPA/DEM certified laboratory in accordance with
current standard chemical analysis methods for wastewater established by EPA/
DEM. All samples shall represent the normal wastewater flow according to the
flow either manually with at least one (1) sample collected hourly or by
automatic integrated sampling equipment.
   (d)   Unless otherwise prescribed by the director, self-monitoring reports
of the sampling shall be submitted to the town quarterly in accordance with the
following schedule:
 
Monitoring Period     Report Due Date
January 1–March 31  April 15
April 1–June 30     July 15
July 1–September 30 October 15
October 1–December 3January 15
 
   (e)   Where a permittee operates as an integrated complex involving varying
processes and having separate industrial waste sewer connections within the
same contributory area, such permittee may be considered as one (1) unit with
multiple connections. An analysis for each connection may be combined in
proportion to the flow from the connection and the weighted average of the
results thus obtained may be used as the measure of the total flow and
concentration of the wastewater discharged into the public sanitary sewer.
   (f)   The handling, storage, and analysis of all samples taken for the
determination of the characteristics of waste discharged shall be performed in
accordance with standard methods.
   (g)   The town may test for quality, to include sampling, any of the waste
being discharged to the public sanitary sewers at any time. A duly authorized
representative of the director may enter an industrial user's facility at any
time, by appropriate application at the plant office during business or
operational hours, for this purpose or for reviewing operations in the plant to
estimate the quality of wastes being produced.
(Ord. No. 1992-1, 1-7-92; Ord. No. 2021-09, 5-4-21)
Sec. 18-192. Quantity determination.
   (a)   Unless otherwise provided, the quantity of wastewater delivered to the
public sanitary sewers shall be the same as the water delivered to the producer
by the town water system.
   (b)   Should the user evaporate or otherwise legally dispose of water
delivered by the town's water system, it shall be the obligation of the user to
install at his expense such meters or other flow measurement devices to
accurately determine the portion or quantity of the metered water delivered to
the wastewater system.
   (c)   The director may establish a constant ratio, factor, or percentage to
be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by the town in order to
estimate the quantity of wastewater delivered by the user. Determination of
this factor shall be the responsibility of the user as will be the
demonstration of the accuracy and generality of the factor to obtain the
director's approval thereof. The value of this factor will be periodically
reviewed for accuracy and may be revised.
   (d)   All domestic and industrial users served by the town wastewater system
shall pay sewer user charges to the town.
   (e)   Where no payment procedure is established, it shall be the obligation
of the owner in all instances to immediately submit to the director a statement
concerning water consumption and disposal upon which wastewater service fees
can be determined. If changes in the consumption and disposal conditions so
stated take place after billing rates and charges have been initially
established, a further statement is required to be submitted on forms supplied
by the director.

SECTION 3.0 PROCEDURES
3.1   General provisions.
   To establish an orderly process to develop land within the jurisdiction of
the Town of Surf City, consistent with standard development practices and
terminology, this section provides a clear and comprehensible development
process that is fair and equitable to all interests including the applicants,
affected neighbors, Administrator, staff and related agencies, and the Town
Council.
   A.   No Construction to Commence without Permit. No land shall be used or
occupied, and no structures shall be erected, moved, extended, or enlarged, nor
shall any timbering, clearing, and grubbing, or filling of any lot for the
construction of any building be initiated until the Administrator has issued an
appropriate development approval which will certify that the proposed work is
in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
   B.   Development Approvals Run with the Land. Unless provided otherwise by
law, all rights, privileges, benefits, burdens, and obligations created by
development approvals made pursuant to this Section attach to and run with the
land.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
3.2   Submission procedures.
   The following requirements shall apply to all applications prior to and for
development approval as identified in this Section.
   A.   Applicants. Applications for development approvals may only be made by
the landowner, a lessee or person holding an option or contract to purchase or
lease land with the permission of the landowner, or an authorized agent of the
landowner. The director of the appropriate department, or designee, may require
an applicant to present evidence of the authority to submit an application.
   B.   Pre-Submittal Meeting. A pre-submittal conference with the
Administrator or designee held prior to the applicant submitting an application
for development approval to discuss the procedures, standards and regulations
required for development approval in accordance with this Ordinance. The
meeting is required with certain applications as outlined on the Development
Process Table in Section
3.7. For all other applications, the Pre-Submittal meeting is optional.
      1.   At the time of the pre-submittal conference, applicants shall submit
a sketch plan for review by the Administrator. This plan should, in simple
sketch form, show the proposed layout of streets, lots and other features in
relation to existing conditions.
      2.   When a subdivision is to be developed in stages, a master plan shall
be submitted for the entire development and a preliminary plat shall be
submitted for each individual stage. A final plat is submitted for individual
stages as each stage is developed. Each new stage shall be developed adjacent
to an earlier stage.
   C.   Forms. Applications required under this Code shall be submitted with
application forms approved by and available from the Planning Department.
   D.   Fees. Application filing fees shall be established and updated as
needed to defray the actual cost of processing the application, as listed in
the approved Fee Schedule maintained by the Town. Fees shall be submitted with
applications.
   E.   Plans. The necessary engineered and/or surveyed plans shall be
submitted with each application as outlined in this section.
   F.   Completeness Review.
      1.   Submission.
         a.   All completed applications for development approval shall be
submitted to the Administrator, including the application fee, all appropriate
forms and documentation, and the plan sets in accordance with the requirements
of this Section and the Fee Schedule adopted by the Town Council.
         b.   Applications sufficient for processing shall be submitted to the
Administrator or designee, in accordance with the established submission
schedule. Schedules indicating submittal dates shall be developed each year and
made available to the public.
      2.   Completeness Determination.
         a.   An application shall be considered submitted only after it has
been determined to be complete as provided below, not upon submission to the
Administrator.
         b.   On receiving a development application, the Administrator shall,
within ten (10) business days, determine whether the application is complete or
incomplete. A complete application is one that:
            (1)   Contains all information and materials required by this
Zoning Ordinance for submittal of the applicable type of application, and in
sufficient detail, format, and readability for the Town of Surf City
Administrator to evaluate the application for compliance with applicable review
standards; and
            (2)   Is accompanied by the fee established for the type of
application.
         c.   Complete Applications. Once the application has been determined
complete, the Administrator shall:
            (1)   Release the application for payment in accordance with the
fee established for the type of application;
            (2)   Upon payment receipt, accept the application as submitted in
accordance with the procedures and standards of this Code in effect at the time
of the submittal;
            (3)   Provide the applicant written notice of application submittal
acceptance electronically; and
            (4)   Copies of the application and plans shall be referred by the
Administrator to the appropriate reviewing entities.
          d.   Incomplete Applications.
            (1)   On determining that the application is incomplete, the
Administrator shall, within ten (10) business days following submittal, provide
the applicant with written notice of the submittal deficiencies electronically.
The applicant may correct the deficiencies and resubmit the application for a
completeness review.
            (2)   If the applicant fails to resubmit an application within
fifteen (15) calendar days after being first notified of submittal
deficiencies, the application submittal shall be considered abandoned.
   G.   Additional Information as Needed. The presumption shall be that all the
information required in the application forms is necessary to satisfy the
requirements of this section. However, it shall be recognized that each
application is unique, and therefore more or less information may be required
according to the needs of the particular case. The applicant may rely on the
recommendations of the Administrator as to whether more or less information
should be submitted.
   H.   Withdrawal of Application.
      1.   An applicant may withdraw an application at any time, by filing a
statement of withdrawal with the Administrator or designee.
      2.   The statement of withdrawal shall be signed by all persons who
signed the application, or in the event of death or incompetence, by the
estate's lawful personal representative.
      3.   The Administrator may withdraw applications due to the failure of
the applicant to submit required information within ninety (90) days of the
initial request.
      4.   An applicant may postpone a scheduled public hearing once per
application for up to ninety (90) days after the date the first public hearing
was scheduled to occur, after which the Administrator may withdraw the
application.
   I.   Related Applications.
      1.   Related applications necessary for development approvals may be
filed and reviewed simultaneously, at the option of the applicant, and with
approval from the Administrator. Any application that also requires a rezoning,
variance or special use permit, shall not be eligible for final approval until
the rezoning, variance, or special use permit has been granted.
      2.   Related applications submitted simultaneously are subject to
approval of all other related applications; denial or disapproval of any
concurrently submitted application shall stop consideration of any related
applications until the denied or disapproved application is resolved.
   J.   Active Application Time Period.
      1.   Requests for additional information, corrections, or other
modifications for all applications, unless otherwise indicated in this
ordinance, shall be returned to the Administrator or designee within ninety
(90) days from the date comments on the application are officially issued.
Failure to meet this deadline shall result in the application being considered
withdrawn and voided, thus requiring a new application, including all
requirements associated with a new application.
      2.   Requests for additional information, corrections, or other
modifications for applications submitted to address a notice of violation shall
be returned to the Administrator or designee within thirty (30) days from the
date comments on the application are officially issued. Failure to meet this
deadline shall result in the application being considered withdrawn and voided,
thus requiring a new application, including all requirements associated with a
new application.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
3.3   Neighborhood meeting.
   After the application has been deemed complete but prior to the placement of
an application on the agenda of a Planning Board or Town Council meeting or
approval by the Administrator or designee, the applicant shall hold a mandatory
neighborhood meeting for applications as designated on the Development Process
Table in Section
3.7.
   A.   Only the initial application for a development shall require a
neighborhood meeting unless there are changes in use, an increase of dwelling
units or square footage of more than 10%, or a reduction in buffers.
   B.   The purpose of the neighborhood meeting shall be to inform the
neighborhood of the nature of the proposed land use and development features,
explain the site plan if any, and solicit comments.
   C.   The applicant shall provide notice by first-class mail (at the last
addresses listed for such owners in the county tax records) to all property
owners within and immediately abutting the subject property. Where the subject
property immediately adjoins a public or private right-of-way, landscape or
riparian buffer, commonly owned private area, public property, or homeowners'
association property, then letters of notification shall be sent to adjoining
property owners as if they directly abut the subject property. The notice shall
be mailed at least ten (10) days but not more than 25 days prior to the date of
the neighborhood meeting.
   D.   The applicant shall prepare and submit to the Administrator or designee
a meeting summary that outlines attendance, major points discussed, and any
agreements reached between the parties involved.
   E.   The Administrator or designee may alter the neighborhood meeting
procedures in cases where there are absentee land owners, limited number of
land owners, or other situations that may limit the ability of adjoining
property owners to attend the meeting.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
3.4   Public notification.

   C.   Mailed Notice. The Town shall notify by first-class mail (at the last
addresses listed for such owners in the county tax records) the affected
property owner and all property owners within and immediately abutting the

(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
3.6   Quasi-judicial processes and evidentiary hearings.
   All quasi-judicial processes are required to have an evidentiary hearing.
   A.   Notice.
      1.   Public notice of the meetings is required. Mailed and Posted Notice
shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Section
3.4.
      2.   Continuation of Hearing with Notice. The Board may continue an
evidentiary hearing that has been convened without further advertisement. If an
evidentiary hearing is set for a given date and a quorum of the board is not
then present, the hearing shall be continued until the next regular Board
meeting without further advertisement.
   B.   Evidentiary Hearing. Evidentiary hearings are required to gather
competent, material, and substantial evidence. They are held by the body making
the quasi-judicial decision, either Board of Adjustment or Town Council.
      1.   Contact with Decision-Making Board Members. Contact with any members
of a decision-making board prior to the evidentiary public hearing by any
individual regarding the matter is prohibited.
      2.   Materials. The Administrator or staff to the Board shall transmit to
the board all applications, reports, and written materials relevant to the
matter being considered. The administrative materials may be distributed to the
members of the board prior to the hearing as long as a copy is also provided to
the appellant or applicant and to the landowner if that person is not the
appellant or applicant. The administrative materials shall become a part of the
hearing record.
      3.   Oaths. The Board Chair or any member acting as chair and the clerk
to the Board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter
coming before the board. Any person who, while under oath during a proceeding
before the board determining a quasi-judicial matter, willfully swears falsely
is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
      4.   Presentation of Evidence. The applicant, the local government, and
any person who would have the standing to appeal the decision under G.S. 160D-
1402(c) shall have the right to participate as a party at the evidentiary
hearing. This includes presenting evidence, cross-examination of witnesses,
objecting to evidence and making legal arguments. Other witnesses may present
competent, material, and substantial evidence that is not repetitive as allowed
by the board. Further, the Council/Board may subpoena witnesses and compel the
production of evidence.
      5.   Administrator as Witness. The official who made the decision or the
person currently occupying that position, if the decision-maker is no longer
employed by the local government, shall be present at the evidentiary hearing
as a witness.
      6.   Competent Evidence Required. All decisions shall be based on
competent evidence entered in as part of the record. The term "competent
evidence," as used in this subsection, shall not preclude reliance by the
decision-making board on evidence that would not be admissible under the rules
of evidence as applied in the trial division of the General Court of Justice if
(i) the evidence was admitted without objection, or (ii) the evidence appears
to be sufficiently trustworthy and was admitted under such circumstances that
it was reasonable for the decision-making board to rely upon it. The term
"competent evidence," as used in this subsection, shall not be deemed to
include the opinion testimony of lay witnesses as to any of the following:
         a.   The use of property in a particular way would affect the value of
other property.
         b.   The increase in vehicular traffic resulting from a proposed
development would pose a danger to the public safety.
         c.   Matters about which only expert testimony would generally be
admissible under the rules of evidence.
      7.   Objections. Objections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary
issues, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal or the
standing of a party or the inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials,
may be made to the Board. The Board chair shall rule on any objections, and the
chair's rulings may be appealed to the full board. These rulings are also
subject to judicial review pursuant to G.S. 160D-1402. Objections based on
jurisdictional issues may be raised for the first time on judicial review.
      8.   Voting. A simple majority is needed for all quasi-judicial decisions
with the exception of variances that require a concurring vote of four-fifths
of the Board. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on the
board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter
under G.S. 160D-109(d) shall not be considered members of the board for
calculation of the majority if there are no qualified alternates available to
take the place of such members.
      9.   Decisions. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon
competent, material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-
judicial decision shall be in writing, reflect the Board's determination of
contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. Each
decision approved by the board shall be signed by the chair.
      10.   Effective Date. A quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing
the written decision with the clerk to the Board. The decision of the Board
shall be delivered within a reasonable time by personal delivery, electronic
mail, or first-class mail to the applicant, landowner, and any person who has
submitted a written request for a copy of the decision.
      11.   Judicial Review. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to
review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari
pursuant to G.S. 160D-1402.
   C.   Appeals from Quasi-Judicial Decisions. An appeal from the decision of
the Board of Adjustment regarding a quasi-judicial decision may be made by an
aggrieved party and shall be made to the Superior Court of Pender County in the
nature of certiorari. Any such petition shall be filed with the clerk of the
superior court by the later of thirty (30) days after the decision is effective
or after a written copy thereof is given in accordance with G.S. 160D-406(j).
When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three (3) days shall be added
to the time to file the petition. The decision of the Board may be delivered to
the aggrieved party either by personal service or by registered mail or
certified mail return receipt requested.

necessary or desirable at the time, but will be needed in the future, make a
payment in lieu of such improvements or part thereof. The amount of any such
payment shall be an amount estimated by the Town to be the actual and total
installation and construction costs of such improvements. The amount paid for a
given improvement shall be considered total and complete payment for the
improvements considered and will preclude any further assessment of the
property in the event that the town elects to install such improvements at a
later date. Full payment shall be made before any building permit or
certificate of occupancy is issued for any use shown on the site plan.
      3.   For all residential and planned developments approved the effective

      3.   As each phase of improvements is implemented and inspected by the
Town, the bond amount shall be reduced by the costs of the installed
improvements.
      4.   In the event that the applicant wishes to occupy any building or any
portion of any building prior to the completion of the required site
improvements, the bond guaranteeing improvements shall be retained by the Town
until the remaining required improvements are completed.
   F.   Inspections of Required Improvements. Inspections of site improvements
shall be made by the Administrator or their designee.

provide an amount equal to the increased cost to the Town, which the Town shall
deposit in the special account. The final approval of any application requiring
a TIA by the Town shall be contingent upon the full payment of all consultant
costs incurred for the analysis.
      4.   The Town may require additional funds for independent review where a
decision-making body expands the scope of the required review; the applicant

   A.    Applicability.
      1.    Amendments to the Zoning Map shall be made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.
      2.    Rezonings should correspond with the boundary lines of existing
platted lots or parcels. Where the boundaries of a rezoning request stop short
of an exterior property line, it must be possible to subdivide and develop that
portion of the property outside the proposed rezoning boundary in accordance
with the existing zoning and other requirements of this Ordinance.
      3.    All zoning requirements shall be met within the boundaries of the
area being rezoned. If all of the requirements cannot be met on the site being
rezoned, prior to advertisement of the public hearing, the rezoning shall be
expanded to include all property necessary to meet zoning requirements.
   B.   Initiation of Amendment.
      1.   The Town Council, any Town agency, or any resident or landowner
within the land use jurisdiction of the Town may initiate a rezoning, except
that no amendment to a zoning regulation or a zoning map that down-zones
property shall be initiated nor enforceable without the written consent of all
property owners subject to the amendment unless initiated by the Town. For
purposes of this section, "down-zoning" means a zoning ordinance that affects
an area of land in one of the following ways:
         a.   By decreasing the development density of the land to be less
dense than was allowed under its previous usage.
         b.   By reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in
a zoning ordinance or land development regulation to fewer uses than were
allowed under its previous usage."
      2.   Citizen Comment. If any resident or property owner in the Town
submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or
repeal to zoning regulation, including a map amendment that has been properly
initiated as provided in 160D-601, to the clerk to the Council at least two (2)
business days prior to the proposed vote on such change, the clerk to the
Council shall deliver such written statement to the Town Council.

Administrator shall forward the completed request and any related materials to
the Planning Board.
      3.   Action by Planning Board.
         a.   All proposed amendments to zoning map shall be submitted to the
Planning Board for review and comment. If no written report is received from
the planning board within thirty (30) days of referral of the amendment to that
board, the Town Council may act on the amendment without the planning board
report. The Town Council is not bound by the recommendations, if any, of the
planning board.
         b.   Plan consistency.
            (1)   When conducting a review of proposed map amendment pursuant
to this section, the planning board shall advise and comment on whether the
proposed action is consistent with any comprehensive plan or future land use
plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is
applicable. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the
Town Council that addresses plan consistency.
            (2)   A comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is
inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or
approval of the proposed amendment by the Town Council.
            (3)   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale
rezoning" under G.S. 160D-602(b), the planning board statement describing plan
consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and
policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the recommendation
made.
            (4)   The review and comment required of the Planning Board by this
section shall not be assigned to the Town Council and must always be performed
by a separate board, even if the Town Council is acting on behalf of the
Planning Board.
         c.   Following Planning Board review, the Administrator shall forward
the completed rezoning request and any related materials, including the
Planning Board recommendation (if applicable), to the Town Council for final
action
      4.   Action by the Town Council.
         a.   Before taking action on a rezoning, the Town Council shall
consider the recommendations of the Planning Board and Administrator.
         b.   Following the legislative hearing, the Town Council may approve
the rezoning, deny the rezoning, or send the rezoning back to the Planning
Board for additional consideration.
         c.   Concurrently with adopting, denying, or remanding any rezoning,
the Town Council shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is
consistent or inconsistent with the adopted plans and polices of the Town and
explaining why the Town Council considers the action taken to be reasonable and
in the public interest. The requirement may also be met by a clear indication
in the minutes of the Town Council that the Town Council was aware of and
considered the planning board's recommendations and any relevant portions of
the comprehensive plan.
            (1)   If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was
deemed inconsistent with the plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect
of also amending any future land-use map in the approved plan, and no
additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required.
            (2)   A comprehensive plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be
considered concurrently.
            (3)   The comprehensive plan consistency statement is not subject
to judicial review.
            (4)   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale
rezoning" under G.S. 160D-602(b), the Council's statement describing plan
consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and
policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the action taken.
            (5)   Additional Reasonableness Statement for Rezonings. When
adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, a statement
analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be approved by the
Town Council. This statement of reasonableness may consider, among other
factors:
               (a)   The size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the
area proposed to be rezoned;
               (b)   The benefits and detriments to the landowners, the
neighbors, and the surrounding community;
               (c)   The relationship between the current actual and
permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development
that would be permissible under the proposed amendment;
               (d)   Why the action is taken is in the public interest; and
               (e)   Any changed conditions warranting the amendment.
               (f)   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale
rezoning" under G.S. 160D-602(b), the Town Council's statement on
reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.
            (6)   Single Statement Permissible. The statement of reasonableness
and the plan consistency statement required by this section may be approved as
a single statement.
3.19   Conditional zoning and planned unit development (PUD).
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/26ef4cebe88d67a45cebf4279d35ba49de2b6341/

conditional zoning district is equivalent to its corresponding general use
(base) zoning district, except as limited or expanded by the additional
conditions that the applicant and the Town mutually agree are necessary to
ensure compatibility between land uses, conformance to adopted plans, and/or
mitigation of expected development impacts.
         b.   Type 2 - Planned Unit Development (PUD). This zoning district is
similar to a Planned Development in that the uses and design guidelines are set
by the applicant and the Town with no direct correspondence to an existing
district. Conditions that the applicant and the Town mutually agree upon ensure
compatibility between land uses, conformance to adopted plans, and/or
mitigation of expected development impacts.
      4.   Applications for a conditional rezoning shall include all the land
area within a recorded lot or site that is the subject of the application.
Conditional rezoning applications may not establish split zoning
classifications where only a portion of a lot or site is subject to a
particular conditional zoning district classification.

conditional zoning, the Town Council shall find the Planned Development Master
Plan to comply with the general standards for planned development in this
section and the specific standards for the proposed planned development listed
below.
      2.   Planned Development Master Plan. The development proposed in the
Master Plan is compatible with the character of surrounding land uses and
maintains and enhances the value of surrounding properties. The Master Plan
shall be prepared by a professionally certified landscape architect, engineer
or architect.
      3.   Design Guidelines and Dimensional Standards. The planned development
shall provide a comprehensive set of design guidelines (lot areas, setbacks,
density, architectural features, etc.) that demonstrate the project will be
appropriate within the context of the surrounding properties and the larger
community. All bulk, area and dimensional standards shall be established by the
Town Council at the time of approval.
      4.   Development Standards. The development standards specified in
Section 5, shall apply, unless alternatives meeting the intensity and intent of
the regulations is proposed and accepted by the Town Council as a portion of
the Conditions.
      5.   Resource Conservation Areas.
         a.   No resource conservation area shall be counted towards the
requirements for minimum lot area.
         b.   Only fifty percent (50%) of the resource conservation area shall
be counted towards the recreation and open space requirements (see Subsection
6, below).
      6.   Recreation and Open Space. The planned development master plan shall
meet or exceed the recreation and open space requirements of Section
7.1.
      7.   Stormwater Management. The planned development master plan shall
contain a comprehensive stormwater management plan prepared by a professional
engineer licensed in the State of North Carolina.
      8.   Phasing. If development is proposed to occur in phases, the planned
development master plan shall include a phasing plan for the development, and
if appropriate, with specific build-out dates. Guarantees shall be provided
that project improvements and amenities that are necessary and desirable for
residents and tenants of the project, or that are of benefit to the Town, are
constructed with the first phase of the project, or, if this is not possible,
then as early in the project as is technically feasible.
      9.   Minimum Requirements. The minimum tract of land for rezoning is two
(2) contiguous acres.
      10.   Permitted Uses. The mix of uses shall be established by the Town
Council at the time of approval.
      11.   Project Boundary Buffer. A project boundary buffer shall be
provided. The width and planting requirements shall be determined in the Master
Plan.
   C.   Application Submittal and Review.
      1.   Conditional rezoning applications may only be initiated by the
landowner(s) of the land subject to the application, or their authorized
agents.
      2.   All conditions of approval proposed by the applicant must be
included with the conditional rezoning application.
      3.   Conditional rezoning applications shall include a site plan or
concept plan depicting the proposed development configuration that shall be
reviewed by the TRC prior to the public hearing.
      4.   Action by Administrator.
         a.   Upon submission of a completed application, the Administrator
shall schedule the conditional rezoning for review by the Technical Review
Committee. The Technical Review Committee shall review the conditional rezoning
for consistency with the requirements of this Ordinance.
         b.   Upon completion of the technical review for a conditional
rezoning, the Administrator shall prepare a report that reviews the application
in light of comments provided by the Technical Review Committee, in light of
the adopted plans and policies of the Town, and the general requirements of
this Ordinance. The report, site plan and any related application materials
shall be forwarded to the Planning Board.
      5.   Action by Planning Board.
         a.   The Planning Board shall make a recommendation on the application
to the Town Council. The Planning Board's recommendation shall include a
written statement to the Town Council describing whether its recommendation is
consistent with the adopted plans and policies of the Town, and reasonable and
in the public's interest. During its review of a conditional rezoning
application, the Planning Board may suggest revisions to the proposed
conditions (including the concept plan), consistent with the provisions of
Section
3.19.C.9, Conditions of Approval. Only those revisions agreed to in writing by
the applicant shall be incorporated into the application.
         b.   Following Planning Board review, the Administrator shall forward
the completed conditional rezoning request and any related materials, including
the Planning Board recommendation, to the Town Council for final action.
      6.   Action by Town Council.
         a.   Before taking action on a conditional rezoning, the Town Council
shall consider the recommendations of the Planning Board and Administrator.
         b.   After the conclusion of the Public Hearing, the Town Council may
approve the conditional rezoning as proposed, approve revised conditional
rezoning, deny the conditional rezoning, or send the conditional rezoning back
to the Planning Board for additional consideration.
         c.   Concurrently with adopting, denying, or remanding any rezoning,
the Town Council shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is
consistent with the adopted plans and policies of the Town and explaining why
the Town Council considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public
interest.
      7.   Designation of Official Zoning Map. The Administrator shall make
changes to the Official Zoning Map promptly after approval of a conditional
rezoning application by the Town Council.
      8.   Conditional Zoning Review Standards. The advisability of a
conditional zoning is a matter committed to the legislative discretion of the
Town Council and is not controlled by any one factor. In determining whether to
approve or deny a conditional zoning, the Town Council shall weigh the
relevance of and consider the following:
         a.   Whether the proposed conditional rezoning advances the public
health, safety, or welfare;
         b.   Whether and the extent to which the proposed conditional rezoning
is appropriate for its proposed location, and is consistent with the purposes,
goals, objectives, and policies of the Town's adopted policy guidance;
         c.   Whether an approval of the conditional rezoning is reasonable and
in the public interest;
         d.   Whether and the extent to which the concept plan associated with
the conditional rezoning is consistent with this ordinance; and
         e.   Any other factors as the Town Council may determine to be
relevant.
      9.   Conditions of Approval.
         a.   Only conditions mutually agreed to by the owner(s) of the
property that is the subject of a conditional zoning district designation and
the Town Council may be approved as part of a conditional rezoning application
establishing a conditional zoning district.
         b.   Conditions shall be limited to those that address conformance of
development and use of the site with Town regulations and adopted plans and
that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development
or use of the site.
         c.   Conditions shall be in writing and may be supplemented with text
or plans and maps.
         d.   Unless subject to an approved condition, all requirements of a
corresponding general zoning district shall apply to a conditional zoning
district.
      10.   Effect.
         a.   Lands subject to a conditional rezoning shall be subject to all
the standards, conditions, and plans approved as part of that application.
These standards, plans, and approved conditions are perpetually binding on the
land as an amendment to this ordinance and the Official Zoning Map and may only
be changed in accordance with the procedure for zoning map amendment,
conditional zoning, or planned development.
         b.   No permit or development approval shall be issued for development
subject to a conditional zoning district except in accordance with the approved
conditions and an accompanying conditional zoning plan (if submitted).

of the approval to assure that mitigation measures are associated with the use.
The conditions shall become part of the Special Use Permit approval and shall
be included in the final site plan application. However, the Board must not
impose conditions on special use permits that the Town does not otherwise have
the statutory authority to impose. Further, there must be written consent by
the applicant to the related conditions.
      3.   Findings of Fact. In addition to determining that the application
meets all other requirements of this ordinance, the Town Council must find the
following in order to grant approval of a Special Use Permit:

subsequent application for the same or similar use submitted by any party for
any part of the subject property until twelve (12) months have elapsed from the
date of denial. If the Town Council votes to approve an application, the permit
shall be recorded in the County Register of Deeds office.
      2.   The special use permit and additional conditions, if applicable,
shall run with the land and shall be binding on the original applicant as well
as any successors, assigns, and heirs. Any decision by the Town Council may be
appealed within thirty (30) days of the decision in accordance with G.S. 160D-
405.
   E.   Coordination with Rezoning. An application for a major special use
permit may be reviewed concurrently with a rezoning application. However, a
decision shall be rendered first for any rezoning and then subsequently for any
major special use permit.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)ÿ
3.22   Variance.

   The variance process administered by the Board of Adjustment is intended to
provide limited relief from the requirements of this ordinance in those cases
where strict application of a particular requirement will create a practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of the land in a manner
otherwise allowed under this ordinance. However, in no event shall the Board of
Adjustment grant a variance that would conflict with any state code, would
allow the establishment of use that is not otherwise allowed in a particular
zoning district, or which would change the zoning district classification or
the district boundary of the property in question.
   A.   Application Procedure. An application for a variance may be filed by
the owner of the property or by an agent specifically authorized by the owner
to file such an application. Staff shall review an application for a variance
to determine if it is complete. If an application is complete, the
Administrator or designated staff shall schedule the matter for consideration
at a meeting of the Board of Adjustment. The Administrator or designee shall
prepare a staff report regarding the submitted variance application.
   B.   Review Process.
      1.   Upon receipt of the request for a variance from the Administrator or
designee, the Board of Adjustment shall hold a public, evidentiary hearing on
the request.
      2.   After conducting the hearing and within forty-five (45) days, the
Board of Adjustment may: deny the application; conduct an additional public
hearing on the application; approve the application; or approve the application
with additional conditions. A concurring vote of four-fifths (4/5) of the
members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to grant a variance.
      3.   Conditions. In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may
attach such conditions to the approval as it deems necessary and appropriate to
satisfy the purposes and objectives of this ordinance. The Board of Adjustment
may also attach conditions in order to reduce or minimize any injurious effect
of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood and to ensure
compliance with other terms of this ordinance. Such conditions and safeguards
must be reasonably related to the condition or circumstance that gives rise to
the need for a variance.
      4.   Any approval or denial of the request shall be accompanied by
written findings of fact supporting the conclusion that the variance meets or
does not meet each of the standards set forth below in Subsection C.
    C.   Required Findings. The Board of Adjustment shall not grant a variance
unless and until it makes all of the following findings:
      1.   Carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the
absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
      2.   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability.
      3.   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant of
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with the knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
      4.   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of this ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial
justice is achieved.
      5.   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
the ordinance and preserves its spirit. That is, the applicant is not seeking
to establish, or expand, or extend a nonconforming use. Moreover, the existence
of a nonconforming use is the same or in any other zoning district shall not
constitute a reason for granting the requested variance.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
3.23   Administrative appeals.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/26ef4cebe88d67a45cebf4279d35ba49de2b6341/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2592.png]
   The following is established to provide an appeal process for parties
aggrieved by an order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the
Administrator or designee charged with enforcing the specific provision of the
ordinance.
   A.   Application Procedure. An appeal of an administrative decision may be
taken by any person who has standing under G.S. 160D-1402(c) or by the Town, to
the Board of Adjustment. Such an appeal shall be made within thirty (30) days
of the receipt of the written notice of decision from the Administrator or
designee, or of the filing of the written notice with the Town Clerk. If notice
is sent via first-class mail, it is deemed received on the third business day
following the deposit of the notice, for mailing with the United States Postal
Service. A complete application, as required by the Town of Surf City shall be
submitted for an appeal.
   B.   Stay of Proceedings. The filing of an appeal shall stay enforcement of
the action appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed during the length
time of the appeal to the board of adjustment and any subsequent appeal in
accordance with G.S. 160D-1402 or during the length of time of any civil
proceeding authorized by law or appeals therefrom unless the Administrator or
designee certifies that, in their opinion, by reason of facts stated in the
certification, such a stay would cause imminent peril to life and property. In
such a case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by restraining order or
preliminary injunction granted by the Superior Court of Pender County in
accordance with Rule 65 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
   C.   Required Appeal Application Information. Upon submission of a complete
application, containing such relevant information as may reasonably allow the
Board of Adjustment to understand the basis for the applicant's appeal, the
Administrator or designee shall similarly prepare a report detailing the
regulations and interpretation behind the matter being appealed and their
reason for their decision.
   D.   Review Process.
      1.   Upon receiving the application and being deemed complete, the
Administrator or designated staff for the Board of Adjustment shall schedule a
public, evidentiary hearing on the appeal. The applicant, the local government,
and any person who would have the standing to appeal the decision under G.S.
160D-1402(c) shall have the right to participate as a party at the evidentiary
hearing. Refer to Section 3.6 for hearing procedures.
      2.   After conducting the public hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall
adopt an order reversing or affirming, wholly or in part, or modifying the
order requirements, decision, or determination in question. It shall take a
simple majority vote of the Board of Adjustment to reverse or modify the
contested action.
      3.   The Board of Adjustment, in making its ruling, shall have all the
powers of the Administrator or designee from whom the appeal is taken, and may
issue or direct the issuance of a permit.
      4.   The decision of the Board of Adjustment must be in writing and
permanently filed in the minutes as a public record. All findings of fact and
conclusions of law must be separately stated in final decisions or orders of
the Board of Adjustment, which must be delivered to parties of interest by
certified mail.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
3.24   Modifications to development approvals.
   Occasionally, unanticipated circumstances require changes to approved
development plans and permits, including developer agreements and site-specific
vesting plans. In accordance with G.S.160D-403(d), the Town of Surf City allows
for minor modifications to be administratively approved, however, all major
modifications require the same procedures to be followed as were completed for
the original approval. This administrative flexibility reduces the need for a
full approval process to accommodate a limited change to the plans for a
project.
   A.   Major Modifications. Major Modifications are considered significant and
require an amendment. Amendments shall be reviewed and considered in accordance
with the procedures and standards established for the original approval.
      1.   Any change in land use.
      2.   Any increase in density.
      3.   Any decrease in the amount of open space.
      4.   When there is the introduction of a new vehicular access point to an
existing street, road, or thoroughfare not previously designated for access.
      5.   When the total floor area of a commercial or industrial
classification is increased more than ten percent (10%) beyond the total floor
area last approved by the Town Council.
      6.   A change in the type of proposed dwelling unit (e.g., Single-family
detached to Townhouse).
      7.   Change in location of any public easement.
      8.   When the number of existing trees to be preserved decreased more
than ten percent (10%) beyond the number of trees shown on the approved plans.
      9.   Any change that would increase traffic beyond the levels projected
in the approved Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA).
      10.   Any increase in the stormwater impact beyond what was identified in
the approved stormwater analysis for the project.
      11.   Any change which alters the basic development concept of the
approval.
      12.   Any net reduction in the area of a buffer or a reduction in the
width of more than twenty-five (25%) of the approved width.
      13.   A change in the number of approved phases of any development, or
any change in the phasing of proposed improvements, such as utilities,
roadways, open space, etc.
      14.   For developer agreements, any change in deadlines or completion
dates in excess of three (3) months.
   B.   Minor Modifications. The Administrator or designee is authorized to
review and approve administratively a minor modification to an approved Special
Use Permit, PUD, Conditional Zoning, Minor or Major Subdivision, Minor or Major
Site Plan, or Site-Specific Vesting Plan, subject to the following limitations.
      1.   General Limitations. The minor modification shall meet the
following:
         a.   Does not involve a change in the uses permitted or the density of
overall development permitted.
         b.   Does not increase the impacts generated by the development on
traffic, stormwater runoff, or similar impacts beyond what was projected for
the original development approval;
         c.   Does not qualify as a major modification; and,
         d.   Is in compliance with all other ordinance requirements.
      2.   Site Design. Site design minor modifications are limited adjustments
to the terms of the design of an approved development plan or plat, including a
site plan attached as a condition to conditional zoning or special use permit.
In addition to the general limitations for minor modifications, a site design
minor modification must:
         a.   Comply with underlying zoning standards and other applicable
conditions of the approval;
         b.   Be limited to a minor change such as, without limitation:
            (1)   Changes to the location of or the rearrangement of internal
streets, turn lanes, drives, or access restrictions;
            (2)   Changes to the configuration of parking areas, but not the
number of parking spaces, unless permitted by Subsection 3.a, below;
            (3)   Changes to the configuration or location of open space or
placement of required amenities, provided the amount of open space (whether
passive or active) is not decreased;
            (4)   Changes to the configuration of landscape yards, including
types of materials, provided minimum width and planting requirements remain;
            (5)   Changes to proposed building elevations or facades, including
materials, provided that the change retains the same general architectural
character and provided the development still complies with the applicable
design requirements;
            (6)   Changes to the arrangement or location of buildings provided
there is no increase in the number of buildings, size, or amount of impervious
surface.
      3.   Dimensional Standards. Dimensional standard minor modifications are
adjustments to the dimensional standards of the Land Use Code. Dimensional
standards may only be modified upon a finding by the Administrator or designee,
based on evidence from the permit holder, that the modification is needed to
address a site characteristic or technical design consideration not known at
the time of initial approval. In addition to the general limitations for minor
modifications, dimensional standard minor modifications are limited to:
         a.   An adjustment to parking requirements up to the greater of five
(5) spaces or ten percent (10%).
         b.   An adjustment to setback requirements up to greater than five (5)
feet or twenty-five percent (25%) of the standard setback.
         c.   An adjustment to landscape standards up to twenty percent (20%)
of required landscaping.
   C.   Procedure for Minor Modifications.
      1.   Preliminary Plat or Site Plan.
         a.   When minor revisions are proposed to an approved preliminary plat
or site plans, the applicant shall submit a written request to the
Administrator with a copy sent to the Technical Review Committee delineating
the revisions and requesting authorization for administrative revision.
            (1)   The Administrator shall notify the applicant whether the
proposed revision qualifies for minor modification and the basis for the
determination. If approved, the final plat may be submitted in accordance with
the revisions.
            (2)   The Administrator shall distribute copies of the revised plat
to the appropriate agencies.
      2.   Final Plat. When minor revisions are proposed to an approved final
plat, the applicant shall submit a written request to the Administrator with a
copy sent to the Technical Review Committee delineating the revisions and
requesting authorization for administrative revision.
         a.   If the plat has been recorded, the applicant shall submit the
recorded plat with a statement describing the revisions made and title block
for the Administrator signature, and date of signing.
         b.   If the ownership of the subdivision has changed or if any lots
have been sold since the previous recording, an owner's and notary's
certificates shall be provided on the plat for each current owner.
         c.   In addition to the letter and the revised final plat, the
applicant shall submit the required fees to the Administrator for processing
and rerecording the revised plat.
         d.   The Administrator shall distribute copies of the recorded final
plat to the appropriate agencies.
   D.   Appeals and Variances. A decision on a minor modification may be
appealed to the Board of Adjustment as an administrative determination. An
application for a minor modification does not preclude an applicant from
seeking a variance from the Board of Adjustment.
   E.   Individual Parcels within a Conditional Zoning District. For a
conditional zoning district applicable to multiple parcels, the owners of
individual parcels may apply for a minor modification or major amendment so
long as the change would not result in other properties failing to meet the
terms of the conditions. Any approved changes shall only be applicable to those
properties whose owners petitioned for the change.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
3.25   Nonconforming situations.
   Nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of
this ordinance may be continued, subject to the requirements outlined in this
subsection.
   A.   Nonconforming Lots. When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity
with all of the regulations (other than the area or width requirements)
applicable to the district in which the lot is located, such a use may be made
as of right. Otherwise, the nonconforming lot may be used only in accordance
with a special use permit issued by the board of adjustment. The board shall
issue such a permit if it finds that 1) the proposed use is one permitted by
the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located,
and 2) the property can be developed as proposed without any significant
negative impact on the surrounding property or the public health, safety, or
welfare. In issuing the permit authorized by this paragraph, the board may
allow deviations from applicable dimensional requirements (such as setback
lines and yard size minimums) if it finds that no reasonable use of the
property can be made without such deviations.
   B.   Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations.
      1.   Except as specifically provided in this subsection, it shall be
unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in
the extent of non-conformity of a nonconforming situation.
      2.   Unless otherwise stated in this subsection, a nonconforming use may
be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use
was made nonconforming by this ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged
to accommodate such use. However, subject to subsection 7.6 of this section
(authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain
circumstances), a non-conforming use may not be extended to additional
buildings or to land outside the original building.
      3.   Subject to subsection 7.6 of this section (authorizing the
completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a nonconforming
use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by
that use when it became nonconforming.
      4.   The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a
nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes
used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if
these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity
rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this
subsection occur.
      5.   Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures
on open land are unlawful if they result in:
         a.   An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a
nonconforming use;
         b.   Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions
such as yard requirements, height limitations, or density requirements; or
         c.   The enclosures of previously unenclosed areas, even though those
areas were previously used in connection with the nonconforming activity. An
area is unenclosed unless at least seventy-five (75) percent of the perimeter
of the area is marked by a permanently constructed wall or fence.
      6.   Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where
nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged.
      7.   Any structure used for single-family residential purposes and
maintained as a nonconforming use may be replaced with a similar structure of a
larger size, so long as the replacement does not create new non-conformities
with respect to yard size and setback requirements. In particular, a
manufactured home may be replaced with a larger manufactured home, and a
"single-wide" manufactured home may be replaced with a "double-wide."
      8.   A structure that is conforming in any respect or a structure that is
used in a nonconforming manner may be reconstructed or replaced if partially or
totally destroyed, subject to the following restrictions:
         a.   Such structure may be restored and occupancy or use allowed if
that structure is destroyed or damaged. In order to rebuild a nonconforming
structure the permits for repairs or rebuilding must be issued within 12
months;
         b.   The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use may not
be increased, except that a larger, single-family residential structure may be
constructed in place of a smaller one and a larger manufactured home intended
for residential use may replace a smaller one;
         c.   The reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with
respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements, height
limitations, or density requirements, and such dimensional nonconformity's must
be eliminated if that can reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening
the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming
use of such building;
         d.   The reconstructed building may not enclose areas that were
previously unenclosed, even though those areas were used in connection with the
nonconforming activity. An area is unenclosed unless at least seventy-five (75)
percent or more of the perimeter of the area is marked by a permanently
constructed wall or fence.
      9.   Manufactured homes in nonconforming manufactured home parks may not
be increased in number. Manufactured homes, when nonconforming, may not be
substituted for conforming types of dwelling units or other nonconforming
dwelling units.
   C.   Change in Nonconforming Use.
      1.   A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use. Thereafter,
the property may not revert to a nonconforming use.
      2.   Except as specifically provided in this subsection, it shall be
unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in
the extent of nonconforming situation.
      3.   The Administrator is authorized to approve an Administrative
Adjustment to allow a change from one or more nonconforming uses to one or more
nonconforming uses that are in the same use category or to another functionally
similar use, or to allow a modification or expansion to an existing
nonconforming use, provided that the proposed uses do not materially increase
the degree of nonconformity, and the uses will have no greater adverse impacts
on the surrounding area. To make this determination, the Administrator shall
consider, but is not limited to consider, all of the following:
         a.   Anticipated traffic of each use;
         b.   Parking requirements of each use;
         c.   Anticipated number of persons on the premises of each use at a
time of peak demand;
         d.   Hours of operation of each use;
         e.   Environmental impacts of each use; and
         f.   Off-site impacts of each use, such as sight distance, visibility,
lighting, noise, glare, dust, vibration, or smoke;
      4.   If the Administrator denies the Administrative Adjustment, the
Administrator must state, in writing, the reasons for the denial.
   D.   Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconforming Situations.
      1.   When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of
twelve (12) months, or discontinued for any period of time without a present
intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may
thereafter be used only for conforming purposes.
      2.   If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming use
exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of twelve (12) months or
discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming
that activity, then the property may thereafter be used only in conformity with
all of the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is
located.
      3.   For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a
nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this subsection, all of the
buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be
considered as a whole.
      4.   When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this ordinance
is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this ordinance, the twelve
(12) month period, for purposes of this subsection, begins to run at the
effective date of the ordinance.
   E.   Completion of Nonconforming Projects. The completion or erection of any
nonconforming project may be completed provided all construction is done
pursuant to a valid building permit issued prior to the effective date of this
ordinance.
   F.   Nonconformities Created by Public Action. When lot area or setbacks are
reduced as a result of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a
public purpose and the remaining area is at least seventy-five (75) percent of
the required minimum standard for the district in which it is located, then
that lot shall be deemed to be in compliance with the minimum lot size and
setback standards of this ordinance without the need for a variance from the
board of adjustment.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
3.26   Vested rights.
   A.   The zoning vested right is a right which is established pursuant to
G.S.160D-108 to undertake and complete the development and use of property
under the terms and conditions of an approved site-specific vesting plan.
Obtaining development approval through the vested rights precludes any action
by the Town of Surf City that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish,
or otherwise delay the development or use of the property allowed by the
applicable land development regulation or regulations. As such, amendments in
land development regulations are not applicable or enforceable without the
written consent of the owner with regard to any of the following:
      1.   Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development
permit application has been submitted and subsequently issued in accordance
with G.S. 143-755.
      2.   Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application
authorizing the subdivision have been submitted and subsequently issued in
accordance with G.S. 143-755.
      3.   A site-specific vesting plan pursuant to G.S. 160D-108.1 and
subsection H, below.
      4.   A multi-phased development pursuant to Subsection D.
      5.   A vested right established by the terms of a development agreement.
   B.   Duration of Vested Rights.
      1.   Upon issuance of a development permit, the vesting granted for a
development project is effective upon the filing of the application in
accordance with G.S. 143-755, for so long as the permit remains valid. Unless
otherwise specified, building permits expire after six (6) months and
development permits expire one (1) year after issuance unless work authorized
by the permit has substantially commenced.
       2.   Except where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or land
development regulation, the vesting granted expires for an uncompleted
development project if development work is intentionally and voluntarily
discontinued for a period of not less than twenty-four (24) consecutive months.
The vesting period for a nonconforming use of property expires if the use is
intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than
twenty-four (24) consecutive months.
   C.   Multiple Permits. Where multiple development permits are required to
complete a development project, the applicant may choose the version of each of
the Town's land development regulations applicable to the project, upon
submittal of the application for the initial development permit. This provision
is applicable only for those subsequent development permit applications filed
within eighteen (18) months of the date following the approval of an initial
permit.
   D.   Multi-Phased Developments. A multi-phased development is a development
containing over twenty-five (25) acres that are both submitted for development
approval to occur in more than one phase and subject to a master development
plan with committed elements showing the type and intensity of each phase.
      1.   A multi-phased development is vested for the entire development with
the land development regulations then in place at the time a site plan approval
is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development.
      2.   A right that has been vested as provided for herein remains vested
for a period of seven (7) years from the time a site plan approval is granted
for the initial phase of the multi-phased development.
   E.   Continuing Review. Following the issuance of a development permit, the
Town of Surf City may make subsequent inspections and reviews to ensure
compliance with the applicable land development regulations in effect at the
time of the original approval.
   F.   Process to Claim Vested Right. A person claiming a vested right may
submit information to the Administrator, who shall make an initial
determination as to the existence of the vested right. The decision of the
zoning administrator or officer may be appealed under G.S. 160D-405. On appeal,
the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking
such a determination or pursuing an appeal under G.S. 160D-405, a person
claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by G.S.
160D-1403.1.
   G.   Runs with the Land. Vested rights run with the land except for the use
of land for outdoor advertising governed by G.S. 136-136.1 and G.S. 136-131.2
in which case the rights granted by this section run with the owner of the
permit issued by the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
   H.   Site-Specific Vesting Plans.
      1.   A site-specific vesting plan consists of a plan submitted to the
Town in which the applicant requests vesting, describing with reasonable
certainty on the plan the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or
parcels of property. The development approvals listed below are determined by
the Town of Surf City to qualify as site-specific vesting plans.
         a.   Minor Subdivision Preliminary Plat.
         b.   Major Subdivision Preliminary Plat.
         c.   Minor Site Plan.
         d.   Major Site Plan.
         e.   Special Use Permit.
         f.   Planned Unit Development.
         g.   Conditional Zoning.
      2.   A vested right established pursuant to this ordinance shall run for
a period of two (2) years from the effective date of the approval of the
underlying development application.
      3.   Approval Process for a site-specific vesting plan.
         a.   Each site-specific vesting plan shall include the information
required by the Town Council and outlined in this Article for the underlying
type of development plan.
         b.   Each site-specific vesting plan shall provide the notice and
hearing required for the underlying type of development plan. If the vesting
plan is not based on such approval, a legislative hearing as required by
G.S.160D-602 shall be held.
         c.   The Town of Surf City may approve a site-specific vesting plan
upon any terms and conditions that may reasonably be necessary to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare.
         d.   A site-specific vesting plan is deemed approved upon the
effective date of the Town Council's decision approving the plan.
         e.   An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be
amended with the approval of the owner and the local government in the same
manner as required for the underlying type of development plan. Minor
modifications may be approved administratively in accordance with Section 3.24.
      4.   Duration and Termination of a Vested Right.
         a.   A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan remains valid for
two (2) years. Upon following the same process as required for the original
approval, the Town Council or the Administrator may extend the vesting of a
site-specific vesting plan up to three (3) years (with a total length of
vesting not to exceed five (5) years) upon finding that:
            (1)   The permit has not yet expired;
            (2)   Conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a
new application; and,
            (3)   The extension is warranted in light of all other relevant

development or use of the property as set forth in an approved site-specific
vesting plan, except under the following conditions outlined in G.S.
160D.108.1.
         b.   The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the

the rule or ordinance will apply to the permit and use of the building,
structure, or land indicated on the permit application if a land development
regulation is amended between the time the application was submitted and the
permit decision is made or if a land development regulation is amended after a
development permit decision has been challenged and found to be wrongfully
denied or illegal.
   A.   When a development required multiple permits under the development
regulations of this ordinance, the applicant may choose the regulations
applicable to the project at the time of their initial permit application. The
applicant must submit the subsequent applications within eighteen (18) months
of approval of the initial permit in order to claim permit choice.

under G.S. 160D-404, development approvals may be revoked by the Town by
notifying the holder in writing stating the reason for the revocation. The Town
shall follow the same development review and approval process required for
issuance of the development approval, including any required notice or hearing,
in the review and approval of any revocation of that approval. Development

altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or
land is used or developed in violation of this ordinance or of any development
regulation, the Town may take appropriate action or proceedings.
      1.   No civil penalty shall be assessed under this Section until a Notice
of Violation has been issued to the responsible party as provided above. If
after receiving a Notice of Violation the responsible party fails to correct
the violation, a civil penalty shall be imposed in the form of a citation. Such
citation shall be in writing and shall be delivered by certified or registered
mail to the holder of the development approval and to the owner of the property
involved (if that person is not the holder of the development approval), by
personal service, or by conspicuously posting on the property. The citation
shall state the civil penalty fee and shall direct the violator to pay the
civil penalty within ten (10) business days of the date of issuance. Failure to
pay the civil penalty shall subject the responsible party, in addition to other
remedies, to the payment of reasonable attorney's fees, including the principal
amount of the penalty and interest accruing thereon.
      2.   Upon expiration of the time limit set forth by the Administrator in
the Notice of Violation, Civil Penalties as set by the Town of Surf City fee
schedule shall be assessed per violation. Assessment of a civil penalty and
payment of that penalty does not negate the responsible party from correcting
the violation. Civil penalties paid within ten (10) business days shall be
reduced by fifty (50%) percent if the violation has been corrected.
      3.   Civil penalties assessed for violations of this Article shall
constitute a lien against the property upon which the violation is or has been
conducted.
      4.   Notwithstanding any other remedies of civil penalties imposed for
violations of this Article, in the event that the Town files suit to enforce
any section of this Article and prevails in such suit, the entity found to be
in violation shall be responsible for reasonable attorney's fees expended by
the Town to enforce such ordinance.
   F.   Penalties for Transferring Lots in an Unapproved Subdivision. The
following penalties as set forth in the General Statutes shall also prevail:
G.S. 160D-807, "Penalties for Transferring Lots in Unapproved Subdivisions; any
person who, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within
the jurisdiction of that city, thereafter subdivides his land in violation of
the ordinance or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of, or any
other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been
properly approved under such ordinance and recorded in the office of the
appropriate register of deeds, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The
description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document
used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the
transaction from this penalty. The Town may bring an action for injunction of
any illegal subdivision, transfer, conveyance, or sale of land, and the court
shall, upon appropriate findings, issue an injunction and order requiring the
offending party to comply with the subdivision ordinance."
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
SECTION 4.0 ZONING DISTRICTS AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
4.1   Establishment of zoning districts.
   In order to achieve the purpose of this ordinance and for the purposes of

established as a district in which the principal use of land is for residential
development. The regulations of this district permit developments provided the
necessary public and/or community water and adequate sewage disposal facilities
are available, while protecting open space and the natural environment.
         g.   R-5M Residential Manufactured Home District. The R-5M Residential
Manufactured Home District is established as a residential district in which
the principal use of land is for single-family homes, manufactured homes,
manufactured home parks, tiny home communities, and recreational vehicles. The
regulations of this district permit intensive development provided Special
Flood Hazard Areas are not present and the necessary public water and sewer
services are available.
      3.   Non-Residential Districts.
         a.   O&I Office and Institutional. The Office and Institutional
District are established as a district to serve as a transitional zone between
residential and nonresidential uses. The regulations of this district permit
intensive development provided the necessary public water and sewer services
are available.
         b.   NB Neighborhood Business. The Neighborhood Business District is
established as a district to serve the adjoining residential uses in a small
scaled commercial matter to provide convenience to the residential community.
         c.   C-1 Central Business District. The Central Business District is
intended to protect and promote suitable areas for business and commercial uses
on the island which benefit from proximity to each other, promote walkability,
including a variety of sales and service facilities for the general public, and
to encourage the intense development of a centralized business center on the
island in Surf City.
         d.   C-3 Extended Commercial. The Extended Commercial District is to
provide for commercial uses which are suitable, practical, and appropriate for
the mainland area of Surf City and the ETJ. Its regulations are designed to: 1)
encourage a continuity of uses along the main thoroughfare onto the island; 2)
enhance the landscaping and viewsheds of the Town; 3) provide an attractive and
robust commercial district; and 4) limit access points on NC 50/210 to preserve
the transportation capacity of the highway.
          e.   G-1 Government District. In order to establish a zoning district
to provide the proper location and setting for governmental operation,
structures, and equipment necessary for providing public services and the
maintenance of public health and well-being, the Town Council has established
the zoning district in this division and referenced as the government zone.
         f.   I Industrial District. The Industrial (I) Zoning district is
established to support the heavy commercial, flex, and industrial uses. The I
district implements the industrial future land uses in the comprehensive plan
and can only be implemented via a zoning map amendment. It is intended that
industrial uses are permitted and encouraged when adequate transportation and
utilities are provided and the required protections from coastal ecosystems and
incompatible land uses are implemented.
   B.   Mixed Use District MU - Mixed Use. The MU District is established to
provide and protect areas suitable for a mixture of uses providing high density
residential opportunities near or vertically-mixed with retail goods, services,
lodging, tourist services, and entertainment. The Mixed-Use District encourages
the coordinated and contextual development town's major roads to ensure
properly designed and common methods of ingress and egress while providing for
safe and adequate traffic flow.
   C.   Character Overlay District. CFOD - Coastal Forest Overlay District. The
purpose of this district is to preserve and protect the remaining maritime
forests and natural vegetation located in the most vulnerable natural areas.
Maritime forests and vegetated areas are recognized as essential to Topsail
Island's eco-system. They provide wildlife habitat, stabilization of soil and
sand, and are a vital link in natural storm water management through
absorption. This natural management acts as a filter necessary to maintaining
the health and quality of pristine waters. The Coastal Forest Overlay District
shall apply to all properties on Topsail Island as well as all properties
adjacent to coastal waters and marshes.
   D.   Conditional Zoning Districts. Conditional Zoning Districts allow a
landowner to propose, and the Planning Board and Town Board of Commissioners to
consider, additional conditions or restrictions to the range of allowable uses,
use standards, development intensities, development standards, and other
regulations specific to the site.
      1.   Type 1, CZ. Base District Conditional Zoning. The CZ Conditional
Zoning District is intended to provide a landowner and the Town an alternative
to a general zoning district. A general zoning district only allows certain
uses and development where conditional zoning allows uses and development that
may not conform to adopted policy guidance and otherwise may have adverse
impacts on public facilities or surrounding lands. This type of Conditional
Zoning enables the Town and the landowner to tailor an existing zoning
classification to accommodate desirable development and provide conditions that
could mitigate any negative effects.
      2.   Type 2, PUD Planned Unit Development. The PUD District is intended
to achieve innovative site design and land development by encouraging
flexibility and creativity while achieving the purposes outlined in this zoning
ordinance. A variety of uses is encouraged within a Planned Development
District provided appropriate setbacks, buffers, landscaping, open space,
connectivity, and architectural standards are woven into the design of the
project. This type of district enables the Town and the landowner to create the
guiding document and associated plan for an inspirational development that
would otherwise be unable to be established by the strict prescribed standards
of this ordinance.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
4.2   Interpretation of district boundaries.
   A.   Provision for the Official Zoning Map. The Town of Surf City is hereby

together with all explanatory matters thereon, is hereby adopted by reference
and declared to be a part of this ordinance. The official zoning map shall be
identified by the signature of the mayor of the town attested by the Town Clerk
and bearing the seal of the Town. No changes of any nature shall be made on the
official zoning map or matter shall thereon except in conformity with the
procedures set forth in this ordinance. Regardless of the existence of copies
of the official zoning map which may, from time to time, be made or published,
the official Zoning Map located in the Town Planner's office shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings,
and other structures in the town. The current Zoning Map, and prior adopted
maps, must be available for public inspection and may be in paper or a digital
format.
   B.   Replacement of Official Zoning Map. In the event that the official
Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because
of the nature or number of changes and additions the Town Council may, by
resolution, adopt a new official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior
official zoning map. The new Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors or
omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have
the effect of amending the original official Zoning Map. The new official
Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor of the Town
attested by the Town Clerk and bearing the seal of the town. Unless the prior
official Zoning Map has been lost, or has been destroyed, the prior map or any
significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved, together with all
available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.
   C.   Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty
exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map,
the following rules shall apply:
      1.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets or highways, shall be construed to follow such centerlines;
      2.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the right-of-way of
streets or highways, shall be construed to follow such right- of-way;
      3.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines;
      4.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following town limits shall be
construed as following such town limits;
      5.   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or
other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines;
      6.   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances
not covered by subsections 1. through 5. above, the Board of Adjustment shall
interpret the district boundaries.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
4.3   One principal use or building per lot.
   Lots are intended to have one principal use or building, unless part of a

conditional zoning; or a mixed-use development. All lots containing more than
one principal building or use shall conform to the requirements in Section 5.3,
Complexes.
4.4   Measurements and standards.
   A.   General. No lot, even though it may consist of one (1) or more adjacent

requirements of the underlying zoning district not specified within the CFOD
shall also apply. In the event of a conflict between the underlying zoning
district and the CFOD, the more stringent shall apply. All CFOD requirements
shall apply to new and existing lots.
   B.   Dimensional Requirements. All existing natural areas and topography
shall be preserved outside of the building setbacks; septic systems, water
supply wells, fencing, stormwater systems, and driveway(s) are exempt.
   C.   Design Standards. Development shall be designed to protect the
continuing growth of the undisturbed area. In doing so, the following
requirements shall be met:
      1.   The maximum total frontage for driveways is 24 feet of width at the
street.
      2.   Driveway design shall be shown on a submitted grading plan prepared
by a licensed professional which demonstrates minimal land disturbance.
      3.   The amount of fill added to a lot shall not be greater than two feet
above the crown of the highest adjoining street or access easement. However, an
additional one foot of fill, not to exceed a maximum of three feet above the
crown of the highest adjoining street or access easement, may be added provided
it is demonstrated through an engineering analysis that the proposed fill would
not result in any increase in the base flood elevation and not cause any
adverse impacts by wave ramping or deflection to the subject structure or
adjacent properties.
      4.   Fill material must be similar and consistent with the natural soils
in the area or proven by a licensed engineer to be an improved soil type.
      5.   All fill must be contained on-site by either a retaining wall or
sloped no steeper than 3:1 with the fill tying to the existing grade prior to

      6.   Retaining walls shall not exceed four (4) feet in height unless a
certification letter is submitted by a licensed professional engineer stating
compliance with state building code requirements.
      7.   Fill that is necessary to meet any county environmental health
department or town/NCDEQ stormwater permit requirement may exceed the fill
limit. In which case, fill shall only be allowed to the minimum extent
necessary to obtain a permit.
      8.   If the lot is graded so that the storm water flows towards a street
or access easement, an engineered stormwater system such as a swale,
bioretention area, or other approved apparatus must be installed adjacent to
the right of way to treat a 1.5-inch rain event in 24 hours.
      9.   If any fill is placed on a lot, sediment and erosion control
measures must be installed to maintain all sediment within the lot limits. This
includes but is not limited to properly installed silt fence in accordance with
the NCDEQ Erosion and Sediment Control Planning and Design Manual.
      10.   The area of disturbance shall be limited to the area of a lot
contained within the front, rear, and side setbacks of the underlying

      16.   Pervious materials shall be used for the construction of any
surfaces located outside the footprint of the principal structure and any
accessory buildings allowed. (Commercial development and roads are exempt from
this requirement). Pervious materials are, but not limited to, pervious
concrete, pervious asphalt, slate gravel, river rock, slatted wood and other
similar materials or products designed to allow water to pass through. Crusher
run and ABC stone are examples of impervious materials.
         a.   Concrete or other impervious material may be used for the
purposes of pool borders consistent with current CAMA Standards so long as it
does not exceed the overall lot coverage percentage allowed in the underlying
zoning district.
      17.   Setbacks shall be delineated physically on the lot for site
inspection purposes.
      18.   If existing impervious surfaces outside of the footprint of the
principal structure and any accessory buildings are modified by more than
twenty percent (20%), pervious material shall be used.
      19.   When placing new stone over existing stone driveways, pervious
material shall be used.
   D.   Grading Plan Requirements. Zoning permits shall be accompanied by a
scaled grading plan depicting elevation changes prepared by a licensed
surveyor, landscape architect, or professional engineer. A scaled grading plan
is not required when fill is not proposed in excess of four inches. However, a
sketch shall be submitted to depict areas of proposed fill, grading, and
excavation.
   E.   Site Plan Requirements. Prior to the development of a lot, an applicant
must submit a site plan to the community development department for review and
approval. Developing building sites in the CFOD requires maximal preservation
of trees and vegetation. The site plan shall show the following:
      1.   All requirements for a building permit application.
      2.   All trees in the setbacks greater or equal to three (3) inches in
diameter measured four (4) feet from the ground.

grading will occur.
   F.   Enforcement.
      1.   Trees removed, other than those permitted under this ordinance,
shall be replaced by a quantity of trees totaling the diameter of the tree
removed (i.e.: three 2-inch trees may replace one 6" tree). Replacement trees
are not to be less than two (2) inches in diameter. All replacement plants
shall be native species as identified in
Appendix A, Recommended Planting Table.
      2.   Replacement trees shall be located on the site of the violation. If
the number of replanted trees becomes unhealthy to the trees as determined by
staff on the lot in violation; remaining trees shall be used for offsite
restoration projects within the jurisdiction of the town. If trees are removed
from the island, a portion of the mitigation trees may be considered for off-
site planting on Topsail Island so long as a plan is submitted detailing the
location of mitigated trees, along with an agreement from all property owners
involved.
      3.   Any lot cleared prior to submitting a site plan shall be assessed a
penalty of one (1) tree per foot of road frontage. For example, a 50-foot lot
would require fifty (50) trees for replacement.

      1.   The standards in this section shall apply to development on lots
abutting canals or waterways within the Town's planning jurisdiction that are
or could be subject to significant erosion, as determined by the Administrator
or their designee.
      2.   For the purposes of these standards, significant erosion means
erosion resulting in the loss of six (6) or more inches of shoreline per year.
   C.   Standards.
      1.   No building permit shall be issued for development upon any land
subject to these standards until the landowner has taken the necessary steps to
stabilize the land and prevent further significant erosion. Stabilization of
the shoreline may be accomplished by the installation of any of the following:
         a.   Bulkheads;
         b.   Sloping rip-rap;
         c.   Gabions;
         d.   Living Shoreline;
         e.   Vegetation; or

be a violation of this ordinance in accordance with
Section 3.28, Enforcement.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
SECTION 7.0 DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTURE STANDARDS
7.1   Open space and recreation standards.
   A.   Purpose. Recreation and open space are an integral part of every
community. The purpose of this section is to require open space for the
preservation of natural features, adding character and amenities to new
residential development, and provide active and passive recreational
opportunities for the residents of Surf City.
   B.   Applicability.
      1.   The open space and recreation requirements of this section are
applicable to all new, mainland residential development of five units or more,
requiring the submission of a major subdivision plat or site plan.
      2.   Exemptions. The following development shall not be subject to the
provision of open space and recreational facilities unless otherwise required
by this ordinance:
         a.   Expedited and Minor subdivisions (see Articles II.G and H of the
Subdivision Ordinance).
         b.   Residential infill development or individual residential
dwellings not part of a subdivision, site plan, special use, or conditional
rezoning.
         c.   Residential development on island, however sound and/or ocean
access may be required.
   C.   Minimum Requirements. All new residential developments meeting the
requirements of Section B shall be required to set aside open space equal to
0.03 acres (1,306.8 square feet) per dwelling unit.
   D.   Provision of Open Space.
      1.   Open Space shall not include more than fifty (50) percent of
resource conservation areas as defined in Section 6.0, Environmental and
Coastal Protection.
      2.   No open space within a subdivision may be placed on an individually
subdivided lot, intended for residential use.
      3.   The land dedicated under this ordinance, or any provisions made
under this ordinance shall be used only for the purpose of providing open
space, parks or recreation areas and the location of the land shall bear a
reasonable relationship to the use of the area by the future inhabitants of the
subdivision or development.
      4.   The land reserved for the provision of open space shall be located
either on the subject site or may be provided in another location on the
recommendation of the Planning Board and the approval of the Town Council. A
fee-in-lieu of the provision of recreation area required may be made and shall
be provided at a rate determined appropriate by the Town. A combination of
dedication and payment-in-lieu may be used to meet these requirements.
      5.   The applicant is required to either dedicate the land for recreation
and/or open space use to the Town or provide private space and/or facilities
for the use of residents or patrons of the development. The Town Council
reserves the right to refuse to accept dedication of open space for
subdivisions.
         a.   The location of the proposed recreation and open space areas,
their suitability for recreational use, and any recreational plans adopted by
the Town shall be considered in determining whether to accept dedication,
payment-in-lieu, or require private responsibility. The decision shall be made
by the Town Council or Administrator.
         b.   If the Board refuses the dedication or if a private open space or
recreation facilities are proposed, the applicant shall provide information
related to the ownership and responsibility of the open space, such as the
property owner, a Homeowners Association or Land Conservancy or Trust, in
accordance with this section and shall record a declaration of covenants and
restrictions that will govern the open space.
         c.   If the Board accepts dedication, the land received under this
ordinance shall be used only for the purpose of providing open space, park and/
or recreational areas, but shall not be so restricted should the Town determine
to sell such land as provided by this paragraph. The Town shall have the right
to sell any land dedicated to the Town for park and recreational purposes after
a finding by the Planning Board that a particular piece of property is not
appropriate for recreational development or incompatible with the Surf City
Land Use Plan. The sale of said property shall be restricted to be used as is
adjacent property. Fees collected in lieu of dedications and any proceeds from
such transactions or sales shall be held in a special fund by the Town. The
funds shall be used by the Town for the purpose of acquiring and developing
open space and recreation areas and for no other purposes. The depository for
such funds may be the same as permitted other funds of the Town and pending
their expenditure in accordance with the terms of this act, such funds may be
invested as other funds of the Town. The Town may at its discretion add
additional monies to the fund for the purposes of purchasing open space and
recreational land. On all matters not specifically provided for in this
ordinance, the Municipal Fiscal Control Act, as amended, shall be controlling.
   E.   Recreation Required. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of all required
open space shall be dedicated and designed to allow for programmed recreational
features. For example, a fifty (50) acre residential development requires, at
minimum, five (5) acres of land dedicated to open space. Of those five (5)
acres, a minimum fifty (50) percent (e.g., 2.5 acres) shall be dedicated for
recreation.
      1.   Recreation features must include active recreation.
      2.   Programming of spaces must be indicated on the plans at the time of
submittal.
      3.   Active Recreation may include but is not limited to the following:

   F.   Configuration of Open Space.
      1.   The minimum width for any required open space shall be fifty (50)
feet. Exceptions may be granted by the Town Board of Commissioners for items
such as trail easements, mid-block crossings, linear parks/medians, when their
purpose meets the intent of this section.
      2.   At least fifty percent (50%) of the required open space shall be in
a contiguous parcel. For the purposes of this section, contiguous shall include
any recreation and open space bisected by a residential street or driveway,
provided that:
         a.   A pedestrian crosswalk is constructed to provide access to the
recreation and open space on both sides of the street or sidewalk; and
         b.   The right-of-way area is not included in the calculation of
minimum recreation and open space required. The recreation and open space shall
adjoin any neighboring areas of recreation and open space, other protected
areas, and non-protected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion
as part of a future area of protected recreation and open space.
      3.   In residential areas, the required recreation and open space shall
be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of units within the
development. Non-adjoining units shall be provided with safe, convenient access
to the open space (i.e., mid-block connections in logical locations). No unit
within the development should be further than a quarter mile radius from the
required recreation and open space. This radius shall be measured in a straight
line, without regard for street, sidewalk, or trail connections to the open
space.
      4.   Access to the recreation and open space shall be provided either by
an abutting street, parking areas, or easement.
      5.   Slope on areas dedicated for recreation shall not exceed five (5)
percent.
      6.   In the case that a development or subdivision is being developed in
phases, the amount of recreation and open space shall be computed separately
for each phase but may be combined with existing recreation and open space in
earlier phases to create a larger uniform area.
      7.   In no case shall the provision of open space or recreation areas be
on an individual, subdivided lot developed as a residential unit within a
residential subdivision.
   G.   Adopted Municipal and County Plans. Adopted municipal and county plans
shall be taken into consideration when evaluating land proposals.
   H.   Prohibited Uses of Recreation and Open Space. Recreation and Open space

being disposed, or if the association is dissolved, adequate open space shall
be deeded to the Town to satisfy the requirements for public recreation
facilities under this article.
         d.   Private landowner. A private landowner may retain ownership of
recreation and open space. The responsibility for maintaining the recreation
and open space, and any facilities shall be borne by the private landowner.
This is not intended for individual homeowners in a residential subdivision.
      2.   Maintenance.
         a.   Passive recreation and open space maintenance is limited to
removal of litter, dead tree and plant materials (that is obstructing
pedestrian movement), and brush; weeding and mowing. Natural water courses are
to be maintained as free-flowing and devoid of debris. Stream channels shall be
maintained so as not to alter floodplain levels.
          b.   Active recreation and open space areas shall be accessible to
all residents of the development. Maintenance is limited to ensuring that there
exist no hazards, nuisances or unhealthy conditions.
   J.   Legal Instrument for Permanent Protection.

binding legal instrument that is recorded with the deed. The instrument shall
be one (1) of the following:
         a.   A permanent conservation easement in favor of either:
            (1)   A land trust or similar conservation-oriented non-profit
organization with legal authority to accept such easements. The organization
shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments
shall contain an appropriate provision for re-transfer in the event the
organization becomes unable to carry out its functions; or
            (2)   A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals
compatible with the purposes of this chapter. If the entity accepting the
easement is not the Town, then a third right of enforcement favoring the Town
shall be included in the easement.
         b.   A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in
favor of a governmental entity or property owner's association
         c.   An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent protection, if
approved by the Town.
      2.   The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear
restrictions on the use of recreation and open space. These restrictions shall
include all restrictions contained in this chapter, as well as any further
restrictions the applicant chooses to place on the use of the recreation and
open space. Where appropriate, the instrument shall allow for stream or habitat
restoration within the easement area.
      3.   Documentation of covenants, conditions, and restrictions; easements
descriptions; and other required instruments shall be submitted to the Town for
review by the Town's Administrator and attorney.
   K.   Fee in Lieu of Open Space Dedication.
      1.   Any person developing and/or subdividing property subject to this
Chapter, upon approval of the Town Council, may make a payment in lieu of any
required dedication of open space land.
      2.   Value Determination.
         a.   Payment in lieu of dedication shall be the product of the average
post-development appraised value per acre of the land within the development
multiplied by the number of acres required to be dedicated: as shown in the
following formula and as described in subsection b. and subsection c. below:
         b.   Average Post Development Appraised Per Acre Value of Entire
Development x (Required Open Space Dedication) = Payment in Lieu Dedication
Fee.
         c.   The Average Post Development Appraised Value per acre of the
Entire Development shall be established by an appraiser at the applicant's
expense. The appraiser shall be a member in good standing of the American
Institute of Real Estate Appraisers.
         d.   Any disagreement in the amount of the required payment shall be
resolved by conducting a second professional appraisal of the fair market value
of the property. Another professional appraiser shall be mutually agreed upon
by the developer and Town. This appraiser shall be appointed by the Town, at
the developer's expense, should an initial agreement not be reached.
      3.   The Town Council may, at its discretion, accept either an equitable
amount of land in another location or a fee paid to the Town in lieu of
dedication. A combination of open space land dedication and payments-in-lieu of
dedication may be permitted.
      4.   All open space land dedication payments made in lieu of dedication
shall be made at the time of Final Plat approval. Failure to make such
dedication and/or submit the required fee along with such applications will
delay approval of such submissions until payment is rendered. All funds
received for payment in lieu of dedication shall be deposited in a special fund
or line item to be used only for the acquisition, development, management and/
or redevelopment of public open space by the Town.
      5.   Reasons for payments in lieu of dedication may include, but are not
limited to, proximity to existing public parks and/or existing topographic or
geographic conditions.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
7.2   Greenway standards.
   A.   General. Consistent with adopted Comprehensive Plan and the adopted
Surf City Multi-Use Path Map, the Town of Surf City intends to support and
promote the provision of greenways in the Town as a portion of the larger
pedestrian network. Greenways preserve and create open space, encourage
physical fitness, provide alternative means of transportation, create
opportunities for outdoor recreation, and provide connectivity between open
spaces, schools, cultural sites, neighborhoods, and the beach. Where land is
designated as part of the town's adopted greenway system, development shall
comply with the town's adopted plans and include the creation of new greenway
trails. New development may also provide additional greenways and/or
connections to greenways in accordance with the standards of this section.
   B.   Applicability. Greenway requirements of this section are applicable to
all properties with frontage onto the Surf City Multi Use Path as identified on
the adopted Surf City Multi-Use Path Map.
   C.   Greenways may be credited against the requirements of
Section. 7.1 Open Space and Recreation provided that such greenways are:
      1.   A part of the Surf City Multi-Use Path.
      2.   Dedicated to public use and located within a 20' public greenway
easement located across HOA- owned/maintained land (easement cannot be located
within individual residential lots).
      3.   Built to meet public greenway standards per the Town of Surf City's
Standard Specifications and Standard Details.
   D.   Residential developments adjacent to planned/existing public greenways
shall provide one (1) or more dedicated public greenway connection(s) from a
public sidewalk/public multi-use path within the development to the planned/
existing public greenway shown on the adopted Surf City Multi-Use Path Map;
such greenway connections may be credited against the requirements of
Section. 7.1 provided that these greenway connections meet the standards of
this ordinance.

            (2)   Timbering and Silviculture. Normal forestry activity on
forestland that is taxed on the basis of its present use value as forestland
under G.S. Chapter 105, Article 12 or that is conducted in accordance with a
forest management plan that is prepared or approved by a forester registered in
accordance with G.S. Chapter 89B shall be exempt from the tree protection
provisions of this Chapter.
               (a)   Timbering and forestry practices shall not be used to
circumvent the requirements of this Chapter.
               (b)   Clear cutting of a site in a manner not consistent with
the requirements of
Section 7.3, is prohibited.
               (c)   If one of the forestry exemptions in subsection b. above,
is used to remove all or some of the trees that would have been protected by
this section, no application for development shall be accepted for improvement
of the land for a period of three (3) years after completion of the forestry
activity, pursuant to G.S. 160D-921(c)(1)(a).
               (d)   If one of the forestry exemptions in subsection b. above,
is not met and some or all of the trees that would have been protected by this
section are willfully removed, no application for development shall be accepted
for improvement of the land for a period of up to five (5) years after
completion of the forestry activity or site clearing and/or grading, pursuant
to G.S. 160D-921(c)(1)(b).
               (e)   In the event an application is submitted for an exempted
development, cleared, but then converted to a development subject to the
requirements of this Chapter, approval of the converted application shall be
delayed for a period of up to five (5) years after the completion of the
forestry activity or site clearing and/or grading, pursuant to G.S. 160D-921(c)
(1)(b).
      3.   Compliance with Landscaping Standards Required. All preservation,
replacement, and mitigation shall be in compliance with the landscaping
standards of
Section 7.4.
   B.   Preservation Standards.
      1.   Design Considerations.
         a.   When designing any site, careful consideration shall be taken
regarding the preservation and long-term survival of environmental resources,
specifically existing trees. Sites should be designed with the intention of
preserving significant trees and utilizing them as existing vegetation to meet
the landscape requirements of this Chapter. Significant trees, those healthy
and larger than 12" DBH, are an invaluable resource to the community as they
provide significantly more benefits related to air quality, water quality,
erosion prevention, etc. than newly planted trees. When designating trees to be
preserved, the applicant shall incorporate as many significant trees as
possible into a contiguous canopy, understanding that wherever possible, all
healthy trees over 24" should be preserved and approval will be required for
their removal.
         b.   Understanding that construction and the removal of trees can
easily damage trees that are slated to remain, the location of tree protection
zones should be considered when designing the site.
         c.   The design of new landscaping should evenly place vegetation
throughout the landscaped area but may be staggered or clustered as necessary
to maximize visual and screening objectives, and to meet the needs of the
particular species of plants for root space, water, light, and air circulation.
         d.   When designing roadways and lot placement, consideration should
be given to the location of street trees. If they are to be located within the
public right-of-way, potential conflicts with on-street parking, utilities,
streetlights, sidewalks, driveways and intersections, and bicycle facilities,
should be avoided.
      2.   Tree Survey Required.
         a.   A significant tree survey shall be required for all sites over ½
acre to be developed where a landscape plan is also required. The significant
tree survey shall show the general location, species, and size of any tree
deemed significant by the Town.
         b.   For tracts of land exceeding five (5) acres in size, a
generalized sample survey may be performed in lieu of significant tree survey.
All generalized surveys of tracts exceeding five (5) acres are required to show
a minimum 1-acre sample size that includes the general location, species, and
size of any tree deemed significant by the town.
      3.   Significant Trees. Significant Trees, as identified by the Town are
as follows:
         a.   A live oak (Quercus virginiana) with a trunk caliper measurement
of 6" or greater when measured at 4.5 feet above the ground (or 6" dbh,
diameter at breast height).
         b.   Any live oak that was planted under a previously approved
significant tree mitigation plan under this ordinance, regardless of its size.
         c.   Any of the following healthy trees with an 18" dbh or greater:
            (1)   Willow Oak (Quercus phellos).
            (2)   River Birch (Betula nigra).
            (3)   Red Maple (Acer rubrum).
            (4)   Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora).
         d.   Any of the following healthy shrubs at a height of 10' or 5' in
width or greater:
            (1)   Wax Myrtle (Myrica cerifera).
      4.   Existing Vegetation. The use of existing trees or shrubs to satisfy
the landscaping requirements of this Chapter is strongly encouraged. Existing
significant vegetation within a landscaped area required by this Chapter (such
as a buffer) or significant vegetation over 24" DBH located anywhere on the
site shall be preserved unless otherwise approved by the Town of Surf City at
the time of land development approval and shall be credited toward the
applicable standard.
      5.   Design Incentives for Preservation of Significant Trees.
         a.   Where existing vegetation is preserved in an area where
landscaping is otherwise required, the applicant shall receive credit against
the requirements of this ordinance (eg. landscaping in parking lots, buffer
plantings, etc.)
         b.   Where significant trees are designated on the plans for a
development application to be preserved in areas outside a Resource
Conservation Area (RCA), the Administrator may review and approve an
administrative adjustment for the following:
            (1)   Open space. Where open space is required and a significant
tree is slated for preservation in an area not already required for landscaping
or preservation (eg. perimeter buffer), the calculated area of critical root
zone (CRZ) may be multiplied by two and deducted from the open space required
by the Chapter.
            (2)   Setbacks. Reduction of the front (except for ocean-front
lots), side, and rear setback requirements up to 30% on any given lot or lots
(should the CRZ span more than one lot) where a significant tree is to be
preserved. Any significant tree and its CRZ shall be placed in a landscape
easement, accessible to the HOA, the Town, or other entity for maintenance.
Parking dimensional requirements must still be met, regardless of setback
reductions.
             (3)   Parking Spaces. A reduction of the required number of
parking spaces as outlined in Section 7.6 may be reduced by no more than 15%
provided that the preserved tree(s) has no more than 20% of its critical root
zone encroached for the provision of sidewalk, parking, drive aisles, or other
pedestrian facilities.
            (4)   Buffers. The Administrator may allow for a variable width
buffer to accommodate a wider buffer width for the significant tree and its
critical root zone and a smaller width where only shrubs are provided.
      6.   Mitigation.
         a.   All significant trees, as defined by this ordinance, that are
proposed to be removed as part of a new development shall be replaced at the
following ratios with the identical tree type having a minimum trunk
measurement of 2" DBH and a minimum height of eight feet (8'):
            (1)   Trees 6" - 23" DBH shall be replaced at a two to one (2:1)
ratio (2 trees for every one removed).
            (2)   Trees greater than 24" DBH shall be replaced at a three to
one (3:1) ratio (3 trees for every one removed).
         b.   Where trees cannot be mitigated on site, the applicant shall work
with the Town to determine an alternative location where a portion of the
mitigated trees may be planted or the payment of a fee-in-lieu, in the amount
as listed on the Town's fee schedule.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
7.4   Landscaping.
   A.   General.
      1.   Intent.
         a.   The intent of this ordinance is to provide landscape requirements
that protect existing trees and natural vegetation as well as manage the
installation and long-term maintenance of all landscaping of the Town of Surf
City. The landscape requirements in this ordinance are designed to minimize the
visual impacts from adjacent properties as well as protect against the
transmission of noise, dust, odor, litter, and glare of lights. Landscape
requirements help to provide a sense of space and create a sense of privacy.
The use of new and existing landscaping will enhance the appearance of new
developments and help this development blend in with the natural environment.
         b.   Landscaping includes not only trees, shrubs, grass, and ground
cover, but open paving stones, benches, fountains, and exterior lighting
fixtures. All non-vegetative landscaping must be incidental to the overall
landscaping plan.
         c.   When possible existing vegetation shall be used. Preservation of
existing vegetation is the intent of this ordinance.
      2.   Applicability.
         a.   The requirements of this section shall apply to all zoning
districts.
         b.   All existing and proposed development for which a preliminary
plat or site plan approval is required (see Section 3) shall meet the landscape
related provisions of this Section, including but not limited to site
landscaping, buffers, screening, parking area plantings, etc.
         c.   Buildings and structures lawfully existing as of the effective
date of this chapter may be redeveloped, renovated or repaired without
providing or modifying landscaping, screening, and buffering in conformance
with this section, provided there is no increase in gross floor area in such
building or structure or impervious area on the site. However, a change of use
or expansion of existing heated square footage of an existing building and
expansion and/or paving of parking and loading areas also shall require
compliance with this Section.
         d.   Modification of Standards.
            (1)   Where necessary to accommodate creativity in site design, or
where topographic or physical site conditions are not feasible, the
Administrator may modify these requirements, provided that the type and amount
of landscaping or other features are equivalent in effectiveness.
            (2)   On a case-by-case basis, the Administrator may approve
alternative planting materials or substitutions to the requirements of this
section when new plantings would not be practical due to overhead utilities,
environmental features, or adequate existing vegetation. Such substitutions
must still meet the intent of this ordinance.
         e.   Emergencies. In the case of emergencies such as windstorms, ice
storms, fire, or other disasters, the requirements of this ordinance may be
waived by the Town during the emergency period so that the requirements of this
ordinance will in no way hamper private or public work to restore order in the
Town. This shall not be interpreted to be a general waiver of the intent of
this ordinance.
      3.   Landscape Plan Required.
         a.   A landscape plan shall be submitted in conjunction with a
required preliminary plat and site plan (see Section 3).
         b.   A registered Landscape Architect shall prepare all landscape
plans, except where expressly exempted by the Administrator. The landscape plan
shall adequately detail the requirements of this section.
      4.   Standards for New Planting. In general, new plant material should
complement existing vegetation native to the site. The use of salt-tolerant,
indigenous, native and/or regionally grown species of trees, shrubs, and
groundcover is encouraged in order to make planted areas compatible with
existing native habitats and to reduce dependency on irrigation.
         a.   Minimum Size. Landscaping should be of sufficient size so that
mature appearance will be achieved within three (3) years of installation for
shrubs and within five (5) years of installation for trees. Where the following
minimum size requirements overlap, the higher standard shall prevail:
            (1)   Evergreen trees of any classification shall not be less than
eight (8) feet in height with a minimum two (2) inch caliper.
            (2)   Multi-stemmed trees of any classification shall have at least
three (3) stalks and not be less than eight (8) feet in height.
            (3)   Canopy trees shall not be less than eight (8) feet in height
with a minimum two (2) inch caliper.
            (4)   Understory trees shall be a minimum of one and a quarter (1¼)
inch caliper and have a minimum height of six (6) feet.
            (5)   Shrubs shall be at least three (3) gallons in container size,
have a minimum height of twenty-four (24) inches and have a minimum spread of
twelve (12) to fifteen (15) inches.
            (6)   Groundcovers shall be a minimum of one-and-a-half (1½) to
two-and-a-half (2½) inch pots with a minimum spread of four (4) inches.
         b.   All landscaping required by this ordinance is included in
Attachment 1, Recommended Planting Table, in order to maintain native species
tolerant to coastal conditions.
         c.   (1)   Residential Tree Canopy location and required usage: All
residential properties. This type functions to maintain and/or replenish the
tree canopy in areas of new residential development. Each lot shall provide
canopy trees in accordance with the following schedule:
 
Lot Size                     Required Number of Canopy Trees*
Less than 10,000 square feet 1 front yard, 1 rear yard
10,000 - 15,000 square feet  1 front yard, 2 rear yard
15,001 - 20,000 square feet  2 front yard, 2 rear yard
More than 20,000 square feet 3 front yard, 3 rear yard
* Oceanfront lots are not required to plant rear yard canopy trees.
 
            (2)   The use of existing vegetation to satisfy this requirement is
encouraged. Existing canopy trees over six (6) inches in caliper may be counted
towards fulfilling this requirement. Required street trees may not be used to
fulfill this requirement. All trees required under this section shall be
planted within the private lot.
      5.   Plantings in Easements and Site Triangles.
         a.   No new plantings shall be located within an existing utility,
drainage, or access easement, unless utilized in stormwater facilities or
functioning as street trees.
         b.   Any vegetation planted within an easement shall have the
expressed written consent of the easement holder.
         c.   A minimum sight triangle shall be maintained at all driveways and
street intersections. Within the sight triangle, no plant material shall
interfere with an individual's vehicle sight line. No plant material shall
exceed thirty (30) inches in height at maturity; trees shall be trimmed so that
branches are at least seven (7) feet above curb level.
         d.   Where landscaping to meet the requirements of this ordinance must
be placed on an individually subdivided residential lot, it must be placed
inside a required landscape easement to ensure perpetuity, access for
maintenance, and replacement, as necessary.
      6.   Tree Protection During Construction.
         a.   Existing trees specified on the landscape plan to remain on the
site as a function of fulfilling the purpose of this section shall be protected
from vehicular movement and material storage over their root spaces during
construction.
         b.   The Critical Root Zone (CRZ) of the preserved trees shall be
identified and protected through the placement of tree protection fencing. The
Critical Root Zone is the circular area of ground surrounding a tree extending
from the center of the tree to the greater of:
            (1)   One and one half (1.5) feet per caliper inch dbh (diameter at
breast height) of the tree;
            (2)   The dripline (furthest extent of the canopy) of the tree; or
            (3)   Six (6) feet
         c.   All existing trees and vegetation that are to be preserved shall
be completely enclosed with a sturdy and visible fence prior to any land
disturbance. Fencing shall extend to the CRZ. In some instances, the
Administrator may require an additional area of no disturbance.
         d.   Protective fencing should consist of two by four-inch posts with
one by four-inch rails, orange safety fence, or a similar treatment and shall
remain in place until construction activities are complete.
          e.   All protected trees must be protected from silt with wire mesh
fencing, placed along the outer uphill edge of the tree protection zones at the
land disturbance interface.
         f.   There shall be no clearing, excavation, soil compaction, storage
of equipment, or changes of the existing grade within the delineated tree
protection zones. Should the removal of underbrush vegetation take place, every
effort should be made to minimize the disturbance.
      7.   Landscape Maintenance.
         a.   To encourage the continuance of landscape areas, the owner(s)
shall be jointly and severally responsible for the continued proper maintenance
of landscaped areas. The owner(s) shall be notified in writing by the
Administrator of any areas that are not being properly maintained and the owner
(s) shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the time of notification,
restore the landscaped area(s) to a satisfactory condition.
         b.   If any other reference to landscaping is made within this
ordinance, which is in conflict with this section of the ordinance, it shall be
the responsibility of the owner to follow the stricter of the regulations.
   B.   Perimeter Buffers. A perimeter buffer is a specified land area,
together with the planting and landscaping required on the land to provide a
visual and physical separation between incompatible uses. A buffer may also
contain, a barrier such as a berm or wall where such additional screening is
necessary to achieve the desired level of buffering and opacity between various
land use activities. In all cases, existing, healthy vegetation is preferred
and will be credited toward required planting of this section.
      1.   Perimeter Buffer Location. Buffers shall be located along the
perimeter of a lot, parallel to and extending the length of the property line,
as existing conditions allow. Buffers may be located within required setbacks.
Where existing easements, changes in grade, and other constraints prohibit the
placement of a buffer immediately adjacent to the property line, the Administer
may approve an alternative location meeting the intent and buffering opacities
of this ordinance.
      2.   Uses Allowed Within Required Perimeter Buffers.
         a.   Ingress and egress to a site, including utility infrastructure,
may cross required buffers, provided these crossings are perpendicular to the
buffer.
         b.   Recreational uses such as pedestrian paths, greenway trails, and
other pedestrian transportation infrastructure, provided there is ample room
for the required plantings to be installed and grow.
         c.   Site signage.
         d.   Berms, walls, fences, and other screening devices.
         e.   Other activities deemed appropriate within required buffers as
approved by the Administrator.
      3.   Perimeter Buffer Requirements. The following table shall be used to
determine the required buffer between adjacent uses.

appropriate by the landscape plan preparer and Administrator. All trees planted
outside the right-of-way shall be placed within a minimum ten foot (10') wide
landscape easement.
      5.   Street tree varieties shall be chosen from the plant list included
in Attachment 1, Recommended Planting Table, of this ordinance. Substitutions
are subject to review and approval by the Administrator.
      6.   Street trees are to be maintained and replaced as needed by the
property owner. Street trees on private lots in residential subdivisions should
be placed in a minimum ten (10) foot landscape easement for maintenance access.
      7.   Conflict with Street Lighting: Street trees shall be located and
planted so as not to diminish the effectiveness of required street lighting.
   D.   Parking Area Landscaping.
      1.   General. Landscaping in parking lots is required to mitigate the
effects of pervious surfaces and reduce the heat and runoff associated with
vehicular use areas. Perimeter plantings shall be required to reduce off-site
glare of headlights and islands shall be provided to prevent excessively long
runs of parking spaces. Landscape islands shall have adequate control measures
to ensure the longevity of plantings within them.
      2.   Applicability.
         a.   The following regulations shall apply to all pervious parking
areas of five (5) or more parking spaces.
         b.   The parking area landscape regulations of this subsection shall
not be applicable to single-family detached dwellings.
      3.   Perimeter Plantings.
         a.   The perimeter of all parking areas and other vehicular use areas
with frontage on any portion of an existing public right-of-way or adjacent to
a credential use shall be screened by a berm, a continuous landscaped hedge, or
any combination thereof to form an opaque screen.
         b.   A minimum of 75% of the vegetation shall be evergreen.
         c.   At the time of installation, such screening shall be at least
thirty (30) inches in height. Any vegetative screen shall reach a minimum
height of thirty-six (36) inches within two (2) years of planting.
         d.   There is no specified width for a parking buffer, provided as the
opacity is provided and enough planting area is provided for the vegetation to
thrive. A minimum width of 5' is required for shrubs alone. Where trees are
provided, an 8' width is required.
         e.   No such buffer shall be required along an alley.
         f.   Breaks in the vegetative buffer may occur only in areas of
vehicular and pedestrian walkways or driveways.
      4.   Landscape Islands.
         a.   All parking spaces shall be within sixty (60) feet from the base
of a canopy tree.
         b.   Parking rows shall not extend more than one hundred (100) feet

7.5   Outdoor lighting.
   A.   Intent. The intent of this section is to provide direction in
controlling light spillage and glare so as not to adversely affect motorists,
pedestrians, adjacent properties and the extremely sensitive turtle population.
Lighting intensities should be controlled to assure that excessive lighting and
glare are not directed at adjacent properties, neighboring areas, motorists as
well as the beachfront and/or sound front.
   B.   Applicability.
      1.   Unless specifically exempt, all existing and proposed developments
for which site plan approval is required shall meet the provisions of this
section.
      2.   Lighting installed prior to the adoption of this ordinance is exempt
from the regulations within this section unless:
         a.   Lighting found by a government agency to create a public hazard
can be ordered removed or altered at any time.
         b.   Any lighting damaged by more than fifty percent (50%) of its
value shall be made to comply with this ordinance.
         c.   Upon installation of any new lighting, this ordinance shall fully
apply. An inventory of existing lighting submitted by the applicant will be
required when the application for installing new lighting is made.
   C.   Outdoor Lighting Standards.
      1.   All proposed outdoor lighting shall be maintained in a proper
working condition and oriented to be downward casting while utilizing shielding
to prevent light from projecting onto adjoining properties.
      2.   The maximum fixture height shall be thirty (30) feet for full cutoff
fixtures and twenty (20) feet for non-cutoff fixtures (including residential).
      3.   All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the
maximum illumination measured in foot candles at the property line shall not
exceed three-tenths (.3) for non-cutoff lights and one and one-half (1.5) for
cutoff lights.
      4.   All site plans submitted for review must have a lighting plan
showing foot-candles on site as well as fixture type, fixture height and
fixture location.
      5.   All illuminated signs must be lit internally or lit by top-mounted
lights pointed downward, including billboards.
      6.   Commercial and residential lighting shall not shine into vehicular
travel lanes.
      7.   Any commercial lighting to face the beachfront shall be approved by
the Administrator. No light shall project directly at the beachfront (including
residential).
      8.   Outdoor lighting shall be minimized after the close of business.
Only lights for security, parking areas and walkways shall be left on. Reduced
lighting is encouraged after midnight for all lighting sources on-site.
   D.   Prohibited Lighting.
      1.   Neon lights on the exterior of a building.
      2.   Neon lights on the exterior of a sign.
      3.   Flashing, blinking or rotating lights.
   E.   Exempt Lighting. Active recreation areas, because of their unique
requirements for nighttime visibility and limited hours of operation (i.e. the
lighting of ball fields and tennis courts) are not considered in this chapter.
However, lighting fixtures for such uses shall be mounted and aimed so that the
illumination falls within the primary playing area and immediate surrounds and
so that no direct light illumination is directed off site. Under all
circumstances, lighting used for active recreational purposes shall not go
beyond 11:00 p.m.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
7.6   Off-street parking and loading standards.
   A.   Intent. The Intent of this section is to provide off-street parking
standards that will alleviate congestion in the streets and allow for the
efficient storage of motor vehicles while, concurrently, reducing any adverse
environmental impacts to the urban area. By reducing glare, noise levels and
air pollution to occupants and residents of adjoining properties, and by
controlling storm water drainage and soil erosion, these standards will
generally contribute to the public health, safety and general welfare of the
citizenry and will create a more aesthetically pleasing environment in the Town
of Surf City.
   B.   Plan Required.
      1.   Prior to any work being done or any building or driveway permit
being issued, all off-street parking facilities of five (5) or more spaces,
and/or twenty-five hundred (2,500) square feet constructed, reconstructed,
revised, or enlarged shall have a plan reviewed by the Administrator for
compliance with Town Ordinances and compliance with General Statutes.
      2.   The plan shall show the number, size and location of spaces;
arrangements of circulation aisles; locations of driveways; provisions for
vehicular and pedestrian circulation; locations of sidewalks and curbs on or
adjacent to the facility; barriers or wheel stops; interior, perimeter and
street side landscaping; locations, legend and details of signs; lighting
standards; typical cross-section of pavement; storm drainage facilities; and
other pertinent information necessary to indicate compliance with this section.
   C.   Parking Table. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided with the
specified amounts for each use listed below. Uses not specifically listed shall
be reviewed by the Administrator for a determination of the required number of
spaces. Buildings with multiple uses shall calculate parking based on the
square footage of each use in the building.

      3.   Design of Loading Spaces.
         a.   Off-street loading spaces shall be designed and constructed so
that all maneuvering to park vehicles for loading and unloading can take place
entirely within the property lines of the premises. Loading spaces must be
designed so not to interfere with the normal movement of vehicles and
pedestrians on public rights-of-way. Off-street loading areas shall be required
in the side or rear yard and shall be screened from any adjacent right-of-way.
         b.   No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used
to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion
of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for
loading and unloading facilities.
         c.   Each loading berth shall have a paved surface and be a minimum of
twelve (12) feet in width and thirty-five (35) feet in length. Each such berth
shall also have a minimum vertical clearance of fourteen (14) feet. For any use
which is required to furnish three (3) or more loading berths, at least one (1)
of every three (3) berths shall have a minimum width of twelve (12) feet,
minimum length of sixty-five (65) feet and a minimum vertical clearance of
fourteen (14) feet.
         d.   Hours of loading and unloading operation adjacent to ground floor
residential uses shall be limited between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
Loading docks shall be signed to indicate "no idling."
   J.   Alternative Parking Plan (APP).
      1.   General. The Planning Board may recommend, and the Town Council
approve the modification of the parking requirements of this section where
applicant-submitted parking data, prepared and sealed by a registered engineer
in the State of North Carolina with transportation expertise, illustrates that
the standards of this section do not accurately apply to a specific
development. The data submitted for an alternative parking plan shall include,
at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the mix of uses,
the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and
traffic loads of all uses.
      2.   Alternative Options Available: If approved by the Town or NCDOT, the
following methods may be used to alternatively provide for reduced parking.
         a.   On-Street Parking. On-street parking spaces located immediately
abutting the subject parcel, entirely within the extension of the side lot
lines into the roadway, and not within any required clear sight triangle may be
counted toward meeting off-street parking requirements.
         b.   Off-Site Parking. Required off-street parking spaces may be
located on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if
the off-site parking complies with all of the following standards.
            (1)   Ineligible Activities. Off-site parking may not be used to
satisfy the off-street parking requirements for residential uses (except for
guest parking), as well as convenience stores or other convenience-oriented
uses. Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities may not be
located off-site.
            (2)   Location. Off-site parking spaces shall be located within
seven hundred fifty (750) feet from the primary entrance of the use served
unless shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking area. Off-site
parking may not be separated from the use that it serves by a street right-of-
way with a width of more than sixty (60) feet unless a grade-separated
pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic control or shuttle bus service
is provided to the off-site parking area.
            (3)   Zoning Classification. Off-site parking areas serving uses
located in nonresidential districts shall be located in nonresidential
districts. Off-site parking areas serving uses located in residential districts
may be located in residential or nonresidential districts.
            (4)   Agreement.
               (a)   If an off-site parking area is not under the same
ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement between the recorded
property owners shall be required.
               (b)   An off-site parking agreement may be rescinded only if all
required off-street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with this
section.
         c.   Shared Parking.
            (1)   Ineligible Activities. Shared parking may not be used to
satisfy the off-street parking standards for upper-story residential uses.
Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities may not be
located off-site.
            (2)   Location. Shared parking spaces shall be located within seven
hundred fifty (750) feet of the primary entrance of all uses served unless
shuttle bus service is provided to the parking area.
            (3)   Zoning Classification. Shared parking areas serving uses
located in nonresidential districts shall be located in nonresidential
districts. Shared parking areas serving uses located in residential districts
may be located in residential or nonresidential districts. Shared parking areas
shall require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than that
required for the most intensive of the uses served by the shared parking area.
            (4)   Shared Parking Study. Applicants wishing to use shared
parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements shall submit a
shared parking analysis to the Administrator, as part of the Alternative
Parking Plan, that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The
study shall be provided in a form established by the Administrator and made
available to the public. It shall address, at minimum, the size and type of the
proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of
parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all
uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces.
            (5)   Agreement.
               (a)   Shared parking arrangements shall be a formal legal
instrument and be provided to the Administrator or designee at time of rezoning
and/or plan approval.
               (b)   A shared parking agreement may be rescinded only if all
required off-street parking spaces are provided in accordance with this
section.
         d.   Valet Parking. Valet parking may be utilized as a means of
satisfying otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements where all of
the following standards have been met:
            (1)   Adequate assurance of the continued operation of the valet
parking is provided, such as a contractual agreement for valet services or the
tenant's affidavit agreeing to provide such services;
            (2)   An equivalent number of valet spaces are available to replace
the required parking spaces. Such valet spaces do not require individual
striping, and may take into account the tandem or mass parking of vehicles. All
valet parking areas visible from the public right-of-way shall meet the
requirements of
Section 7.4;
            (3)   Valet parking drop-off locations shall meet the requirements
loading space requirements; and
            (4)   The design of the valet parking shall not cause customers who
do not use the valet service to park off-premises or cause queuing in the
right-of-way.
         e.   Site Design Changes. The minimum amount of motor vehicle parking
can be reduced using the following methods, individually or in combination, for
an overall maximum reduction of twenty-five percent (25%).
            (1)   Additional Bike Parking. A maximum of five percent (5%)
reduction is permitted if an additional six (6) bicycle parking spaces are
provided for each motor vehicle parking space reduced.
            (2)   Additional Tree Coverage. A maximum of twenty percent (20%)
reduction is permitted if the following additional tree coverage is provided
per one parking space:
               (a)   An additional canopy tree is preserved and protected; or
               (b)   One canopy tree and two understory trees are planted;
               (c)   The following shall also apply:
                  (i)   An appropriate species per the Landscape Plant List
shall be used for planting.

preserved tree.
                  (iii)   Root zone protection standards of this ordinance
shall apply.
                  (iv)   The additional planted or protected tree(s) shall not
count towards any other Code requirement.
      3.   Recording of Approved Plans. An attested copy of an approved
Alternative Parking Plan shall be recorded in the deed records for Pender
County on forms made available by the Planning Director. An Alternative Parking
Plan may be amended by following the same procedure required for the original
approval. The applicant shall provide proof of recording prior to approval of
the certificate of occupancy.

construction or modification or the amount of time spent responding to an
applicant's arguments as regards its application or the requirements of this
section.
      4.   The town will maintain accounting for the expenditure of all such
funds.
      5.   Pursuant to state law, if an application is amended, or a waiver or
relief is requested from any local regulations, at any time prior to the grant
of the certificate of completion required under this section, the town reserves
the right to require additional payment for review and analysis equal to, but
not exceeding, the cost created for the town by the applicant or its
application. Such amount shall be paid to the town prior to the issuance of the
special use permit or administrative authorization or the certificate of
completion, whichever is procedurally needed next.
   D.   Liability insurance.
      1.   A holder of a special use permit for a wireless telecommunications
support structure shall secure and at all times maintain public liability

consultants as additional insureds.
         b.   The insurance policies shall be issued by an agent or
representative of an insurance company licensed to do business in the state and
with an AM Best's rating of at least A.
         c.   The insurance policies shall contain an endorsement obligating
the insurance company to furnish the town with at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice in advance of the cancellation of the insurance.
         d.   Renewal or replacement policies or certificates shall be
delivered to the town at least fifteen (15) days before the expiration of the
insurance that such policies are to renew or replace.
         e.   Before construction of a permitted wireless telecommunications
facility or complex is initiated, but in no case later than fifteen (15) days
prior to the grant of the building permit, the holder of the special use permit
shall deliver to the town a copy of each of the policies or certificates
representing the insurance in the required amounts.
         f.   A certificate of insurance that states that it is for
informational purposes only and does not confer rights upon the town shall not
be deemed to comply with this section.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   A.   Title. This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the
"Subdivision Regulations for the Town of Surf City, North Carolina and its
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction" and may be referred to as the "Subdivision
Regulations", "Subdivision Ordinance", and/or the "Ordinance".
   B.   Preamble. Since the establishment of the Town of Surf City in 1949, the
size of the Town was generally limited to those areas on the island. Beginning
in 2003, the Town began accepting voluntary annexations on the mainland thereby
increasing the size of the Town. The island portion of the Town is, by its very
nature, surrounded by water on all sides and is more linear in its geographic
shape. Furthermore, the island portion of the Town is mostly developed with the
infrastructure currently in place and the majority of the parcels built out.
Due to a single route of evacuation, current development and geographic
constraints the island is not conducive to public school facilities or
additional recreational areas and will not be required.
   C.   Purpose.
      1.   The purpose of this Ordinance is to support and guide the proper
subdivision of land within the jurisdiction of Surf City in order to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Surf City
territorial jurisdiction. The Ordinance is designed to promote the orderly
development of the Town; for the coordination of streets and highways within
proposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and highways and other
public facilities; for the dedication or reservation of rights-of-way or
easements for street and utility purposes; and for the distribution of
population and traffic, which shall avoid congestion and overcrowding and which
will create conditions essential to public health, safety, and the general
welfare. This Ordinance is designed to further facilitate suitable provisions
for water, sewerage, parks, schools, recreational space, open space, and also
to facilitate the further resubdivision of larger tracts into smaller parcels
of land.
      2.   The provisions in this Ordinance shall be administered to ensure
orderly growth and development and shall supplement and facilitate the
provisions in the Land Use Plan, Zoning Ordinance and Map, and Capital
Improvements Program.
   D.   Authority. This Ordinance is adopted under the authority of G.S. 160D-
801.
   E.   Jurisdiction. The regulations contained herein as provided in G.S.
Chapter 160D shall govern each and every subdivision within the jurisdiction of
Surf City as directed in the Surf City Incorporation Ordinance, adopted March
23, 1949, and subsequently amended as well as the extra territorial
jurisdiction as recorded on a map filed with the Town Clerk, and the Pender
and/or Onslow Register of Deeds and subsequently amended.
   F.   Applicability. This Ordinance is applicable to all divisions of a tract
or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots, building sites, or other division
when any one (1) or more of those divisions are created for the purpose of sale
or building development (whether immediate or future). This Ordinance is also
applicable to all divisions of land involving the dedication of a new street or
a change in existing streets. However, the following divisions of land shall
not be included within the definition of subdivision nor be subject to the
regulations herein:
      1.   The combination or recombination of portions of previously
subdivided and recorded lots where the total number of lots is not increased
and the resultant lots are equal to or exceed the standards of the Town of Surf
City.
      2.   The division of land into parcels greater than ten (10) acres where
no street right-of-way dedication is involved.
      3.   The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for the
widening or opening of streets or for public transportation system corridors.
      4.   The division of a tract in single ownership whose entire area is no
greater than two (2) acres into not more than three (3) lots, where no street
right-of-way dedication is involved and where the resultant lots are equal to
or exceed the standards of the Town of Surf City, as contained herein.
      5.   The division of a tract into parcels in accordance with the terms of
a probated will or in accordance with intestate succession under G.S. Chapter
29.
   G.   Conformance with this Ordinance. From and after the effective date of
this Ordinance, any subdivision for which application is made shall be in
conformity with this chapter and all standards and specifications adopted as
part of such ordinance. In addition, after the effective date, no plat for
subdivision of land within the jurisdiction of the Subdivision Ordinance shall
be certified for recording by the Administrator, nor shall the Clerk of
Superior Court order the recording of a plat until it has been submitted and
approved in accordance with the provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance.
   H.   Consistency with Other Regulations.
      1.   Whenever the provisions of any other statute or ordinance require a
greater standard or impose more restrictive standards than are required by any
regulations made under authority of this Chapter, the provisions of such
statute shall govern.
      2.   This Ordinance does not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair
or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances, except those
specifically or explicitly repealed by this Chapter, or any restrictions placed
upon property by covenant, deed, or other private agreement unless
objectionable hereto.
      3.   Provisions in Appendix A, Zoning, providing for varying design
standards shall not be considered in conflict with the provisions of this
Chapter. To the extent that a conflict may exist between the provisions of this
Chapter and those of Appendix A, Zoning, the provisions of Appendix A shall
apply.
      4.   No parcel containing any deed restriction or previous plan
restriction forbidding subdivision of that parcel may be further subdivided.
   I.   Conformance with Official Plans. All subdivisions shall comply with the
principles, goals, and/or objectives of the CAMA Land Use Plan and all other
officially adopted plans and policies of the Town. Where a proposed subdivision
includes any part of a thoroughfare which has been designated as such upon the
officially adopted comprehensive transportation plan of the Town as provided
for by G.S. 136-66.2, such part of such thoroughfare shall be platted and
dedicated by the subdivider in the location shown on the plan and at the width
specified by the Town. Similarly, where a proposed subdivision includes any
part of a greenway as officially adopted by the Town, such part of such
greenway shall be dedicated and platted by the subdivider in the location shown
on the plan. Such dedication shall be in accordance with Article V of this
ordinance. While the proposed subdivision must comply with the requirements of
all ordinances and regulations of the Town, examples of those types of
ordinances and regulations include: the Zoning Ordinance, Disposal of Sewerage,
Operations of the Municipal Water System, Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance,
and Regulations for Mobile Home and Travel Trailer Parks.
   J.   Separability. Should any section or provision of this ordinance be
decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid,
such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any
part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
   K.   Abrogation. It is not intended that this ordinance repeal, abrogate,
annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed
restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or
issued pursuant to law. However, where this ordinance imposes restrictions, the
provisions of this ordinance shall govern.
   L.   Effective date. This Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from
and after the 5th day of November 2024.
   M.   Amendments. The Town Council may from time to time amend the terms of
this Ordinance, but the amendment shall not become effective unless it shall
have been proposed by or shall have been submitted to the Planning Board for
review and recommendation. The Planning Board shall have a period of time, not
to exceed ninety (90) days within which to submit its recommendation in a
report. If the Planning Board fails to submit a report within the specified
time, it shall be deemed to have approved the amendment. Amendments become
effective after the Town Council conducts a public hearing and approval by the
board in accordance with G.S. 160D-601. Planning Board and Town Council review
and statements shall be provided for each amendment in accordance with G.S.
160D-604 and G.S. 160D-605, respectively.
(Ord. No. 2024-15, 11-5-24)
ARTICLE II. SUBDIVISION PROCEDURES
   A.   General Requirements.
      1.   Pursuant to G.S. 160D-803, no final plat of a subdivision within the
planning jurisdiction of the Town of Surf City and its extraterritorial
jurisdiction, shall be recorded by the Register of Deeds of Pender County or
Onslow County, whichever is applicable, until it has been approved in
accordance with the procedures of this Ordinance as provided herein.
      2.   Approval of public services. No street shall be maintained by the
Town nor street dedication accepted for ownership and maintenance, no
construction permits shall be issued, nor shall water, sewer, or other Town
facilities or services be extended to or connected with any subdivision for
which a plat is required to be approved unless and until such preliminary plat
has been approved by the Town Council of Surf City.
      3.   Effect of plat approval on dedications. Pursuant to G.S. 160D-806,
the approval of a plat shall not be deemed to constitute or affect the
acceptance by the Town or public of the dedication of any street or other
ground, public utility line, or other public facility shown on the plat.
However, the Town Council may by resolution accept any dedication made to the
public of lands or facilities for streets, parks, public utility lines, or
other public purposes, when the lands or facilities are located within its
subdivision regulation jurisdiction. Acceptance of dedication of lands or
facilities located within the subdivision regulation jurisdiction but outside
the corporate limits of the Town shall not place on the Town any duty to open,
operate, repair or maintain any street, utility line, or other land or
facility, and the Town shall in no event be held to answer in any civil action
or proceeding for failure to open, repair, or maintain any street located
outside its corporate limits.
      4.   Enforcement and penalties for violation.
         a.   It shall be the duty of the Administrator to enforce the
provisions of this Ordinance and to bring to the attention of the Town any
violations or lack of compliance.
         b.   After the effective date of this Ordinance, any person who, being
the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the territorial
jurisdiction of this Ordinance, thereafter subdivides their land in violation
of this ordinance or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of, or
any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has
been properly approved under the terms of this Ordinance and recorded in the
office of the Pender County or Onslow County Register of Deeds, whichever is
applicable, is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor as outlined in G.S. 160D-807.
The descriptions by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other
document used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt
the transaction from this penalty. The Town, through its attorney or other
official designated by the Town Council may enjoin illegal subdivision,
transfer or sale of land by action for injunction.
      5.   Variances.
         a.   Where, because of severe topographical or other practical
difficulties peculiar to the site, strict adherence to the provisions of this
Ordinance would cause an unnecessary hardship, the Board of Adjustment may
grant a variance to the terms of this ordinance only to the extent that is
absolutely necessary and not to an extent which would violate the intent of the
ordinance. Variances may be granted by Board of Adjustment after an evidentiary
hearing is held and advertised in accordance with G.S. 160D-406 and G.S. 160D-
705(d).
   B.   Application Required.
      1.   Applications for development approvals may be made by the landowner,
a lessee or person holding an option or contract to purchase or lease land with
the permission of the landowner, or an authorized agent of the landowner.
      2.   All application packets for development approval shall be submitted
in accordance with the appropriate process administered by the Town.
         a.   Two (2) paper copies of the completed application packet shall be
submitted.
   C.   Completeness Review.
      1.   Completeness Determination .
         a.   Until an application is determined to be complete and in
accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance, an application has not been
submitted.
         b.   Upon receiving a development application, the Administrator shall
determine whether the application is complete or incomplete. A complete
application is one that:
            (1)   Contains all information and materials required by this
Subdivision Ordinance for submittal of the applicable type of application, and
in sufficient detail, format, and readability for the Administrator to evaluate
the application for compliance with applicable review standards; and
            (2)   Is accompanied by the fee established for the applicable type
of application.
      2.   Application Incomplete.
         a.   On determining that the application is incomplete, the
Administrator shall provide the applicant notice of the submittal deficiencies
electronically. The applicant may correct the deficiencies and resubmit the
application for a completeness review.
         b.   If the applicant fails to resubmit an application within fifteen
(15) calendar days after being first notified of submittal deficiencies, the
application submittal shall be considered abandoned. If an applicant submits a
request in writing to the Administrator within fifteen (15) calendar days of
the application abandonment date, fifty (50%) percent of the application fee
paid for the withdrawn application shall be refunded.
      3.   Application Complete. On determining that the application is
complete, the Administrator shall:
         a.   Accept the application as submitted in accordance with the
procedures and standards of this Ordinance in effect at the time of the
submittal; and
         b.   Provide the applicant notice of application submittal acceptance
electronically.

Administrator shall advise the subdivider or their authorized agent of the
regulations pertaining to the proposed subdivision and the procedures to be
followed in the preparation and submission of the preliminary and final plat.
This review shall in no way be construed as consulting an official action of
approval for recording of the subdivision by the Planning Board as required by
this Ordinance. A Preliminary Plat shall be submitted no later than one (1)
year from the time of Sketch Plan approval. The Administrator shall notify
applicants of the Sketch Plan approval date. If a Preliminary Plat is not

Preliminary Plat within forty-five (45) days after first consideration by the
Planning Board, provided that the plan complies with all of the requirements of
the ordinance with respect to content. First consideration shall be at the
first regularly scheduled meeting that occurs after the TRC recommendation.
Once the Planning Board makes a recommendation, the Preliminary Plan will be
placed on the next regularly scheduled Town Council meeting. If a Final Plat is
not submitted within one (1) year from the time of Preliminary Plat approval,

planning board shall specify the reasons for such action in writing. One (1)
copy of such reasons shall be retained by the Planning Board (in the Planning
Department) and one (1) copy shall be given to the Subdivider. If the
Preliminary Plat is disapproved, the Subdivider may make the recommended
changes and submit a revised Preliminary Plan to the Planning Board or appeal

      1.   Applicability. A Final Plat shall be submitted for all subdivisions
of land within the planning jurisdiction of the Town and shall be prepared by a
surveyor or professional engineer licensed and registered to practice in the
State of North Carolina and shall be submitted together with any application
fee as set by the Town of Surf City.
      2.   Review.
         a.   Upon approval of the Preliminary Plat by the Town Council, the
subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the Final Plat and the
installation or arrangement for required improvements in accordance with the
approved Preliminary Plat and the requirements of this Ordinance. Prior to
approval of a Final Plat, the subdivider shall have installed improvements
specified in this ordinance or guaranteed their installation through a
performance guarantee.
         b.   The Final Plat shall constitute only that portion of the
Preliminary Plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the
time; such portions shall conform to all requirements of this Ordinance.
         c.   No Final Plat will be accepted for review by the Administrator
unless accompanied by written notice by the Administrator acknowledging
compliance with this Ordinance.
         d.   The Final Plat shall be submitted not more than twelve (12)
months after the date on which the Preliminary Plat was approved, unless a
written extension of this time limit has been granted by the Planning Board
prior to expiration of the one (1) year anniversary of the approval.
         e.   The Final Plat shall be prepared by a surveyor or professional
engineer licensed and registered to practice in the State of North Carolina.
The Final Plat shall substantially conform to the Preliminary Plan as it was
approved. The Final Plat shall conform to the provision set forth in G.S. 47-
30.
         f.   Size of plat and scale. Final Plats shall meet the size
requirements outlined in G.S. 47-30.
      3.   Contents Required. Table B outlines all required elements for Final
Plats.
      4.   Performance guarantee.
         a.   In lieu of prior construction of the improvements required by
this Ordinance, the Town Council may, for the purpose of approving a Final
Plat, accept a guarantee from the subdivider that such improvements will be
carried out according to the final plat and Surf City's specifications at their
expense. No performance guarantee will be considered by the Town on any
subdivision that has not installed at least ten (10) percent of the required
improvements. Such guarantee may be in the form of a surety bond made by a
surety company licensed to do business in North Carolina. To secure this
agreement, the subdivider shall provide, subject to the approval of the
Administrator an engineer's cost estimate equal to one hundred twenty-five
(125) percent of the entire cost of the improvements and a schedule indicating
time of initiation and completion of the work, as a whole or in stages to the
Administrator. The engineer's cost estimate shall show the quantities, unit
costs and estimated total costs. All expenses associated with the Town's
review, recommendation, modification, and approval relative to the amount of
any performance guarantee and periodic drawdowns shall be born directly by the
subdivider.
         b.   Performance guarantees shall run for a period of one (1) year
unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the required
improvements necessitates a longer duration in which case written approval from
the Town Council with a completion date shall be required.
         c.   Default. Upon default, meaning failure on the part of the
subdivider to complete the required improvements in a timely manner as spelled
out in the performance bond or letter of credit, then the surety, or the
financial institution involved shall, if requested by the Town Council, pay all
or any portion of the bond or letter of credit fund to the Town up to the
amount needed to compete the improvements based on an engineering estimate.
Upon payment, the Town Council, in its discretion, may expend such portion of
said funds, as it deems necessary to complete all or any portion of the
required improvements. The Town shall return to the subdivider any funds not
spent in completing the improvements.
         d.   Release of guarantee security.
            (1)   The performance guarantee shall be returned or released, as
appropriate, in a timely manner upon the acknowledgment by the Town that the
improvements for which the performance guarantee is being required are
complete. The Town shall return letters of credit funds upon completion of the
required improvements to its specifications or upon acceptance of the required
improvements, if the required improvements are subject to acceptance by the
Town. When required improvements that are secured by a bond are completed to
the specifications of the Town, or are accepted, if subject to its acceptance,
upon request by the developer, the Town shall timely provide written
acknowledgment that the required improvements have been completed.
            (2)   In the event that the applicant wishes to occupy any building
or any portion of any building prior to the completion of the required site
improvements, the financial guarantee guaranteeing improvements shall be
retained by the Town of Surf City until the remaining required improvements are
completed.
      5.   Administrative Review.
         a.   If the Administrator approves the final plat, the subdivider
shall obtain signatures for all certifications as found in Article XII.
         b.   If the Final Plat is deemed incomplete or disapproved by the
Administrator, the subdivider may make such changes as will bring the final
plat into compliance with this ordinance and resubmit to the Administrator for
review.
      6.   Effect of plat approval on dedication. The approval of a Final Plat
shall not be deemed to constitute or affect the acceptance by Surf City of the
dedication of any street or other ground, easement, public utility line, or
other public facility shown on the plat. However, Surf City may by resolution
of the Town Council accept any dedication made to the public of lands or
facilities for streets, parks, public utility lines, or other public purposes,
when the lands or facilities are located within its subdivision regulation
jurisdiction.
      7.   Number of copies and graphic media of approved final plat. Once the
applicant receives confirmation of compliance, a mylar and digital copy of the
Final Plat may be submitted to the Administrator.
      8.   Recording of the final plat. The developer shall file the approved
Final Plat with the Register of Deeds of Pender County or Onslow County,
whichever is applicable, for recording within thirty (30) days after the date
of approval; otherwise, such approval shall be null and void. Within five (5)
days of recordation, the developer shall file with the Administrator a copy of
said Final Plat certified as a true copy of Pender County or Onslow County,
which is applicable, Register of Deeds.
      9.   Resubdivision procedures. For any replatting or resubdivision of
land, the same procedures, rules and regulations shall apply as prescribed
herein for an original subdivision.
