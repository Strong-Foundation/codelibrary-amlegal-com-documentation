manner and for such length of time as prescribed by the council. In any case,
however, where the lessee enters into a binding obligation to erect upon
property owned by the city improvements to cost not less than one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000.00), the council may rent or lease such property for
a term not to exceed forty (40) years, and such lease may be made by the
council either privately or publicly and upon such terms as in the judgment of
the council will promote the best interest of the city.

map of the improvements on which is shown the frontage and location of each
affected lot, together with the amount assessed against each lot and the name
or names of the owner or owners thereof as far as the same can be ascertained,
shall be a sufficient assessment roll. If the resolution directed the making of
more. than one improvement, a single preliminary assessment roll for all the
improvements authorized by such resolution shall be sufficient, but the cost of
each improvement to each lot affected shall be shown separately. After the
preliminary assessment roll has been completed, it shall be filed in the office
of the city clerk, and there shall be published in some newspaper of general
circulation in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or if there
be no such newspaper, the city clerk shall cause to be posted in three (3)
public places in the city a notice of the completion of the assessment roll,
setting forth a description in general terms of the improvements, and stating
the time fixed for the meeting of the council for the hearing of objections to
the special assessments, such meeting to be not earlier than ten (10) days
after the first publication or from the date of posting of said notice. Any
number of assessment rolls may be included in one notice. In any case where the
preliminary notice was served or mailed instead of being published, this notice
need not be published or posted but may be served or mailed. The serving or
mailing of notices shall be completed not less than five (5) days prior to the
date fixed for the hearing of the assessment roll, and the return of the person
serving or mailing the same shall, in the absence of fraud, be conclusive that
the same were served or mailed.

assessment against any or all lots or parcels described thereon, or by
canceling, increasing or reducing the same. If any property is omitted from the
preliminary roll, the council may place it on the roll and levy the proper
assessment. The council may thereupon confirm the assessment roll. Whenever the
governing body shall confirm assessments for local improvements, the city clerk
shall enter on the council minutes and on the assessment roll the date, hour
and minute of confirmation, and from the time of confirmation the assessment
shall be a lien on the property assessed of the same nature and to the same
extent as county and city taxes and shall be superior to all other liens and
encumbrances. After the assessment roll is confirmed, a copy of the same shall

the superior court of Wayne County, in which case he shall within twenty (20)
days after the confirmation of the assessment roll serve on the mayor or city
clerk a statement of facts upon which he bases his appeal. The appeal shall be
tried as other actions at law. The remedy herein provided for any person
dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment against any property of which he
is the owner or in which he is interested shall be exclusive.

Sec. 10.14. ERROR IN ASSESSMENT; POWER TO CORRECT, PROCEDURE.
   If it shall appear after confirmation of any assessment roll that an error
has been made, the city clerk shall cause to be published one time in some
newspaper of general circulation in the city, or if there be no such newspaper,
the city clerk shall cause to be posted at three (3) public places in the city
a notice referring to the assessment roll in which the error was made, naming
the owner or owners of the lot or parcel of land affected by the error if the
same can be ascertained, and naming the time and place fixed for a hearing by
the council for the correction of the error, such meeting not to be earlier
than ten (10) days from the publication or from the date of the posting of the
notice. At the time fixed in the notice or at some subsequent time to which the
council may adjourn, the council, after giving the owner or owners of the
property affected and other persons interested therein an opportunity to be
heard, may proceed to correct the error, and the assessment then made shall
have the same force and effect as if it had originally been properly made. No
notice and hearing shall be necessary if the correction does not increase an
assessment against any property not owned by the city, or if all of the
property owners affected by the correction waive notice in writing.

Sec. 10.15. REASSESSMENT.
   The council shall have the power, when in its judgment there is any
irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings
relating thereto, to set aside the whole of the local assessment made by it and
thereupon to make a reassessment. In such case there shall be included, as a
part of the cost of the improvements involved, all interest paid or accrued on
notes or certificates of indebtedness or bonds issued by the city to pay the
expenses of such improvement. The proceeding shall, as far as practicable, be
in all respects as in the case of original assessments, and the reassessment
shall have the same force as if it had originally been properly made.
('70 Code, Charter Sec. 10.15) (Am. Ord. 2016-9, passed 2-1-16)
Sec. 10.16. PUBLICATION OF NOTICE OF CONFIRMATION OF ASSESSMENT ROLL.
   After the expiration of twenty (20) days from the confirmation of the
assessment roll, the city clerk shall cause to be published one time in some
newspaper of general circulation in the city which is qualified to carry legal
notices, or if there be no such newspaper, shall cause to be posted at three
(3) public places in the city a notice of confirmation of the assessment roll,
and that assessments may be paid at any time before the expiration of thirty
(30) days from the date of publication or posting of the notice without
interest from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll, but that if such
assessment is not paid in full within said time, all installments thereof shall
bear interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum from the date of
confirmation of the assessment roll.
('70 Code, Charter Sec. 10.16)
Sec. 10.17. PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS IN CASH OR BY INSTALLMENTS.
   The property owner assessed shall have the option of paying for improvements
in cash or in not less than two (2) or more than five (5) equal annual
installments as may have been determined in the resolution ordering the
improvements. If paid in installments, installments shall bear interest at the
rate of eight per cent (8%) per annum from the date of confirmation of the
assessment roll. If any assessment is not paid in cash, the first installment
with interest shall become due and payable thirty (30) days after the
publication or posting of the notice of confirmation, and one subsequent
installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of the same
month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full; provided,
however, that if the council shall so direct installments shall become due and
payable on the same date when property taxes of the city are due and payable.
If any installment with interest is not paid when due, it shall be subject to
the same penalties as are now prescribed by law for unpaid taxes, in addition
to the interest herein provided for. The whole assessment may be paid at any
time by the payment of the full amount due with accrued interest.
('70 Code, Charter Sec. 10.17) (Am. Ord. 2016-9, passed 2-1-16)
Sec. 10.18. PROCEDURE TO ENFORCE PAYMENT; MANDAMUS AGAINST RAILROADS AND STATE
AGENCIES; FORECLOSURE AGAINST INDIVIDUALS.
   Upon the failure of any property owner to pay any installment when due and
payable, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately become due
and payable, and property and rights-of-way may be sold by the city under the
same rules, regulations, rights of redemption and savings as are now prescribed
by law for the sale of land for unpaid taxes. Collection of assessments with
interest and penalties may also be made by the city by proceedings to foreclose
the lien of assessments as a lien for mortgages is or may be foreclosed under
the laws of the state, and it shall be lawful to join in any bill for
foreclosure any one or more lot or parcels of land, by whomsoever owned, if
assessed for an improvement ordered by the same resolution, after default in
the payment of any installment. The payment of said installment, together with
interest and penalties due thereon and any advertising and legal costs already
incurred, before the lot or parcel of land against which the same is a lien is
sold or said lien is foreclosed, shall bar the right of the city to sell land
or to foreclose the lien by reason of default.
('70 Code, Charter Sec. 10.18)
Sec. 10.19. ASSESSMENT OF COST OF WATER MAIN AND SEWER EXTENSIONS.
   If the resolution ordering the making of any improvement or improvements
included a provision far any necessary extension of a water main or sewer or
sewers beyond the limit of a street or streets, at such time after the
completion of said extension or extensions, as in the judgment of the council
circumstances justify the assessment of the cost thereof, the council shall
cause a preliminary assessment to be made, and the procedure thereafter to be
followed with respect to such assessment and the force and effect thereof shall
be as already prescribed for other assessments.
('70 Code, Charter Sec. 10.19) (Am. Ord. 2016-9, passed 2-1-16)
Sec. 10.20. APPORTIONMENT OF ASSESSMENTS.
   In any case where one or more special assessments have been made, and
property has been or is about to be subdivided, and it is desirable that the
assessments be apportioned among the subdivisions of such property, the council
may, upon application by the owner or owners, apportion the assessments among
the subdivisions. Thereafter, each subdivision shall be relieved of any part of
the original assessment except the part apportioned to the subdivision, and the
part of the original assessment apportioned to any subdivision shall be of the
same force and effect as the original assessment.
('70 Code, Charter Sec. 10.20) (Am. Ord. 2016-9, passed 2-1-16)
Sec. 10.21. CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP.
   No change of ownership of any property or interests therein after the

made therefor as if there had been no change in ownership.
('70 Code, Charter Sec. 10.21)
Sec. 10.22. PROCEEDINGS IN REM.

or parcel of land affected thereby shall be regarded as a substantial mistake
or omission.
('70 Code, Charter Sec. 10.22)
Sec. 10.23. GRASS PLOT AND DRIVEWAY MAINTENANCE.

resolution that the collection of assessments levied against abutting lots or
parcels of land for water main improvements or sanitary sewer improvements,
when in its opinion such improvements may not presently be used by the owner or
owners of the abutting lots or parcels of land, may be held in abeyance without
the payment of any interest thereon until such time as the council shall
determine that any such assessments shall be paid in accordance with the terms
set out in the confirming resolution. The collection of some part of the
assessments levied for the improvements herein set out on a street or streets
or portion thereof may be held in abeyance as herein provided without holding
the collection of all of said assessments in abeyance.
   (b)   Statutes of limitations suspended. All statutes of limitations are
hereby suspended during the time that the collection of any assessment is held
in abeyance without the payment of interest as provided in subsection (a). Such
time shall not be a part of the time limited for the commencement of action for
the enforcement of the payment of any such assessment, and such action may be
brought at any time within ten (10) years from the date of the adoption of a
resolution by the council determining that such assessment shall be paid in
accordance with the original resolution confirming it.

   (a)   Determination by council; effect. If any local improvements are made
adjacent to any lands outside the city limits, the city council may upon the
completion of such local improvements levy assessments against the abutting
property in the same manner as if such abutting property were within the city
limits and delay the collection of part or all of such assessments without any
interest until the city limits are extended to include such abutting property,
or the council may provide that no water or sewer service connections shall be
made to such property, pending she annexation thereof, until all assessments
thereon are paid. Upon annexation, if not paid prior thereto, the council may
proceed to collect the assessments for such property. Nothing contained in this
section shall be construed to prohibit or restrict the city council and a
property owner from entering into an agreement for payments in lieu of
assessments.
   (b)   Statutes of limitations suspended. All statutes of limitations are
hereby suspended during the time that the collection of any assessment is held
in abeyance without the payment of interest as provided in subsection (a). Such
time shall not be a part of the time limited for the commencement of action for
the enforcement of the payment of any such assessment, and such action may be
brought at the time within ten (10) years from the date of the adoption of a
resolution by the council determining that such assessment shall be paid in
accordance with the original resolution confirming it.
   (c)   Retroactive construction prohibited. Nothing herein shall be construed
to revive any right of action which has heretofore been barred by the statutes

alternate members to take the place of the absent member, a unanimous six votes
would be required to obtain the necessary 4/5 majority. (Six being the first
whole number to exceed four-fifths (0.80) of the entire Board). If alternate
members are present, they may vote in place of any absent member. All other
actions of the Board shall be taken by majority vote, a quorum being present.

replaced at the property owner’s expense. Curbside garbage collection of roll-
out containers shall be provided to residents once per week. To minimize the

recycle container lids nor on the sides of the container. If a residence
requires an additional bin, a second bin may be issued by the city at the fee
shown in §
50.08(E).
   (F)   A return service fee may be assessed for bins that were not serviced
on the original route due to citizens failure to comply with bin placement
ordinance found in divisions (C) - (E). The return service will be initiated by
homeowner request or by complaint of someone other than the homeowner no
earlier than 24 hours after the regularly scheduled service. Return service
will be provided on the work day after the work order was initiated.
   (G)   A current recycling/refuse customer of the city may purchase a three-
cubic yard flexible tote bag dumpster from the city. This dumpster may be used
for any item not listed as an exception in §

bins will be serviced. If the bin is in the back yard of a fenced-in area, the
fence shall be unlocked and all dogs, regardless of temperament or size, shall

receive the premium side yard service at basic service rates. Fees are shown in
section §
50.08(E).

      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the
system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system;
      (4)   To protect both municipal personnel who may come into contact with
sewage, sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as
protecting the general public;
      (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and
      (6)   To ensure the municipality complies with its NPDES or non-discharge
permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal
or state laws which the municipal wastewater system is subject to;
      (7)   To aid in the prevention of wastewater collection system blockages
and obstructions and resulting sanitary sewer overflows from contributions and
accumulation of fats, oils, and greases into the municipal wastewater system
from industrial or commercial establishments, particularly food preparation and
serving facilities.
   (C)   This regulation provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the issuance of
permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs-resulting from the program established
herein.
   (D)   This regulation shall apply to all users of the city of Goldsboro's
wastewater collection and treatment system and to persons outside the city, who
are, by permit or agreement with the city, users of the city POTW. Except as
otherwise provided herein, the Public Utilities Director shall administer,
implement, and enforce the provisions of this regulation. Any powers granted to
or imposed upon the POTW Director may be delegated by the POTW Director to
other city personnel. By discharging wastewater into the municipal wastewater
system, industrial users located beyond the city limits agree to comply with
the terms and conditions established in this regulation, as well as any permits
or orders issued hereunder.

necessary to comply with this chapter and wastewater permits issued under §
51.051 and shall achieve compliance with all National categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
51.010 within the time limitations as specified by EPA, the state, or the POTW
Director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the POTW Director
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
approved by the POTW Director prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the POTW Director may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that specific
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate domestic
sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as
may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with
the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The POTW Director may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Sand interceptors shall be installed when, in the opinion of the
Building Inspector, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater
containing excessive amounts of sand; except that such interceptors shall not
be required for residential users. All sand interception units shall be of type
and capacity approved by the Building Inspector and shall be so located to be
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be
installed, inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user
at their expense.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

§ 51.018 GREASE TRAP PROGRAM.
   (A)   Grease, fats and oil interceptors shall be installed and maintained by
users operating food cooking establishments. Grease interceptors may also be
required in food non-cooking establishments and other industrial or non-
domestic users when, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, they are
necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of
grease, fats, and oils; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users. Interceptors shall be installed and maintained at the user’s
expense. If no grease is found through investigation by the City Inspector(s)
at a food establishment, a grease trap may not be required.
   (B)   No user shall allow any wastewater discharge concentration from the
interceptor to exceed 325 milligrams per liter (EPA Method 1664) or 275
milligrams per liter (EPA Method 413) in fats, oils, and greases. These limits
shall be consistently maintained.
   (C)   All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the
Building Inspector and shall be so located to be easily accessible for
cleaning, inspection, and wastewater effluent sampling. Such interceptors shall
be inspected, cleaned of grease, sludge, debris and the like and repaired as
required in order to maintain minimum design capability of the grease
interceptor, but not less often than every 30 days if grease problems are
found. This maintenance shall be performed by the user at their expense. The
Building Inspector will allow the use of an automatic grease separator system
under the following conditions:
      (1)   A food establishment has physical limitations creating a hardship
condition which prohibits installing a properly sized in-ground grease trap.
      (2)   The sizing of an automatic grease separator system will be
according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
      (3)   The food establishment manager/staff signs a log certifying each
daily, weekly, and quarterly maintenance of the automatic grease separator
system has been done according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
   (D)   The POTW Director, in his or her discretion, may grant a variance to a
user as it relates to the required grease trap/interceptor cleanout
requirements based upon certified documentation that the requirements of this
chapter impose an unnecessary or unreasonable burden on the user. The POTW
Director may rescind or modify such variance if the quantity or concentration
of the user’s discharge has changed or causes a detriment to the city’s sewer
collection system.
   (E)   Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches shall be
provided over each interceptor chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes
shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to
prevent water inflow and infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily
removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater
sampling activities.
   (F)   Minimum design capability of the interceptor must be in accordance
with the North Carolina edition of the International Plumbing Code and provide
for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at actual peak flow or 12
minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as predicted by the
Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent and effluent
baffle with 20% of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for
sludge to settle and accumulate.

51.012. The amount charged per pound of excess will be set forth in the
Schedule of Charges And Fees.
      (1)   The volume of flow used in determining the total discharge of
wastewater for payment of user charges and surcharges shall be based on the
following:
         (a)   Metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter
readings maintained by the city; or
         (b)   If required by the city or at the individual dischargers option,
other flow monitoring devices which measure the actual volume of wastewater
discharged to the sewer. Such devices shall be accessible and safely located,

   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
51.064. The notification requirements in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
51.060,
51.062, and
51.063.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (A) above
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e). discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in
a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one time notification. Subsequent
months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any
hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW
Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision-does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

   (A)   The city requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following

   The city will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city approval authority and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, or in the performance of any of their duties. The city approval
authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city,
approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the POTW
Director's, approval authority's or EPA's access to the user's premises shall
be a violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of
access. The city may make unannounced inspections at any time when there is
activity at the permitted facility.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
§ 51.082 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the POTW Director, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to
a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the POTW Director,
approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the
Superior Court of Justice of Wayne County.

permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall
be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction
unless the User specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the POTW Director that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data.
   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this regulation, the
national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, Non-discharge
permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions
of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in

industrial user has violated or is violating this regulation, wastewater
permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any
other pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the
date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user.
Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to §
51.100(D) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this chapter, or is in
noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW Director
determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least 10 days before the hearing. Service may be
made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the issuance of an administrative order under §
51.100 or the assessment of a civil penalty under §
51.101.
   (D)   Administrative orders. When the POTW Director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this regulation, permits or orders
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may
issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons
in noncompliance to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;

51.051(H).
   (E)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/
or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the POTW Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW Director
shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon
proof of the elimination of the non-compliant discharge. The industrial user
shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the
POTW Director prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The POTW Director
may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good
cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
      (1)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his discharge;
      (2)   Failure to report significant changes in operation, or wastewater
constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge,
conditions of this chapter or any applicable state and federal regulations.
   Non-compliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination
of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause
under §
51.100 of this regulation why the proposed action should not be taken.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94; Am. Ord. 2007-45, passed 6-4-07)
§ 51.101 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Any user who is found to have failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued
hereunder, may be fined up to $25,000 per day per violation.
         (b)   Penalties between $10,000 and $25,000 per day per violation may
be assessed against a violator only if:
            1.   For any class of violation, only if a civil penalty has been
imposed against the violator within the five years preceding the violation; or
            2.   In the case of failure to file, submit, or make available, as
the case may be, any documents, data, or reports required by this chapter, or
the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, only if the POTW
Director determines that the violation was intentional and a civil penalty has
been imposed against the violator within the five years preceding the
violation.
      (2)   Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer
service charges and the POTW shall have such remedies for the collection of
such assessments as it has for collection of other service charges.
   (B)   In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the POTW Director
shall consider the following:
      (1)   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to the
public health, or to public or private property resulting from the violation;
      (2)   The duration and gravity of the violation;
      (3)   The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or on air
quality;
      (4)    The cost of rectifying the damage;
      (5)   The amount of money saved by noncompliance;
      (6)    Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally;
      (7)   The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply
with the pretreatment program;
      (8)   The costs of enforcement to the city.
   (C)   Appeals of civil penalties assessed in accordance with this section
shall be as provided in §
51.051(H).
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94; Am. Ord. 2007-45, passed 6-4-07)
§ 51.102 JUDICIAL REMEDIES.
   If any person violates this regulation, or any order or permit issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director, through
the City Attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or
equitable relief in the Superior Court of Justice for Wayne County.
   (A)   Criminal Violations. The District Attorney for the Wayne County
Judicial District may, at the request of the city, prosecute non-compliant
users who violate the provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B. [Note: Under North
Carolina law, it is a crime to negligently violate any term, condition, or
requirement of a pretreatment permit, or negligently fail to apply for a
pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B(f)), to
knowingly and willfully violate any term, condition, or requirement of a
pretreatment permit, or knowingly and willfully fail to apply for a
pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B(g), to
knowingly violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit
issued by local governments, or knowingly fail to apply for a pretreatment
permit, knowing at the time that a person is placed in imminent danger of death
or serious bodily injury, (G.S. § 143-215.6B(h)), and to falsify information
required under G.S. Article 21 of Chapter 143 (G.S. 143-215.6B(i).]
   (B)   Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user is in violation of the
provisions of this regulation or an order or permit issued hereunder, the POTW
Director, through the City Attorney, may petition the Superior Court of Justice
for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both as may be
appropriate, which restrains or compels the activities in question. In the
event the POTW chooses to correct the violation itself, the cost of such
correction may be added to the next scheduled sewer service charge payable by
the person(s) causing the violation. The POTW shall have such remedies for the
collection of such costs as it has for the collection or other sewer service
charges.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
§ 51.103 OTHER REMEDIES.
   (A)   Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user or establishment
is in violation of the provisions of this regulation or an order or permit
issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and
service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated consistent compliance.
   (B)   Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent
limitations of this regulation or of a permit or order issued hereunder, is
hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed
by the POTW Director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject
to the provisions of the appropriate city code governing such nuisances,
including reimbursing the POTW for any costs incurred in removing, abating or
remedying said nuisance.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94; Am. Ord. 2007-45, passed 6-4-07)
§ 51.104 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The POTW
Director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a non-
compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the POTW
Director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the POTW Director is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any non-compliant user.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE
§ 51.110 ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   At least annually, the POTW Director shall publish in the largest daily
newspaper circulated in the service area, a list of those industrial users
which were found to be in significant noncompliance, also referred to as
reportable noncompliance in 15A NCAC 2H.0903(b)(10), with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements, during the previous 12 months.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 51.120 UPSET PROVISION.
   (A)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection (B) below are met.
   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW
Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
§ 51.121 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS DEFENSE.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
51.010(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
51.010(A)(1)(b)(2), (3), and (5) through (7) if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
§ 51.122 BYPASS.
   (A)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of subsections (B) and (C) of this section.
   (B)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW Director, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of this time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW Director may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (B) of
this section.
      (2)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Director determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in subsection (C)(1) of this section.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE PLAN
§ 51.130 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   Federal and state pretreatment regulations, as well as Part III (B)(6)
of the city of Goldsboro's NPDES permit requires the city to take timely and
effective enforcement actions against significant industrial users (SIUs) for
failure to comply with pretreatment standards and requirements. Federal and
state regulations also require each POTW, with an approved pretreatment
program, to develop and implement an enforcement response plan (ERP). By
regulation, this plan must:
      (1)   Describe how the POTW will investigate instances of noncompliance;
      (2)   Describe the types of escalating enforcement responses the POTW
will take in response to all anticipated types of SIU violations and the time
periods within which responses will take place;
      (3)   Identify the official(s) responsible for each type of response; and
      (4)   Adequately reflect the POTW's primary responsibility to enforce all
applicable pretreatment requirements and standards.
   (B)   The purpose of the city of Goldsboro's enforcement response plan is
two-fold. First, to ensure compliance with federal and state regulations.
Second, to ensure that, if and when it is necessary for the city to enforce
pretreatment standards and requirements, all industries are treated in a fair
and equitable manner.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
§ 51.131 ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES AVAILABLE TO THE CITY.
   (A)   Sections
51.100 through
51.104 gives the Public Utilities Director the authority to take a wide variety
of enforcement actions. Each of these actions can be viewed as having a certain
degree of punitiveness. The city's enforcement response plan will utilize all
of the enforcement tools available to the Director in the system which outlines
escalating enforcement actions dependent on the nature of the violation and the
cooperativeness, or recalcitrance, of the violator. The following is a list of
remedies authorized by the sewer use ordinance and ordinance citation. It is
presented in order of punitiveness, least punitive first and most punitive
last.
      (1)   Notice of Violation §
51.100(A)
      (2)   Consent Order §
51.100(B)
      (3)   Administrative Order §
51.100(C)
      (4)   Show Cause Order/Hearing §
51.100(D)
      (5)   Emergency Suspensions (temporary) §
51.100(E)
      (6)   Termination of Permit (permanent) §
51.100(F)
      (7)   Civil Penalties §
51.101(A) and (B)
      (8)   Judicial Remedies §
51.102(A) and (B)
   (B)   In addition to the tools listed above, §
51.100 through
51.104 authorizes the Director to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000.00 per
day per violation. Civil penalties are normally used in conjunction with one of
the other eight activities listed above and the punitiveness of the penalty
depends on the dollar amount.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
§ 51.132 NONCOMPLIANCE DETERMINATIONS.
   The staff will generally investigate SIU compliance three ways: on site
inspections of the SIU, review of SIU self-monitoring data, and review of
compliance data collected by the city. Using the this chapter, as well as
guidance which has been provided by EPA and the Division of Environmental
Management, the city staff has identified four categories of permit
noncompliance. Below is a discussion of the types of violations within each
category and the city staff member responsibility for the initial compliance
determination for each violation type.
   (A)   Unpermitted discharges.
      (1)   Unpermitted discharges can result from several activities. An SIU
might fail to obtain a permit prior to discharging to the wastewater treatment
plant. An SIU might discharge to a point in the collection system which is not
identified in the SIU's permit. An SIU might begin to discharge a pollutant
which was previously identified as absent by the industry. Also, an SIU might
continue to discharge when its permit has expired.
      (2)   Unpermitted discharges will normally be discovered during the
inspection of an industry. The inspector will be responsible for determining
the severity of the violation during his inspection. The severity will normally
depend on whether the unpermitted discharge poses an immediate threat to the
POTW or the environment and whether the industry was unaware of the
requirements or was seeking to avoid the regulations.
   (B)   Permit noncompliance. Noncompliance with an SIU's pretreatment permit
falls into four areas: limits violations, monitoring violations, reporting
violations, and violations of permit conditions.
      (1)   Permit limit noncompliance. Permit limit violations are fairly
straight forward and the severity depends on whether the violation is
considered reportable noncompliance (RNC). RNC is defined in North Carolina's
general pretreatment regulations [15A NCAC 2H.0903(b)(10)]. It is the
Pretreatment Coordinator's responsibility to evaluate compliance with
pretreatment limitations each time data is received and at the end of each
semiannual reporting period.
      (2)   Self-monitoring noncompliance.
         (a)   Noncompliance with monitoring occurs when an SIU fails to
conduct all of the self-monitoring required by its pretreatment permit. The
severity of the violations depends on how much self-monitoring was actually
completed. If the SIU conducted less than 80% of the sampling and analyses
required in a six-month period, the violation is considered significant or RNC.
         (b)   Each time a self-monitoring report is received from an SIU, it
is the responsibility of the Pretreatment Coordinator to compare the report to
the permit requirement sand evaluate compliance with monitoring requirements.
      (3)   Reporting violations.
         (a)   Reporting violations occur when an SIU fails to provide
information which is required by the permit within the time period stated in
the permit or when the information is incomplete or false. Reports required by
the permit can include self- monitoring reports, spill prevention plans,
baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, and sludge handling
plans. In the case of late or incomplete reports, the severity of the violation
depends on the length of time the report is late. If a complete report is not
submitted within 30 days of the due date, the violation is considered RNC.
Knowingly submitting false information is always considered a significant
violation.
         (b)   It is the Pretreatment Coordinator's responsibility to track the
report due dates included in the pretreatment permits and to evaluate
compliance in terms of the tardiness and completeness of the submission.
      (4)   Violations of other permit conditions. The pretreatment permits
issued by the city contain about 20 conditions which do not fall into the
category of limits, monitoring, or reporting requirements. For example, the
pretreatment permit prohibits slug loads and requires the SIU to properly
operate its pretreatment facility. Violations of these conditions would
normally be discovered as part of an inspection or in conjunction with another
enforcement action. The Pretreatment Coordinator is responsible for evaluating
compliance with these requirements and the severity of the violation is
determined by the Director.
   (C)   Violations of enforcement orders.
      (1)   Violations of enforcement orders are actually very similar to
pretreatment permit noncompliance in that they can be broken down into limits
violations (interim limits), monitoring violations (increased monitoring
required by the order), and reporting violations. In addition, violations of
enforcement orders would include missing milestone dates and noncompliance with
final limits once the order has expired. However, all violations of enforcement
orders, with the exception of interim limits violations, are considered RNC.
Interim limit violations would not be considered significant if they did not
meet the criteria listed in 15A NCAC 2H.0903(b)(10)(A) and if the SIU paid the
stipulated penalty assessed.
      (2)   Once an SIU has been put on an enforcement order, the city's
initial response to violations becomes simply a matter of notifying the SIU of
the violation and collecting the stipulated penalty outlined in the order. It
is the Pretreatment Coordinator's responsibility to track compliance with the
order and notify the Director when penalties should be assessed. Once the
Director is informed of noncompliance with an order, he will determine whether
the violations are so severe as to warrant escalated enforcement. For example,
an escalated enforcement actions would be needed if it was clear that the SIU
could no longer meet the remaining milestone dates in the existing order.
(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)
§ 51.133 RESPONSES TO NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   In order to ensure that the city is taking timely and effective
enforcement actions, two tools will be employed - an enforcement response guide
in subsection (C) and an enforcement flowchart. The purpose of the enforcement
response guide (ERG) is to identify initial responses and time frames for each
of the types of violations discussed in §
51.132. Once the enforcement action is taken, the flow chart is used to
identify the more punitive action which would be taken if the SIU failed to
return to compliance as a result of the previous or initial action.
   (B)   As an example of how the ERG and flowchart can be used to determine
appropriate enforcement responses, consider an SIU which submits a self-
monitoring report which shows a violation. The ERG tells the Pretreatment
Coordinator to issue a notice of noncompliance within 14 days. The notice will
require the SIU to collect additional data to confirm compliance or
noncompliance. The next step is to determine if the SIU is in reportable
noncompliance (RNC) at the end of the six month reporting period. As indicated
by the flow chart, if the data does not show RNC, no action is required. If the
data does show RNC, a notice of violation (NOV) is issued. The ERG tells the
Pretreatment Coordinator that, in response to RNC with permit limits, an NOV
assessing a fine of $100 should be sent within 30 days of receiving all of the
data. The NOV requires the SIU to respond by indicating the cause and time
needed to correct the violation. If the time needed to correct the violation
was greater than 90 days, a consent order would be drafted. Hopefully the SIU
would comply with the consent order and the violation would be resolved.
However, if the SIU failed to meet the compliance date of the consent order,
the flow chart indicates that a notice to comply should be issued and the ERG
gives the Pretreatment Coordinator information on time frames, penalties, and
responses which should be included in the notice to comply. By using the
flowchart and ERG, a worst case scenario can be followed in a similar manner
through the issuance and violation of an administrative order, through a show
cause meeting and, eventually, to termination of service.

§ 52.06 BACKFLOW AND CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL.
   (A)   Introduction.
      (1)   This regulation shall apply to all users connected to the City of
Goldsboro's public water system.
      (2)   This regulation complies with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act
(P.L. 93-523), the North Carolina State Administrative Code (Title 15A,
Subchapter 8C), and the North Carolina State Building Code (Volume II) as they
pertain to cross connections with the public water supply.
   (B)   Purpose.  The purpose of this regulation is:
      (1)   To define the city as the water purveyor in the elimination of all
cross-connections within the public water system;
      (2)   To protect the public water system of the city from the possibility
of contamination or pollution by isolation within the customers’ internal
potable water distribution system(s), or the customers’ private water system
(s), such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow into the public water
system;
      (3)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, direct or indirect, between the city’s
customers' potable water system(s) and non-potable water systems, plumbing
fixtures and industrial piping systems; and
      (4)   To provide a continuing inspection program of cross-connection
control; which will systematically and effectively prevent potential
contamination or pollution of the public water system.
   (C)   Responsibility. The city endeavors to protect its public water system
from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or
pollutants through the water service connection. If the city requires an
approved backflow prevention assembly to protect the water distribution system,
the city will give notice to the customer to install an approved backflow
prevention assembly(s). If the assembly(s) is not installed as required by the
city, the water service may be disconnected until such assembly(s) has been
properly installed.
   (D)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
   AIR GAP (AG). The unobstructed, vertical, physical separation between the
lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing
fixture, or other vessel and the flood level rim of said receiving vessel. An
approved AIR GAP, shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, as
measured vertically above the overflow rim of the vessel. In no case shall the
AIR GAP be less than one inch.
   APPROVED.  Accepted by the city as meeting an applicable specification(s)
stated or cited in this regulation, or as suitable for the proposed use.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water supply on or available to the consumer's
premises other than the city's approved public water supply.
   BACKFLOW.  The reversal of the normal direction of flow of water caused by
either backpressure or backsiphonage.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTER. An assembly or means designed to prevent backflow.
   BACKPRESSURE. Backpressure occurs when the customer's water system pressure
exceeds the water purveyor's system pressure. This can occur through an
increase in the downstream pressure, a decrease in the water purveyor's
pressure or a combination of both. Increases in the customer's water pressure
above the water purveyor's pressure can be created by booster pumps,
temperature increases (such as in a boiler), head pressure caused by elevation
and the like.
   BACKSIPHONAGE. Backflow caused by negative or reduced pressure in the supply
piping. BACKSIPHONAGE occurs when the supply line pressure falls below
atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi). Decreases in the pressure of the potable water
system can be caused by fire fighting, flushing of a water main, a break in the
water main, water mains being shut down for maintenance and the like.
   CERTIFIED TESTER. An individual who has demonstrated competency to test and
repair backflow prevention assemblies as required by the city. Each person who
is certified to make competent test, or to repair, overhaul and make reports on
backflow prevention assemblies shall be knowledgeable of applicable laws, rules
and regulations, shall be a licensed plumber or must hold a certificate of
completion from an approved training program in testing and repair of backflow
prevention assemblies and have at least two years experience under and be
employed by a state licensed plumber.
   CONTAINMENT. Preventing the impairment of the potable water supply by
installing an approved backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.
   CONTAMINATION.  An impairment of the quality of the potable water, which
creates a potential or actual hazard to the public health through the
introduction of hazardous or toxic substances or waterborne health hazards in
the form of physical or chemical contaminants or biological organisms and
pathogens.
   CROSS-CONNECTION. Any actual or potential connection, link or structural
arrangement, direct or indirect, between the water purveyor's water supply and
any other source or system through which it is possible to introduce into any
part of the potable water system any substance other than the potable water
with which the system is supplied. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections,
removable sections, swivel or changeover devices and other temporary or
permanent devices through which or because of which backflow can or may occur
are considered to be cross-connections.
   CROSS-CONNECTIONS CONTROLLED. A water service connection between a potable
water system and a non-potable water system with an approved backflow
prevention assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will
continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   CUSTOMER. Any person, firm or corporation responsible for any property at
which water from the city public water system is received. In the absence of
other parties or the failure of other persons to accept the responsibilities
herein set forth, the owner of the private water system or property owner shall
be ultimately responsible.
   DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY (DCVA). An assembly consisting of two
independently operating spring loaded check valves with full flow
characteristic resilient seated shut-off valves on each side of the check
valves, plus four properly located resilient seated test cocks for the testing
of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance
specifications as determined by the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and
Hydraulic Research, University of Southern California. To be approved by the
city, these assemblies shall be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and
testing, and be installed horizontally, unless specifically approved for
vertical installation by the city.
   DOUBLE CHECK DETECTOR ASSEMBLY (DCDA). A specially designed assembly
composed of a line-size approved double-check valve assembly with a specific
bypass water meter and a meter-sized approved double-check valve assembly. This
assembly shall be used to protect against a moderate hazard.
   HAZARD, DEGREE OF. The potential risk to public health and the adverse
effect of the hazard upon the public potable water distribution system as
determined by the city.
      (1)   MODERATE HAZARD. An actual or potential threat of pollution or
other adverse effect to the physical properties of the water purveyor’s or the
customer’s potable water system.
      (2)   SEVERE HAZARD. An actual or potential threat of contamination of a
physical or toxic nature to the water purveyor's potable water system or to a
customer's potable water system that could cause a danger to health, serious
illness or death.
   ISOLATION. The act of confining a localized hazard at the source of the said
hazard within a plumbing or distribution system by installing approved backflow
prevention assembly(s).
   POINT OF SERVICE.  The point of service will generally be at the property
line of the customer, adjacent to the public right-of-way where the city water
mains are located, or at a point on the customer's property where the meter is
located.
   POLLUTION.  An impairment of the quality of the water to a degree that does
not create a hazard to the public health but which does adversely and
unreasonably affect the aesthetic qualities of such water.
   PRESSURE VACUUM BREAKER (PVB).  An assembly approved for residential lawn
sprinkler irrigation systems consisting of a spring loaded air-inlet valve,
with full flow characteristic resilient seated shut-off valves, one on the
inlet and one on the outlet side of the PVB, plus two properly located
resilient seated test cocks for testing the assembly. The entire assembly shall
meet the design and performance specifications as determined by the Foundation
for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research, University of Southern
California. It cannot be subjected to backpressure of any kind and shall be
installed at least 12 inches above the highest irrigation head and/or
downstream piping. Chemigation or aspiration of any herbicide, pesticide,
fungicide or fertilizer is not permitted for use with a PVB. To be approved by
the city, these assemblies shall be readily accessible for in-line maintenance
and testing, and be installed vertically in a location where no part of the
assembly will be submerged.
   PROCESS WATER. Water that goes through various procedures in the making or
treatment of a product.
   PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM.  The potable water system owned and operated by the
city. This system includes all distribution mains, lines, pipes, connections,
storage tanks and other facilities conveying potable water from the water plant
to the service connection of each customer.
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE ASSEMBLY (RP). An assembly consisting of two
independently operating spring loaded check valves with a hydraulically
operating, spring loaded mechanical differential pressure relief valve located
between the check valves, and at the same time lower than the first check
valve. The assembly shall include four properly located resilient seated test
cocks and full flow characteristic resilient seated shut-off valves at each end
of the assembly. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance
specifications as determined by the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and

§ 52.27 DECLARATION OF WATER SHORTAGE INTERRUPTIONS.
   (A)   Whenever the Mayor of the city is informed by the City Manager that
raw water supplies are well below the level necessary to meet basic water needs
and that serious shortages exist, the Mayor is empowered to declare by this
subchapter that a water shortage interruption situation exists. Under a water
shortage interruption situation, it is contingent upon the city to provide
critically-limited water supplies, in order to preserve public health and
safety of its citizens.
   (B)   In addition, the Mayor (or City Manager or his or her designee) is
authorized to call upon all water customers to employ water shortage
interruption measures as outlined in Addendum 4. These restrictions shall
continue until this phase is ended by the announcement by the city that water
service interruptions conditions no longer exist.
   (C)   If the water shortage crisis indicates that despite conservation
measures in effect, the water supply cannot meet the city's water consumption,
broader water main interruptions may be required which will affect water users.
The following provisions shall govern the implementation of temporary service
interruptions.
      (1)   In order to effectuate compliance with this subchapter, the city is
hereby authorized and required to plan and implement temporary service
interruptions to all or part of its water supply system, as may be deemed
appropriate, when any and/or all of the following conditions are determined to
exist:
         (a)   The mandated reduction in system-wide usage has not been
achieved; and/or
         (b)   The mandated reduction in system-wide water usage has been
achieved, but has failed to have a significant impact in extending limited
water supplies; and/or
         (c)   Temporary service interruptions are necessary in order to
further extend limited and/or dwindling water supplies.
      (2)   In the event it is determined that temporary service interruptions
are necessary, the city shall notify its customers through the public media
(newspapers, radio, and television), at least one day prior to the temporary
service interruptions, that a planned, temporary service interruption is to be
imposed. Such notice shall:
         (a)   State the day or days when the planned, temporary service
interruption will occur;
         (b)   State the time(s) when such planned, temporary service
interruptions will commence, and the time(s) such interruption will cease;
         (c)   State whether the planned, temporary service interruptions are
to be imposed on the entire system, or part thereof, and, if only part(s) of
the system will experience planned, temporary service interruptions, identify
geographic boundaries within which such interruptions will occur; and
         (d)   Advise all customers within the areas affected by planned,
temporary service interruptions how to treat any water received from the
system, for human consumption, during the period(s) of such interruptions and
for such additional time as may be necessary until full pressure is restored to
the system.
      (3)   If a planned, temporary service interruption is imposed as
authorized and required by this subchapter, the city must provide for the
continued delivery of water to health care facilities within the area(s)
affected by such interruptions, by means of any adequate, alternative delivery
measures that may be necessary.
      (4)   If a planned, temporary service interruption is implemented, the
city must make provision, by any means possible, for the continued delivery of
such water as may be necessary for the proper operation of sewage collection,
treatment, and disposal systems and facilities.
      (5)   If a planned, temporary service interruption is implemented, the
city shall impose a temporary moratorium on all new service connections to the
city's water system.

§ 52.28 WATER SHORTAGE RATES.
   Upon the declaration of a water supply shortage as provided in §§
52.17 through
52.27, the governing body of the city shall have the power to adopt shortage
water rates by ordinance designed to conserve water supplies. Such rates may
provide for, but not be limited to: (a) higher charges per unit for increasing
usage (increasing block rates); (b) extra charges for use in excess of a
specified level (excess demand surcharge).

§ 52.29 RETURN-TO-NORMAL.
   When it is determined that the water shortage has abated, the reverse order
of water conservation stages will be followed until a full return-to-normal is
achieved. For example, the water shortage crisis phase will go to a less
restrictive mandatory conservation phase, then to a much less restrictive
voluntary conservation phase until a return-to-normal condition is reached. It
is the city's intent to remain for an adequate period of time at each water
conservation phase to avoid oscillating back and forth between water shortage
phases and the return-to-normal condition.

§ 52.30 PUBLIC COMMENT.
   The city will provide a public comment period to review revisions to this
subchapter. A public hearing date will be set and advertised at least ten days
prior to the public hearing. Interested citizens will be provided with the
proposed ordinance revisions by request to the City Clerk. After the public
hearing comments have been taken into consideration, the City Council may adopt
the revised ordinance.
(Ord. 2009-60, passed 8-3-09)
ADDENDUM 1: VOLUNTARY CONSERVATION PHASE
   Direct users to adopt the following conservation measures:
   (A)   Take five-minute showers instead of baths.
   (B)   Do not let water run while shaving, brushing teeth, and rinsing
dishes.
   (C)   Keep a bottle of chilled water in the refrigerator for drinking, so as
not to run the tap to get cold water.
   (D)   Only run dishwasher or clothes washing machine when have full loads.
Washing dishes by hand saves about 25 gallons (don't let tap run).
   (E)   Inspect and repair leaky valves on faucets and toilets.
   (F)   Install water-saving devices on toilets and showers. (Such as place an
item in the toilet tank (do not use a brick) to reduce amount of water per
flush, install low-flow shower heads and the like. Look for water conservation
features if buying new water-consuming appliances.)
   (G)   Do not allow children to play with hose or sprinklers.
   (H)   Limit lawn and outside plant watering, then only at night between 5:00
p.m. and 12:00 midnight, no more than three times per week, to avoid water
evaporation loss. In an hour, 600 gallons of water can be wasted.
   (I)   Position sprinklers to water the lawn, to avoid water spraying on
pavement.
   (J)   Avoid watering on windy days when the wind not only blows water off
target, but also causes excess evaporation.
   (K)   Know how to turn off an automatic sprinkler system in case of rain.
There are automatic rain sensors available that prevent automatic sprinkler
from starting if it has just rained.
   (L)   Use an alarm clock or a timer to remind one to shut off hose-fed
sprinklers that don't have timers.
   (M)   Consider delaying the seeding or sodding of new lawns.
   (N)   Golf courses and athletic fields shall attempt to reduce water
consumption by 50%.
   (O)   While waiting for water to get hot, catch running water from sink and
tub faucets and use for animals to drink or to water plants.
   (P)   Use a broom instead of water to wash down sidewalks, patios, and
driveways.
   (Q)   Do not fill empty swimming pools or wading pools.
   (R)   Do not use the toilet as a wastebasket. Put tissues and trash in a
trash can.
   (S)   Limit toilet flushes.
   (T)   Use disposable and biodegradable dishes where possible.
   (U)   Be ready to catch rainfall that occurs. Place containers under drain
spouts.
   (V)   Use pistol-grip nozzles on hoses to avoid waste when watering flowers
and shrubs.
   (W)   Aerate lawns by punching holes six inches apart. This allows water to
reach roots rather than run off surfaces.
   (X)   Keep sprinkler heads clean to prevent uneven watering.
   (Y)   Adjust hose to simulate a gentle rain. Sprinklers that produce a fine
mist waste water through evaporation.
   (Z)   Install automatic shut off devices on sprinkler systems.
   (AA)   The city will delay the implementation of landscape code requirements
until the next planting season after return-to-normal condition. However, a
performance bond will be required for any landscaping required by the city’s
Unified Development Ordinance.

§ 53.17 CONDITIONS FOR MAKING WATER AND SEWER CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   For residential and commercial property:
      (1)    Access to water and sewer lines will be provided to a requesting
developer or private property owner outside the city limits only upon the
receipt and approval of a voluntary petition for annexation by a developer or
private property owner who are deemed the same.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the city to extend water and
sewer lines, if funds are available, from its current location to the existing
city limits. The city shall assess the costs of such extension (except for
costs incurred for the oversizing of lines due to projected expansions) to the
abutting property owners located within the city.
      (3)   The requesting developer shall then be entitled to access to the
water and sewer lines, and may gain such access on the property described in a
voluntary annexation petition. The developer shall be required to pay all costs
incurred with the extension of the line from the city limits to the points of
disbursement on his property. If the property of the developer is not
contiguous to the city limits, he shall likewise be responsible for extending
the line to the nearest point of access on his property outside the city
limits. The developer shall not be responsible for the payment of the costs of
an oversized line.
      (4)   It shall be the responsibility of the developer to extend all lines
within his subdivision, tract or property to ensure water and sewer service to
all existing or potential development within the property described in the
petition for voluntary annexation.
      (5)   Although the city shall be dedicated to the concept of making such
extensions possible, the city shall not be responsible for such extensions if
funds are not reasonably available. In the event that there are not reasonable
funds available for the extensions of such lines, the city shall be entitled to
consider and implement one or more of the following options:
         (a)   The city may deny the petition for annexation.
         (b)   The city may negotiate with the developer and reach an agreement
whereby the developer will pay the city's cost which would normally be incurred
under this chapter and may be reimbursed at a later date as funds become
available to the city.
         (c)   The city may reach an agreement with the developer to accept the
petition for annexation without the extension of any water and sewer lines.
         (d)   The city may reach a contractual agreement with the developer
whereby the acceptance of the petition for voluntary annexation will be delayed
until some future date upon the city's extension of the lines.
      (6)   A developer who participates in the costs of the extension of lines
will be entitled to recapture his costs through frontage fees. Frontage fees
will be established by the city based upon the actual cost of the construction
per front foot. The recapture of costs of construction shall not include,
however, any federal or state funds which may be available to the developer in
the extension of these lines. The developer shall not be entitled to recover a
frontage fee based upon his own front footage, nor shall he be entitled to
recover frontage fees in excess of his actual cost.
      (7)   (a)   The frontage fee charged by the city shall be based upon the
then current cost of construction rather than the original cost of
construction. The city shall establish by resolution the frontage fee to be
charged a developer, property owner or lessee. The cost incurred by virtue of
the installation of oversized lines shall not be charged as a part of the
frontage fee. Any monies collected in excess of the actual cost of construction
and refunded to the developer or any funds received from frontage fees after 25
years shall be retained by the city. In addition, if the city is unable to
locate the developer after reasonable inquiry, any monies collected for
frontage fees which would be refunded to the developer may be retained by the
city after 30 days written notice to the developer's last known address.
         (b)   Frontage fees shall be collected by the city for a period not to
exceed 25 years. These frontage fees shall be collected at the time that a tap
is made, provided however, when the frontage fee exceeds $500 for residential
use and $1,000 for nonresidential use, then and in that event the frontage fees
may be paid in five annual equal installments and shall bear interest at the
same rate as that charged by the city for unpaid taxes from the date said tap
is made. The first installment shall be due and payable on the date a water or
sewer account is opened with the city and the subsequent installment and
interest payments shall be due and payable on the same day of the same month in
each successive year until the indebtedness is paid in full. If any installment
with interest is not paid when due, it shall be subject to the same penalties
as are now prescribed by law for unpaid taxes, in addition to the interest
herein provided for and upon the failure to pay any installment, the entire
balance shall be due and payable without further notice.
         (c)    When an installment account is requested for the payment of
frontage fees, a developer, owner and/or lessee shall be required to execute an
agreement with the city establishing a lien upon the property served by the
utility. The lien shall continue until the amount of said installments,
including interest, has been paid in full. Further, if any annual installment,
plus interest, is 90 days in arrears, the water and/or sanitary sewer service
to said property may be terminated by the city. Any reconnection cost shall be
made at the user's expense.
      (8)   If a developer or private property owner desires city water or
sewer service from lines for which there are no assessment rolls or utility
agreements, a frontage fee based upon the current cost of construction as per
City Council resolution will be charged. This entire fee will be retained by
the city.
      (9)   There may arise certain requests for water and/or sanitary sewer
line extensions which the developer cannot reasonably fund. For example, there
are certain natural and manmade barriers existing in and around the city such
as swamps, creeks, rivers, railroads, highways, and the like, where the costs
of extension of lines across such barriers would be extremely high. It is the
intent and concept of this chapter that the city should consider the
possibilities of future expansions and resulting benefits in determining
whether or not to participate or accept a petition for voluntary annexation
from a developer whose line would be extended across such barriers. The city
may negotiate solutions to line extension problems which arise by virtue of
these barriers.
   (B)   For industrial property:
      (1)   An industry will be defined as listed under Division D,
Manufacturing, of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, published by
the Office of the Management and Budget of the United States Government.
      (2)   The city will agree to provide access to water and sewer lines to
any industry requesting such extension, subject to available capacity, provided
that the industry locates within three miles of the city limits.
      (3)   An industry requesting access to water and sewer lines will be
granted such access upon execution of a formal agreement with the city to file
a petition for voluntary annexation on or before the date occupancy begins.
      (4)   It shall be the responsibility of the developer to pay for the
extension of water and sewer lines from the point of nearest access to its
property, but the city shall agree to reimburse the developer for such costs in
accordance with this chapter and formula provided for the payment of frontage
fees for residential and commercial development. If the developer is in fact
the county, the developer will be responsible for the extension of water and
sewer lines, including any oversized lines to be required for future
development. In addition, the operation and maintenance of pump lift stations
constructed relative to these lines outside of the city limits would be borne
by the county until properly for which pump lift station was installed is
annexed. If the developer is in fact a private developer, then it shall be the
responsibility of the city to bear the costs of any oversized lines required by
it. However, the county will also be entitled to the recoupment of its
expenses, including oversized lines, through frontage fees in accordance with
the policy and formula described for residential and commercial development.
Recapture of the expenses of oversized lines shall be based upon the front foot
cost of the line, excluding oversizing, plus the line’s future inflated cost
not to exceed the original front foot cost of the oversized line.
      (5)   Any industry located outside the city limits obtaining access to
water and/or sewer facilities shall continue to pay revenues based upon the
rates then in effect and shall continue to pay such prevailing rates until its
annexation into the city pursuant to the petition for voluntary annexation.
      (6)   The following parcels within the ParkEast Industrial Park are
exempt from the annexation requirements set forth above: ParkEast Lot 7,
ParkEast Lot 9, ParkEast Lot 18 and the parcel in ParkEast identified as Wayne
County PIN 351991580.
   (C)   Every person owning a house, apartment house, storehouse, restaurant
or any building inside the city limits used for sleeping quarters or any
building where any persons are employed, which building abuts or adjoins a
street or alley along which there is public water or sewer, shall, within 30
days from the date of legal notice served by the City Plumbing Inspector or
other authorized deputy, have sewer and water connections made to the building
or house. All such connections must be made according to the requirements of
this subchapter in the interest of public health and safety.
   (D)   The permission to connect will be conditioned upon the premises being
supplied with city water and sewer and upon the house plumbing being installed
in accordance with this subchapter.
   (E)   Applications for such connections shall be made at the revenue office
application window and service will not be turned on until the certificate from
the inspections division is received that the house plumbing has been properly
installed.
   (F)   The city reserves the right to change the rate or to refuse to give
service where conditions herein mentioned are not met or where conditions are
such as to make such service impractical.

shall be at the expense of the consumer. The work of furnishing and installing
the service line from the main sanitary sewer line to the right-of-way line
shall be performed by the City Maintenance Division.
      (3)   The property owner shall pay in advance for new service lines which
are deemed the same.
('70 Code, § 25-33)
   (C)   Contents of permit application for water connection. All applications
for a permit to make connections with the water system shall be made at the
Office of the City Engineer. Such application shall fully describe the locality

§ 53.20 CITY ENGINEER TO GRANT PERMIT, CAUSE SERVICE LINES TO BE LAID;
OWNERSHIP OF SERVICE LINES; REVOCATION OF PERMIT, AND THE LIKE.
   The City Engineer may grant such permit and shall cause suitable water
service lines to be laid from the main water line to and including the curb
stop, which shall be located near the abutting public easement line or road
right-of-way, and be provided with a suitable meter box. The city retains

('70 Code, § 25-42) (Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82)
§ 53.26 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FEES.
   (A)   System development fees shall be charged with respect to new
development to fund costs of capital improvements to recoup a combination of
costs consisting of the cost of existing facilities which serve such new
development and the incremental cost of capital assets required for preserving
and/or providing additional system capacity. System development fees shall be
charged consistent with the requirements of G.S. Ch. 162A, Art. 8 as such may
be amended from time to time. Terms used in this section shall have the same
meanings as set forth in G.S. Ch. 162A, Article 8.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, NEW DEVELOPMENT includes any of the
following occurring after April 8, 2019 (the date the city began the written
analysis process required by G.S. § 162A-205) that increases the water and/or
sewer capacity necessary to serve that development:
         (a)   The subdivision of land;
         (b)   The construction, reconstruction, redevelopment, conversion,
structural alteration, relocation, or enlargement of any structure which
increases the number of service units; or
         (c)   Any use or extension of the use of land which increases the
number of service units.
   (B)   Beginning on the effective date of this section, system development
fees shall apply to all new developments except for fire line connections.
   (C)   System development fees shall not include, and separate charges may be
assessed for:
      (1)   A charge or fee to pay administrative, plan review, or inspection
costs associated with permits required for development.
      (2)   Tap or hookup charges for the purpose of reimbursing the city for
the actual costs of connecting the service unit to the system.
      (3)   Availability/capacity charges.
      (4)   Dedication of capital improvements onsite, adjacent, or ancillary
to a development absent a written agreement providing credit or reimbursement
to the developer pursuant to G.S. §§ 160A-320, 160A-499 or G.S. Ch. 160A, Art.
19, Part 3D as the same may be amended from time to time.
      (5)   Reimbursement to the city for its expenses in constructing or
providing for water or sewer utility capital improvements adjacent or ancillary
to the development if the owner or developer has agreed to be financially
responsible for such expenses; however, such reimbursement shall be credited to
any system development fee charged as required per G.S § 162-207(c).
   (D)   System development fees will not be charged on buildings or other
improvements constructed to replace like buildings provided that the
replacement will not result in any increased capacity requirements over that
required to serve the replaced building. System development fees are
transferable between locations on different parcels of property as long as the
parcels are contiguous or separated only by a street or alley and part of a
single or multi-phased project shown on an approved site plan at the time of
issuance of a building permit.
   (E)   For new development involving the subdivision of land, the system
development fee shall be collected at the later of the time of plat
recordation, or when water or sewer service is committed by the city.
      (1)   For all other new developments, system development fees are due at
the earlier of the time of application for connection of the individual unit of
development to the service or facilities, or when water or sewer service is
committed by the city.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, water service shall be deemed
committed by the city at such time as the Public Works Department has approved
the connection and building permit(s) for the development are issued. Fees
shall be assessed based on the schedule of fees in effect at the time the fees
are collected.
   (F)   Additions, alterations to or replacements or change in use of existing
buildings shall be required to pay a system development fee based on the rates
applicable at the time of connection or at the time such addition, alteration,
replacement or change in use is placed into service. When a change in use
occurs, the new use will pay the difference calculated between the existing use
and the proposed use.
   (G)   Buildings that contain more than one use shall have the system
development fee calculated from the sum of each use in the building.
   (H)   The system development fee shall be paid for connections to the city
municipal water system based on the customer's calculated anticipated daily
flow rate in gallons per day (GPD), in an amount not to exceed the calculated
charge based on the cost per gallon development costs as defined herein
multiplied by the daily flow rate set out in the North Carolina Administrative
Code sections referenced herein. The system development fee shall be the same
regardless of the customer's location inside or outside the municipal limits of
the city.
   (I)   System development fees shall be based on the calculated (GPD) flow
rate of the anticipated use or increase in use of the proposed structure. Flow
rates shall be determined in accordance with the flow rates established in the
North Carolina Administrative Code, 15A NCAC 2T.0114 and 15A NCAC 18C.0409 as
such may be amended from time to time. A licensed professional engineer is
required to calculate flow rates for other uses not included within the North
Carolina Administrative Code, 15A NCAC 2T.0114 and 15A NCAC 18C.0409. The City
Goldsboro shall not incur any expense associated with this requirement.
   (J)   In calculating system development fees with respect to new
development, the city will credit the value of costs in excess of the
development's proportionate share of connecting facilities required to be
oversized for use of others outside of the development. No credit shall be
applied, however, for water or sewer capital improvements on-site or to connect
new development to water or sewer facilities.
   (K)   All system development fees collected by the city shall be deposited
into the city's water and sewer system development capital reserve fund and
expended as provided by G.S. § 162A-211, as such may be amended from time to
time.
   (L)   The Water and Sewer System Development Fee Study prepared by Stantec,
and published April 10, 2023, is adopted to assist in establishing the City of
Goldsboro's Water and Sewer System Development Fee Charges, which are listed
below. The system development fee calculation shall be updated at least every
five years or as required by G.S. Ch. 162A, Art. 8.

RATES AND CHARGES
§ 53.35 PAYMENT OF BILLS; PENALTIES.
   Bills for water and sewer charges shall be rendered monthly and shall be
payable without discount within 20 days after the postmark date of the bill or
prior to the cut-off date stated on the bill. Failure to make payment by the
designated cut-off date shall result in severance of service subject to the
hearing requirements set forth in §
53.42. A penalty charge, established by City Council resolution, shall be
assessed against all accounts unpaid as of the designated cut-off date. Failure
to receive a bill does not entitle the consumer to exemption from penalty. A
charge, established by board resolution, will be assessed against each check
and sure-pay draft which is returned to the city due to insufficient funds.
('70 Code, § 25-98) (Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82)
§ 53.36 ADVANCE PAYMENT OF METER DEPOSIT.
   An advance payment of a water meter deposit shall be required upon opening a
utility account. This payment shall be based upon meter size and service
classification established by City Council resolution.
('70 Code, § 25-99) (Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82)
§ 53.37 WHEN ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO BE APPLIED TO CURRENT BILL.
   Upon severance of service for any reason, the advance payment shall be
applied to the current bill and to any arrearages. Any balance after clearance
of account shall be refunded to the customer.
('70 Code, § 25-100) (Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82)
§ 53.38 WAIVER OF ADVANCE PAYMENT.
   An advance payment is waived for water consumption by public utilities and
organizations of the U.S. Government, the state and the county.
('70 Code, § 25-101) (Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82)
§ 53.39 TRANSFER SERVICE FEES.
   A fee, as established by City Council resolution, shall be assessed each
utility customer transferring service within the city's systems.
('70 Code, § 25-102) (Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82)
§ 53.40 WATER SERVICE CHARGE GENERALLY, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CITY.
   The water service for the city shall be as follows:
   (A)   Availability:
      (1)   This schedule is available to all domestic, commercial and
industrial water service.
      (2)   Under no instances will water purchased from the city be resold by
the customer to another purchaser.
      (3)   Two or more dwellings, apartments or stores or combination of
dwellings, apartments or stores will not be permitted on the same meter unless
account is opened by the property owner.
      (4)   (a)   Water customers of the city shall be classified according to
their average monthly water consumption. Utility user classifications and their
corresponding monthly water consumption ranges are as follows:
         Classification            Consumption per 100 Cubic Feet
         Grade A               0 - 40
         Grade B               41 - 166
         Grade C               167 - 333
         Grade D               334 - 667
         Grade E               668 - 1,334
         Grade F               1,335 - Over
         Grade G (with sewer)              6,000 - Over
         (b)   Payment for water will be based upon a flat rate established for
each grade. Customers assigned a grade will pay the corresponding rate for each
100 cubic feet of water consumed. If during the year a consumer's water usage
varies from the grade assigned, this usage, nevertheless, will be billed at the
rate established for the assigned grade. All residential customers will be
assigned a Grade A classification. All new nonresidential customers will be
assigned a classification based upon their projected bi-monthly water
consumption. At the conclusion of six months this classification will be
reexamined, taking into consideration the users actual water usage in order to
determine its appropriateness. If the actual water consumption does not justify
the grade assigned, a grade adjustment will be made. All classifications other
than those assigned residential consumers will be reviewed annually in order to
determine the accuracy based upon the volume of water used by the consumer for
the previous year.
      (5)   For customers outside the city the monthly water rate shall be
established by City Council resolution. No bill shall be rendered for less than
an amount established annually by City Council resolution. The rate established
for Grade G is effective only for customers using city sewer services.
   (B)   Applicability. This schedule applies to all water supplied to the
customer's premises at one point of delivery through one meter.
   (C)   Type of service. The volume of water flow and pressure at the point of
delivery, location of meter, shall be in accordance with the city's standard
practices.
   (D)   Rate. For customers inside the city the monthly water rate shall be
established by board resolution. No bill shall be rendered for less than an
amount established by City Council resolution.
('70 Code, § 25-110) (Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82)
§ 53.41 CHARGES FOR SANITARY SEWER.
   (A)   Sanitary sewer service charge generally, inside and outside city. Any
person discharging waste water into the sanitary sewer of the city, except as
indicated in division (B) of this section shall pay a sewer service charge
established by City Council resolution. The charges shall be based upon the
metered water consumption.
('70 Code, § 25-120)
   (B)   No sanitary sewer charge where service is not rendered inside and
outside city. Any person using water supplied by the city utility system but
not discharging waste water into the sewer system of the city shall not be
charged a sewer service charge provided that a sanitary sewer line is not
available to serve the property. In instances where a sanitary sewer line is
available to serve the property but the property owner decides not to connect
to the sewer line, a minimum bi-monthly sanitary sewer bill shall be assessed,
as established by City Council resolution, against the resident if he is the
property owner. This requirement will become effective five years after
annexation in order for property owners to plan for and amortize septic tanks.
('70 Code, § 25-121)
   (C)   Charges to commercial or industrial consumers. Any commercial or
industrial consumer of city water that retains 75% or 30,000 gallons per day or
more of its water consumption in the preparation of its product, may supply the
city with engineering documentation as prepared by a registered engineer of the
percentage of its water usage actually discharged into the city's sanitary
sewer system. This percentage will be applied to the customer's average daily
water consumption derived from its monthly water consumption bill in order to
determine the number of gallons of water actually not being discharged into the
sanitary sewer system on a daily basis. Where a measuring device is necessary
to so determine the actual use of the sewer, the consumer shall be required to
bear the cost of the installation and maintenance of such measuring device.
Upon acceptance by the city of such statistical data, said sanitary sewer bill
will be computed at the sanitary sewer rate established by City Council
resolution based upon the estimated percentage of water consumption actually
discharged into the sanitary sewer system.
('70 Code, § 25-122)
   (D)   Action taken upon failure to pay sanitary sewer service; reinstatement
charges.
      (1)   Any person failing to pay the sewer service charge as set forth by
City Council resolution shall:
         (a)   If a consumer of the city revenue office, have his water
disconnected;
         (b)   If not a consumer of the city revenue office, have his sanitary
sewer service connection severed and blocked.
      (2)   Where it becomes necessary to disconnect and block a sanitary sewer
connection, the person or persons desiring to reinstate sewer service shall pay
to the city an amount established by City Council resolution for disconnection
and re-establishing such service.
('70 Code, § 25-123)
   (E)   Fire suppression fee outside city. The city has assumed a substantial
financial responsibility in constructing the water facility and its
distribution system. As an integral part of the distribution system, the water
facility necessarily has maintained a reserve water capacity for the purpose of
fire suppression. Although users outside the territorial limits of the city are
currently paying double rates, these rates provide only a very small portion of
the costs incurred for fire protection. This excess capacity is not recouped
through water and sewer rates, but is built into the system to provide
sufficient capacity in the event of the occurrence of fire, not only within the
city, but outside the city as well. There is only a minimal cost in the
maintenance of a capacity sufficient for fire suppression purposes for
residential dwellings. The needed capacity for fire suppression capability for
industrial or large plants and businesses is substantial. Therefore, the city
establishes an annual fire suppression fee for all users of water located
outside the city limits whose plant or facility exceeds 5,000 square feet. The
fire suppression fee is based on a rate established by board resolution for
such users. Such fee will be assessed on a fiscal year basis and is due and
payable July 1 of each calendar year. Fees issued for any business located
beyond the city limits and connecting to the city water system on or after
January 1 of a fiscal year shall have their fire suppression fee prorated at
50% of their normal fee for that year.
('70 Code, § 25-124)
(Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82; Am. Ord. 2002-65, passed 7-15-02)
§ 53.42 DISCONNECTION FOR LATE PAYMENT.
   (A)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city's form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address,
room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
      (1)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set forth
on the bill; and
      (2)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second bill
will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid within
ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be discontinued for
nonpayment; and
      (3)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his bill shall have
a right to a hearing at which time he may be represented in person and by
counsel or any other person of his choosing and may present orally or in
writing his complaint and contentions to the city official in charge of utility
billing. This official shall be authorized to order that the customer's service
not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make a final determination
of the customer's complaint.
   (B)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained; only
questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence of
payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.
   (C)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility service
to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only after
all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on charge in
the sum of $20.

(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17; Am. Ord. 2018-3, passed 1-22-18)
§ 54.03 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY ESTABLISHED; ADMINISTRATION; POWERS AND
DUTIES.
   (A)   The City Council hereby establishes a stormwater management utility to
carry out the purposes, functions and responsibilities set forth in this
section. The governing body of the stormwater management utility shall be the
City Council. The City Manager shall administer the stormwater management
utility through the Public Works Department or such other departments and
divisions as the City Manager shall designate.
   (B)   The stormwater management utility shall have the following powers and
duties, subject to available revenues, which powers and duties are not
necessarily exclusive to the stormwater management utility.
      (1)   Stormwater management planning and preparation of comprehensive
watershed master plans for stormwater management.
      (2)   Regular inspections and maintenance of public stormwater management
facilities, and measures for the construction thereof, as well as regular
inspections of private stormwater management facilities.
      (3)   Maintenance and improvement of stormwater management facilities
that have been accepted by the city for purposes of stormwater management.
      (4)   Plan review and inspection of sediment control and stormwater
management plans, measures and practices.
      (5)   Retrofitting designated watersheds to reduce existing flooding
problems or to improve water quality.

(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17)
§ 54.04 BOUNDARIES AND JURISDICTION.
   The boundaries and jurisdiction of the stormwater management utility shall
extend to the corporate limits of the city, as they may exist from time to
time, and such areas lying outside the corporate limits of the city as shall be
approved by the City Council.
(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17)
§ 54.05 STORMWATER UTILITY SERVICE FEES, RATES AND FEE SCHEDULE.
   (A)   Stormwater utility service fees will be determined and modified from
time to time by the City Council, so that the total revenues generated by these
fees will be used to pay such expenses as are reasonably necessary or
convenient in the management, administration, planning, regulatory compliance,
public education, construction, operation, and maintenance of the stormwater
system, and to pay principal of and interest on the debt incurred for
stormwater purposes.
   (B)   The fee system must be reasonable and equitable so that users pay to
the extent they contribute to the need for the stormwater management utility,
and so that fees bear a substantial relationship to the cost of service. The
City Council recognizes that these benefits, while substantial, in many cases
cannot be measured directly.
      (1)   Stormwater utility service fees shall accrue on the date determined
by City Council and set forth in the city schedule of rates and fees.
Stormwater utility service fees shall apply to all land as presented in §
54.04, whether public or private. Exemptions shall not be allowed based on age,
tax exemption, or other status of an individual or organization, except as set
forth in §
54.06.
      (2)   Stormwater utility service fees shall be based on a commonly
accepted rate unit for stormwater utilities, the equivalent residential unit
(ERU). The ERU is used to relate a base rate fee charged to a single-family
residential property to that charged to a non-single-family residential
property. The city’s ERU is 3,000 square feet of impervious surface area. The
ERU is determined by analyzing digital photographs and, for verification
purposes, performing field checks of a representative sample of single-family
residences within the city limits.
      (3)   Current stormwater utility fee rates are maintained in the city’s
Manual of Fees and Charges as part of the annual budget ordinance.
         (a)   All single-family residential properties will be charged the
corresponding rate for one ERU per month.
         (b)   All non single-family residential properties will be charged the
corresponding rate per ERU for the total number of ERUs on the property.
(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17; Am. Ord. 2018-3, passed 1-22-18; Am. Ord. 2024-1,
passed 1-22-24)
§ 54.06 CREDITS.
   (A)   Stormwater utility fee credits will be made available to developed
non-single family residential properties with structural BMPs that treat at
least 100% of runoff from the parcel. Credit for either a 10% or up to a total
of 20% reduction in the stormwater utility fee will be given, as long as the
property meets the eligibility requirements and the BMP meets the appropriate
treatment requirements and is being properly maintained. The credit percentage
is applied after the complete stormwater bill is calculated.
   (B)   Credit eligibility, application, approval, and expiration criteria and
procedures are documented in the stormwater utility fee policies.
(Am. Ord. 2018-3, passed 1-22-18)
§ 54.07 BILLING METHOD; RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.
   (A)   Bills for stormwater utility service fees shall be sent at regular,
periodic intervals. Stormwater utility service fees may be billed on a combined
utility bill that also contains fees for other utilities. Stormwater utility
service fees that are shown on a combined utility bill may be for a different
service period than that used for other utilities. For properties not having
otherwise active utility accounts, the fee for only stormwater utility service
accounts shall be billed to the owners or other persons listed on the real
property tax records. These accounts may be billed at different intervals than
the accounts receiving combined utility billings.
   (B)   As the general rule, stormwater utility bills for a property that
receives other city-provided utilities shall be sent to the customer receiving
such service. Billing for parcels or groups of adjacent and associated parcels
with multiple utility accounts may be done as a separate bill to each account
with the impervious area allocated among the accounts. Where this allocation
results in an amount of impervious area allocable to a given account that is
similar to that for a single family residential property, the account will be
billed the same way as a single family residential property.
   (C)   Townhouse and condominium developments and other similar properties
billed through individual utility accounts and not the property owner, but
containing impervious surface greater than one ERU in common ownership areas,
shall be charged a stormwater utility service fee for the total impervious
surface of all commonly-owned property within the development. The stormwater
utility bill for the commonly-owned areas shall be sent to the homeowners’
association.
   (D)   Stormwater utility service fees shall be due and payable as set forth
in the city schedule of rates and fees, a copy of which is located in the
office of the City Clerk, and is incorporated by reference herein.
(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17; Am. Ord. 2018-3, passed 1-22-18)
§ 54.08 BACKBILLING.
   Failure to receive a stormwater utility service fee bill is not
justification for nonpayment. The owner of each parcel of land shall be
ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no
bill is sent, the city may backbill for up to two years.
(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17)
§ 54.09 COMPLAINTS REGARDING A BILL.
   (A)   A customer having a grievance or complaint that a bill is excessive
must file written notice with the city’s finance office. If it is determined
that the bill is in error, an adjustment will be made according to the schedule
of rates and fees.
   (B)   No adjustment will be made for more than a three-year period.
(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17)
§ 54.10 APPEAL.
   (A)   For the purposes of the stormwater utility fee, any person who
disagrees with any final determination of the Public Works Director in the
administration of the fee with regards to classification of parcels, stormwater
fees, application of credits, final administrative policies, or procedures, and
other matters related to the administration of the stormwater utility have 30

76.99   Penalty and enforcement
§ 76.01 REGULATION OF GOLF CARTS.
   (A)   Necessity. The establishment of a golf cart ordinance is necessary to
address the interests of public safety. Golf carts, are not designed or
manufactured to be used on public streets, roads and highways, hereinafter
“road(s),” and the City of Goldsboro in no way advocates or endorses their
operation on roads. The city, by regulating such operation is merely trying to
address obvious safety issues, and adoption of this article is not to be relied
upon as a determination that operation on roads is safe or advisable if done in
accordance with this article. All persons who operate or ride upon carts on
roads do so at their own risk and peril and must be observant of and attentive
to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other
motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The city has no liability under any
theory for permitting carts to be operated on roads. Any person who operates a
cart must procure liability insurance on a par with that required for motor
vehicles.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance shall be to establish a golf
cart ordinance within the City of Goldsboro to promote the health, safety and
welfare of persons operating cart(s) within the city and to protect the safety
of their passengers and other users of roads.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and
phrases shall have the following meanings.
      DRIVER'S LICENSE. A valid license issued to operate a motor vehicle
issued by North Carolina or any other state.
      FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. Liability insurance coverage on a golf cart in
an amount not less than required by North Carolina law for motor vehicles
operated on public highways in the State of North Carolina.
      GOLF CART. A four-wheel vehicle designed and manufactured for operation
on a golf course for sporting or recreational purposes and that is not capable
of exceeding speeds of 20 MPH (G.S.  20-4.01(12a)). Vehicles resembling golf
carts which exceed this speed capacity must be registered with the NC
Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case they will essentially be regulated
as an automobile, and otherwise such vehicles will not be allowed on public
streets.
      OPERATOR. Only persons 16 years of age and older holding a valid driver's
license may operate a golf cart on roads.
(Ord. 2019-29, passed 6-2-19)
§ 76.02 RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE OPERATION OF GOLF CARTS.
   This section is to establish guidance in the interest of public safety.
Hereinafter:
   (A)   (1)   The owners of golf carts, not including similar vehicles which
have been registered with the state and have a license plate, must obtain a
permit from the city. Such permit is valid for one year only and must be
renewed annually. The permit fee is $25, and the permit shall be granted once
the owner has provided the following items and information:
         (a)   The full name of the owner and his or her address and telephone
number;
         (b)   A copy of the owner's driver's license;
         (c)   Proof of insurance covering the golf cart for injury to persons
and property on an equal level to that required for NC registered motor
vehicles;
         (d)   The names, addresses and ages of the persons authorized by the
owner to drive the golf cart, and a copy of their driver's licenses.
      (2)   A copy of the permit shall be on the golf cart at all times when it
is used on public streets.
   (B)   Golf carts shall not be operated on or alongside a public road or
street with a posted speed limit greater than 25 miles per hour.
   (C)   Golf carts may cross a road with a posted speed limit greater than 25
mph at a duly erected traffic control signal (such does not include stop signs
or yield signs, but is intended that crossing be at duly erected traffic
stoplights/control signals only). However, once this segment of road has been
traversed, the golf cart is still required to travel only on or along a roadway
with a speed limit of 25 mph or less. Golf carts must cross in a manner that is
the most direct route in order to decrease crossing distance, i.e. no riding
along a road or crossing at an angle. Under no circumstance is a golf cart
allowed to cross a controlled access facility (such as an interstate) other
than by means of bridges which cross over or under a controlled access
facility.
   (D)   Any person who operates a golf cart must be responsible for all
liability associated with operation of the golf cart and must have liability
insurance coverage which will cover the use of a golf cart in an amount not
less than required by North Carolina law for motor vehicles operated on public
highways in the State of North Carolina. Proof of such insurance shall be
readily available on the golf cart.
   (E)   Any person who operates a golf cart must be at least 16 years of age
or older. No person may operate a golf cart unless that person is licensed to
drive upon the public streets, roads and highways of North Carolina and then,
only in accordance with such valid driver's license. Golf cart operators must
carry their driver's license on their person at all times while operating a
golf cart on public roads.
   (F)   Any person who operates a golf cart on public streets and roads must
adhere to all applicable state and local laws, regulations and ordinances,
including but not limited to those banning the possession and use of alcoholic
beverages, and all other illegal drugs. In addition, no golf cart containing
any open container of alcohol shall be operated on public roads.
   (G)   The operator of the golf cart shall comply with all traffic rules and
regulations adopted by the State of North Carolina and the city which governs
the operation of motor vehicles.
   (H)   An operator may not allow the number of people in the golf cart at any
one time to exceed the maximum capacity specified by the manufacturer. The
operator shall not allow passengers to ride on any part of a golf cart not
designed to carry passengers, such as the part of the golf cart designed to
carry golf bags.
   (I)   In no instance shall a golf cart be operated at a speed greater than
20 miles per hour. No golf cart may be operated at a speed greater than
reasonable and prudent for the existing conditions.
   (J)   Golf carts must be operated at the right edge of the roadway and must
yield to all vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
   (K)   Golf carts must park in designated spaces in such a manner that
multiple golf carts can utilize the space. All parking rules and limits apply.
No parking on sidewalks is allowed.
   (L)   Golf carts must have basic and safety equipment supplied by the
manufacturer, including a vehicle identification or serial number. Such
equipment must include a rear view mirror and plainly visible rear reflectors.
   (M)   Golf carts without lights may be operated only during daylight hours.
Golf carts meeting the requirements set forth below may operate at any time:
      (1)   Golf carts having two operating headlights, one on each side of the
front of the golf cart and two operating tail lights, one on each side of the
rear of the cart, all four lights must be visible from a distance of 500 feet;
and
      (2)   If a mechanical turn signal indicator is not installed, then hand
signals are required for turns.

§ 76.99 PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute an infraction
in accordance with Chapter 20 of the North Carolina General Statutes, the
maximum penalty for which shall be $150.

§ 92.10 MEMORIALS, HEADSTONES, MONUMENTS, MARKERS AND CORNERSTONES.
   (A)   Memorials are defined as any headstone, monument, marker or other
object memorializing the deceased.
   (B)   Headstones are the most common form of memorial for a grave site to
mark a single grave. The headstone is typically a piece of rock (usually
granite or marble) that sits erect on the ground, allowing individuals who walk
past to easily identify the individual. Information carved into the headstone
can range from a person’s name, to birth date and death date, to a quote or
saying, to an engraving or inscription. A headstone is typically less ornate
than true monuments, and often times are smaller. It is common to have one
headstone per family (mother and father).
   (C)   Monuments are grander memorials, defined as larger upright headstones
or family burial lot markers, to identify two or more graves. They can come in
various shapes and sizes depicting saints, angels, animals, people, etc.
Depending on their size, they may require extensive or engineered foundations
for proper support. Such monuments will require the family or responsible party
to hire a reputable and qualified monument company to ensure proper
installation.
   (D)   Markers are smaller memorials that often sit flat, and can only be
read when standing straight above them. The same basic information carved into
a headstone can be printed or carved into a cemetery marker.
   (E)   Cornerstones are only permitted on burial lots with four or more grave
spaces, typically 10' x 20' or larger. They shall be granite or marble and must
be installed flush with the ground.
   (F)   All third party and/or contractor work, including installation,
maintenance, repair, cleaning, etc. of memorials, must be coordinated through
the Cemetery Superintendent.
   (G)   All authorized memorials must have foundations that shall:
      (1)   Be preapproved by the Cemetery Superintendent through the
submission of a “Permit to Install Cemetery Memorials.”
      (2)   Be installed by a reputable contractor or monument company hired/
contracted by the burial plot owner or nearest of kin.
      (3)   Be at least one-inch wider and one-inch longer than the base stone
resting upon it.
      (4)   Not project above the surface of the ground.
      (5)   Extend as low as the Cemetery Superintendent and/or Public Works
Director may require for safety and permanence.
(‘70 Code, § 6-11)
   (H)   The following guidance regarding memorial plans, quantity and location
must be followed to protect the interest of all lots owners and ensure the
city’s cemeteries remain uniform and attractive:
      (1)   No memorial may be erected in the cemetery unless a City of
Goldsboro “Permit to Install Cemetery Memorials” has been submitted by the
burial plot owner or nearest of kin and approved by the Cemetery
Superintendent. Memorial specifications, plans and location must be included as
part of the permit request and approval process. Once the initial permit is
received and approved, the requestor and/or their representative/contractor
must coordinate with the Cemetery Superintendent to have the four corners and
center of the footing location marked.
      (2)   Cemetery staff will not be responsible for excavating or pouring
any footings or installing memorials. A reputable contractor or monument
company must be hired by the burial plot owner or nearest of kin to pour
footings and install the memorials. Once the contractor or monument company has
excavated and formed up the footing location, they must acquire final approval
from the Cemetery Superintendent prior to setting/pouring the concrete.
      (3)   Only one monument will be permitted on a family burial lot and
shall not be more than ½ the width of the lot in height, and shall be of
granite or marble. No monument shall cover more than 7% of the ground space of
the lot or lots. All monuments, except upon agreement in writing signed by the
Public Works Director, shall be placed in the center of lots. (‘70 Code, § 6-
12)
       (4)   Only one memorial shall be allowed for each direct burial grave
space and shall be placed at the head of the grave. Grave spaces used solely
for cremation burials may have a total of three memorials, but only one can be
an upright headstone. The others must be flat grave markers. The only exception
would be for family burial lots where a monument has been installed in the
center of the burial lot. In such cases, all respective direct burial and/or
cremation memorials within the burial lot must be flat markers. Individual
grave spaces used solely for cremation burials may still have up to three flat
markers.
      (5)   All headstones and markers shall be granite or marble, at least
five inches in length, not less than four inches nor more than eight inches in
thickness, and not more than 18 inches in width and 24 inches to 30 inches in
length. All markers shall be level and set to the contour of the land.
Headstones and footstones standing on end are prohibited. All lettering on
individual grave markers shall be of the incised type, and in no case will
raised letters be permitted on these slabs.
(‘70 Code, § 6-13)
      (6)   Restrictions on ornaments. Grave markers with porcelain or other
photographs are not permitted; however, laser etched inscriptions and photos
are allowed. All inscriptions and photos must be respectful and conservative in
nature. Any photos or inscriptions the Cemetery Superintendent determines to be
outlandish, freakish or unusual in size or appearance will not be allowed.

maintenance of the structure. In the event that a BMP is severed from the
original site it was designed for (such as by the division of the original
site, sale of a portion of the original site, or construction of a road through
the site), a substitute BMP must be constructed by the responsible party (the

value, such as pencils, chewing gum, and the like for a donation shall not make
the conduct lawful.
   (D)   Exceptions. The conduct prohibited does not include solicitations made
by authorized representatives of not-for-profit corporations, organizations or
groups in order to obtain funds designed principally to further the purpose of
such not-for-profit corporations, organizations or groups provided proper
identification such as signs, vests, badges and the like, are clearly visible
to the general public naming the not-for-profit corporations, organizations or
groups.
   (E)   Opportunity to stop the prohibited activity.
      (1)   No arrest shall be made for an initial violation of this section
unless the arresting officer first affords a person an opportunity to stop the
conduct that violates division (C). After being warned that aggressive
panhandling or begging is illegal within the city limits of Goldsboro, a police
officer will issue a panhandling warning ticket to the individual. A copy of
this ticket will be maintained by the Goldsboro Police Department for
documentation purposes. If after being warned the panhandler does not cease
these activities or if an officer observes a person who has been duly warned
conducting aggressive panhandling activities again within the city limits, that
individual shall be immediately arrested.
      (2)   If a complaint is registered with the police department by a
private citizen and the complainant formally identifies the person accused of
aggressive panhandling or begging activities, a panhandling warning ticket will
be issued to that individual. If the person accused of aggressive panhandling
or begging by a private citizen has previously been duly warned of the
illegality of this activity, that person will be arrested if the complaining
citizen files appropriate charges or agrees to serve as a witness.
   (F)   Severability. If any portion of this section is for any reason held
invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
portion shall be deemed severable, and such holding shall affect the validity
of the remaining portions hereof.

manufactured homes, whether the home is owned by the park owner or a private
individual.
      (7)   Failure of a property owner to display the official street address
on the structure, after proper notice from the City of Goldsboro, shall be

§ 98.18 NAMING AND SIGNING PRIVATE STREETS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the intent of this section to establish
guidelines and a process for establishing the name and/or erecting signs for
private streets within the city limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of
Goldsboro.
   (B)   Street name guidelines. In general, private streets shall be given a
unique name to avoid duplication and confusion. Names which refer to landmarks,
places and natural features are preferable. In no case shall the name for a
private street duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names,
irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place
or court.
   (C)   Street name approval.
      (1)   Any property owner desiring to name or rename a private street
shall submit a petition on a form provided by the Department of Planning and
Community Development. An appropriate subdivision plat, record survey, or tax
map illustrating all affected parcels or lots shall also be provided. The
submitted petition shall include the head of household name and mailing address
for each dwelling fronting on the street.
      (2)   The Department of Planning and Community Development shall review
the proposed street name and compare it to the official street name to
determine its acceptability. If the proposed street name is found to be
acceptable, written notice shall be provided to all individuals included on the
petition, the U.S. Postal Service and all public utility companies.
   (D)   Street name signs.
      (1)   Street name signs shall be erected and maintained by the City of
Goldsboro where private streets intersect with public streets. When private
streets do not intersect with public streets and provide access to two or more
dwelling units, street name signs shall be erected and maintained by the
private street owner(s) in accordance with current city standards. The City of
Goldsboro may, at the written request of the property owner(s), construct and
install street name signs, at cost, if the owner desires to purchase these
services from the city.
      (2)   Failure of a property owner to install a street name sign on a
private street that does not intersect with a public street, after proper
notice from the City of Goldsboro, will constitute a civil penalty with a fine
of $25 per day, per street.

tributary shall be assessed a cost for its improvement up to a cap. If the
tributary does not follow a property line and one owner owns land on both
sides, then that owner shall be assessed a cost for the improvement for each
side up to a cap. This cap shall be established by the City Council and shall
be evaluated annually based upon the average material cost for an 18-inch storm
drainage line. In time of budgetary constraints, the City Council shall
prioritize tributary improvements.
('70 Code, § 20-42) (Ord. 1989-7, passed 1-23-89)

to comply with the provisions of this chapter. However, a license may not be
revoked unless the driver has received notice and has had an opportunity to
present evidence in his behalf.
('70 Code, § 24-54) (Ord. 1977-51, passed 10-24-77)
§ 114.43 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CITY, STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS.

STANDARDS OF OPERATION; PROHIBITED ACTS
§ 114.55 VEHICLE EQUIPMENT AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   License eligibility.

convenience and necessity or the use and operation of any vehicle or
replacement thereof under the provisions of this chapter, such vehicle as
desired to be operated shall be thoroughly examined and inspected by the Police
Department and found to be sanitary, mechanically sound and to comply with such
reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the City Council.
These rules and regulations shall be promulgated to provide safe transportation
and shall specify such safety equipment and regulatory devices as the City
Council shall deem necessary therefor.
      (2)   When the Police Department has determined that a vehicle has met
the standards established by the City Council, the Police Department shall
issue to the City Clerk a statement of eligibility for license, which shall
also state the authorized seating capacity of such vehicle.
   (B)   Periodic inspections. Every vehicle operating under this chapter shall
be periodically inspected by the Police Department at such intervals as shall
be deemed necessary to insure the continued maintenance and upkeep of each
vehicle. If during the course of such an inspection any vehicle should be found
to be unsafe or unfit for operation, notice shall be given by the Police
Department to the holder of the certificate of convenience and necessity issued
under this chapter and such vehicle shall not thereafter be operated as a
vehicle for transporting persons for hire until the vehicle has been placed
back into a safe condition for such operation. Nothing herein shall be
construed to relieve any owner or operator of any vehicle from all or any
duties imposed by law nor relieve such owner or operator from liability
resulting from the unfitness of such vehicle or the negligent operation
thereof.

except under the provisions of a contract unless such taximeter shall be in
operation and such meter shall be kept operating continuously during the entire
time that it is engaged in the transportation of passengers for compensation
and during any waiting time. Since limousine service shall be operated on a
contract basis for pre-established fees, the installation of a metering device
shall not be required within vehicles of this category.

Each taximeter shall be equipped with a tamper-proof switch and electrical
system so than when the flag is in the non-earning position a light operating
at the same time, located on the exterior of the cab, will be lighted. The
type, design and location of the tell-tale light shall be approved by the
Police Department. No taxicab shall be driven or operated for hire if the tell-
tale light is out of order. At all times, while the taxicab is engaged unless
under contract copies of which are on file with the Police Department, the flag
of the taximeter shall be placed in the 6 o'clock position to register charges
for mileage or into the 9 o'clock position to register charges for waiting time
whichever is applicable. It shall be unlawful for any driver of any taxicab,
while carrying passengers to display the flag attached to the taximeter in such
a position as to denote that such vehicle is unemployed or to fail to place the
flag of the taximeter to a position indicating that such vehicle is unemployed
at the termination of each and every service. The flag shall not be changed to

inaccuracy in the taximeter, the operator thereof shall remove or cause to be
removed from service the vehicle equipped with the taximeter until such
taximeter shall have been repaired and accurately adjusted. No defective
taximeter shall be repaired without the Police Department being notified nor
placed back into operation without Police Department approval. The Police
Department shall maintain a listing available to all certificate holders of the
date and name of each individual whose taximeter had been inspected and the
nature of any findings.

   As noted in §
114.62 if more than two passengers belong to a party not utilizing a contract
service, a charge of $0.25 will be assessed for each traveler in excess of this
number. If passengers are not discharged at the same destination, the first
passenger leaving the taxicab shall be chargeable for the amount of the fare
shown on the taximeter and before proceeding to transport the remaining
passenger(s), the flag shall again be placed in the earning position so as to
designate the beginning of a new and separate trip as to the remaining
passenger(s) in such taxicab and such process shall be repeated each time a
passenger reaches his destination and alights from the taxicab so that the
remaining passenger(s) leaving the taxicab shall be chargeable with such fare
appearing upon the taximeter upon leaving the taxicab. This procedure, however,
does not apply for passengers who are being transported in limousines under
contract, copies of which have been placed on file with the Chief of Police in
compliance with §
114.68(D). In addition, in those instances where limousines have been retained
to transport passengers to a predetermined destination beyond the city limits
and such agreement is informal, solely for a completed trip, and between the
limousine operator and passenger without utilizing the privileges of a contract
of any nature, general rates for such trips shall be determined by the City
Council and posted in accordance with §

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. §§ 143-215.51 et
seq., 160A-174 et seq., 160A-381 et seq., 160A-411 et seq., and 160A-456 et
seq., delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry.
(Ord. 2018-24, passed 5-21-18)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Goldsboro
are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. 2018-24, passed 5-21-18)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 2018-24, passed 5-21-18)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (for example,
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   To minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
   (G)   To make flood insurance available to the community through the
National Flood Insurance Program;
   (H)   To maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
   (I)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
   (J)   To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a
Special Flood Hazard Area.

foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
      (5)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
opening coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions; and
      (6)   Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for-regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record a non-
conversion agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring that the
area below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall not be improved,
finished or otherwise converted to habitable space; The City of Goldsboro will

§ 151.31(5) ADDITIONS/IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition
and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the
existing structure are:
      (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more
nonconforming than the existing structure.
      (2)   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally
modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the
addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
   (B)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a substantial
improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to the existing
structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall require only the
addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
   (C)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
      (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure.
      (2)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
   (D)   Where a fire wall or independent perimeter load-bearing wall is
provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall
be considered a separate building and only the addition must comply with the
standards for new construction.
   (E)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one year period,
the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with the
standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the one year
period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that building
or structure subsequent to the effective date of this chapter. Substantial
damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on two separate
occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of
each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure has

         (b)   The property or properties shall be described in the ordinance.

         (a)   If the abandoned structure has been vacated and closed for a

(Repair, Closing, and Posting), or after the PEO issues an order, or
proceedings have commenced under the substandard housing regulations regarding
an abandoned structure to be restored or vacated and closed as provided in this
chapter, then the City of Goldsboro City Council pursuant to G.S. §160D-1203(6)
may find the following:
            1.   That the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to
restore, alter, or improve the structure;
            2.   That the continuation of the structure in its vacated and
closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, and welfare of the City
of Goldsboro in that the structure would:
               a.   Continue to deteriorate;
               b.   Would create a fire or safety hazard;
               c.   Would attract persons intent on criminal activities;
               d.   Would cause or contribute to blight or the deterioration of
property values in the area; or
               e.   Would render unavailable property and a structure that
might otherwise have been made available to serve the citizens of the City of
Goldsboro.
         (b)   Then in such circumstances, the City of Goldsboro City Council
may, after the expiration of such one-year period, enact an ordinance and serve
such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
            1.   If it is determined that the structure is deteriorated, the
ordinance shall require that the owner either restore or demolish and remove
the structure within 90 days.
            2.   If it is determined that the dwelling is dilapidated, the
ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the structure within
90 days.
         (c)   The ordinance shall be recorded in the Wayne County Register of
Deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor
index. If the owner fails to comply with this ordinance, the PEO shall
effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.
      (5)   Liens.
         (a)   The amount of the cost of restorations, alterations,
improvements, vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the PEO shall
be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred.
            1.   The lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be
collected as the lien for special assessment provided in G.S. Ch.160A, Art. 10
and in accordance with G.S. § 160D-1203(7).
         (b)   If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the PEO, the City of
Goldsboro shall sell the materials of the abandoned structure, and any personal
property, fixtures, or appurtenances, found in or attached to the structure.
            1.   The proceeds of the sale shall credit against the cost of the
removal or demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the
Superior Court by the PEO.

shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by
final order or decree of the court.
            3.   If the City of Goldsboro enters into a contract for
demolition, the contractor shall verify by affidavit that the proceeds from
sales of any salvaged materials, including personal property, fixtures, or
appurtenances, have been credited against the cost of demolition.
         (c)   Nothing in this division shall be construed to impair or limit
in any way the power of local government to define and declare nuisances and to
cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
      (6)   Violations. It shall be unlawful for the owner, operator, occupant,
or parties of interest of any structure to fail, neglect, or refuse to repair
or to vacate and close and/or demolish and remove the same, upon order of the
PEO duly made and served as herein provided, within the time specified in such
order.
      (7)   Method of service.
         (a)   Complaints or orders issued by the PEO shall be served and
parties of interest personally, or by registered or certified mail.
            1.   When service is made by registered or certified mail, a copy
of the complaint or order may also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be
deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused,
but the regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten days after
mailing.
            2.   If regular mail is used, a notice of the pending proceedings
shall also be posted in a conspicuous place on the affected premises per G.S. §
160D-1206(a).
         (b)   If the whereabouts of such persons are unknown and cannot be
ascertained by the PEO in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the PEO shall
generate an affidavit to that effect. The PEO shall then serve the complaint or
order by singular publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the
City of Goldsboro. A notice of the pending proceedings shall also be posted in
a conspicuous place on the affected premises per G.S. § 160D-1206(b).
         (c)   Failure on the part of any owner or party in interest to receive
or have served upon him/her any complaint, notice, or order herein provided for
shall not affect or invalidate the proceedings with respect to any other owner
or party of interest, or any other person.

      (1)   General.
         (a)   Any owner or party of interest who has received an order under
this chapter may appeal from the order to the Board of Adjustment according to
the procedure authorized by G.S. § 160D-1208(a).
         (b)   The appeal must be filed with the PEO and the Board of
Adjustment within ten days following service of the order. The notice of appeal

Board all documents constituting the record upon which the decision appealed
from was made.
      (2)   Appeal of a decision.
         (a)   When an appeal is from a decision of the PEO refusing to allow
the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his/her decision shall remain in
effect until modified or reversed.
         (b)   When an appeal is from a decision of the PEO requiring a person
to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement
until the hearing by the Board, unless the PEO certifies to the Board that a
suspension of the requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property.
            1.   In that case the requirement shall not be suspended except by
a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less
than one days written notice to the PEO, by the Board, or by a court of record
upon petition made pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1208(a).

concurring vote of four members shall be necessary to reverse or modify any
decision or order of the PEO, in accordance with G.S. § 160D-1208(b).
         (d)   Every appellate decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be
subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within

Adjustment may also petition the Superior Court for a temporary injunction
restraining the PEO from carrying out the decision, pending a final disposition
of the cause. The petition shall be filed within 30 days of the issuance of the
Board's decision or order in accordance with G.S. § 160D-1208(d).
   (J)   Penalty.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for the owner to use an abandoned structure
which has been posted with the notices authorized in division (H)(2), after the
time prescribed in the notice for the vacation of said structure. Each day's

      (2)   If any person shall violate any provision of this chapter, he shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished as provided by law.

penalty of $1,000 for the first day following the expiration of the order to
restore, vacate and close or demolish said structure or the unlawful use of the
abandoned structure. In each instance, a penalty of $250 per day shall be
imposed for each subsequent day that the abandoned structure remains in
violation of the order or remains unlawfully used. If a person fails to pay the
civil penalty within 30 days after being notified of the amount due, the city
