(Ord. 03-006, passed 8-13-2003)
§ 50.002 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   State law. Under G.S. Chapter 153A, the county has the responsibility
and authority to regulate land use and development, enforce ordinances within
its jurisdiction, and to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
   (B)   Exceptions to applicability. This stormwater management ordinance
shall not apply to those land use activities identified in the specific
sections of this chapter or as identified below:
      (1)   Existing development may be continued and maintained. Expansion to
existing structures classified as existing development must meet the provisions
of this chapter; and

purpose.
(Ord. 03-006, passed 8-13-2003)
§ 50.003 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to:
   (A)   Ensure the health, safety, and general welfare of citizens, and
protect and enhance the water quality of watercourses and water bodies in a
manner pursuant to and consistent with the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C.
§§ 1251 et seq.) by reducing pollutants in stormwater discharges to the maximum
extent practicable and by prohibiting non-stormwater discharges to the storm
drain system;
   (B)   Establish minimum criteria to control and minimize the quantitative
and qualitative impacts of stormwater runoff from development within the
county; and
   (C)   Encourage sustainable development. Prudent site planning should

infiltration, slowing stormwater runoff from individual sites in route to
streams and rivers by use of effective runoff management, structural and
nonstructural best management practices, drainage structures, and stormwater
facilities.

reviewing the circumstances of a particular case, the County Health Director
may permit the animal to be confined on the premises of the owner, but only
after an inspection and recommendation from the Sheriff. The County Health
Directors recommendation shall be based on whether or not there is a suitable
secure enclosure on the premises and other circumstances warrant confinement on
the owner’s premises.

rabies shall immediately notify the County Health Director and the Sheriff and
shall securely confine the animal until further instructed by the County Health
Director.

confinement, develops rabies, as determined by a licensed veterinarian, it
shall be the duty of the owner to have such animal euthanized under the
supervision of the County Health Director. Any dog or cat known to have been
bitten by another animal which is known or proved to be rabid shall be

restrain the following animals shall be constructed with the materials and in
the manner specified.
         (a)   Cheetahs, lions, tigers, and hybrids thereof.
            1.   Animals in this category shall be housed within a primary
enclosure which has as a minimum 2,500 square feet per animal. There shall be
no more than one male and two females in any one primary enclosure. There shall
be no common fences between enclosures housing tigers and any other animals. If
adult male animals are placed in adjacent enclosures, these enclosures shall be
constructed of no smaller than nine gauge steel chain link fence, doubled and
spaced so as to prohibit physical contact between two males. All enclosures
shall have double safety doors.
            2.   The enclosure shall be constructed of not less than nine gauge
steel chain link fence attached to not smaller than two and one-half inch
diameter, schedule 40 steel poles placed at least 30 inches in the ground and
anchored in 30 inches of concrete, and of sufficient length to extend to the
top of the fence, and shall be placed no more than ten feet apart. Enclosures
with roofs shall have sides a minimum of eight feet high, and enclosures
without roofs shall have sides at least 12 feet high. Roof of enclosures shall
be constructed of the same material as the sides and be firmly attached to the
sides with no gaps.
         (b)   Leopards, mountain lions, and hybrids thereof. Animals in this
category shall be housed in enclosures meeting all requirements set out above
for tigers and, in addition thereto, the enclosure shall have a roof
constructed or at least nine gauge steel chain link fencing, attached firmly to
the sides with no gaps.
         (c)   Jaguars. Jaguars of any species shall be housed in enclosures
constructed to the same standards as those required for leopards, except that
the fencing shall consist of not smaller than six gauge steel chain link
fencing for the sides and roof; however, the roof may consist of nine gauge
steel chain link fencing provided the sides are at least ten feet high. The
fencing shall be firmly secured to vertical and horizontal piping or rods, and
must be firmly secured at three-inch intervals to the bottom horizontal
crossbar, which shall be no more than three inches above the floor.
         (d)   Caracals, bobcats, lynxes, ocelots, servals, and hybrids
thereof. Animals in this category shall be housed in enclosures completely
enclosed with a minimum of 400 square feet for each animal and of a minimum
height of eight feet. For additional animals, the minimum area shall be
determined by multiplying the required square footage for a single animal by a
factor of one and one-half for one additional animal and the result by the same
factor, successively, for each additional animal. Walls and top or roof of
cages shall be constructed of no smaller than 11.5 gauge steel chain link
fencing secured to steel poles not smaller than one and one-half inch diameter
and placed at least 30 inches in the ground in 30 inches of concrete not more
than ten feet apart. Enclosures shall be double safety doors.

as well as the more escape prone of all animals. Bears shall be housed in
primary enclosures with at least 600 square feet per animal. There shall be not
more than one male and one female per primary enclosure. The primary enclosure
shall be constructed of solid steel bars at least three-fourths inch in
diameter, anchored in the ground at least 30 inches and in 30 inches of
concrete. Such enclosures shall be at least ten feet high and shall have a top
or roof constructed of the same material as the sides and firmly attached
thereto with no gaps therein. All such enclosures shall have a crossweld at
least every four inches, and shall have a floor of concrete, covered with
plywood or earth sufficiently to protect the animals used therein.
         (f)   Wild dogs, wolves, and hybrids thereof. Animals in this category
shall be housed in enclosures completely enclosed with a minimum of 600 square
feet for each animal and a minimum height of ten feet tall. Walls and top or
roof of enclosures shall be constructed of not smaller than six gauge steel
chain link fencing. The fencing shall be firmly attached to steel poles not
smaller than two inches in diameter and placed at least 30 inches in the ground
in 30 inches of concrete not more than ten feet apart.
         (g)   Poisonous reptiles. Poisonous reptiles shall be housed within a
primary enclosure which contains a minimum of six cubic feet per reptile,
provided, however, the enclosure shall, in any event, be of sufficient size to
accommodate the reptile for normal growth. There shall be no more than one male
and one female reptile per enclosure. The primary enclosure may be constructed
of wood, metal, glass, or fencing material or any combination thereof
sufficient to restrain and confine the reptile(s). Where solid wood, metal,
and/or glass enclosures are provided, holes shall be provided in the sides for
ventilation but shall be small enough to prevent the escape of the reptile.
Where fencing material is used, the spacing between strands of wire shall be
small enough to prevent the escape of the reptile. All enclosures must be of
such construction as to totally enclose the reptile(s) and prevent the reptile
(s) from opening the enclosure from within. At least one side of the enclosure
must have a window of glass or fencing through which the owner may see the
location of the animal before opening the enclosure. In lieu of a window, one
or more sides of the enclosure may be constructed of glass or fencing to allow
viewing of the reptile. All doors and entrances to the enclosure must be
padlocked to contain the reptile and prevent its removal without the owner’s
permission.
      (2)   Secondary enclosures.
         (a)   The purposes of secondary enclosures is to serve as a perimeter
fence surrounding all primary enclosures, in order to protect the public by
prevention of escape by an animal accidentally freed from its primary
enclosure.
         (b)   Secondary enclosures shall be constructed of not smaller than
11.5 gauge steel chain link fencing at least 12 feet in height and shall
encompass all primary enclosures. The fencing shall be attached to steel poles
not smaller than two and one-half inch diameter and set in 30 inches of
concrete or cedar or creosote post of equivalent length. All posts shall be
placed at least 30 inches in the ground and be spaced not more than 15 feet
apart. Secondary enclosures shall not have any common wall with any primary
enclosure, and all such enclosures shall not have any common wall with any
primary enclosure, and all such enclosures of animals capable of fence climbing
shall be electrified at the bottom and middle and shall also have an
electrified overhang to prevent climbing. Secondary enclosures surrounding
enclosures of animals capable of fence climbing shall be electrified at the
bottom and middle and shall also have an electrified overhang to prevent
climbing. Secondary enclosures housing digging animals such as hyenas, wild
dogs, and bears shall be so constructed as to be tunnel proof. The strength of
the secondary enclosure shall be appropriate to the animals enclosed as well as
to the conditions and shall be so constructed that no single foreseeable event
can jeopardize the structural integrity of both the primary and secondary
enclosure. All enclosures shall have double safety doors, each of which shall
be secured by a lock. All such enclosures shall be located at a sufficient
distance from the primary enclosure and from all other structures, rocks,
trees, or terrain features that no such primary enclosure, structure, rock,
tree, or terrain feature may be used as a leaping platform.
         (c)   In the event that cedar or creosote posts are used for line
posts, all corner posts and posts at sharp angles shall be of steel and at
least four inches in diameter, and all posts other than corner or angle posts
shall be located on the outside of the fencing. In the event that cedar or
creosote posts are used, they shall be replaced with steel posts at least two
and one-half inches in diameter, schedule 40 when replacement is needed, or
within six years, whichever is earlier.
      (3)   Shift cages. Shift cages are to be used for all deadly animals and
are necessary so that the animals can be shut off from the primary enclosure
for purposes such as cage cleaning. Structural and strength specifications are
to be identical to the specifications for the primary enclosure. Size is to be
determined as follows: an open top shift cage must be at least 400 square feet.
A closed top shift cage must be at least two times the length of the animal
squared (example: an eight-foot long animal shift cage would be two by eight
square or 256 square feet). The shift cage shall share a common wall with the
primary enclosure and should be accessible to the animal by means of a drop
door that can be raised or lower from outside the enclosure. The shift cage
shall also have a door that allows the shift cage to be entered without first
entering the primary enclosure.
      (4)   Variations.
         (a)   County animal services shall allow no variations from these
standards, if, because of the breeding, history, character, or other particular
trait, it is the opinion of Sheriff that the standards as described in this
subchapter are insufficient to restrain any wild or exotic animal, he or she
shall refuse to issue a permit until standards sufficient to restrain the
animal are developed and adopted by the Board of County Commissioners.
         (b)   Animal services may seek the assistance of the Sheriff or Police
Department to remove or keep the animal out of the county.
      (5)   Maintenance of structure. All primary and secondary enclosures

amends or revises an effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance
study. LETTERS OF MAP CHANGE include:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An official amendment, by letter,
to an effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA is based on
technical data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being
in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is
not located in a Special Flood Hazard Area;

      (4)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP
requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of Special Flood
Hazard Areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map or
flood insurance study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built
documentation, a letter of map revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the
effective FIRM.

of digital flood hazard data products carry the same authority as hard copy
products. Therefore, the NCEM’s Floodplain Mapping Program websites house
current and historical flood hazard data. For effective flood hazard data, the
NC FRIS website (http://FRIS.NC.GOV/FRIS) is the map repository, and for
historical flood hazard data, the FloodNC website (http://FLOOD.NC.GOV/NCFLOOD)
is the map repository.

rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
during any one-year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant

provides guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP,
which are contained in Title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at §
60.3. The BULLETINS AND FACT SHEETS are intended for use primarily by state and
local officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and
by members of the development community, such as design professionals and
builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued
periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations; rather they
provide specific guidance for complying with the minimum requirements of
existing NFIP regulations. It should be noted that TECHNICAL BULLETINS AND
TECHNICAL FACT SHEETS provide guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP
regulations. State or community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take
precedence. Design professionals should contact the community officials to
determine whether more restrictive state or local regulations apply to the
building or site in question. All applicable standards of the state or local
building code must also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
   TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED. Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in, or appliance.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully

or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in §§
150.25 to
150.29 and §§
150.40 to
150.46 is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION (WSE). The height, in relation to NAVD 1988, of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other

   (C)   Certification requirements.
      (1)   Elevation certificates.
         (a)   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-33) is required prior
to the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit
holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
elevation of the reference level, in relation to NAVD 1988. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder prior to the
beginning of construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to
make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development
permit.
         (b)   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-33) is required after
the reference level is established. Within seven calendar days of establishment
of the reference level elevation, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the
reference level, in relation to NAVD 1988. Any work done within the seven day
calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at the
permit holder’s risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate
data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to further work being permitted to proceed.
Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required corrections
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
         (c)   A final finished construction elevation certificate (FEMA Form
086-0-33) is required after construction is completed and prior to certificate
of compliance/occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of final as-built
construction of the elevation of the reference level and all attendant
utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy. The finished construction elevation
certificate certifier shall provide at least two photographs showing the front
and rear of the building taken within 90 days from the date of certification.
The photographs must be taken with views confirming the building description
and diagram number provided in by the town. To the extent possible, these
photographs should show the entire building including foundation. If the
building has split-level or multi-level areas, provide at least two additional
photographs showing side views of the building. In addition, when applicable,
provide a photograph of the foundation showing a representative example of the
flood openings or vents. All photographs must be in color and measure at least
three inches by three inches. Digital photographs are acceptable.
      (2)   Flood-proofing certificate.
         (a)   If nonresidential flood-proofing is used to meet the regulatory
flood protection elevation requirements, a flood-proofing certificate (FEMA
Form 086-0-34), with supporting data, an operational plan, and an inspection
and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start of any new
construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a certification of the flood-proofed design elevation
of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to NAVD 1988.
Flood-proofing certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. The
Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data, the operational
plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit approval. Failure to
submit the certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause
to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to construct in accordance
with the certified design shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy.
         (b)   A final finished construction flood-proofing certificate (FEMA
Form 086-0-34), with supporting data, an operational plan, and an inspection
and maintenance plan are required prior to the issuance of a certificate of
compliance/occupancy. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the flood-proofed design
elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to
NAVD 1988. Flood-proofing certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. The
Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data, the operational
plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to certificate of occupancy.
Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required corrections
shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to construct in
accordance with the certified design shall be cause to deny a certificate of
compliance/occupancy.
      (3)   Manufactured homes. If a manufactured home is placed within Zones A
or AE and the elevation of the chassis is more than 36 inches in height above
grade, an engineered foundation certification is required in accordance with
the provisions of §
150.41(C)(2).
      (4)   Alteration/relocation of watercourse. If a watercourse is to be
altered or relocated, a description of the extent of watercourse alteration or
relocation, a professional engineer’s certified report on the effects of the
proposed project on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the
effects to properties located both upstream and downstream, and a map showing
the location of the proposed watercourse alteration or relocation shall all be
submitted by the permit applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain development
permit.
      (5)   Certification exemptions. The following structures, if located
within Zones A or AE are exempt from the elevation/flood-proofing certification
requirements specified in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above:
         (a)   Recreational vehicles meeting requirements of §
150.41(F)(1);

within Coastal High Hazard Areas. It shall be the duty of the permit applicant
to submit to the Floodplain Administrator said certification to ensure the
design standards of this chapter are met. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall develop or review the structural design, plans, and
specifications for construction and certify that the design and methods of
construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
for meeting the provisions of this chapter. This certification is not a
substitute for an elevation certificate. In addition, prior to the certificate
of compliance/occupancy issuance, a registered professional engineer or
architect shall certify the finished construction is compliant with the design,
specifications, and plans for VE Zone construction.
   (D)   Determinations for existing buildings and structures. For applications
for building permits to improve buildings and structures, including
alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy,
additions, rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of
substantial damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and
structures, the Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with the Building
Official, shall:
      (1)   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work; in the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
      (2)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or

      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of flood waters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow flood waters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters
in both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      (4)   Shall, in Coastal High Hazard Areas (Zone VE), meet the
requirements of §
150.45.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more
nonconforming than the existing structure; and
         (b)   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally
modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the
addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
      (2)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure; and
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one
year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market
value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply
with the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the
one year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this chapter.
Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement
does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the Building
Official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;

(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood, or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the Special Flood Hazard Area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures.

   (B)   The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in §§
150.40 and
150.41, shall apply to all development within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain
Administrator prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit; or
         (b)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six
months of completion of the proposed encroachment.

§ 150.47 EFFECT ON EXISTING LAWS AND DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Effect on rights and liabilities under the existing flood damage
prevention ordinance. This chapter in part comes forward by re-enactment of
some of the provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance enacted
December 7, 1999 as amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather
to reenact and continue to enforce without interruption of such existing
provisions, so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are
reserved and may be enforced. The enactment of this chapter shall not affect
any action, suit, or proceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the
flood damage prevention ordinance of the town enacted on December 7, 1999, as
amended, which are not reenacted herein are repealed. The date of the initial
flood damage prevention ordinance for the county is April 1, 1985.
   (B)   Effect upon outstanding floodplain development permits. Nothing herein
contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size, or
designated use of any development or any part thereof for which a floodplain
development permit has been granted by the Floodplain Administrator or his or
her authorized agents before the time of passage of this chapter; provided,
however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding permit
within a period of six months subsequent to the date of issuance of the
outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 1.11 ZONING MAP INTERPRETATION.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the
official zoning map, the UDO Administrator shall employ the following rules of
interpretation.
   1.11.1   Centerline. Where a boundary line lies within and follows a street
or alley right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary shall be construed to
be in the center of such street or alley right-of- way, or utility easement. If
such a street or alley right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary
between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from dedication,
the district boundaries shall be construed as following the centerline of the
abandoned or vacated road bed or utility easement.
   1.11.2   Edge line. Where a boundary line follows the edge of a street or
alley right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary shall be construed to be
on the edge of such street or alley right-of-way, or utility easement. If such
a street or alley right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary
between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from dedication,
the district boundaries shall be construed as following the edge of the
abandoned or vacated road bed or utility easement.
   1.11.3   Lot line. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines. In the event that a district
boundary line divides a lot or tract, each part of the lot or tract so divided
shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this ordinance
for the district in which said part is located.
   1.11.4   Town limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following town
limits shall be construed as following the town limits.
   1.11.5   Watercourses. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the
centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall
be construed to follow such centerlines.
   1.11.6   Extensions. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of
street or alley rights-of-way, utility easements, lot lines, town limits,
county lines, or extraterritorial boundaries shall be so construed.
   1.11.7   Scaling. In the case where a district boundary does not coincide
with any boundary lines as above and no distances are described by specific
ordinance, the boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing
on the map.
   1.11.8   Authority. Appeal of the UDO Administrator’s determination of
zoning district boundaries shall be to the Board of Adjustment.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 1.12 INTERPRETING PERMITTED USES.
   Uses that are prohibited in a zoning district are indicated by a blank in
the table. The uses listed may not address all possible uses. In determining if
a use is permitted, the UDO Administrator shall consider which category of
expressed uses most closely matches the use proposed and apply the regulations
pertaining to that category to the proposed use. In determining the use which
most closely matches the proposed use, the UDO Administrator shall consider the
density and intensity of the use, and anticipated traffic, noise, light, and
odor on adjacent properties. If requested, the applicant shall submit evidence
to the Administrator of the anticipated traffic, noise, light, or odor of the
proposed use. Reports prepared by the applicable professional trade may be
required (i.e., transportation engineer, environmental scientist, and the
like). Such interpretation shall be provided in writing to the property owner
or applicant and subject to appeal by the Board of Adjustment.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 1.13 EXEMPTIONS.
   1.13.1   The provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to existing bona
fide farms. A bona fide farm is any tract of land containing at least three
acres which is used for the production of or activities relating to, or
incidental to, the production of crops, fruit, vegetables, ornamental and
flowering plants, dairy, livestock, poultry, and all other forms of
agricultural or forest products having a domestic or foreign market.
   1.13.2   For bona fide farms, this ordinance does not exercise any controls
over crop lands, timber lands, pasture lands, idle or other farm lands, nor
over any farm house, barn, poultry house, or other farm buildings, including
tenant or other houses for persons working on said farms, as long as such
houses shall be in the same ownership as the farm and located on the farm. Such
agricultural uses maintain the openness of the land and achieve the purposes of
this ordinance without the need for regulation. Residences for non-farm use or
occupancy and other non-farm uses shall be subject to the provisions of this
ordinance.
   1.13.3   In accordance with G.S. § 160D-913, the town UDO applies to state-
owned lands only when a building is involved.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 1.14 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This ordinance shall become effective on November 1, 2007. See table of text
amendments for effective dates of subsequent amendments.

* Note: A plat is usually preceded by an approved site plan. The sequence can
be: concept/sketch plan, site plan, plat. The definition of plot plans and site
plans are the same, although some municipalities use both terms (plot plans for
residential and site plans for multi-family, commercial, industrial, PUD, and
the like.)
** Note: A survey plat is also acceptable. A survey plat provides both the site
plan information and the plat information.

*Notes: The Master Development Plan (MDP) is primarily used for a phased
development project with a variety of components, e.g., retail, office,
multi-family, and the like the flow would start with a concept plan then to
an MDP, followed by a site-specific vesting plan and plats. For single
purpose sites such as multi-family or commercial, the flow would go from a
concept plan to a site plan to plats.
 
      C.   Electronic files required.
         1.   Applications for a site plan or subdivision involving more than
ten lots shall provide electronic drawings in the format as specified by the

         2.   Once the applicant indicates that the application is as complete
as the applicant intends to make it, the application shall be placed on the
agenda of the appropriate review board in accordance with standard procedures.
However, if the UDO Administrator believes the application is incomplete, the
application shall be returned to the petitioner for modification and re-
submittal.
      F.   Changed application. If the applicant makes significant changes to

         1.   Where mailed notice is required, the town shall notify by first
class mail all property owners of adjoining properties and the owners of all
properties within 200 feet of the subject property. For the purposes of this
section, properties are adjoining even if separated by a street, railroad, or
other transportation corridor.
         2.   The notice shall be mailed at least ten but not more than 25 days
prior to the date of the public hearing.
         3.   Mailed notice under this Article shall not be required if a

adjacent street or highway right-of-way. The applicable board may continue an
evidentiary hearing that has been convened without further advertisement, if an
evidentiary hearing is set for a given date and a quorum of the board is not
then present, the hearing shall be continued until the next regular board
meeting without further advertisement.
   4.1.5   Decisions. Unless specifically provided elsewhere, all respective
board decisions shall require an affirmative vote. Tie votes shall be

plans and the general requirements of this ordinance for the Town Council.
   4.2.3   Action by the Planning Board.
      A.   General procedures.
         1.   Before making any recommendation on a text amendment, the
Planning Board shall consider any comments from the UDO Administrator.
         2.   The Planning Board shall make a recommendation to the Town
Council based on the approval criteria in Article 4.2.5 within 30 days of its
initial review.
         3.   The Town Council may act on the amendment if the Planning Board
does not provide a recommendation within 30 days.
   4.2.4   Action by Town Council.
      A.   Review procedures.
         1.   Public notice requirements shall be in accordance with Article
4.1.4.
         2.   The Town Council shall make a decision based on the approval
criteria in Article 4.2.5.
         3.   Following the public hearing, the Town Council may approve the
text amendment, approve with modifications, deny the amendment, or send the
amendment back to the Planning Board for additional consideration.
      B.   Hearing. The public hearing shall be scheduled for the next Town
Council meeting following completion of the published notice requirements.
   4.2.5.   Approval criteria.
      A.   In evaluating any proposed ordinance text amendment, the Planning
Board and the Town Council shall consider the following:
         1.   The extent to which the proposed text amendment is consistent
with the remainder of the ordinance; specifically with respect to any purpose
and intent statements;
         2.   The extent to which the proposed text amendment represents a new
idea not considered in the existing ordinance, or represents a revision
necessitated by changing circumstances over time;
         3.   Whether the proposed text amendment corrects an error in the
ordinance; and
         4.   Whether the proposed text amendment revises the ordinance to
comply with state or federal statutes or case law.
      B.   In deciding whether to adopt a proposed ordinance text amendment,
the central issue before the Town Council is whether the proposed amendment
advances the public health, safety, or welfare and is consistent with the
comprehensive plan and the specific intent of this ordinance.
   4.2.6   Required statements.
      A.   Planning Board statement. When making its recommendation to the Town
Council, the Planning Board shall adopt a written statement as part of its
recommendation for approval or denial that addresses the consistency of the
proposed text amendment with all relevant adopted plans. A comment by the
Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive
plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by
the Town Council.
      B.   Town Council statement. When making its final decision on a proposed
text amendment, the Town Council shall adopt a written statement that addresses
the consistency of the proposed amendment with all relevant adopted plans, the
reasonableness of the final decision, and how the final decision serves the
public interest. The requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be
met by a clear indication in the minutes of the Town Council meeting that, at
the time of action on the amendment, the Town Council was aware of and
considered the Planning Board’s recommendations and any relevant portions of an
adopted comprehensive plan.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 4.3 ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS - ALL ZONING DISTRICTS (REZONING).
   4.3.1   Applicability.
      A.   Zone boundaries as shown on the zoning map may be amended,
supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed in accordance with the procedures
of this Article.
      B.   The Town Council shall consider amendments to the official zoning
map of the town as may be required from time to time. A zoning map amendment
may sometimes be referred to as a “rezoning”.
      C.   Rezoning should correspond with the boundary lines of existing
platted lots or tracts. Where the boundaries of a rezoning request stop short
of an exterior property line, a survey is required to properly define the
zoning lines. It must be possible to subdivide and develop that portion of the
property outside the proposed rezoning boundary in accordance with the existing
zoning and other requirements of this ordinance.
      D.   No amendment to zoning regulations or a zoning map that down-zones
property shall be initiated, nor is it enforceable without the written consent
of all property owners whose property is the subject of the down-zoning
amendment, unless the down-zoning amendment is initiated by the town. For
purposes of this section, DOWN-ZONING means a zoning amendment that affects an
area of land by either decreasing the development density of the land to be
less dense than was allowed under its previous usage or by reducing the
permitted uses of the land to fewer uses than were allowed under its previous
usage.
   4.3.2   Initiation of amendment.
   General Districts and Overlay Districts
   A request for a rezoning may be initiated by the Town Council, the Planning
Board, the UDO Administrator, the property owner or their agent, or a duly
authorized third party who does not own the property(ies) proposed for
rezoning.
   4.3.3   Pre-application conference. All applicants petitioning for a
rezoning shall schedule a pre- application conference with the UDO
Administrator in accordance with Article 4.1.2.
   4.3.4   Neighborhood meeting. It is recommended that all applicants
petitioning for a general use, PD-CD, or MR-CD rezoning hold a neighborhood
meeting. After the pre-application conference, and at least ten days prior to
submitting the application, the neighborhood meeting is recommended for the
following approvals:
         1.   Zoning map amendment - All general use zoning districts.
         2.   Zoning map amendment - MR-CD or PD-CD.
         Applicants seeking a rezoning to the CZ-CD district shall be required
to hold a neighborhood meeting prior to submitting an application.
      A.   The purpose of the neighborhood meeting is to inform the
neighborhood of the nature of the proposed land use and development features,
explain the plan (if any), and receive comments. The comments received at the
neighborhood meeting are not binding on the applicant although the applicant
may incorporate suggestions received at the meeting.
      B.   If held, an oral or written summary of the neighborhood meeting
discussions must be available for discussion at the Planning Board meeting
scheduled to review the application.

   4.3.5   Application requirements. All applications for a rezoning shall be
submitted in accordance with Article 4.1.3 (Application Requirements).
   4.3.6   Notice and public hearings. The town shall hold all required public
hearings and give notice in accordance with Article 4.1.4 (Public Notice
Requirements).
   4.3.7   Action by the UDO Administrator.
      A.   The UDO Administrator shall prepare a staff report that reviews the
rezoning request in light of any applicable plans and the general requirements
of this ordinance. The staff report shall consider the entire range of
permitted uses in the requested classification.
      B.   Following completion of technical review by staff, the UDO
Administrator shall forward the completed request and any related materials to
the Planning Board for review and recommendation to Town Council.
      C.   Following Planning Board review, the UDO Administrator shall forward
the completed rezoning request and any related materials, including the
Planning Board recommendation, to the Town Council for a hearing and final
action.
   4.3.8   Action by Planning Board.
      A.   Procedure. The Planning Board shall make a written recommendation on
the application to the Town Council. If the Planning Board fails to make a
recommendation within 60 days, the Town Council may process the request without
a recommendation.
      B.   Review criteria. In making its written recommendation as to plan
consistency, the Planning Board shall make a recommendation based on the
approval criteria in Article 4.3.9 B.
   4.3.9   Action by Town Council.
      A.   Procedure.
         1.   Before taking action on a rezoning at the public hearing, the
Town Council shall consider the recommendations of the Planning Board (public
notice requirements are given in Article 4.1.4)
         2.   The Town Council may approve the rezoning, apply zoning other
than that requested (if not inconsistent with the notice), deny the rezoning,
or send the rezoning back to the Planning Board for additional consideration.
      B.   Approval criteria. In approving a rezoning, the Town Council shall
consider the following matters:
         1.   Consistency with any adopted land use plans, including the
comprehensive plan;
         2.   Compatibility with the present zoning and conforming uses of
nearby property and with the character of the neighborhood;
         3.   Suitability of the subject property for uses permitted by the
current district versus the uses permitted in proposed district;
         4.   Whether the proposed change tends to improve the balance of uses
permitted or satisfies a specific demand in the town;
         5.   The availability of adequate school, road, park, waste water
treatment, water supply, and stormwater drainage facilities for the proposed
use as well as the range of permitted uses for the zoning requested; and
         6.   The extent to which the proposed zoning map amendment is
consistent with the remainder of the ordinance including, specifically, any
purpose and intent statements.
      C.   Statement of consistency. The Town Council shall adopt a written
statement as to the consistency of the rezoning with any adopted land use
plans. The requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a
clear indication in the minutes of the Town Council meeting that at the time of
action on the amendment the Town Council was aware of and considered the
Planning Board’s recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted
comprehensive plan. If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was
deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the
effect of also amending any future land-use map in the approved plan, and no
additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. A
plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The plan
consistency statement is not subject to judicial review. If a zoning map
amendment qualifies as a large-scale rezoning under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the
Town Council statement describing plan consistency may address the overall
rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted
plans were considered in the action taken.
      D.   Statement of reasonableness. A written statement shall be adopted as
to the reasonableness of the rezoning. This statement of reasonableness may
consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other
attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned, (ii) the benefits and detriments
to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding community, (iii) the
relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the
tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be permissible under
the proposed amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public interest;
and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a zoning map
amendment qualifies as a large-scale rezoning under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the
Town Council statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning. The
statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement required by this
section may be approved as a single statement.
   4.3.10   Resubmission of application.
      A.   Upon final action by the Town Council to deny or approve an
application for the rezoning of property, the Planning Board shall not accept
for review any applications for changes affecting the same property or any
portion thereof until the expiration of one year from the date of such previous
action except as provided in division B. below. The UDO Administrator shall
reject applications that do not comply with the elapsed time requirements.
      B.   The UDO Administrator may allow re-submission of such petition
within the one year period if it is determined that, since the date of action
on the prior petition:
         1.   There has been a significant change in the zoning district
classification of an adjacent piece of property;
         2.   The Town Council has adopted a plan that changes public policy
regarding how the property affected by the amendment should be developed;
         3.   Construction or expansion of infrastructure (e.g., a road, water
line, sewer line, or other such facilities) has occurred to serve the property
and can comfortably accommodate the intensity of development allowed under the
proposed classification; and
         4.   There has been some other extraordinary change in conditions or
circumstances, outside the control of the applicant, which justifies waiver of
the one year restriction on re-submission; this, however, shall not include a
change in the ownership of the subject property.

§ 4.4 ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS - CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   4.4.1   General procedure. Zoning map amendment applications for an
amendment to a conditional zoning district as described in Article 7.1.2 are
processed, considered, and voted upon in accordance with the procedures of
Article
4.3 (Zoning map amendment-all zoning districts) except as otherwise expressly
stated in this Article.
   4.4.2.   Pre-application conference.
      A.   All applicants seeking a zoning map amendment to a conditional
district shall schedule a pre-application conference with the UDO
Administrator. The UDO Administrator shall review the preliminary concept plan
(prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article
4.4.5) for completeness and consistency with the purpose and intent of the
conditional zoning district requirements.
      B.   Following the pre-application conference, the UDO Administrator
shall notify the applicant of any modification to the concept plan that may be
required. The applicant will then prepare the final concept plan for submission
to the Planning Board.
   4.4.3   Neighborhood meeting. It is recommended that all applicants seeking
approval of (1) a PD/PUD or MR-CD, or (2) a modification, including expansion,
to an existing PD/PUD or MR-CD hold a neighborhood meeting in accordance with
Article
4.3.4 (Neighborhood Meeting). An application to create or modify a CZ-CD shall
require a neighborhood meeting.
   4.4.4   Application requirements. The conditional rezoning application
consists of the following materials:
      A.   A conditional district zoning map amendment application prepared in
accordance with Article
4.1.3.
      B.   The concept plan approved by the UDO Administrator for submission.
This concept plan consists of a map-based presentation of proposed zoning
conditions attached to the conditional district zoning map amendment
application.
   4.4.5   Concept plan. For the purpose of establishing conditions to be
included with the conditional zoning map amendment, applications for a zoning
map amendment to a conditional zoning district must be accompanied by a concept
plan for the entire property proposed to be included in the district. At a
minimum, the concept plan must include the elements listed below. Additional
details may be added to the concept plan.
      A.   The location and size of the area involved;
      B.   The current zoning of the surrounding properties;
      C.   Location of existing waterways and other riparian areas, and other
significant environmental features;
      D.   General layout of transportation routes including streets,
pedestrian ways, and off- street parking and loading areas;
      E.   Estimated population density and extent of activities to be
allocated to parts of the project;
      F.   Reservations for public use including schools, parks, and other open
spaces;
      G.   The general means of the disposition of sanitary wastes and
stormwater;
      H.   A graphical indication of areas and a tabulation of these land areas
to be devoted to various uses and overall densities.
      I.   If a project is to be developed in phases, a general breakdown
showing the various phases and the estimated schedule of construction.
   4.4.6   Approval process and guidelines.
      A.   The concept plan. The UDO Administrator shall review the concept
plan for consistency with the standards of Article 12 (Subdivision Standards)
and other applicable standards in this ordinance. The UDO Administrator may
consult with the Technical Review Committee or other consultants. Upon finding
such consistency, the UDO Administrator shall approve the concept plan for
submission to the Planning Board in combination with an application for a
zoning map amendment.
   4.4.7   Conditions.
      A.   Conditions may specify the location on the property of proposed
uses; the number of dwelling units; the location and extent of supporting
facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets; design elements
of the proposed use; the location and extent of buffer areas and other special
purpose areas; the timing of development; the location and extent of rights-of-
way and other areas to be dedicated for public purposes; the widening of
streets to mitigate traffic impacts; and other such matters as the applicant
may propose as conditions upon the request.
      B.   Any conditions imposed in association with a conditional district
and so authorized are perpetually binding upon the property included within the
conditional district unless subsequently changed or amended as provided for in
this Article or future modifications thereof.
      C.   Specific conditions may be proposed by the petitioner or the town or
its agencies, but only those conditions approved by the town and consented to
by the petitioner in writing may be incorporated into the zoning regulations.
Unless consented to by the petitioner in writing, in the exercise of the
authority granted by this section, the town may not require, enforce, or
incorporate into the zoning regulations any condition or requirement not
authorized by otherwise applicable law, including, without limitation, taxes,
impact fees, building design elements within the scope of G.S.§ 160D-702(b),
driveway-related improvements in excess of those allowed in G.S. § 136-18(29)
and G.S. § 160A-307, or other unauthorized limitations on the development or
use of land. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional
district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the
development and use of the site in accordance with this ordinance, plans
adopted pursuant to G.S. § 160D-501, or the impacts reasonably expected to be
generated by the development or use of the site.
   4.4.8   Procedure. The procedure for a zoning map amendment to a conditional
zoning district shall be the same as set forth in Article
4.3 (Zoning map amendments-all zoning districts) in that notice and public
hearings shall be in accordance with Article
4.1.4, Public Notice Requirements. Action by the Planning Board shall be in
accordance with Article
4.3.8. Action by the Town Council is a legislative decision procedure in a
public hearing in accordance with Article
4.3.9, including required statements of consistency and reasonableness.
   4.4.9   Effect of approval. Approval of a zoning map amendment application
and accompanying conceptual plan has the effect of establishing the maximum
density/intensity, maximum height and general location of buildings and uses of
each tract, or area shown on the conceptual plan.
   4.4.10   Amendments and modifications. Minor modifications, such as reducing
density, increasing open space, adding buffers, and the like, may be approved
by the Planning Board. Any major proposed change from what is shown on the
approved concept plan shall require an amendment of the conditional zoning
district following the same procedure as that required for the original
approval of the district.
   4.4.11   Conditional district-site plans and permits. The concept plan
approvals establish the basic zoning requirements of the district. A master
development plan (MDP) and subsequent site plans for the development in the
conditional district must be submitted for review and approval in accordance
with the site plan approval procedure of Article
4.7 of this ordinance to enable site development and subdivision of land and
construction. See Article
4.1.3 for MDP requirements.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021; Ord. 2023-03, passed 3-1-2023)
§ 4.5 VARIANCE.
   4.5.1   Applicability.
      A.   The decision authority may vary certain requirements of this
ordinance in harmony with the general purpose of these regulations, where
special conditions applicable to the subject property would make the strict
enforcement of the regulations impractical or result in a hardship in making
reasonable use of the property.
      B.   No variance shall be permitted that would have the effect of
allowing a use not permitted in the subject zoning district (see use table set
forth in Article 7), or a density exceeding the maximum allowed in the subject
zoning district.
      C.   No variance may be granted where explicitly prohibited by this
ordinance.
   4.5.2.   Decision authority. The Board of Adjustment shall be the decision
authority for all variance applications.
   4.5.3.   Pre-application conference. All applicants seeking a variance shall
schedule a pre- application conference with the UDO Administrator to discuss
the procedures, standards, and regulations required for variance approval in
accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.
   4.5.4.   Application requirements. An application for a variance shall be
signed by the owner(s) of the subject property or the owner(s) agent with a
valid power of attorney and submitted in accordance with Article 4.1.3
(Application Requirements).
   4.5.5.   Notice and evidentiary hearings. Once the application has been
determined complete, the UDO Administrator shall schedule an evidentiary
hearing and give public mailed and posted notice as set forth in Article 4.1.4.
   4.5.6   Burden of proof. The applicant seeking the variance shall have the
burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the decision authority to
reach the conclusions set forth below (Findings, Article 4.5.9), as well as the
burden of proof on those issues.
   4.5.7   Action by the UDO Administrator. The UDO Administrator shall provide
the decision authority a copy of the application and all relevant materials
pertaining to the request prior to the public hearing.
   4.5.8   Action by the decision authority.
      A.   Each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact by the
decision authority that specifies the reasons for the decision.
      B.   A decision to approve a variance requires a concurring vote of four-
fifths of the members of the decision authority.
      C.   The decision authority may approve in whole or in part, deny, or
continue the request. In granting the variance, the approving authority may
prescribe reasonable and appropriate conditions that will ensure that the use
will be compatible with adjacent properties and will not alter the character of
the neighborhood. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such conditions must be
directly related to the impacts of the proposed use and must be roughly
proportional to these anticipated impacts.
   4.5.9   Findings of fact.
      A.   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of
the provisions of the zoning regulation upon a showing of all of the following:
         1.   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the regulation. It is not necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;
         2.   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability;
         3.   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant
or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-
created hardship; and
         4.   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose,
and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and
substantial justice is achieved.
      B.   Any variance granted must be the minimum variance required for
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure. The fact that property may
be utilized for greater profit, however, is not considered adequate to justify
the granting of a variance.
      C.   Neither the nonconforming use of lands, buildings, or structures in
the same zoning district; nor the permitted use of lands, buildings, or
structures in other zoning districts; nor personal circumstances may be
considered as grounds for the issuance of a variance. Furthermore, mere
financial hardship does not constitute grounds for granting a variance.
      D.   The decision authority’s final decision shall be delivered in
writing by personal delivery, electronic mail, or first class mail to
applicant.
   4.5.10   Effect of approval.
      A.   The applicant shall file the approved variance with the County
Register of Deeds within six months from the date of approval or the variance
shall be deemed void.
      B.   All variances that are granted shall run with the property for which
the variance is being sought and not with the owner of the property.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 4.6 SUBDIVISION AND MASTER DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   4.6.1   Applicability. Subdivision approval shall be required before the
division of land into two or more parcels is undertaken. The Planning Board has
final authority on preliminary and final plat approval, with the exception of
minor subdivision plats which review and approval shall be delegated to the UDO
Administrator. Standards are given in Article 12.
   4.6.2   Major and minor subdivision definition.
      Minor Subdivision
      A minor subdivision is any subdivision activity that creates no more than
ten lots (including the original lot) or involves the platting of no more than
ten residential units and conforms to the minor subdivision regulations and
requirements of this ordinance.
      Minor Subdivision, Expedited
      The division of one existing parcel of land under single ownership that
is not exempt per G.S. § 160D-802(a); (1) where no part of the tract or parcel
to be divided has been divided in the ten years prior to the proposed division;
(2) the entire area of the tract or parcel to be divided is greater than five
acres; (3) after division, no more than three lots result from the division and
all resultant lots comply with all lot dimension size requirements of the
applicable zoning district and the use of the lots is in conformity with the
applicable zoning district; and (4) a permanent means of ingress and egress is
recorded for each.
      Major Subdivision
      All other divisions of land that do not qualify as a minor subdivision
and do not qualify for statutory exclusion.
   4.6.3   Statutory exclusions. Consistent with G.S. § 160D-802, the following
activities are not considered subdivisions for the purposes of this ordinance.
      A.   The combination or recombination of portions of previously
subdivided and recorded lots where the total number of lots is not increased
and the resultant lots are equal to or exceed the standards of this ordinance;
      B.   The division of land into parcels greater than ten acres where no
street right-of-way dedication is involved and where the resultant lots are
equal to or exceed the standards of this ordinance;
      C.   The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for water or
sewer infrastructure;
      D.   The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for the
widening or opening of streets or for public transportation corridors; and
      E.   The division of a tract in single ownership whose entire area is no
greater than two acres into no more than three lots, where no street right-of-
way dedication is involved and where the resultant lots are equal to or exceed
the standards of this ordinance.
   4.6.4   No subdivision without plat approval.
   Pursuant to G.S. § 160D-803, a final plat shall be prepared, approved, and
recorded pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance whenever any subdivision
of land takes place in the town’s planning jurisdiction.
      A.   No persons may subdivide land except in accordance with all of the
provisions of this ordinance. In particular, no subdivision may occur unless
and until a final plat of the subdivision has been approved in accordance with
the provisions of this Article and recorded by the Brunswick County Register of
Deeds.
      B.   Not all divisions of land constitute subdivisions that are subject
to regulation under this ordinance. However, to ensure that such divisions are
in fact exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, all plats creating a
division of land shall be presented to the town before submittal for
recordation in the Brunswick County Registry and the UDO Administrator shall
indicate on the face of the plat that the division is exempt from the
provisions of this ordinance if that is the case.
   4.6.5   Unlawful to record plat without plat approval.
   Pursuant to G.S. Chapter § 160D-803, no final plat of subdivision within the
town planning jurisdiction shall be recorded by the Register of Deeds of
Brunswick County until it has been approved by the UDO Administrator or
designee or by the town’s Planning Board pursuant to the procedures established
in this Article.
   4.6.6   Subdivision required. After the effective date of this ordinance,
any person who, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land within the
territorial jurisdiction of this ordinance, thereafter subdivides his or her
land in violation of this ordinance or transfers or sells land by reference to,
exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land
before the plat has been properly approved under the terms of this ordinance
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The description by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or
transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The town,
through its attorney or other official designated by the Town Council, may take
action to enjoin illegal subdivision, transfer, or sale of land by action for
injunction. Further, the violation of any provision of this ordinance shall
subject the offender to the penalties prescribed by G.S. § 160D-807. Illegal
subdivisions will not be recognized for zoning purposes.
   4.6.7   Pre-application conference and concept plan.
      A.   All applicants seeking subdivision approval shall schedule a pre-
application conference with the UDO Administrator.
      B.   Applicants shall submit a concept plan for review by the UDO
Administrator. This plan may be in simple sketch form. Information requirements
are given in Article 4.1.3.
      C.   Following approval of the concept plan, the preliminary master
development plan (Article 4.1.3) will be developed for planned developments
(including large commercial developments, and mixed use developments).
   4.6.8   Application requirements.
      A.   All applications for subdivision review shall be submitted in
accordance with Article 4.1.3, (Application Requirements) and any specific
requirements as directed by the town. In addition, all applications for
subdivision shall include electronic versions of plats and surveyor’s files for
both preliminary and final plats. Electronic files shall be in the format as
directed by the UDO Administrator.
      B.   A transportation impact analysis may be required if the proposed
subdivision meets the thresholds established in Article 4.11 (Transportation
Impact Analysis).
   4.6.9   Major subdivision preliminary plat approval.
      A.   Applicability. A preliminary plat shall be required for all major
subdivisions.
      B.   Staff consultation. Prior to submitting a preliminary plat, the
applicant shall meet with the UDO Administrator and submit a concept plan in
accordance with Article 4.6.6 above.
      C.   Application requirements.
         1.   Applications for preliminary plat approval shall be submitted in
conformance with Article 4.6.8 (Application Requirements).
         2.   When a subdivision is to be developed in phases, a phasing plan
shall be submitted for the entire development and a preliminary plat shall be
submitted for each individual phase. A final plat shall be submitted for
individual phases as each phase is developed. Each new phase shall be developed
adjoining an earlier phase.
      D.   UDO Administrator duties and responsibilities.
         1.   Applications for preliminary plat approval shall be submitted to
the UDO Administrator. The UDO Administrator shall review the application for
compliance with the provisions of the ordinance.
         2.   Upon receipt of a completed application, the UDO Administrator
shall distribute the application submittal to the relevant agencies for review
and comment.
         3.   The UDO Administrator shall prepare a staff report based on
comments provided by the relevant agencies and the Technical Review Committee,
if any. The report shall be forwarded to the Planning Board for final action at
the next scheduled meeting.
      E.   Action by the Technical Review Committee.
         1.   The Technical Review Committee may review the preliminary plat
and associated application documents for conformance with the requirements of
this ordinance in accordance with the adopted public review schedule.
         2.   Upon completion of the review period, and prior to providing
written comments to the applicant stating any corrections or modifications that
shall be required, the Technical Review Committee may meet with the applicant
and discuss any modifications or corrections in development design that may be
required, based on the recommendations made by members of the Technical Review
Committee.
         3.   The applicant shall have 30 days to make corrections and return
the revised application to the UDO Administrator. The applicant may apply for
an extension of this review period by written request to the UDO Administrator,
provided that such request shall be received prior to the expiration of the 30-
day period.
         4.   Within ten business days of receipt of a revised application, the
Technical Review Committee shall review the revised application for
satisfactory completion of all required corrections and may make a
recommendation to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application.
The application and associated comments shall then be returned to the UDO
Administrator.
      F.   Action by Planning Board.
         1.   The Planning Board shall take final action on the preliminary
plat application (per Article 4.6.10.I.) taking comments by the UDO
Administrator and Technical Review Committee, if any, into consideration.
Applications that have not received final administrative review shall not be
reviewed.
         2.   The preliminary plat shall be considered by the Planning Board at
the next available meeting.
         3.   The Planning Board may approve the preliminary plat, approve with
minor corrections/conditions, or deny the preliminary plat.
         4.   A simple majority of all eligible voting members of the Planning
Board shall be necessary for approval of any preliminary plat. The Planning
Board’s minutes shall include identification of members present, and their
individual vote on the preliminary plat. No final action shall be deemed to
have been given by the Planning Board on the preliminary plat until the
Planning Board delivers its dated written decision on the preliminary plat to
the applicant (this may be delegated to the UDO Administrator to deliver;
delivery may be via email, written decision on the face of the plat, or in
letter form).
         5.   If the Planning Board should deny the preliminary plat, the
reasons for such action shall be given to the applicant, or their agent, along
with recommendations for changes in the plat.
      G.   Effect of preliminary plat approval. Upon approval of the
preliminary subdivision plat, the applicant may proceed to comply with the
other requirements of these regulations, including construction plan approval,
preparation of the final plat, and all other approvals and permits.
      H.   Duration of preliminary plat validity. An approved preliminary plat
shall remain valid for a period of 24 months, after which time the preliminary
plat shall expire. If a final plat has not been approved, the preliminary plat
must be resubmitted as a new application in conformance with all applicable
requirements of this ordinance at the time of reapplication.
      I.   Modifications to an approved preliminary plat. Minor changes to an
approved preliminary plat may be approved by the UDO Administrator. Such
changes as adjusting lot lines, reducing density, increasing open space,
increased screening and buffering, and adjusting stormwater or utility
locations for other permits and the like qualify as minor changes. Major
changes to an approved preliminary plat, such as movement of roads, new roads,
increased density, and the like, will require resubmittal for review and
approval as a modification to an application.
   4.6.10   Major subdivision final plat approval.
      A.   Applicability. The final plat shall constitute only that portion of
the approved preliminary plat that the applicant proposes to record and develop
at the time of submission. After the improvements shown on the approved
preliminary plat have been installed or guaranteed for the whole or portion of
a subdivision, the applicant shall submit a final plat of the area covered by
such improvements.
      Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval
of the final subdivision plat, nor shall it constitute approval of portions of
a subdivision to be developed in future phases that have not been reviewed in
conformance with this Article. Application for approval of the final plat will
be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified
below have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been
met.
      B.   Application requirements.
         1.   All applications for final plat approval shall be submitted in
accordance with Article 4.1.3 (Application Requirements) in addition to any
specific requirements provided by the UDO Administrator.
         2.   Construction plan approvals and required permits must be received
prior to final plat approval.
         3.   A land surveyor registered to practice in North Carolina shall
prepare the final plat. All final plats to be recorded by the Brunswick County
Register of Deeds shall be probated and shall conform to the provisions for
plats, subdivisions, and mapping requirements set forth in G.S. § 47-30 as
amended, and the Standards of Practice for Land Surveying in North Carolina.
      C.   UDO Administrator action. Where all required improvements have been
completed, upon receipt of a completed application, the UDO Administrator shall
review the application for conformance with the applicable approval criteria
listed in Article 4.6.10.I. In performing such review, the UDO Administrator
may consult with the Technical Review Committee or other applicable review
entities or consultants. If the final plat for a subdivision is in compliance
with the applicable approval criteria listed in Article 4.6.10.I., the Planning
Board shall approve the final plat. If the required improvements have not been
completed see provisions for improvement guarantees.
      D.   Provision of improvement guarantees. Where the required improvements
have not been completed prior to the submission of the final plat, the UDO
Administrator may, in consultation with the Town Council, accept from the
applicant an improvements guarantee using one of the methods described in
Article 4.6.12 (improvement guarantees).
      E.   Action by the Planning Board.
         1.   In the event required improvements have not been completed, upon
receipt of a completed application, and agreed upon improvement guarantees, the
UDO Administrator shall review the application for conformance with the
applicable approval criteria listed in Article 4.6.10.I. In performing such
review, the UDO Administrator may consult with the Technical Review Committee
or other applicable review entities or consultants. The UDO Administrator shall
forward the final plat to the Planning Board for review prior to its next
scheduled meeting and the Planning Board shall take final action within 30
days; however, this time period may be extended upon written request of the
applicant if the UDO Administrator finds that extensive modifications are
necessary.
         2.   If the final plat for a subdivision is in compliance with the
applicable approval criteria listed in Article 4.6.10.I., the Planning Board
shall approve the final plat. This approval and all other required endorsements
(see F below) shall be noted on the original and three copies of the final
plat. The original shall be returned to the applicant. One copy shall be
transmitted to the Brunswick County Health Department, one copy shall be
transmitted to the Brunswick County Engineering and Utilities, and one copy
shall be retained for the permanent files of the Planning Board. The approval
shall grant the applicant authority to record the subdivision plat and to begin
the sale of lots unless the subdivider has entered into pre-sale, pre-lease
agreements with lot purchasers based on preliminary plat approval under Article
4.6.9.
         3.   If the final plat is not in compliance, the reasons for
disapproval and conditions to be met before approval of the final plat shall be
noted on two copies of the proposed final plat. One copy shall be returned to
the applicant and one copy shall be retained for the Planning Board’s records.
      F.   Required endorsements. The following endorsements shall be
prominently located on all copies of an approved final plat. The UDO
Administrator may waive endorsements that are not relevant.

      G.   Appeal. If the final plat is denied by the Planning Board, the
applicant may appeal to the Board of Adjustment. Any appeal must be taken
within 30 days after the decision of the Planning Board is filed in the town
office or after a written copy of the decision is mailed to the appellant by
registered mail return receipt requested, whichever is later. Such appeal shall
be for the Board of Adjustment to determine if the Planning Board correctly
applied the subdivision review requirements to the subdivision request.
      H.   Effect of denial. The applicant shall have the later of six months
from the time of final notification of denial by the Planning Board or the
expiration of 24 months after preliminary plat approval to submit a revised
final plat, at which time the approved preliminary plat shall be null and void.
      I.   Final plat approval criteria. Subdivision plats shall be approved
only when the Planning Board finds that all of the following conditions exist:
         1.   The plat substantially complies with the approved preliminary
plat;
         2.   The plat complies with the standards of Article 12, (Subdivision
Standards), and the other applicable requirements of this ordinance;
         3.   All necessary rights-of-way have been offered for reservation or
dedication;
         4.   All necessary drainage easements have been provided; and
         5.   All required endorsements and certifications have been obtained.
      J.   Expiration of final plat approval/recordation required. Approved
final plats shall be recorded with the Brunswick County Register of Deeds
within six months from the date of approval, if the final plat is not recorded
within this period, it shall expire. The plat may be resubmitted for review and
it shall be reviewed against the ordinance in effect at that time.
      K.   Limitations of final plat approval. The approval of a final plat
pursuant to regulations adopted under this Article shall not constitute or
affect the acceptance by the town or the public of the dedication of any street
or other ground, public utility line, or other public facility shown on the
plat. Public roads must be accepted by the state’s Department of
Transportation.
   4.6.11   Minor subdivision plat approval.
      A.   The procedures for approval of minor subdivisions are intended to
simplify processing of routine small subdivisions with due regard to protection
of the public interest. The approval process difference between the minor and
major subdivision process is that minor subdivisions do not require a
preliminary plat.
         1.   Applicants petitioning for minor subdivision plat approval shall
meet with the UDO Administrator and submit a concept plan or, alternatively, a
survey plat, for a determination of whether the approval process authorized by
this Article can be used.
         2.   The UDO Administrator may require the applicant to submit
additional information to make this determination, including, but not limited
to, a copy of the tax map showing the land being subdivided and all lots
created out of that tract of land within the previous five years.
         3.   The UDO Administrator may refer the minor plat application to the
TRC for consideration and recommendation. Following TRC review, if any, the UDO
Administrator may approve, approve with minor modification, deny the
application, or refer the application to the Planning Board for a final
decision. Reasons for the decision shall be transmitted in writing to the
applicant. Delivery may be via email, written decision on the face of the plat,
or in letter form.
      B.   There shall be only one minor subdivision approved on any original
tax parcel in any five- year period.
      C.   After completion of a pre-application conference and sketch plan
review, the applicant may apply directly for approval of a final plat.
      D.   A minor subdivision plat shall only be approved when it meets all of
the approval criteria set forth below:
         1.   The plat complies with the applicable standards of Article 12,
Subdivision Standards, and the other applicable requirements of this ordinance;
         2.   The plat indicates that all subject lots will have frontage on
existing approved streets, or access for ingress and egress on a private
street;
         3.   All necessary drainage easements have been provided; and
         4.   All required endorsements and certifications have been obtained
(see Article 4.6.10(F)).
      E.   Notwithstanding the above, qualified expedited minor subdivisions
are to be approved administratively by the UDO Administrator when all of the
approval criteria set forth below are met. A minor subdivision plat shall only
be approved when it meets all of the approval criteria set forth below:
         1.   The tract or parcel to be divided is not exempted under G.S §
160D-802(a);
         2.   No part of the tract or parcel to be divided has been divided
under this subsection in the ten years prior to division;
         3.   The entire area of the tract or parcel to be divided is greater
than five acres;
         4.   After division, no more than three lots result from the division;
         5.   After division, all resultant lots comply with all lot dimension
size requirements of the applicable zoning district, the use of the lots is in
conformity with the applicable zoning district, and a permanent means of
ingress and egress is recorded for each lot.
   4.6.12   Improvement guarantees.
      A.   Agreement and security required. In lieu of requiring the
completion, installation, and dedication of all improvements prior to final
plat approval, the town may enter into an agreement with the subdivider whereby
the subdivider shall agree to complete all required improvements, with the
exception of electric utilities. This agreement shall be accompanied by a
survey plat indicating the property boundaries and lot lines, if applicable, of
the area subject to the agreement. Once said agreement is signed by both
parties and the security required herein is provided, the final plat may be
approved by the appropriate responsible authority as provided in this
ordinance, if all other requirements of this ordinance are met. The town shall
not have the authority to mandate one type of guarantee over another. To secure
this agreement, the subdivider shall provide, subject to the approval of the
UDO Administrator, either one or a combination of the following guarantees
equal to 125% of the entire cost as provided herein.
         1.   Surety performance bond(s). The subdivider shall obtain a
performance bond(s) from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in
North Carolina. The bonds shall be payable to the town and shall be equal to,
either alone or in combination with any other surety discussed in this Article,
a total amount equal to 125% of the entire cost, as estimated by the
subdividers and approved by the town, of installing all required improvements,
with the exception of electric utilities.
         2.   Security. The subdivider shall deposit an irrevocable letter of
credit or other instrument readily convertible into cash at face value, either
with the town or in escrow with a financial institution designated as an
official depository of the town. The amount of the deposit shall be equal,
either alone or in combination with any other security discussed in this
Article, to a total amount equal to 125% of the cost, as estimated by the
subdivider’s engineer and approved by the town of installing all required
improvements, with the exception of electric utilities. If cash or other
instrument is deposited in escrow with a financial institution as provided
above, then the subdivider shall file with the town an agreement between the
financial institution and himself or herself guaranteeing the following:
            a.   That said escrow account shall be held in trust until released
by the town and may not be used or pledged by the subdivider in any other
matter during the term of the escrow; and
            b.   That in the case of failure on the part of the subdivider to
complete said improvements, the financial institution shall, upon notification
by the town and submission by the town to the financial institution of an
engineer’s estimate of the amount needed to complete the improvements,
immediately either pay to the town the funds estimated to complete the
improvements, up to the full balance of the escrow account, or deliver to the
town any other instruments fully endorsed or otherwise made payable in full to
the town.
         3.   Certification of electric utilities. A written statement by the
utility company authorized to serve the subdivision stating their commitment to
install electric utilities with projected completion dates may be accepted in
lieu of guarantees set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
      B.   Default. Upon default, meaning failure on the part of the subdivider
to complete the required improvements in a timely manner as spelled out in the
performance bond or escrow agreement, then the surety, or the financial
institution holding the escrow account shall pay all or any portion of the bond
or escrow fund to the town up to the amount needed to complete the improvements
based on an engineering estimate. Upon payment, the town may expend such
portion of said funds as it deems necessary to complete all or any portion of
the required improvements.
      C.   Release of guarantee security.
         1.   The performance guarantee shall be returned or released, as
appropriate, in a timely manner upon the acknowledgment by the town that the
improvements for which the performance guarantee is being required are
complete. The town shall return letters of credit or escrowed funds upon
completion of the required improvements to its specifications or upon
acceptance of the required improvements, if the required improvements are
subject to town acceptance. When required improvements that are secured by a
bond are completed to the specifications of the town, or are accepted by the
local government, if subject to its acceptance, upon request by the developer,
the town shall timely provide written acknowledgment that the required
improvements have been completed.
         2.   In the event that the applicant wishes to occupy any building or
any portion of any building prior to the completion of the required site
improvements, the town shall retain the bond guaranteeing improvements until
the remaining required improvements are completed.
      D.   Duration and extension.
         1.   The duration of the performance guarantee shall initially be one
year, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the required
improvements necessitates a longer duration. In the case of a bonded
obligation, the completion date shall be set one year from the date the bond is
issued, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the required
improvements necessitates a longer duration.
         2.   A developer shall demonstrate reasonable, good-faith progress
toward completion of the required improvements that are secured by the
performance guarantee or any extension. If the improvements are not completed
to the specifications of the town, and the current performance guarantee is
likely to expire prior to completion of the required improvements, the
performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance guarantee issued,
for an additional period. An extension under this subdivision shall only be for
a duration necessary to complete the required improvements. If a new
performance guarantee is issued, the amount shall be equal to 125% of the total
cost of all incomplete improvements.
   4.6.13   Re-subdivision procedures. For any re-platting or re-subdivision of
land, the same procedures, rules, and regulations shall apply as prescribed
herein for an original subdivision submittal.

§ 4.8 VESTED RIGHTS AND PERMIT CHOICE.
   4.8.1   Establishment of a vested right, general.
      A.   A vested right shall be deemed established upon the valid approval
of a site-specific vesting plan or multi-phased development following any
required notice and public hearing as provided for by law (Article 4.1.4 and
Article 4.1.5).
      A site-specific vesting plan may be in the form of a planned unit
development, a subdivision plat, a preliminary or general development plan
(e.g., site plan, a master development plan, and the like), a conditional
district zoning plan, or any other land use approval designation utilized by
the town. A variance shall not constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and
approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be
obtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary
variance is obtained.
      B.   The approval authority may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon
such terms and conditions as may be reasonably necessary to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested
right being established, provided that failure to satisfy any of the terms and
conditions so imposed will result in a forfeiture of vested rights.
      C.   A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed approved as of the
effective date of the approval authority’s final action or adoption of an
ordinance relating thereto.
   4.8.2   Approval procedures and approval authority.
      A.   Except as otherwise provided in this Article, an application for
site-specific vesting plan approval shall be processed in accordance with the
procedures established by this ordinance and shall be considered by the
designated approval authority for the specific type of zoning or land use
permit or approval for which application is made.
      B.   Notwithstanding the provisions of division A. above, if the
authority to issue a particular development approval, SUP, or rezoning has been
delegated by ordinance to a board, committee, or administrative official other
than the Town Council, in order to obtain a zoning vested right, the applicant
must request in writing at the time of application that the application be
considered and acted on by the Town Council following notice and legislative
hearing as provided in G.S. § 160D-601. Such hearing and granting of vested
rights shall occur after the initial development approval is issued.
   4.8.3   Duration of vested rights.
      A.   A vested right established pursuant to this Article shall remain
vested for a period of two years from the effective date thereof. The town may
provide for rights to be vested for a period exceeding two years but not
exceeding five years where warranted in light of all relevant circumstances,
including, but not limited to, the size and phasing of development, the level
of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles, and market
conditions or other considerations.
      B.   Nothing in this Article shall be construed to exempt a site-specific
vesting plan with respect to which a vested right has been established from
subsequent review or approvals by the town to ensure compliance with the terms
and conditions of the original approval as provided for in the original
approval or by applicable town code provisions.
      C.   The establishment of a vested right pursuant to this Article shall
not preclude the application of overlay zoning that imposes additional
requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or
ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all
property subject to land use regulation by the town. These include, but are not
limited to: building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. New and
amended zoning regulations that would be applicable to certain property if a
vested right had not been established shall become effective upon the
expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this Article.
      D.   Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions of
G.S. § 160D-1111 and the revocation provisions of G.S. § 160D-1115 shall apply,
except that a building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the
running of time while a zoning vested right under this Article is outstanding.
   4.8.4   Termination of vested rights. A zoning right that has been vested as
provided in this Article shall terminate:
      A.   At the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to
buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been
filed;
      B.   Upon written request or with the written consent of the affected
landowner;
      C.   Upon findings by the Town Council, by ordinance after notice and an
evidentiary hearing, that natural or human-made hazards on or in the immediate
vicinity of the property would, if uncorrected, pose a serious threat to the
public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as
contemplated in the site-specific vesting plan;
      D.   Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all
costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not
limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural,
planning, marketing, legal, and other consultant’s fees incurred after approval
by the town, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid.
Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property
which is caused by such action;
      E.   Upon findings by the Town Council, by ordinance after notice and an
evidentiary hearing, that the landowner or his or her representative
intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material
misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the approval
authority of the site- specific vesting plan; or
      F.   Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or
regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site-specific
vesting plan, in which case the approval authority may modify the affected
provisions upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a
fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and a hearing.
   4.8.5   Transitional provisions.
      A.   Jurisdiction. Any project for which a building and/or zoning permit
has been issued by the county prior to the effective date of an annexation or
an extraterritorial jurisdiction expansion may be completed under the
requirements of the ordinance(s) in effect at the time all required permits/
certificates were issued. Upon completion, any development, project, or
improvement not in full compliance with the requirements of this ordinance
shall be considered nonconforming.
      B.   Existing vested rights. The town recognizes that some owners of
property within the town limits have vested rights to complete development and/
or construction in accordance with approvals issued or granted by the county
prior to the effective date of this ordinance. Subsections below are intended
to facilitate the interpretation of existing vested rights in the situations
described therein.
         1.   Work in progress on effective date. The adoption of this
ordinance or a part hereof does not require a change in the plans,
construction, or designated use of any building for which actual construction
was lawfully begun prior to the adoption of this ordinance, provided that such
actual construction and work is not discontinued for an uninterrupted time
lasting 60 calendar days or longer. Such interruption shall result in
revocation of building and zoning permits unless the UDO Administrator grants a
time extension. For the purposes of this provision ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION
includes:
            a.   Demolition and removal of an existing structure in connection
with approved and permitted site work and/or construction;
            b.   Site work; or
            c.   Erection or installation of construction materials in
permanent position.
         2.   Approvals granted before effective date. Building permits,
variances, special use permits, subdivision plans, site plans, site-specific
vesting plans, multi-phased developments, planned unit development plans,
master plans, and other similar approvals by the county that are valid on the
day prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall remain effective until
such approvals would have expired under applicable law in effect on the day
prior to the effective date of this ordinance. Site improvements, buildings,
and other structures may be completed in accordance with such approvals even if
any such site improvement, building, or other structure does not fully comply
with the provisions of this ordinance. If work is not commenced within the time
that an approval would have remained effective under applicable law in effect
on the day prior to the effective date of this ordinance, or any extension
granted, then the site improvement, building, and/or structure must meet the
standards of this ordinance as it is in effect at the time of reapplication.
         3.   Application pending on effective date. Applications for building
permits, variances, special use permits, subdivision plans, site plans, site-
specific vesting plans, multi-phased developments, master plans, or other
similar approvals that were submitted to the county in complete form and are
pending approval on the effective date of this ordinance will be reviewed and
acted on under the terms of the county requirements in effect on the effective
date of this ordinance. Applications that were submitted to the county, but
were not in complete form or pending approval prior to the effective date of
this ordinance, will be reviewed and acted upon under the provisions of this
ordinance.
         4.   Violations. A violation of the prior applicable county regulation
will continue as a violation under this ordinance, and will be subject to
penalties and enforcement under Article 6 of this ordinance. The adoption of
this ordinance does not affect nor prevent any pending or future action to
abate violations of prior regulations.
         5.   Nonconformities. Nonconformities under a prior regulation may
continue under these regulations as provided in Article 5 herein.
   4.8.6   Exemptions.
      A.   These regulations shall not apply to any land or structure for
which, prior to the effective date hereof, there is a properly approved site-
specific vesting plan as required by the requirements previously adopted. Any
preliminary or final subdivision plat approvals required for such approved or
exempted site-specific vesting plans shall be conducted in accordance with the
requirements of the previous zoning ordinance or subdivision ordinance. The
provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to existing bona fide farms within
the extra-territorial jurisdiction (ETJ).
      B.   In accordance with G.S. § 160D-913, the town’s UDO applies to state-
owned lands only when a building is involved.
   4.8.7   Miscellaneous provisions.
      A.   A vested right, once established as provided for in this Article,
precludes any zoning action by the town that would change, alter, impair,
prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as
set forth in an approved site-specific vesting plan.
      B.   Nothing in this Article shall prohibit the revocation of the
original approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms
and conditions of the approval or the zoning ordinance.
      C.   A vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run
with the land with respect to the affected property. All successors in title
and interest of the owner who obtained the vested right shall be entitled to
exercise the right.
   4.8.8   Voluntary annexation. A petition for annexation filed with the town
under G.S. §§ 160A-31 or 160A-58.1 shall contain a signed statement by the
landowner(s) of said property declaring whether or not any zoning vested right
with respect to the properties subject to the petition has been established
under G.S. §§ 160D-108 or 160D-108.1. The failure to sign a statement declaring
whether or not a zoning vested right has been established shall be binding on
the landowner and any such zoning vested right shall be terminated.
   4.8.9   Limitations. Nothing in this Article is intended or shall be deemed
to create any vested right other than those established pursuant to G.S. §§
160D-108 or 160D-108.1.
   4.8.10   Repealer. In the event that G.S. §§ 160D-108 or 160D-108.1 is
repealed, this Article shall be deemed repealed and the provisions hereof no
longer effective.
   4.8.11   Effective date. This Article shall only apply to site-specific
vesting plans approved on or after the effective date of this ordinance.
   4.8.12   Permit choice. If a land development regulation is amended between
the time a development permit application was submitted and a development
permit decision is made or if a land development regulation is amended after a
development permit decision has been challenged and found to be wrongfully
denied or illegal, G.S. § 143-755 applies.

   Variances, see G.S. § 160D-705(d)
§ 4.9 SPECIAL USE PERMIT.
   4.9.1   Purpose and applicability.
      This ordinance provides for a number of uses to be located by right in
each general zoning district subject to the use meeting certain area, height,
yard, and off-street parking and loading requirements. In addition to these
uses, this ordinance allows some uses to be allowed in these districts on a
special use basis subject to issuance of a special use permit by the Town
Council. Uses requiring a special use permit are shown in Article 7.16.
      The purpose of having these uses be special is to ensure that they would
be compatible with surrounding development and in keeping with the purposes of
the general zoning district in which they are located and would meet other
criteria as set forth in this section.
      A special use permit allows flexibility within the zoning ordinance. A
zoning ordinance cannot account for every situation, and the special use permit
gives the decision authority discretion to allow uses for the benefit of the
neighborhood that are not otherwise specifically allowed.
   4.9.2   Approval process. The deadline for which a special use permit
application shall be filed with the UDO Administrator is the first business day
of the month. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan drawn to
scale, and necessary supporting text which shall include the following the
information:
      A.   Name, address, and phone number of the property owner or his or her
agent, and the tax parcel number of the property. The property owner or an
authorized agent are the only two parties who may initiate a request for a
special use permit;
      B.   A boundary survey and vicinity map, showing the property’s total
acreage, zoning classification(s), general location in relation to adjoining
streets, railroads, and/or waterways, date, and north arrow;
      C.   The owner’s names and addresses, tax parcel numbers, and existing
land use(s) of all adjoining properties;
      D.   Proposed use of all land and structures including the number of
residential units, if applicable;
      E.   Proposed number and location of all structures, their approximate
area, and their approximate exterior dimensions;
      F.   All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way;
      G.   Delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain, as shown on
the official Federal Emergency Management Act (FEMA) flood hazard boundary maps
for the town; and
      H.   Traffic, parking, and circulation plans, showing the proposed
location and arrangement of parking spaces and ingress and egress to adjacent
streets.
   4.9.3   Additional information.
      A.   In the course of evaluating the proposed special use, the Town
Council may request additional information from the applicant. A request for
any additional information may temporarily suspend any further consideration of
the application by the Town Council.
      B.   This information requested may include, but shall not be limited to,
the following as considered necessary by the Town Council:
         1.   Stormwater drainage plan;
         2.   Existing and proposed topography at five-foot contour intervals
or less;
         3.   The existing and proposed location of all water and sewer lines
and fire hydrants intended to serve the proposed development;
         4.   Proposed number, type, and location of signs;
         5.   A transportation impact analysis of the proposed development
prepared by a qualified transportation or traffic engineer or planner as
defined by Article 4.11;
            a.   A cover sheet which provides, in summary form, a description
of the proposed project;
            b.   A statement of purpose and need of the project;
            c.   For projects proposed by public entities, a list of
alternatives of the proposed project;
            d.   A succinct description of the environment affected by the
project;
            e.   A discussion of short and long-term consequences of the
project on the environment, including any adverse environmental impacts which
cannot be avoided; and
            f.   A list of means which could be employed to mitigate any
negative effects on the environment caused by this project.
         7.   A description of all screening and landscaping required by these
regulations and/or proposed by the applicant; and
         8.   Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time for the
project.
   4.9.4   Application completeness.
      A.   No application shall be deemed complete unless it contains or is
accompanied by all items listed in Article 4.9.2 and as may be required by
Article 4.9.3 and a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule approved by the Town
Council for the submittal of special use permit applications (see Article
2.17).
      B.   Eight copies of an application, and all attachments and maps, for a
special use permit shall be submitted to the town.
      C.   Once complete, the UDO Administrator shall notify the Board of
Adjustment that an evidentiary hearing must be scheduled.
   4.9.5   Review of approval of a conditional zoning district.
      A.   It is intended that property shall be reclassified to a conditional
zoning district only in the event of firm plans to develop the property.
Therefore, no sooner than three years after the date of approval of the
petition, the UDO Administrator may examine the progress made toward developing
the property in accordance with the approved petition and any conditions
attached to the approval.
      B.   A report of the findings of the UDO Administrator may be provided
for Planning Board consideration, which may then recommend that the property be
rezoned to its previous zoning classification or to another district
   4.9.6   Notice/hearing.
      A.   Special use permit cases are quasi-judicial, and all witnesses are
to be sworn in.
      B.   Prior to the Town Council making a decision on a special use permit,
a quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing shall be conducted. A quorum of the Board
is required for this hearing. Mailed and posted notice of the hearing shall be
in accordance with Article 4.1.4.
         1.   Evidence/presentation of evidence.
            a.   All persons who intend to present evidence to the Board of
Adjustment shall be sworn.
            b.   All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or
denial of the requested permit or appeal (necessary findings) shall be based
upon reliable evidence. Competent evidence (evidence admissible in a court of
law) shall be preferred whenever reasonably available, but in no case may
necessary findings be based solely upon incompetent evidence unless competent
evidence is not reasonably available, the evidence in question appears to be
particularly reliable, and the matter at issue is not seriously disputed.
            c.   The Town Council has the authority to limit testimony that is
irrelevant.
            d.   The entirety of a quasi-judicial hearing and deliberation
shall be conducted in open session.
            e.   Parties to a quasi-judicial hearing have a right to cross-
examine witnesses.
            f.   Factual findings must not be based on hearsay evidence which
would be inadmissible in a court of law.
            g.   If a Town Council member has prior or specialized knowledge
about a case, that knowledge should be disclosed to the rest of the Board and
parties at the beginning of the hearing.
   4.9.7   Town Council review and action.
      A.   Once the application has been accepted, and required notification
have been completed the Town Council shall review the special use application
at their next schedule meeting, as long as it is received at least 25 days in
advance of the meeting.
      B.   The Town Council may, in its review, suggest reasonable conditions
to the location, nature, and extent of the proposed use and its relationship to
surrounding properties, parking areas, driveways, pedestrian and vehicular
circulation systems, screening and landscaping, timing of development, and any
other conditions the Town Council may find appropriate. The conditions may
include dedication of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer,
or other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed development.
Conditions and safeguards imposed under this subsection shall not include
requirements for which the town does not have authority under statute to
regulate nor requirements for which the courts have held to be unenforceable if
imposed directly by the local government, including, without limitation, taxes,
impact fees, building design elements within the scope of G.S. § 160D-702(b),
driveway-related improvements in excess of those allowed in G.S. §§ 136-18(29)
and 160A-307, or other unauthorized limitations on the development or use of
land.
      C.   In approving an application for a special use permit, the Town
Council may attach fair and reasonable conditions to the approval. The
applicant will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any
additional requirements prior to approval or denial by the Board, which must be
consented to in writing. In no instance shall any of these conditions be less
restrictive than any requirements which would pertain to that particular
development found elsewhere in a similar zoning district.
      D.   The applicant has the burden of producing competent, material, and
substantial evidence tending to establish the facts and conditions which
division E. below require.
      E.   The Town Council shall issue a special use permit if it has
evaluated an application through a quasi-judicial process and determined that:
         1.   The proposed use will have either a minimal effect or positive
effect on the public health or safety;
         2.   The use meets all required conditions and specifications;
         3.   The proposed use will have no material adverse effect on the
value of adjoining or abutting properties unless the use is a public necessity;
and
         4.   The proposed use is in harmony with the CAMA Land Use Plan/
comprehensive plan and/or other plans adopted by the Town Council.
   4.9.8   Effect of approval. If an application for a special use permit is
approved by the Town Council, the owner of the property shall have the ability
to develop the use in accordance with the stipulations contained in the permit,
or develop any other use listed as a permitted use for the general zoning
district in which it is located.
   4.9.9   Binding effect.
      A.   Any special use permit so authorized shall be binding to the
property included in the permit unless subsequently changed or amended by the
Town Council. However, minor changes may be made with the approval of the UDO
Administrator on a one-time basis only in the detail of the approved
application which:
         1.   Will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development
to adjacent property;
         2.   Will not increase the gross floor area of any nonresidential use
by the smaller of 10% or 10,000 square feet;
         3.   Will not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the
yards provided at the periphery of the site by greater than five feet.
      B.   Further changes to the development may only be made by the original
issuing authority in accordance with the process for initial approval.
      C.   For example, if a special use permit is issued for a building having
a gross floor area of 100,000 square feet, under this provision the property
owner could, subject to approval of the UDO Administrator, construct a building
with a gross floor area of up to 110,000 square feet. If the property owner
subsequently had the permit amended authorizing construction of a building of
up to 150,000 square feet, the UDO Administrator could allow the construction
of a building having a gross area of up to 160,000 square feet.
   4.9.10   Certificate of occupancy. No certificate of occupancy for a use
listed as a special use shall be issued for any building or land use on a piece
of property which has received a special use permit for the particular use
unless the building is constructed or used, or the land is developed or used,
in conformity with the permit approved by the Board of Adjustment. In the event
that only a segment of a proposed development has been approved, the
certificate of occupancy shall be issued only for that portion of the
development constructed or used as approved.
   4.9.11   Twelve-month limitation on re-application. If a request for special
use permit is denied by the Town Council, a similar application for the same
property or any portion thereof shall not be filed until the expiration of a
12-month period from the date of the most recent denial. This waiting period
shall not be applicable where the application for a special use permit is
substantially different.
   4.9.12   Change in special use permit. Any request to materially change the
special use permit once it has been issued must first be reviewed and approved
in accordance with Article 4.9.2a requiring the same procedure as was used for
the initial approval of the permit.
   4.9.13   Implementation of special use permit (SUP). Unless the Town Council
issues a special use permit, which either is specifically exempt from any time
constraints or has some other agreed upon time period for implementation of the
site-specific vesting plan, the vesting period has begun upon approval of the
site-specific vesting plan and issuance of the permit (Article 4.8).
   If the development project is not completed by the expiration of the vested
rights or previously approved time frame, the UDO Administrator shall notify
the applicant of this finding and, within 60 days of the notification, the Town
Council shall make a recommendation concerning the revision of the special use
permit. The Board, after having conducted an evidentiary hearing to consider
the revision, may then rescind the permit or extend the life of the permit for
a specified period of time. Due notice of the public hearing shall be given as
prescribed in Article 4.9.6.

§ 4.10 APPEAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION.
   4.10.1   Applicability. As specified in G.S. § 160D-405, an appeal by any
person aggrieved by a final order, interpretation, or decision of the UDO
Administrator or other administrator in regard to the provisions of this
ordinance may be taken to the Board of Adjustment.
   4.10.2   Application requirements.
      A.   Any person who has standing under G.S. § 160D-1402(c) or the town
may appeal a decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal of an
administrative decision shall be taken by filing a written notice of appeal
with the UDO Administrator and the Board of Adjustment specifying the grounds
for the appeal. The appeal shall be submitted on a form provided by the town.
      B.   A notice of appeal of an administrative decision shall be considered
filed when a completed application is delivered to the UDO Administrator. The
date and time of filing shall be entered on the notice.
   4.10.3   Deadline for submission of application. An appeal of an
administrative decision shall be filed with the UDO Administrator and Board of
Adjustment within 30 days of receipt of the written decision. The official who
made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the property
subject to the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different
from the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery,
electronic mail, or by first class mail. Any person with standing to appeal has
30 days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the
final decision or notice of determination within which to file an appeal. In
the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given pursuant to G.S. § 160D-
403(b) by first class mail is deemed received on the third business day
following deposit of the notice for mailing with the United States Postal
Service.
   4.10.4   Notice and public hearings. The Board of Adjustment shall hold a
quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing and give posted and mailed notice in
accordance with Article 4.1.4.
   4.10.5   Action by UDO Administrator. The UDO Administrator shall transmit
to the Board of Adjustment all the documents and exhibits constituting the
record upon which the action appealed was taken. The official shall also
provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property
that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner. The
official who made the decision or the person currently occupying that position,
if the decision maker is no longer employed by the town, shall be present at
the evidentiary hearing as a witness.
   4.10.6   Action by Board of Adjustment.
      A.   The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or
may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and
shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that in its
opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the Board of
Adjustment shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is
taken.
      B.   A motion to reverse, affirm, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from shall include, insofar as practicable,
a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact that support the
motion.
      C.   If a motion to reverse or modify is not made, or fails to receive
the concurring vote of a simple majority of the members of the Board, the
appeal shall be denied.
   4.10.7   Effect of appeal.
      A.   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays
enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed
during the pendency of the appeal to the Board of Adjustment and any subsequent
appeal in accordance with G.S. § 160D-1402 or during the pendency of any civil
proceeding authorized by law or appeals therefrom, unless the official who made
the decision certifies to the Board after notice of appeal has been filed that,
because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril
to life or property or, because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay
would seriously interfere with enforcement of the development regulation. In
that case, enforcement proceedings are not stayed except by a restraining
order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not
stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited
hearing of the appeal, and the Board shall meet to hear the appeal within 15
days after such a request is filed.
      B.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, appeals of
decisions granting a development approval or otherwise affirming that a
proposed use of property is consistent with the development regulation does not
stay the further review of an application for development approvals to use the
property; in these situations, the appellant or town may request and the Board
may grant a stay of a final decision of development approval applications,
including building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
      C.   An appeal shall not stop action lawfully approved (including
construction activities authorized by a building permit). Only actions presumed
in violation of this ordinance are stayed.

      D.   Analysis scenarios. Scenarios for analysis shall include existing
conditions, and opening year with and without development, and may include five
or ten years after opening with or without development.
      E.   Assumptions. Trip generation and distribution assumptions including
trip generation categories, diversion assumptions, and distribution
assumptions. Assumed rate of growth in background traffic and developments in
the area that have been approved or are under review shall also be required.
      F.   Duration of study. The duration of traffic studies (the time period
for which they are considered a valid basis for approvals) for large projects,
particularly planned unit development, will be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis as part of the application review process.
      F.   Existing condition survey.
         1.   Street system description. The street system shall be described,
including geometric features, lane usage, traffic control, signage, sight
distances, and adjacent uses and curb cuts.
         2.   Traffic volumes. Existing peak hour traffic volumes shall be
provided for the impact area. Data shall be adjusted for daily and seasonal
variations. Turning movement counts for peak hour shall also be required for
critical intersections.
         3.   Capacity analysis. Existing capacity of signalized and un-
signalized intersections.
         4.   Other details. Other details may be required at the discretion of
the UDO Administrator depending upon the type and scale of the project. These
may include, but are not limited to, queue length analysis, pedestrian counts,
accident data, traffic speeds (both 50th and 80th percentile), and stopping
distances.
      H.   Future without development. Capacity analysis should be based on the
Highway Capacity Manual or other methodology approved in advance by the UDO
Administrator. In addition, the expected traffic growth over the next 20 years
based upon the developments currently approved by the county and all adjoining
jurisdictions shall also be considered.
      I.   Future with development.
         1.   Projections of peak hour traffic generation shall be made using
the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation Manual, unless the UDO Administrator determines that locally derived
data will provide more accurate forecasts. Data from similar facilities may be
used where the information is not available from the ITE.
         2.   Special analysis shall be required to determine the need for
signalization, minimum safe sight distances, gap analysis, turning radius
requirements, queue length analysis, turning lane length analysis, curb cut
locations, or similar requirements.
   4.11.4   Mitigation plan. Where the analysis indicates that the project will
create deficiencies in the impact area, improvements shall be recommended along
with projected cost estimates. The design of improvements shall be in
accordance with the state’s Department of Transportation. Where a mitigation
plan is not adequate to address the traffic impacts of the project, it shall
serve as a basis for denial of a planned unit development, preliminary plat,
site plan, or special use permit.
   4.11.5   Consultants. The UDO Administrator may require that an independent
consultant be hired by the town to perform the required studies or to review
all or part of a study prepared by the applicant’s consultant. The UDO
Administrator is authorized to administer the contract for any such consultant.
      A.   The town shall determine the scope of services to be performed by
the independent consultant and receive a cost estimate of such services.
      B.   The applicant shall provide an amount equal to the estimate to the
town, who shall deposit the amount in an escrow or other special account set up
for this purpose. Any funds not used shall be returned to the applicant in a
timely manner, without interest.
      C.   The town shall require additional funds for independent review where
a decision-making body expands the scope of the required review; the applicant
substantially amends the application; additional meetings involving the
consultant are requested by the applicant; or the consultant’s appearance is
requested at public or affected agency meetings beyond those anticipated in the
original scope of services.
   4.11.6   Period of validity. A transportation impact analysis shall be valid
for a specific site for no more than three years, so long as no significant
modifications to the development approved for the site are made.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 4.12 PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES.
   Other permits or certificates beyond those included in this Article may be
required. Consult with the UDO Administrator. Any development approval issued
in accordance with this UDO shall be in writing. The town may issue development
approvals in print or electronic form. Any development approval issued
exclusively in electronic form shall be protected from further editing once
issued. Applications for development approvals may be made by the landowner, a
lessee, or person holding an option or contract to purchase or lease land, or
an authorized agent of the landowner. An easement holder may also apply for
development approval for such development as is authorized by the easement.
Unless provided otherwise by law, all rights, privileges, benefits, burdens,
and obligations created by development approvals made pursuant to this UDO
attach to and run with the land.
   4.12.1   Zoning permit.
      A.   Applicability.
         1.   No excavation shall be commenced; no wall, structure, premises,
or land used, building or part thereof shall be built, constructed or altered;
nor shall any building be moved; nor shall any sign be erected or structurally
altered (unless exempted), until application has been made and the proper
permit has been obtained. When the UDO Administrator, with the technical
assistance of other town departments or consultant, has determined that the
proposed land use may be permitted under the provisions of this ordinance, a
permit for the proposed use shall be issued. In the event of an appeal of a
negative decision by the UDO Administrator, the Board of Adjustment may direct
issuance of the zoning permit, but only after overturning the UDO
Administrator’s decision to deny the zoning permit.
         2.   It shall be unlawful to change the type of use of land, or to
change the type of use or type of occupancy of any building, or to extend any
use or any lot on which there is a nonconforming use until the UDO
Administrator has issued a zoning permit for such intended use, including a
determination that the proposed use, in all respects, conforms to the
provisions of this ordinance.
         3.   Exemption. The UDO Administrator may, upon proof of approval by a
legally constituted HOA, POA, or similar entity, waive the zoning permit
requirement for enclosing an existing structure attached to an existing single-
family or duplex dwelling for the purpose of extending the established
residential use (e.g. enclosing a sunroom to allow for climate control).
      B.   Timing of application. In all cases where a building permit is
required, application to and approval from the town for a zoning permit shall
be made prior to the application to the county for a building permit. In all
other cases, application shall be made before initiating any of the activities
that trigger compliance with this Article.
      C.   Application requirements. All applications for a zoning permit shall
be submitted in accordance with Article 4.1.3 (Application Requirements).
      D.   Action by UDO Administrator.
         1.   If the proposed excavation, construction, moving, alteration, or
use of land, as set forth in an application for a zoning permit, is in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, the UDO Administrator shall
issue a zoning permit, provided that all of the following conditions shall
apply:
            a.   Issuance of a zoning permit shall in no case be construed as
waiving any provisions of this ordinance;
            b.   The UDO Administrator shall not grant any exceptions to the
actual meaning of any clause, standard, or regulation contained in this
ordinance to any person making application to excavate, construct, move, alter,
or use buildings, structures, or land;
            c.   The UDO Administrator shall issue a permit when the imposed
conditions of this ordinance are complied with by the applicant regardless of
whether the use of the permit would violate contractual or other arrangements
(including, but not by way of limitation, restrictive covenants) among private
parties; and
            d.   The zoning permit shall include a determination that plans,
specifications, and the intended use of such structure and land do, in all
respects, conform to the provisions of this ordinance. Prior to the issuance of
a zoning permit, the UDO Administrator shall consult with other applicable
persons, as necessary.
         2.   If the proposed excavation, construction, moving, alteration, or
use of land, as set forth in an application for a zoning permit, is not in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, the UDO Administrator shall
not issue a zoning permit. If an application for a zoning permit is
disapproved, the UDO Administrator shall state in writing the cause of such
disapproval and provide written notice to the applicant.
      E.   Expiration. Once a zoning permit has been issued, all activities
pursuant to such permit shall be commenced within 12 months. If the proposed
excavation, construction, moving, alteration, or use of land, as set forth in
an application for a zoning permit, is discontinued for a period of six months
or more, the zoning permit shall lapse and be of no further force and effect.
      F.   Appeal. Final action on a zoning permit may be appealed to the Board
of Adjustment in accordance with Article 4.10 (Appeal of Administrative
Decision).
   4.12.2   (Final) certificate of occupancy/compliance. No certificate of
occupancy or compliance shall be issued by the Brunswick County (the county)
Building Inspector until:
      A.   The UDO Administrator certifies that all applicable standards of
this ordinance have been met; and
      B.   No building, structure, or lot for which a zoning permit has been
issued shall be used or occupied until Building Inspections has, after final
inspection, recommended the issuance of a certificate of occupancy indicating
compliance has been made with all provisions of this ordinance. However, the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall in no case be construed as waiving
any provisions of this ordinance.
   4.12.3.   Temporary use permit. See Article 14.
   4.12.4.   Sign permit. See Article 11.
   4.12.5.    Stormwater permit. (Reserved)

§ 4.13 TEMPORARY MORATORIA PROCEDURES.
   North Carolina G.S. § 160D-107 explicitly recognizes the authority of
cities/towns to adopt temporary moratoria. The duration of any moratorium shall
be reasonable in light of the specific conditions that warrant imposition of
the moratorium and may not exceed the period of time necessary to correct,
modify, or resolve such conditions. Except in cases of imminent and substantial
threat to public health or safety, before adopting an ordinance imposing a
development moratorium with a duration of 60 days or any shorter period, the
Town Council shall hold a public hearing and shall publish a notice of the
hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the area not less than
seven days before the date set for the hearing. A development moratorium with a
duration of 61 days or longer, and any extension of a moratorium so that the
total duration is 61 days or longer, is subject to the notice and hearing
requirements of G.S. § 160D-601. Absent an imminent threat to public health or
safety, a development moratorium adopted pursuant to this section shall not
apply to any project for which a valid building permit issued pursuant to G.S.
§ 160D-1110 is outstanding, to any project for which a conditional special use
permit application has been accepted, to development set forth in a site-
specific or multi-phased development approved pursuant to G.S. §§ 160D-108 or
160D-108.1. to development for which substantial expenditures have already been
made in good faith reliance on a prior valid administrative or quasi-judicial
permit or approval, or to preliminary or final subdivision plats that have been
accepted for review by the town prior to the call for public hearing to adopt
the moratorium. Any preliminary subdivision plat accepted for review by the
town prior to the call for public hearing, if subsequently approved, shall be
allowed to proceed to final plat approval without being subject to the
moratorium.
   Any ordinance establishing a development moratorium must expressly include
at the time of adoption each of the following:
   4.13.1   A clear statement of the problems or conditions necessitating the
moratorium and what courses of action, alternative to a moratorium, were
considered by the town and why those alternative courses of action were not
deemed adequate;
   4.13.2   A clear statement of the development approvals subject to the
moratorium and how a moratorium on those approvals will address the problems or
conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium;
   4.13.3   An express date for termination of the moratorium and a statement
setting forth why that duration is reasonably necessary to address the problems
or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium; and
   4.13.4   A clear statement of the actions, and the schedule for those
actions, proposed to be taken by the town during the duration of the moratorium
to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
   No moratorium may be subsequently renewed or extended for any additional
period unless the town shall have taken all reasonable and feasible steps
proposed to be taken by the town in its ordinance establishing the moratorium
to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium
and unless new facts and conditions warrant an extension. Any ordinance
renewing or extending a development moratorium must expressly include, at the
time of adoption, the findings set forth in Article 4.13.1 through Article
4.13.4 of this ordinance, including what new facts or conditions warrant the
extension.
   Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a moratorium on development
approvals required by law may apply to the appropriate division of the General
Court of Justice for an order enjoining the enforcement of the moratorium, and
the court shall have jurisdiction to issue that order. In any such action, the
town shall have the burden of showing compliance with the procedural
requirements of this subsection.

ARTICLE 5
NONCONFORMITIES
§ 5.1 GENERAL.
   5.1.1   Scope. The regulations of this Article govern lots, uses, buildings,

      A.   Recognize the interests of property owners in continuing to use
their property for lawful purposes;
      B.   Promote reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings; and
      C.   Place reasonable limits on the expansion or alteration of
nonconformities that have the potential to adversely affect surrounding
properties or the community as a whole.

opposed to an illegal situation, rests with the subject landowner.
      B.   It shall be unlawful to maintain or continue any nonconforming use
until a nonconforming use certificate has been issued. However, nonconforming
uses existing as of the effective date of this ordinance shall be permitted to
continue for a six-month period from the time of notification by the UDO
Administrator that there is a nonconformity that necessitates obtaining such
certificate.

which it is now located.
   5.3.2   Continuation. Nonconforming uses of land or structures may continue
only in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
      A.   A nonconforming use shall not be expanded. Expansion shall include
an intensification of use, a physical expansion that results in increased
capacity or activity associated with the use, an extension of the hours of
operation or number of days of activity and any similar change in activity or
location.
      B.   A nonconforming use may not be relocated, in whole or part, to
another portion of the subject lot or parcel.
      C.   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use unless the

located. Once a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, a
nonconforming use shall not be re-established.
      D.   Where a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a
continuous period of 180 days, then the use shall not be re-established or
resumed and any subsequent use of the land or structure shall conform to the
requirements of this ordinance.
      E.   No structural changes shall be made in any structure occupied by a
nonconforming use except as follows:
         1.   Those structural changes ordered by an authorized official in
order to ensure the safety of the structure shall be permitted.
         2.   Maintenance and repairs to keep a structure in sound condition
shall be permitted.
         3.   Structural changes necessary to convert the nonconforming use to
a conforming use shall be permitted.
         4.   An existing nonconforming residential structure may be enlarged
or altered provided that no additional dwelling units result therefrom. Any
such enlargement or alterations shall be in compliance with all yard
requirements of the district and/or use.

nonconforming sign that was lawfully established in accordance with zoning
regulations in effect at the time of its establishment but that no longer
complies with one or more standards of this ordinance.
   5.4.2   Continuation. Nonconforming structures may remain, subject to the
standards of this ordinance.
   5.4.3   Enlargement or modification.
      A.   A nonconforming structure may be modified or altered provided such

   5.5.1.   Definition. A NONCONFORMING SIGN is a sign that was legally
established subject to a lawfully issued permit in compliance with the
applicable laws and ordinances in effect on the date of construction, but by
reason of its size, height, location, design, or construction is no longer in
compliance with the requirements of Article 11, (Signs) and has a valid
nonconforming use certificate. Nonconforming sign structures shall be included
in this definition.

days or more, and must be removed.
         3.   Sign removal shall include the entire sign and any or all
supports.
      B.   Any nonconforming sign or sign structure which has been damaged by

notice. It shall set forth those remedies the UDO Administrator may pursue, and
shall state that the correction order may be appealed to the Town Council. The
notice of violation shall be delivered to the holder of the development
approval and to the landowner of the property involved, if the landowner is not
the holder of the development approval, by personal delivery, electronic
delivery, or first class mail and may be provided by similar means to the
occupant of the property or the person undertaking the work or activity. The

the correction order.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 6.11 EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT NOTICE.
   If a delay in the correction of a violation would seriously threaten the
enforcement of this ordinance or pose a danger to the public health, safety, or
welfare, the UDO Administrator may seek immediate enforcement without prior
written notice through any of the remedies or penalties authorized in Article
6.12 below.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 6.12 REMEDIES AND PENALTIES.
   The UDO Administrator may pursue one or more of the following remedies and
penalties to prevent, correct, or abate a violation of this ordinance. Use of
one of the authorized remedies or penalties does not preclude the UDO
Administrator from using any other authorized remedies or penalties, nor does
it relieve any party from the imposition of one remedy or penalty from the
imposition of any other authorized remedies and penalties.
   6.12.1   Stop work orders. Whenever a building, structure, sign, or part
thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation
of this ordinance, the UDO Administrator may order the work to be immediately
stopped. The stop work order shall be in writing and directed to the owner,
occupant, or person doing the work. The stop work order shall state the
specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the
conditions under which the work may be resumed. Such action shall be in
accordance with G.S. Chapter 160A-321 or the North Carolina Building Code.
   6.12.2   Permit revocation. In accordance with the provision of Article 6.2,
the UDO Administrator may initiate the process to revoke any permit or
authorization granted under this ordinance for failure to comply with the
provisions of this ordinance or with the terms and conditions for a permit or
authorization granted under this ordinance. Such revocation shall be in
accordance with the process as was used in granting the initial approval,
including any applicable notice and required hearing.
   6.12.3   Permit denial. So long as a violation of this ordinance remains
uncorrected, the UDO Administrator may deny or withhold approval of any permit
or other authorization provided for in this ordinance that is sought for the
property on which the violation has occurred.
   6.12.4   Civil penalty.
      A.   A violation of this ordinance subjects the violator to a civil
penalty in the amount of $500 per day in accordance with G.S. Chapter 14-4(a).
The UDO Administrator may impose a civil penalty by giving the violator a
written citation, either in person or by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested. The citation shall describe the nature of the violation,
specify the amount of the civil penalty that is being imposed, and direct the
violator to pay the civil penalty to the town within ten days from the day the
citation is received. If the violator fails to pay the civil penalty within the
time limit, the UDO Administrator may institute appropriate civil action in a
court of competent jurisdiction to recover the civil penalty.
      B.   For the purpose of assessing the amount of the civil penalty, each
day the violation continues after the receipt of the correction order (or the
receipt of the actual citation in the case of emergency enforcement) shall
constitute a separate violation that subjects the violator to an additional
civil penalty. The UDO Administrator may impose monetary penalties of $500 for
each day the violation continues.
   6.12.5   Criminal penalties. Any violation of this ordinance may be enforced
as a misdemeanor or infraction as provided by G.S. Chapters14-1 and 113A-64,
subject to a maximum fine of $5,000.
   6.12.6   Injunction and abatement order. The UDO Administrator may institute
action in a court of competent jurisdiction for a mandatory or prohibitory
injunction and order of abatement commanding a violator to cease or correct a
violation of this ordinance. Pursuant to G.S. §§ 160A-175 and 14-4, if the
violator fails to comply with a court injunction or order of abatement and the
town executes the order, the town will have a lien on the property on which the
violation occurred for the town’s costs in executing the order.
   6.12.7   Alternative equitable relief. In addition to the above remedies and
penalties, the UDO Administrator may institute any other appropriate equitable
action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent, correct,
or abate a violation of this ordinance.

ARTICLE 7
ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 7.1 ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   All areas within the zoning jurisdiction of the town are hereby divided into
zoning districts within which the use of land and water areas; the location,
height, bulk, appearance, and use of structures; the provision of parking and
loading areas; and the provision of buffers and screening areas are regulated
as herein provided. Standards for roads are provided in Article 12. Note: In
the case of lots on the turning circle of a cul-de-sac, the curb width will be
a minimum of 50% of the district lot width requirement but not less than 20
feet.
   Zoning districts within the town’s jurisdiction fall within one of the
following three categories.
   7.1.1   General use zoning districts. Each general use district category
serves a different purpose and imposes its own set of requirements and
restrictions on the use of land in addition to the general requirements and
restrictions imposed on all land or uses within the zoning jurisdiction. A
general use district may be layered with an overlay district, which is a
special type of general use district.
   7.1.2   Conditional zoning districts.
      A.   Typically, conditional districts are established as parallel or
counterpart districts to a general use district. In such cases, references in
the zoning ordinance to the general use district shall be construed to also
include the counterpart conditional district. Conditional districts, like
general use districts, may be layered with overlay districts.
      B.   Each conditional district with a counterpart general use district is
intended to accomplish the purposes of the counterpart district through the
development of identified uses at a specific location in accordance with this
Article. All regulations and uses which apply to a general use district also
apply to the counterpart conditional district, and no use shall be allowed in
the conditional district that is not allowed in its counterpart general use
district.
   7.1.3   Overlay districts.
      A.   Overlay districts are established to provide for certain additional
requirements, to permit uses not otherwise permitted in the underlying
district, to prohibit uses allowed in the underlying district, or to establish
special development requirements for uses permitted. Thus, where overlay
districts exist, and there is a conflict between the requirements and/or uses
specified between the overlay and the underlying district, the standards of the
overlay district shall prevail. Otherwise, the standards of the underlying
district shall also be in effect for any area additionally zoned for an overlay
district.
      B.   A zoning map change either establishing or changing any overlay
district shall be subject to the same procedures and requirements as any other
zoning map change.

§ 7.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AREAS UNDER WATER OR OTHERWISE UNCLASSIFIED.
   7.2.1   All areas within the jurisdiction of the town that are under water
and are not shown as included within any district shall be subject to all of
the regulations of the district which immediately adjoins the water area. If
the water area adjoins two or more districts, the boundaries of each district
shall be construed to extend into the water in a straight line until they meet
the boundaries of another district or the jurisdictional limit.
   7.2.2   All lands within the jurisdiction of the town that are not under
water and are not shown as included within the limits of any district shall be
considered to be in R-20 Residential District until otherwise classified by an
amendment to this ordinance.

ordinance, this district may be expanded only to include additional property
containing single-family residential areas and their associated recreational
amenities and permanently protected open space that has been legally joined by
restrictive covenants to the town's Property Owner's Association
   Given the existence of a private contractual arrangement between individual
property owners within the Plantation and the town's Property Owners'
Association (POA), which regulates the development of single-family dwellings
on individual lots through a set of design guidelines, promulgated and enforced
by the POA's Architectural Control Committee, it is the intent of this district
to allow these regulations to continue to govern such development. A variety of
housing types are permitted, however, the homes will be built in designated
areas zoned and dedicated to housing type and purpose. A development may
consist of a mixture of housing types, however, each type must be in its
designated area and each area must be separated using an aesthetically suitable
transitional strategy buffering the types of neighborhoods. See Article 12.9
for open space and recreational space requirements.
   However, in order to ensure that the health, safety, and general welfare of
the residents and owners of property within this district are protected, the
character of these residential areas is preserved and to prevent environmental
damage, the following minimum standards shall apply.

that is being mitigated.
      C.   Setbacks.
         1.   Attached WTF. The building or structure to which the WTF will be
attached shall maintain the normal setbacks of the district.
         2.   Freestanding WTF. Setbacks for WTFs shall be determined according
to the underlying zoning district, plus an additional one foot of setback (on
each side) for every one-foot of tower height. The Zoning Administrator may
approve reductions to this setback requirement as a part of the special use
permit approval with certification by a registered engineer that the resulting
setbacks provide adequate fall area in case of a tower collapse.
         3.   Mitigation of an existing WTF. A new WTF approved as mitigation
shall not be required to meet setback requirements so long as the new WTF is no
closer to any property lines or dwelling units as the WTF being mitigated and a
certification by a registered engineer that the resulting setbacks provide
adequate fall area in case of a tower collapse.
      D.   Buffers.
         1.   A landscaped buffer shall surround the base of the WTF equipment
compound. Existing trees and shrubs on the site shall be preserved and may be

around the entire perimeter of the facilities.
         4.   Security fencing at least eight feet in height shall be placed
around the entire perimeter of the facility.
      E.   Location of existing towers. In no case shall a telecommunications
tower be located closer than two miles from another tower unless the builder,
user, carrier, and the like, can establish through competent evidence and
documentation either that:
         1.   It is in the best interests of the community that the proposed
tower be located less than two miles from another tower; or
         2.   It is necessary for technical and/or capacity reasons that the
proposed tower be located less than two miles from another tower.
   8.101.4   Aesthetics.
      A.   Stealth attached WTFs, including feed lines and antennas, shall be
designed so as to be compatible with the facade, roof, wall, or structure on
which it is affixed so that it matches the existing structural design, color,
and texture.
      B.   Freestanding WTFs shall be designed so as to be compatible with
adjacent structures and landscapes to the extent feasible with specific design
considerations as to height, scale, color, and texture.
      C.   Commercial messages may not be displayed on any WTF.
   8.101.5   Application requirements. In addition to all of the requirements
of a site plan review, the following information must be supplied with the

supporting the need for a new antenna or a new tower;
      B.   A certified report by a registered engineer or other qualified
professional of diligent efforts to locate an appropriate site based on the
hierarchy established elsewhere in this Article;
      C.   For the proposed use of an existing facility, a report evaluating
the adequacy of all alternative existing facilities to meet the applicants need
and the reasons existing higher hierarchical preferred facilities cannot be
used; and
      D.   In the case of a new WTF:
         1.   Evidence that no existing WTF can accommodate the applicant’s
proposed antenna(s); or that use of such existing WTFs would prohibit personal
wireless services in the area of the town to be served by the proposed WTF
structure;
         2.   Evidence that the WTF has sufficient structural integrity to
accommodate multiple future users, and the number of additional users that can
be accommodated on the proposed WTF is specified. The builder, user, carrier,
and the like, shall also submit documentation that the owner of the tower or
antenna is willing to permit other user(s) to attach accessory communications
facilities which do not interfere with the primary purpose of the tower or
antenna, provided that such other user(s) agree to negotiate a reasonable
compensation to the owner from such liability as may result from such
attachment;
         3.   That in the event of a collapse, the proposed WTF facility has
been engineered to fall in a radius of less than the provided setback;
         4.   Report on service gaps or service expansions that are addressed
by the proposed WTF (“the proposed service”), and accompanying maps and
calculations;
         5.   That the facility meets or exceeds applicable American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) standards as adopted by the FCC in order to protect
the public from unnecessary exposure to electromagnetic radiation;
         6.   A statement that the proposed facility is the least visually
obtrusive, as defined herein, and that the proposed facility conforms with
state of the art, as defined herein, or alternatively, that state of the art
technology is unsuitable for the proposed facility. Costs of state of the art
technology that exceed customary facility development costs shall not be
presumed to render the technology unsuitable; and
         7.   A listing and locations of any possible/future additional towers
that may be necessary to meet the users long-term overall goals.
   8.101.6   Third party review. When due to the complexity of the methodology
or analysis required to review an application for a wireless communication
facility, the Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to pay for a
technical review by a third party expert selected by the town, the costs of
which shall be in addition to other applicable fees. Based on the results of
the expert review, the approving authority may require changes to the
applicant’s application or submittals.
   8.101.7   Mitigation. The intent of WTF mitigation is to reduce the number
of WTFs (especially nonconforming facilities) and replace existing WTFs with
new facilities to improve network functionality and increase overall compliance
with this Article. To qualify as WTF mitigation, a proposal shall accomplish a
minimum of one of the following:
      A.   Reduce the number of overall WTFs;
      B.   Reduce the number of nonconforming WTF types; or
      C.   Replace an existing WTF with a new WTF resulting in compliance with
this Article.
   8.101.8   Approval authority.
      A.   The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for the approval of
stealth attached WTFs, and co-location on existing antenna supporting
structures, except those located within 300 feet of a designated State of North
Carolina Scenic Byway.
      B.   In addition to the requirements for special use permits, the
Planning Board, in determining whether a WTF is in harmony with the area, or
the effects and general compatibility of a WTF with adjacent properties may
consider the aesthetic effects of the WTF as well as mitigating factors
concerning aesthetics. The Planning Board may disapprove an application on the
grounds that the WTFs aesthetic effects are unacceptable, or may condition
approval on changes in WTF height, design, style, buffers, or other features of
the WTF or its surrounding area. Such changes need not result in performance
identical to that of the original application. Factors relevant to aesthetic
effects are: the protection of the view in sensitive or particularly scenic
areas and areas specially designated in adopted plans such as unique natural
features, scenic roadways and historic sites, the concentration of WTFs in the
proposed area, and whether the height, design, placement, or other
characteristics of the proposed WTF could be modified to have a less intrusive
visual impact.
   8.101.9   Construction and operation.
      A.   WTFs shall be constructed and maintained in conformance with all
applicable building code requirements.
      B.   WTFs may not interfere with normal radio and television reception in
the vicinity.
      C.   Lighting may not exceed the FAA minimum standard. Lights shall be
oriented so as not to project directly onto surrounding residential property,
consistent with FAA requirements.
      D.   The WTF equipment compound may not be used for the storage of any
excess equipment or hazardous materials, nor be used as habitable space. No
outdoor storage yards shall be allowed in a WTF equipment compound.
      E.   There shall be minimum eight-foot high fence installed and
maintained by the owner of the telecommunications tower around the perimeter of
the tower compound, except that security fencing shall not be required for
accessory communication facilities.
   8.101.10   Public service access. At the request of any local governing
authority, a license shall be granted to such local governing authority to
place public service communication antennas or other public service
communication devices on the telecommunications tower or antenna, provided that
such communication antennas or other public service communication devices do
not interfere with the function of the telecommunications tower or antenna, or
array of antennas of the operator or owner or other existing service providers
located on the tower or antenna.
   8.101.11   Interference with public safety communications.
      A.   In order to facilitate the town regulation, placement, and
construction of WTFs and their interaction with the town public safety and
emergency services communications equipment, all applicants requesting a permit
for a WTF under this section shall agree in a written statement, to the
following:
         1.   Compliance with good engineering practices as defined by the FCC
in its rules and regulations;
         2.   Compliance with FCC regulations regarding susceptibility to radio
frequency interference (RFI), frequency coordination requirements, general
technical standards for power, antenna, bandwidth limitations, frequency
stability, transmitter measurements, operating requirements, and any and all
other federal statutory and regulatory requirements relating to RFI; and
         3.   In the case of co-location of telecommunications facilities, the
applicant, together with the owner of the site, shall provide a composite
analysis of all users of the site to determine that the applicant proposed
facilities will not cause RFI with the town public safety and emergency
services communications equipment.
      B.   When a specific base station is identified as causing RFI with the
town public safety and emergency services communications equipment, the
following steps shall be taken.
         1.   Upon notification by the town of interference with public safety
and emergency services communications equipment, the owners of the WTF
equipment shall utilize the hierarchy and procedures set forth in the FCC
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Best Practices Guide. If the WTF owner fails
to cooperate with the town in applying the procedures set forth in the Best
Practices Guide in order to eliminate the interference, then the town and/or
county may take steps to contact the FCC to eliminate the interference.
         2.   If there is a determination of RFI with the town public safety
and emergency services communications equipment, the party which caused the
interference shall be responsible for reimbursing the town for all costs
associated with ascertaining and resolving the interference, including, but not
limited to, any engineering studies obtained by the town to determine the
source of the interference.
   8.101.12   Removal of telecommunications towers or antenna no longer in use.
Any telecommunications tower or antenna or accessory communication facility
which is unused for the original permitted use for a period of 180 consecutive
days shall be removed by the owner of such tower or antenna or accessory
communication facility, within 120 days of receipt of notification to that
effect. If the owner fails to so remove the tower or antenna or accessory
communication facility as required by this section, then the town shall remove
the tower or antenna or accessory communication facility, and the owner shall
reimburse the town for all expenses incurred thereby, including without
limitation all engineering, demolition, transportation, disposal, and legal
fees and costs.

   9.1.6   Required parking.
      A.   Minimum requirements.
         1.   Off-street parking spaces shall be provided for all uses listed
below in the amounts specified below. Uses not listed shall be reviewed by the
UDO Administrator, for a determination of the required spaces. Buildings with
multiple uses shall calculate parking based on the square footage of each use
in the building.
         2.   Where a building is constructed without a specific use
identified, such as a “flexible- use” building that may be occupied by multiple
uses, parking requirements shall be satisfied as follows.
            a.   Adequate space shall be reserved either on-site or through an
approved alternative parking plan (see Article 9.1.7) to accommodate the
requirements for the use with the highest parking requirements permitted in the
zoning district. This “reserve area” need not be paved, but shall be indicated
on all required plans and shall be counted toward the impervious cover
calculations for a development when located in an area where impervious parking
and loading is required.
            b.   The actual number of spaces required to be paved shall be one
space per 300 square feet of enclosed floor area. This requirement may be
modified by the Planning Board.
         3.   Calculation of spaces shall be in whole units only. If a
calculation results with a fraction, that fraction shall be rounded up to the
next whole number. Unless otherwise specified, enclosed floor area shall be
deemed to be gross enclosed floor area.

      B.   Maximum parking permitted.
         1.   No use, except single-family or two-family dwellings, shall
provide more than 110% of the required parking shown in the table above unless
any parking above the 110% threshold is pervious or is provided through use of
an elevated parking structure or pervious pavement.
         2.   Where a project is intended to be developed in phases, the
Planning Board may approve development of a parking area intended to serve
current and future development.
      C.   Modifications. The Planning Board may reduce the required number of
spaces by up to 20% for reasons of topography, mixes of uses, ride sharing
programs, availability of transit, or other conditions specific to the site,
provided the reduction in the required number of parking spaces satisfies the
intent of this Article.
      D.   Parking for the disabled. In accordance with the North Carolina
Accessibility Code, the following numerical requirements shall apply for
handicapped/disabled spaces.
Total Number of Spaces in Minimum Number of Accessible
Total Number of Spaces in Minimum Number of Accessible
1-25                      1

NOTE: Minimum number of accessible spaces is in addition to the total number
of required spaces.
 
   9.1.7   Alternative parking plans.
      A.   General. Innovative approaches which reduce the amount of impervious
cover within the town are encouraged when the public interest is served and
protected. The UDO Administrator or Planning Board, as specified, may reduce
the minimum amount of off-street parking required (beyond that permitted by
Article 9.1.6.C, Modifications) where developer-submitted parking data,
prepared and sealed by a registered engineer with transportation expertise,
illustrates that the standards of this Article do not accurately apply to the
specific development. The data submitted for an alternative parking plan shall
include, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the mix
of uses, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak
parking and traffic loads of all uses. The following factors may also be
considered.
      B.   Factors considered in alternative parking plans.
         1.   Public parking. Up to 35% of the required off-street parking
spaces may be waived by the Planning Board if publicly-controlled-parking is
located within a 500 foot walking distance along public walkways from the main
entrance of the proposed use and the UDO Administrator also determines that
adequate parking spaces are available within the publicly-controlled parking
area to accommodate the anticipated use.
         2.   Off-site and cooperative parking.
            a.   Generally. Cooperative provision of required parking space and
other innovative parking arrangements that protect and serve the public
interest are encouraged.
            b.   Separate lot. The UDO Administrator may approve the location
of up to 50% of required off-street parking spaces on a separate lot from that
on which the principal use is located if the off-site parking complies with all
of the following standards. This factor shall not be used to satisfy the off-
street parking requirements for convenience stores or similar convenience-
oriented uses or for handicapped accessible parking.
            c.   Location. No off-site parking space shall be located more than
2,000 feet from the primary entrance of the use served (measured along public
walkways). Off-site parking spaces shall not be separated from the use served
by a highway, unless a grade-separated pedestrian walkway is provided, or
traffic control or remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. Off-site
parking shall be located in a district where commercial parking is a permitted
principal use.
            d.   Agreement for off-site and cooperative parking. If an off-site
parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a
written agreement between the record owners shall be required. The owner of the
off-site parking area shall enter into a written agreement in a form acceptable
to the Town Attorney, (with enforcement running to the record owners of the
area and the town) providing that the land comprising the parking area shall
never be disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the building which
the parking area serves so long as the facilities are required; and that such
agreement shall bind heirs, successors, and assigns.
         3.   Valet parking. The Planning Board may approve valet parking as a
means of satisfying otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements where
all of the following standards have been met.
            a.   Adequate assurance of the continued operation of the valet
parking, such as a contractual agreement for valet services or the tenant’s
affidavit agreeing to provide such services, shall be provided;
            b.   An equivalent number of valet spaces shall be available to
replace the required parking spaces. Such valet spaces do not require
individual striping, and may take into account the tandem or mass parking of
vehicles.
   9.1.8   Vehicle stacking areas.
      A.   Vehicle stacking areas. The vehicle stacking standards of this
Article shall apply unless otherwise expressly approved by the Planning Board.
Additional stacking spaces may be required where trip generation rates suggest
that additional spaces will be needed.
      B.   Minimum number of spaces. Off-street stacking spaces shall be
provided as follows.
Activity Type Minimum Stacking Measured From
Activity Type               Minimum Stacking Measured From
Automated teller machine    3                Teller

                            Determined by UDO Administrator in consideration of
Other                       an approved study prepared by a registered engineer
                            with expertise in transportation engineering.
 
      C.   Design and layout of stacking spaces. Required stacking spaces shall
be subject to the following design and layout standards.
         1.   Size. Stacking spaces shall be a minimum of eight feet in width
by 25 feet in length.
         2.   Location. Stacking spaces shall not impede on or off-site traffic
movements or movements into or out of off-street parking spaces.
         3.   Design. Stacking spaces shall be separated from other internal
driveways by raised medians if deemed necessary by the UDO Administrator, for
traffic movement and safety.
         4.   Landscaping and screening requirements. In order to protect
adjacent properties from noise and visual impacts, vehicle stacking areas shall
be screened from adjacent residential property in accordance with the screening
requirements of Article 9.9 (Screening) and Article 10.
   9.1.9   Loading areas.
      A.   Location.
         1.   No loading spaces shall be located within 30 feet of street
intersections or in any required front, side, or rear yard or within a
triangular sight distance.
         2.   A minimum setback of 50 feet shall be required where loading
docks face a residential district or a structure with first-floor residential
uses.
         3.   Loading areas shall be located on the same lot and provide the
most convenient access to the use being served. Generally, loading areas should
be within 50 feet of the building.
      B.   Surfacing. Generally, all open off-street loading areas shall be
paved with an all-weather material such as concrete or asphalt, designed to
carry the heaviest vehicle loads that can commonly be expected. Consideration
should be given to the weight of fire and sanitation equipment as well as
delivery vehicles.
      C.   Design.
         1.   Loading berths for office uses shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide
by 35 feet long with a height clearance of 14 feet.
         2.   All other loading berths shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide and
55 feet long with a height clearance of 14 feet.
      D.   Utilization. Space allocated to any off-street loading space,
accessory drives, or aisles shall not be used to satisfy the space requirements
for any off-street parking or trash handling facilities.
      E.   Ingress and egress. Each required off-street loading space shall be
provided with a means of unobstructed ingress and egress to a private or a
public street wide enough to accommodate expected vehicles. Where such ingress
and egress is made into a public street, it shall be through driveways or
openings which meet required standards. Permanent wheel stops or curbing shall
be provided to prevent any vehicle using the loading area from encroachment on
the required front yards, side yards, or adjacent property.
      F.   Off-street loading requirements.
         1.   Loading spaces shall be required for uses which normally handle
large quantities of goods, including, but not limited to, industrial plants,
wholesale establishments, warehouses, freight terminals, hospitals, and retail
establishments.
         2.   Off-street loading spaces may be either inside or outside the
building and on the same or adjoining lots.
         3.   The loading spaces shall be of sufficient size and number to
allow normal loading and unloading operations appropriate to the property to be
served.
         4.   In no case shall the loading space hinder the movement of traffic
or pedestrians. The loading spaces shall be indicated on site plans submitted
for approval.
         5.   The Planning Board may require one or more additional loading
areas if the magnitude of the use would anticipate the need for more loading or
standing space.
         6.   Loading areas shall be signed to indicate “No Idling”.
         7.   Any loading area located adjacent to a residential district shall
not receive deliveries between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.

§ 9.2 COMMERCIAL ACCESS.
   9.2.1   General.
      A.   Every lot shall have direct access to a public or private street.
Access must provide a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency
vehicles as well as for all those likely to need or desire access to the
property in its intended use.
      B.   The minimum width of the access required is 36 feet wide to
accommodate as much as a 24-foot driveway.
      C.   Access and circulatory commercial development shall provide
connections to adjacent commercially zoned parcels, or if adjacent parcels are
underdeveloped, stub-cuts must be provided. Shared driveways from a street are
required between commercially zoned properties.
   9.2.2   Driveway permit required. A NCDOT driveway permit may be required
for driveways serving any new use or change from an existing use that accesses
a state-maintained road. Consult the UDO Administrator for more information.
   9.2.3   Driveway design.
      A.   In general, driveways shall be not less than 18 feet in width for
one-way traffic and 24 feet in width for two-way traffic.
      B.   However, 18-foot wide driveways shall be allowed for two-way traffic
when all of the following exist:
         1.   The driveway is not longer than 75 feet; and
         2.   The driveway provides access to six or fewer parking spaces.
      C.   Sufficient turning space shall be provided so that vehicles need not
back into public streets.
      D.   Eighteen foot wide driveways may also be permitted for two-way
traffic if the UDO Administrator determines that not more than ten trips per
day will be generated to and from the vehicular area being served by that
driveway; and such vehicular area is not used by the general public.
      E.   Designated parking spaces shall not be located within the area of
the driveways.
   9.2.4   Sight triangles.
      A.   Driveways. For any driveway, a sight triangle measuring ten feet
from the back of curb and extending 70 feet from the edge of each side of the
driveway shall be required.
   Design Standards. Within the sight triangle, no materials that would impede
traffic visibility shall be allowed. Structures, fences, and plant materials
that extend into the sight triangle above 22 feet, as measured from the grade
of the street or drive, shall not be allowed.
   9.2.5   Access to major thoroughfares restricted.
      A.   All uses located adjacent to a major thoroughfare identified on the
NCDOT Major Thoroughfare Plan for Brunswick County and/or the town shall
require a driveway permit from NCDOT prior to the issuance of a zoning permit
by the town.
      B.   When a subdivision involving platting of a new street (or streets)
borders on or contains an existing or proposed thoroughfare street, lots may
not have direct driveway access to the thoroughfare.
      C.   When a lot or development borders on or contains an existing or
proposed thoroughfare as delineated by a county or NCDOT Transportation Plan,
access to the thoroughfare may be limited by one of the following means.
         1.   A separation of 400 feet is required from the nearest centerline
of any other proposed or existing driveway access along the same side of the
thoroughfare. Reduced separation may be authorized only by review and
recommendation of the UDO Administrator and NCDOT.
         2.   Lots shall be subdivided so as to provide access onto a frontage
road. The centerline of the frontage or reverse frontage road where it
intersects the thoroughfare shall be no closer than 800 feet to the centerline
of the nearest proposed or existing driveway access or road.
         3.   Driveway access closure may be required for any change in use of
a lot based upon review and recommendation of the UDO Administrator and NCDOT.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 9.3 LARGE SCALE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS.
   9.3.1   General purpose and intent.
      A.   The purpose of this Article is to supplement development standards
elsewhere in these zoning regulations with specific criteria that apply to the
design of commercial buildings and projects which are 200,000 gross square feet
or greater in area.
      B.   The town’s goal is to create and maintain a positive ambiance and
community image and identity by providing for architectural and site design
treatments that will enhance the visual appearance of the applicable commercial
development and the quality of life.
      C.   The applicable commercial development depends on high visibility
from public streets. In turn, design of certain commercial buildings and sites
determines much of the image and attractiveness of the streetscapes and
character of the community. Massive, duplicative, or generic projects that do
not contribute to, or integrate with, the community in a positive manner can be
detrimental to a community’s image and sense of place.
      D.   This Article incorporates a basic level of architectural design
which, in conjunction with site design, landscaping, lighting, and sign
treatments located elsewhere in this ordinance, is intended to result in a
comprehensive scheme for building design and site development. However, this
Article is not intended to require any specific style of architecture.
      E.   This Article is also intended to:
         1.   Promote high standards in architectural design and the
construction of creative, innovative, aesthetically pleasing structures;
         2.   Encourage landowners, designers, and developers to look closely
at local conditions and the development site, and produce new development that
enhances and complements both the built and natural environment; and
         3.   Ensure that development and building design is sensitive to the
specific site, consistent with the existing and proposed character of the area,
including residential and nonresidential uses in the surrounding area, and does
not detract from the positive elements of the community and existing
neighborhood characteristics.
   9.3.2   Standards. The standards found in this Article shall be in addition
to all other applicable standards found in this ordinance.
      A.   Building materials. Predominant exterior building materials shall be
high quality material. These include, without limitation: brick, natural decay-
resistant quality exterior wood siding, rock, stone or tinted and textured
concrete masonry units, and transparent glass windows and doors. Facade colors
shall be neutral or earth tone colors. Building trim and accent areas may
feature brighter colors, including primary colors, but these colors may not
comprise more than 15% of any building facade.
      B.   Requirements for building mass and articulation. The design shall
help integrate the development with its surroundings by breaking down the
apparent mass and scale of the building on all sides.
         1.   The first floor should be taller than upper floors. Lower floors
should be differentiated architecturally to create a sense of human scale.
         2.   Buildings shall avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or
roof planes on their visible facades. Building wall offsets, including
projections, recesses, and changes in floor level, shall be used in order to
add architectural interest and variety; relieve the visual effect of a single,
long wall; and subdivide the wall into human scale proportions. No more than
60,000 gross square feet of the structure shall be designed as a distinct mass.
         3.   All facades visible from a public roadway shall be given equal
design significance. There shall be no blank, featureless walls, including rear
walls. The design shall present a continuity of style on all facades visible
from the public roadway, except where separated by a party wall located on a
lot line. The primary facade shall be designed to comply with the requirements
of Article 9.4 (Building Facade Design).
         4.   Similarly, roofline offsets shall be provided to lend
architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve
the effect of a single, long roof.
         5.   Outparcels shall be designed and integrated with the main
project.
         6.   Internal and new streets shall be constructed in accordance with
the regulations set forth in Article 9.2 (Commercial Access).
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 9.4 BUILDING FACADE DESIGN.
   9.4.1   Applicability. The following shall comply with the requirements of
this Article:
      A.   Where compliance with these standards is explicitly required in
other portions of this ordinance;
      B.   All uses except for one- or two-family residences; and
      C.   Expansion or modification of an existing commercial or office use
that increases the total enclosed floor area by at least 50% or 5,000 square
feet, whichever is greater.
   9.4.2   Standards.
      A.   The primary facade shall be constructed of one or a combination of
the following materials: concrete, aggregate, stucco, brick, stone, glass,
natural decay-resistant quality exterior wood siding, or faced concrete block.
Artificial materials that closely resemble these materials shall also be
allowed. Facade colors shall be neutral or earth tone colors. Building trim and
accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors, but these
colors may not comprise more than 15% of the building facade.
      B.   The remaining sides of the building shall be treated with the same
materials of construction of the primary facade. As an alternative, for the
principal use building(s), powder coated painted metal panels may be used on
the non-primary facade walls under the following conditions. (The goal is to
use architectural detail to provide visual interest).
         1.   Metal panels can only be used on buildings in the CI District.
         2.   Metal panels can be used for roofing material.
         3.   The (wall) metal panels will have deep, embolden ribs (or
equivalent) to bring definition to the wall (e.g., MBCI ShadowRib™) with colors
complementing or matching the primary facade. Other approaches to achieve the
desired appearance will be considered at the pre-application conference.
         4.   Long continuous building walls are prohibited. No single metal
wall shall extend unbroken more than 15% of the total wall length or 15 feet
(whichever is greater) in a horizontal plane. Primary facade material should be
used to trim out and/or break up the metal walls in both the horizontal and
vertical planes.
      C.   No building facade facing the public street right-of-way shall be
devoid of architectural enhancements or interest. For street corner buildings,
both street elevations shall be architecturally enhanced as a front facade.
      D.   Long continuous building walls are prohibited and no single facade
extending unbroken more than 35 feet in a horizontal plane may be visible from
a public roadway. Compliance may be obtained through one of the following:
         1.   The use of projections or recesses (articulation). When used,
each projection or recess shall have a projection (depth) dimension of no less
than 18 inches and a width of no less than 36 inches; or
         2.   The use of columns or other architectural detail to provide
visual interest. Where used, columns should be harmonious with the general
design of the structure.
      E.   At least 25% of the first floor of the street facade shall be
transparent.
      F.   Roofs shall be simple forms such as hip, flat, shed, mansard, gable
to front, or gable to side, and shall avoid excessive articulation. Recommended
roofing materials include slate shingles, asphalt and fiberglass shingles, and
metal standing seam or tiles.
      G.   As an alternative, powder coated painted metal panels may be used on
all the walls of an accessory structure in the CLD or CI District under the
following conditions. (The goal is to use architectural detail to provide
visual interest and/or landscaping buffers to screen the structure).
         1.   The accessory structure shall be no closer than 200 feet from the
primary structure.
         2.   The accessory structure shall be no closer than 35 feet from the
nearest lot line for buildings under 12 feet in height; for every foot higher
than this, the required distance to the lot line shall be increased by four
feet.
         3.   Colors shall be neutral or earth tone complementing the primary
structure.
         4.   Where possible, architectural enhancements shall be used to break
up long continuous walls.
         5.   With architectural enhancements, a screening of 0.4 opacity shall
be required on all sides; without enhancements, a screening of 0.8 opacity
shall be required.
         6.   All access points (e.g., driveways) shall not eliminate the need
for continuous landscaping on the access point side.
         7.   Metal panels can be used for roofing material.

building that is not a “face”.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 9.13 CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT.
   9.13.1   Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to provide developers
with greater flexibility in the design and creation of residential subdivisions
while preserving significant amounts of open space and environmentally
sensitive areas. This is achieved by allowing the clustering of residential
lots with reduced area, frontage, and setback standards in relation to the
underlying district, on areas of the proposed site which are best suited for
development and leaving the remaining land as permanently protected open space.
   9.13.2   Minimum area for a cluster subdivision. The minimum area for a
cluster subdivision is 25 acres.
   9.13.3   Minimum open space dedication. The minimum amount of open space
that must be dedicated and permanently protected within a cluster subdivision
is 20% of the gross acreage of the proposed subdivision. In exchange for
dedication of the additional land for open space preservation, further
reductions in lot frontage and setback standards shall be granted in accordance
with 9.13.6 below.
   9.13.4   Maximum number of lots.
      A.   The maximum number of lots that may be created in a cluster
development shall be computed from the gross area of land to be developed minus
20% that represents the approximate area needed for roadways, drainage, and
other improvements.
      B.   Divide the remainder by the minimum lot area requirement for single-
family dwellings of the zoning district where the development is located.
      C.   The result is the maximum number of lots that may be created in the
development. Where fractions of lots remain, the result will be rounded down to
the nearest whole number of lots. The 20% factor shall be constant regardless
of the actual amount of land used for the street system.
   EXAMPLE: The maximum number of lots allowed in a proposed cluster
subdivision consisting of 100 gross acres of land which is Zoned R-15 would be
calculated as follows:
            100 acres: 20% = 80 acres
            80 acres x 43,560 sq. ft. = 3,484,800 sq. ft.
            3,484,800 sq. ft.
             15,000 sq. ft. = 232 lots
   9.13.5   Minimum lot area. The minimum residential lot area requirements of
the underlying zoning district may be reduced by up to 25% within a cluster
subdivision. In no case shall any residential lot within a cluster subdivision
be smaller than the standards shown below:
            R-10: 7,500 sq. ft.
            R-15: 11,250 sq. ft.
            R-20: 15,000 sq .ft.
   9.13.6   Minimum lot frontage and building setbacks. The minimum lot
frontage and building setback requirements of the underlying zoning district
may be reduced by up to 25% within a cluster subdivision. In exchange for the
dedication of additional land for open space preservation, the lot width and
building setback requirements may be reduced by an additional 1% for each
additional 1% of the gross acreage of the project that is dedicated for open
space preservation. In no case shall the lot width or building setback
requirements be reduced below 50% of the requirements of the underlying zoning
district.
EXAMPLE #1: If the minimum open space dedication of 20% were proposed by the
developer of a 100 acre cluster subdivision within an ‘R-15’ Zoning District,
then the minimum lot frontage and building setback standards within the
subdivision would be reduced by 25% as shown below:
            Lot frontage: 67.5 feet
            Front setback: 30 feet
            Side setback: 7.5 feet
            Rear setback: 26.25 feet
EXAMPLE #2: If the same developer were to propose the dedication of 35% of the
gross acreage of the subdivision to open space preservation then the minimum
lot frontage and setback standards would be reduced by 40% as shown below:
            Lot frontage: 54 feet
            Front setback: 24 feet
            Side setback: 6 feet
            Rear setback: 21 feet
   9.13.7   Peripheral lot standards. Lots located on the periphery of a
cluster subdivision which is adjacent to property that is zoned or used for
residential purposes shall conform to the minimum standards of the underlying
zoning district as set forth in Article 7 of this ordinance. For the purpose of
this Article, peripheral lots shall be defined as any lot that contains a point
which lies within 30 feet of the boundary of the subdivision.
   9.13.8   Open space standards.
      A.   All open space dedicated to satisfy the requirements of this section
shall be deeded to the town or another government entity, a homeowner’s
association, or a nonprofit land trust or conservation organization. In
consideration of the purposes served by a cluster subdivision, the title to
such areas as provided shall be preserved to the perpetual benefit of the
public generally or the private properties in the development and shall be
restricted against private ownership for any other purposes.
      B.   To the greatest extent possible, the parcels containing open space
dedicated to satisfy the requirements of this Article shall be contiguous and
compact. The Planning Board shall approve the design of all required open space
areas prior to approving the preliminary plat for a cluster subdivision.
      C.   Improvements upon land dedicated as open space shall be limited to
those which contribute to the passive enjoyment of the open space. Examples of
allowed passive improvements include multi-use paths, hiking trails,
boardwalks, picnic shelters, viewing platforms, kayak or canoe launching areas,
and similar improvements. If provided within the dedicated open space, motor
vehicle parking shall utilize pervious pavement technology over 100% of the
parking area. Under no circumstances shall improvements cover more than 10% of
the dedicated open space.
   9.13.9   Access to open space. All lots created within the development shall
have direct access to all parks or open space as provided by means of public
streets, dedicated walkways, other public lands, or lands in common ownership
by all residents.
   9.13.10   Phase developments. A cluster subdivision may be developed in
phases provided that:
      A.   The entire project receives approval before any phase of development
begins;
      B.   All required open space for the entire project be recorded and/or
provided for in the homeowner’s association with the development of the first
phase. However, cluster developments which do not involve a required
homeowner’s association and which contain open space deeded to the town may be
recorded, provided that the open space is deeded to and accepted by the town
prior to development of the first phase; and
      C.   If a corporation or association is established for the open space,
it will provide for total project membership.

ARTICLE 10
LANDSCAPING, BUFFERING, SCREENING, AND TREE PROTECTION
§ 10.1 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these provisions is to establish minimum requirements for the
provision and maintenance of functionally adequate, attractive screening and
buffering of structures, parking areas, driveways, and other facilities and
land uses, while providing standards for the protection of existing and new
trees and vegetation and their root zones. These requirements are intended to
carry out the following objectives:
   10.1.1   To promote and increase design compatibility between different land
uses, while ensuring attractive views from streets and adjacent properties;
   10.1.2   To assist in delineating separations of spaces, structures, uses,
and activities on a site, or between adjacent sites;
   10.1.3   To shield adjacent properties from potentially adverse external
impacts of development, and development from potential negative impacts of
adjacent land uses and activities;
   10.1.4   To enhance the streetscape by separating the pedestrian from motor
vehicles; abating glare and moderating temperatures of impervious areas;
filtering air of fumes and dust; providing shade; attenuating noise; and
reducing the visual impact of large expanses of pavement;
   10.1.5   To promote the preservation of open space; existing tree canopy and
vegetation; and natural diversity, using supplemental plantings when necessary
to meet the performance criteria of this Article;
   10.1.6   To mitigate adverse grade changes between adjacent properties;
   10.1.7   To improve the quality of the built and natural environments
through air quality enhancements; energy conservation; reductions in the amount
and rate of stormwater runoff and erosion; stormwater runoff quality
improvements; and increase in the capacity for groundwater recharge;
   10.1.8   To enhance the appearance and value of both residential and
nonresidential properties; and
   10.1.9   To create a process whereby some properties are required to obtain
a tree clearing certificate, recognize some properties are exempted from the
requirement to obtain a tree clearing certificate prior to the removal of
vegetation, and establish penalties for removal of all or substantially all of
the required vegetation within required vegetation protected areas.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)

property to be expanded.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.3 TREE PRESERVATION AND TREE CLEARING REQUIREMENTS.
   10.3.1   Tree clearing certificate. The tree clearing certificate
requirement has been developed to implement the enabling legislation granted to
the town by the North Carolina General Assembly. The requirements for obtaining
a tree clearing certificate and penalties for noncompliance are applicable to
all undeveloped properties which are zoned for residential or nonresidential
use located within the town limits. For the purposes of this Article,
UNDEVELOPED PROPERTIES shall include any property within the town’s
jurisdiction which is not subject to an approved development plan.
   10.3.2   Exemptions from tree clearing certificates. The requirement to
obtain a tree clearing certificate shall not apply to the activities listed
below.
      A.   Normal forestry activities taking place on property which is taxed
under the present-use value standard or conducted pursuant to a forestry
management plan prepared or approved by a forester registered pursuant to G.S.
Chapter 89B, and provided such activities are accomplished in compliance with
this Article.
      B.   Properties with a town or county-approved development plan, provided
such plan has not expired and that any clearing or vegetation removal is done
in strict accordance with the approved development plan.
      C.   The removal of vegetation by public or private agencies within the
lines of any public street rights-of-way, utility easements, or other town
property, as may be necessary to ensure public safety, to obtain clear
visibility at driveways or intersections, to perform authorized field survey
work, or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such town property.
      D.   The town-initiated or approved removal of any vegetation which is in
an unsafe condition, constitutes a nuisance or noxious weed, or which by its
nature is injurious to sanitary sewers, electrical power lines, gas lines,
water lines, stream or conveyance channels, or other public improvements, or
vegetation which is infected with any injurious fungus, insect, or other pest.
      E.   The removal of vegetation on property located within an approved
residential subdivision which is zoned for single-family use, and provided such
vegetation is not a portion of a required streetscape or other landscaping
buffer.
   10.3.3   Required buffers and vegetation protection areas. Other than that
necessary to gain reasonable access to the property, clearing and/or removal of
trees and other vegetation shall be prohibited in the areas listed below. In
situations where one or more buffer zones or vegetation protection areas
overlap on the same site, then the more restrictive requirement shall apply:
      A.   Within required project boundary buffer yards;
      B.   Within required street yard buffers; and
      C.   Any other areas necessary for the protection of existing vegetation
as indicated within this ordinance (e.g., riparian buffers).
   10.3.4   Protection of monumental trees and stands. To the greatest extent
practicable, monumental trees and monumental tree stands should be protected
and preserved during and after development. Measures such as the relocation or
reconfiguration of buildings, parking areas, streets, and other features will
be required by the UDO Administrator if deemed necessary to fulfill the intent
of this ordinance. Monumental trees are considered a subset of protected trees
and all regulations for protected trees shall apply to monumental trees.
   10.3.5   Application requirements.
      A.   An application for a tree clearing certificate is not required for
those activities which can demonstrate an exemption in accordance with the
provisions of Article 10.3.2 above.
      B.   An application for a tree clearing certificate may be filed only by
all the owners of the property or by such owners’ authorized agent.
      C.   An application for a tree clearing certificate shall be filed with
the town on a form provided by the town, along with the fee prescribed by the
Town Council.
      D.   The application form shall be accompanied by a vegetation protection
plan which shall include, at a minimum, the following information on a sheet
size no larger than 24 by 36 inches at a minimum scale of one inch equals 50
feet:
         1.   Vicinity map showing the location of the tract at a readable
scale;
         2.   A map of the entire tract, including the property boundary of the

         5.   The owner, current zoning, and present use of all contiguous
properties (including property on opposite side of adjoining streets);
         6.   The general classification of all existing and proposed adjacent
roadways and the ultimate right-of-way boundaries associated with these
roadways;
         7.   The location and width of all future/existing buffers and
associated vegetation protection areas, including riparian buffers, perimeter
buffers, and perimeter streetscapes;
         8.   The proposed limits of timbering activities, including the
location and extent of all tree protection fencing as required under Article
10.4; and
         9.   The location of all required protected trees (see Appendix II),
as well as all other existing trees to be retained through the development
process.
      E.   The UDO Administrator may reduce or waive the requirements for a
vegetation protection plan in situations where it can be demonstrated that all
vegetation removal will take place outside of required vegetation protection
areas.
   10.3.6   Procedure. Prior to the commencement of any vegetation clearing or
removal on any undeveloped property, the owner or the owner’s agent must
demonstrate exemption from the requirements of this Article, or submit the
required application materials and applicable fees for a tree clearing
certificate.
      A.   Upon receipt of documentation that a property is exempted from
obtaining a tree clearing certificate, the UDO Administrator shall review all
materials and make a determination if a property is exempted from the
requirements, or if the requirements apply. In situations where exemption
status is claimed based on forestry use, this documentation shall include proof
that the property is taxed under the present-use value standard or a copy of
the valid forestry management plan prepared or approved by a North Carolina
registered forester. The decision of the UDO Administrator may be appealed to
the Zoning Board of Adjustment pursuant to the provisions of Article 6.8 of
this ordinance.
      B.   If a property is not exempted from the provisions pertaining to a
tree clearing certificate, then such application materials shall include a
vegetation protection plan consistent with the requirements listed in Article
10.3.5.D above.
      C.   The vegetation protection plan shall be reviewed by the UDO
Administrator based upon the provisions of this Article. The Administrator may
defer the decision on the vegetation protection plan to the Planning Board if
he or she has concerns about the plan’s ability to meet the standards of this
ordinance. In the event the Administrator disapproves the plan, an appeal may
be filed with the Board of Adjustment within ten days of disapproval. If an
appeal is filed, the Board of Adjustment shall decide whether to consider the
appeal by majority vote and may affirm, reverse, or modify the Administrator’s
disapproval.
      D.   An applicant for a tree clearing certificate shall be notified upon
approval of the vegetation protection plan, and shall be free to erect or
install any and all barriers necessary to protect existing vegetation within
required buffer areas and vegetation protection areas from damage during tree
clearing and/or removal activities. Failure to protect these areas shall result
in penalties as indicated in Article 6.
      E.   Once all barriers for the protection of existing vegetation have
been installed, a property owner or agent shall request inspection of such
barriers for compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
      F.   Upon a passing inspection of vegetation protection barriers, the UDO
Administrator shall issue a tree clearing certificate, and authorized
vegetation clearing and/or removal may commence.
      G.   An approved tree clearing certificate shall be valid for a period of
not more than 12 months from the date of issuance.
   10.3.7   Non-compliance. Failure to comply with the provisions of this
Article shall constitute a violation of this ordinance, and shall subject an
offending party to a series of actions, including the payment of fines, delay
in development plan approval or building permit issuance, and the requirement
to double the amount of required vegetation as would typically be required
during the development plan review and approval process. The table below
describes the penalties for non-compliance with this Article. An “X” in a
particular cell indicates the associated penalty which applies.

§ 10.4 PRESERVATION OF PROTECTED TREES DURING CONSTRUCTION.
   Protective barricades shall be placed around all protected trees designated
to be saved, prior to the start of development activities or grading. These
barricades shall consist of two inches by four inches posts with one inch by
four inch rails or orange safety fence. Protective barricades shall remain in
place until development activities are complete. The area within the protective
barricade shall remain free of all building materials, stockpiled soil, or
other construction debris. Construction traffic, storage of vehicles and
materials, and grading shall not take place within the protective areas of the
existing trees. Barricades shall be erected at a recommended minimum distance
from the base of protected trees according to the following standards.
   10.4.1   For trees ten inches or less diameter at breast height (DBH),
protective barricades shall be placed a minimum distance of ten feet from the
base of each protected tree, or outside the dripline, whichever is greater.
   10.4.2   For trees greater than ten inches DBH, protective barricades shall
be placed at a minimum distance equal to ten feet from the base of a protected
tree plus an additional one foot for each additional one inch DBH greater than
ten inches DBH, or outside the dripline, whichever is greater.
   Construction access to a site should occur where an existing or proposed
entrance/exit is located. Except for driveway access points, sidewalks, curbs,
and gutters, land disturbance within a tree dripline is strongly discouraged.
Where grading within a tree dripline cannot be avoided, cut and fill shall be
limited to one-fourth to one-third of the area within the dripline, tree roots
must be pruned with clean cuts at the edge of the disturbed area, and no fill
shall be placed within the dripline of a tree without venting to allow air and
water to reach the roots. Trees and undergrowth in designated open space in an
approved plan shall remain undisturbed, except for permitted pathways.

§ 10.5 LANDSCAPING PLANS REQUIRED.
   10.5.1   In order to implement the requirements of this Article, landscaping
plans are required as part of each site plan required under Article 4 of this
ordinance, in addition, subdivision or site plans which include/require
buffers, street buffers, or other landscape areas shall be required to provide
a landscape plan. Plans shall be developed by individuals or professional firms
having the competence and knowledge to satisfactorily develop plans required by
this Article.
   10.5.2    Landscaping plans shall be designed to improve efficiency of
irrigated areas (if applicable) through minimizing slopes, preserving topsoil,
and retaining stormwater drainage on-site.
   10.5.3   Landscaping plans shall meet the standards of this Article, and
shall be consistent with the standards outlined for project boundary buffers,
street buffers, interior landscaping requirements, and vehicle use area
landscaping requirements.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.6 DESIGN OF LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERS.
   10.6.1   Design, installation, and establishment standards. Location of
plants and design of landscaping, including maintenance, shall be according to
sound landscape and horticultural principles. The use of native vegetation and
other lower maintenance landscape materials is desired to promote environmental
protection, energy efficiency, and water conservation.
      A.   Landscape plans submitted for approval for the purposes of
satisfying the requirements of this Article shall clearly indicate the name,
location, and size of vegetation to be installed as well as trees to be
preserved.
      B.   Plant material should be chosen from the lists of recommended tree
species contained within Appendix II, and shall adhere to the minimum
specifications therein. Plant materials shall be reviewed for suitability with
regard to the eventual size and spread, susceptibility to diseases and pests,
and appropriateness to existing soil, climate, and site conditions.
   10.6.2   Issuance of certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy
shall not be issued until all seeding, trees, and plant material have been
placed in accordance with the approved site plan and requirements of this
Article. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a period of 120
days under circumstances that would affect the seeding and planting of the
site, or until the proper planting season is reached to complete the
landscaping requirements, and may be extended up to 90 days upon request to the
UDO Administrator.
   10.6.3   Cold hardy and drought tolerant plants. Required trees and shrubs
shall be cold hardy for the specific location where they are to be planted.
Trees and shrubs shall be drought tolerant and able to survive on natural
rainfall once established with no loss of health.
   10.6.4   Plant material and minimum plant size. Appendix II provides a list
which shall be used as a guide in identifying and categorizing the different
acceptable types and minimum sizes for any required plant. Although the lists
may be expanded, they are intended to provide guidance in selecting
predominately hardy natural species. All materials shall be of high-quality
nursery grade. In addition to the plant types listed in Appendix II, vegetation
and/or trees may be relocated from other sites to the proposed project site.
   10.6.5   Minimum planting areas.
      A.   Canopy trees shall have a planting area no less than ten feet wide
in all dimensions.
      B.   Understory trees shall have a planting area no less than eight feet
wide in all dimensions.
      C.   When planted as a hedge, the maximum spacing for 20-inch high shrubs
shall be 40 inches on center.
      D.   These requirements may be modified administratively by the UDO
Administrator.
   10.6.6   Mulch. Plants shall be mulched to provide ground cover and prevent
water loss due to evaporation, in order to ensure compliance with this
standard, a tree planting detail shall be provided on all landscaping plans.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.7 REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTAINING PLANTED AREAS.
   10.7.1   Responsibility. The responsibility for maintenance of a required
buffer or other landscaping shall remain with the owner of the property, his or
her successors, heirs, assignees, or any consenting grantee. Maintenance is
required in order to ensure the proper functioning of the plantings as a
landscaped area which reduces or eliminates nuisance and/or conflict.
   10.7.2   Maintenance.
      A.   All plantings shall be maintained in an attractive and healthy
condition. Maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, watering,
mulching, fertilizing and pest management, mowing, weeding, removal of litter
and dead plant material, and necessary pruning and trimming.
      B.   Necessary pruning and trimming shall be in accordance with the Tree
Care Industry Association (TCIA) Standards for the Professional Arborist, and
shall not be interpreted to include topping of trees through removal of crown
material or the central leader, or any other similarly severe procedures that
may cause irreparable harm to the natural form of the tree, except where such
procedures are necessary to maintain public overhead utilities. Any such
activity shall be a violation of these zoning regulations.
      C.   Dead or diseased plantings shall be removed. Unless specifically
exempted (such as understory trees shaded by canopy trees), replacement
plantings shall be provided for any required plants which die or are removed
for any reason and shall meet all minimum standards and conform to these
regulations.
      D.   Natural water courses within a buffer shall be maintained in a
natural condition consistent with any applicable regulations.
      E.   A water source shall be supplied within 100 feet of any planting
requiring continuing watering. Where non-native or non-drought tolerant native
vegetation is incorporated in the buffer, an irrigation system shall be
required.
      F.   Landscape structural features such as walls, fences, berms, or water
features shall be maintained in a structurally safe and attractive condition.
      G.   Where other uses, including pedestrian, bike, or other trails, are
allowed within a buffer, these uses shall be maintained to provide for their
safe use.
   70.7.3   Failure to maintain. In the event that any owner of a buffer area
or vehicular use landscaping area fails to maintain same according to the
standards of these regulations, these regulations shall be enforceable by the
town with the right to recover the cost of enforcement, including reasonable
attorney fees. The town may also, following reasonable notice and a demand that
deficiency of maintenance be corrected, enter the buffer area to maintain same.
The cost of such maintenance shall be charged to those persons having the
primary responsibility for maintenance of the buffer area.
   70.7.4   Hardship relief. Landscape requirements may be modified by the UDO
Administrator upon a finding that a modification would be consistent with the
purpose and intent of this Article, with any adopted land use plans, and that
such modification would not adversely affect the land use compatibility or
public interest.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.8 PROJECT BOUNDARY BUFFER YARD AND LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   10.8.1   Definition and purpose of buffer yards.
      A.   A BUFFER is a specified land area, located parallel to and within
the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel and extending to the lot or parcel
boundary line, together with the planting and landscaping required on the land.
A BUFFER may also contain, or be required to contain, a barrier such as a berm,
fence, or wall, or combination thereof, where such additional screening is
necessary to achieve the desired level of buffering between various land use
activities. A BUFFER is not the same as the term “yard”.
         1.   Both the amount of land and the type and amount of planting
specified for each buffer yard required by this Article are designed to
ameliorate nuisances between adjacent land uses, or between a land use and a
public road.
         2.   The planting units required of buffer yards have been calculated
to ensure that they do, in fact, function to “buffer”.
      B.   Buffer yards shall be required to separate different land uses from
each other, in order to:
         1.   Eliminate or minimize potential nuisances, such as dirt, litter,
noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or parking areas; or
         2.   Provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or
danger from fires or explosions.
   10.8.2   Location of buffer yards.
      A.   Buffer yards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or
parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary line.
      B.   Buffer yards shall not be located on any portion of an existing
public or private street or right-of-way.
   10.8.3   Types of required buffers. There are two types of required buffers
that may occur on any given development site, as follows.
      A.   Street buffers. Generally, a street buffer is located along the
street(s) that border a development. The buffer requires a modest amount of
landscaping, enhancing the “public” environment.
      B.   Project boundary buffers. Generally, a project boundary buffer is
located around the sides and rear of a development. This buffer ensures an
appropriate transition between uses. A buffer located around the perimeter of a
nonresidential use is intended to protect adjoining land uses from noise, heat,
dust, lights, and aesthetic impacts from more intense land uses.
   10.8.4   Permitted use of buffer area.
      A.   A buffer may be used for passive recreation and picnic facilities;
and it may contain pedestrian, bike, or equestrian trials, provided that:
         1.   Minimal existing plant material is eliminated;
         2.   The total depth of the buffer is maintained; and
         3.   All other requirements of these regulations are met.
      B.   Other appurtenances which require high visibility and easy access,
such as fire hydrants, public and emergency telephones, and mail boxes. No
screening of such appurtenances is permitted.
      C.   A required buffer is encouraged to retain areas of native habitat
and may incorporate water resources, including stormwater detention/retention
facilities designed as a natural-appearing amenity. However, a minimum ten-foot
contiguous width of the buffer shall be preserved as a planting area without
stormwater facilities.
      D.   Ingress and egress to the proposed use, and utility lines and
appurtenances, may cross the buffer provided they minimize the amount of buffer
taken.
      E.   The buffer area may be included as part of the calculation of any
required open space.
      F.   Identification signs may be located within a buffer as specifically
permitted in the sign ordinance. The landscape buffer shall be designed to
address visibility of permitted ground signs.
      G.   Lighting may be located within a buffer as specifically required in
Article 9.5, Outdoor Lighting.
      H.   Other activities and development required by this ordinance or
expressly authorized by the UDO Administrator.
   10.8.5   Prohibited use of buffer area.
      A.   Buffer area shall not be used for any building or use, accessory
building or use, parking or loading area, storage area, or other principal or
accessory uses except as specifically permitted in this ordinance.
   10.8.6   Planting in easements.
      A.   Where required plantings are located in easements, the utility
provider shall be responsible for replacement of such required vegetation if
maintenance or other utility requirements require their removal.
      B.   No trees shall be planted in wet retention ponds, drainage
maintenance easement, or any utility maintenance easements.
      C.   Shrubs may be planted within easements, provided they are only
within the outer three feet of the easement. No new trees may be planted in an
easement.
      D.   Existing trees may remain in dry retention ponds provided that the
natural grade is undisturbed to the tree line, they are a species adapted to
seasonal flooding and the pond is adequately maintained.
   10.8.7   Determination of buffer requirements. To determine the type of
buffer required between two adjoining lots or parcels, or between a lot or
parcel and a street, the following procedure shall be followed:
      A.   Street buffers. Determine the appropriate street buffer based on
Article 10.8.8.
      B.   Project boundary buffers. Identify the zoning districts/use of the
subject parcel and all adjoining properties. Determine the buffer opacity class
required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel. Refer to
the minimum project boundary buffer table in Article 10.8.9.
   10.8.8   Street buffers. Street buffers shall be required and existing
vegetation should be used to satisfy these planting requirements where possible
(see Article 10.8.3). Berms constructed in accordance with Article 10.8.10.C,
Berm with Vegetation, are encouraged as a component of any street buffer and
the UDO Administrator may allow up to 50% reduction in the required buffer
depth with a berm.
      A.   Measurements.
         1.   Street buffers shall be measured along a perpendicular line from
the future right-of-way line determined during site and development plan
review. Buffer depth averaging may be used in conformance with paragraph (5),
below.
         2.   Required driveways may penetrate required street buffers.
         3.   Driveway widths (measured at the inside edge of the buffer) shall
not be counted in the calculation of the plant material required.
         4.   Vehicular access easements shall not be treated as a street, but
shall be buffered as a project boundary buffer outside the easement area. The
buffer may be provided on either side of the easement.
         5.   While the buffer depth is normally calculated as parallel to the
property line, design variations are allowed and are calculated on the average
depth of the buffer per 100 feet of linear width measured along the property
line. Minimum depth of buffer in any case shall not be less than 50% the
required depth of the buffer chosen. Maximum depth shall not be more than 150%
the required depth of the buffer chosen.
      B.   Collector or thoroughfare street buffers. All development located
along either a collector or thoroughfare street shall be required to provide
one of the following buffers along the entire street frontage:
         1.   Two canopy trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage,
located within a 20-foot landscape buffer;
         2.   One canopy tree and two understory trees per 100 linear feet of
property frontage, located within a 20-foot landscape buffer;
         3.   Under utility lines only, three understory trees per 100 linear
feet of property frontage, located within a ten-foot landscape buffer. No trees
under utility lines shall have a natural height over 25 feet; or
         4.   In all the above options, there shall also be 15 shrubs per 100
linear feet.
   10.8.9   Project boundary buffers.
      A.   Required project boundary buffer table.
         1.   Description.
            a.   The buffer standards in the table below address the opacity of
the buffer that is required on the property boundary between zoning districts,
and in some instances within a zoning district.
            b.   An opacity of 0.2 screens 20% of an object, and an opacity of
0.6 would screen 60% of the adjoining development during summer months after
five years of growth.
         2.   Measurement. Project boundary buffers shall be measured along a
perpendicular line from the lot line.
         3.   How to read the buffer table.
            a.   The required opacity of project boundary buffers is
represented in the table below by two numbers (for example, .2/.6).
            b.   The second number represents the total required buffer opacity
between any two properties.
            c.   Where the proposed project adjoins vacant property, the first
number represents the applicant’s required buffer opacity.
            d.   Where the adjoining property is already developed with no
buffer, the proposed project is responsible for providing the total required
opacity (the second number).
            e.   Where the adjoining property is already developed with a
partial buffer, the proposed project is responsible for providing the remaining
opacity required.
            f.   A zero means no project boundary buffer is required.

NOTE: Wireless telecommunication towers shall require a buffer yard with an
opacity of 0.8 regardless of their location (refer to Article 8.101).
 
   Example. A .2/.4 requires a 20% opaque buffer for property adjacent to
vacant land or a 40% opaque buffer when adjacent to existing development. A
.4/.4 requires a 40% opaque buffer for property adjacent to either vacant or
developed land. A zero means no project boundary buffer is required.
      B.   Buffer alternatives. The table below shows the required buffer depth
(average) and plantings required for a project boundary buffer to satisfy the
required opacity. Existing vegetation should be used to satisfy these planting
requirements where possible (see Article 10.9.2, Existing Vegetation).

   10.8.10   Walls, berms, and fences in buffers. Where walls, berms, or fences
are built within any required buffer, they shall meet the following
requirements.
      A.   Walls.
         1.   All walls, when located within a buffer, shall be planted along
the exterior face of the wall with at least one upright shrub for every six
feet of linear wall length. These shrubs may be counted towards meeting the
opacity requirement for the buffer.
         2.   Where shrubs are planted adjacent to a wall, the minimum distance
between the wall and the property line shall be four feet.
         3.   A finished side of the wall shall face off site.
         4.   The applicant shall be required to demonstrate provision for
access and maintenance of landscaping and the wall structure at the time of
landscape plan approval.
      B.   Fences.
         1.   Fencing shall comply with the height requirements outlined in
Article 9.7.1.B.
         2.   No reduction in buffer width shall be provided based on the
provision of a fence.
         3.   If fencing is used, required shrubs shall have a minimum height
of three feet at initial planting, and shall be placed along the exterior face
of the fence. At least one upright shrub shall be required for every six linear
feet of fence length. Shrubs are not required for a security fence.
         4.   A finished side of the fence shall face off-site.
         5.   Fences shall be maintained in a structurally safe and attractive
condition and with finished faces and plantings located towards the adjoining
property.
      C.    Berm with vegetation.
         1.   The UDO Administrator may allow a reduction of up to 50% of the
required buffer depth when a berm meeting these requirements is provided.
         2.   An earthen berm may be used in conjunction with planted
vegetation provided that the combined height of the berm and planted vegetation
shall be at least six feet.
         3.   The slope of the berm shall be stabilized with vegetation and no
steeper than three to one. The height of the berm may not exceed six feet, with
a level or rounded area on top of the berm. The berm shall be constructed of
compacted earth.
         4.   Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, berms shall be
planted to ensure coverage by live plant material, including grass, within two
years.
         5.   When berms are planned to be installed within required buffers,
storm drainage plans submitted with the application shall be designed to
anticipate a 100-year storm event.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.9 VEHICULAR USE AREA LANDSCAPING.
   10.9.1   Landscaping requirements in parking areas and vehicular use areas.
All vehicular use areas must have at least one canopy tree trunk within 60 feet
of each parking space. Two small trees with heights between ten and 20 feet at
maturity may be used instead of one canopy tree only if overhead or underground
utility lines will impair the canopy tree’s growth to mature habit. All
vehicular use areas used for parking shall be screened from the view of
adjacent properties and streets by evergreen plantings that will attain a
height of three feet within three years of planting. The use of shrubs and
ground covers is greatly encouraged in parking area islands and along the
borders of parking areas.
   10.9.2   Existing vegetation. Existing healthy, well-formed canopy trees may
be counted toward the requirements of this Article, provided that these trees
are protected in accordance with this Article, before and during development of
the site and maintained thereafter in a healthy growing condition.
   10.9.3   Design standards. The design of the vehicular use area with
landscaped areas, and the selection of plant materials, shall meet the
following standards.
      A.   All parking spaces shall be within 60 feet of the trunk of a canopy
tree, or 30 feet from small trees if allowed under overhead utilities or in
special circumstances.
      B.   All planting medians and/or islands in vehicular use areas shall be
at least ten feet long by ten feet wide from back of curb to back of curb, with
a minimum of 300 square feet of space per canopy tree where these trees are
proposed consistent with division (A) above. This dimension must be measured
from the back of the curbs. Linear planting strips between the lengths of
parking isles are strongly encouraged rather than numerous small one tree
islands. If linear planting strips are used, then the distance of parking
spaces from a trunk of a canopy tree may be increased to 70 feet.
      C.   A minimum ten-foot wide continuous planted median shall be installed
in off-street parking areas approximately every 130 linear feet in one
direction for vehicular surface areas exceeding 40,000 square feet. Other
design options may be approved provided that the intent of “breaking up” large
areas of parking is met. Saving existing interior trees may be credited toward
this requirement. This requirement does not apply to vehicular display lots,
vehicular rental lots, and other similar lots.
      D.   The size of the planting area and size of plant material at maturity
shall allow for a two and one-half foot bumper overhang from the face back of
the curb. Barriers, such as curbs or wheel stops, must be provided between
vehicular use areas and landscaped areas.
      E.   All sidewalks shall be at least five feet from the trunks of large
trees, unless otherwise approved by the TRC. For example, when the placement of
the sidewalk would require the removal of an existing large tree to meet this
requirement or where there is not enough space on the site to accommodate both
the tree and the sidewalk, this requirement may be modified.
      F.   Parking lots shall be graded so that landscape islands do not
impound water, unless surface impoundment is required as a method of on-site
retention of stormwater. Landscape islands should be composed of well-prepared
structured soil and thoroughly cultivated and amended so as to support healthy
plant growth.
      G.   Preservation of existing groups, stands, or groves of trees, as well
as isolated islands with single trees, is strongly encouraged.
      H.   Canopy trees shall be at least two inches in caliper when installed.
      I.   Evergreen shrubs shall be at least 18 to 24 inches in height and
minimum three-gallon container size at the time of installation.
      J.   Adequate drainage, mulching, and irrigation shall be provided for
landscape medians and islands.
      K.   The property owner or developer shall provide for continuous
maintenance of the landscaped areas after occupancy of the building. The
property owner shall ensure that performance criteria within this ordinance
and/or included on the approved site and/or subdivision plan are met. Failure
to correct deficiencies in a timely manner shall result in a citation for
violation of this ordinance in accordance with Article 6.
   10.9.4   Screening vehicular use area. Where there is a vehicular use area
between the street/right- of-way and a permanent nonresidential building, a
semi-opaque screen or barrier shall be provided between the right-of-way and
the vehicular use area. The screen or barrier may consist of plants, earthen
berms, fences, walls, or any combination thereof, which meet the following
requirements.
      A.   The screen shall occupy 75% of the length of the vehicular use area,
except for sidewalks and driveways that cut through the screen to connect the
vehicular use area to streets and other properties. Shrubs shall be at least
two feet in height above the ground and healthy at the time of installation.
      B.   Berms may be used or installed in lieu or in addition to plantings.
If the berm does not meet the performance standards of this Article, then plant
materials shall be installed which meet these standards. The installation of
additional plant materials is encouraged so as to enhance the visual and
aesthetic qualities of the streetscape. Plantings should be placed based upon
topography of the site, usually at the top of the slope.
      C.   Berms must, at a minimum, be planted and maintained with a
groundcover vegetation or grass that will permanently stabilize the soil.
      D.   Shrubs, plantings, hedges, or walls shall provide an opaque screen
or barrier for the first three feet of height within three years of planting.
      E.   Vehicular use areas used for the purpose of loading/unloading, and
accessways to those areas shall be screened from views of streets and adjacent
development.
   10.9.5   Foundation plantings. For all portions of buildings, which are
adjacent to parking facilities or internal drive aisles, foundation plantings
shall be required and located between the buildings face and the parking or
drive isle curb. The minimum standards are required; however, it is encouraged
that sites exceed the minimum whenever possible. The following minimum standard
shall apply.
      A.   The area of the building face adjacent to the parking area or
internal drive isle shall be calculated and multiplied by a minimum of 12%. The
resultant total square footage shall be planted as landscaped areas of
sufficient variety and height.
      B.   Exemptions from these requirements may be granted when the following
circumstances exist or when any of the following conditions are proposed on the
site:
         1.   For those portions of buildings which have drive up services
along any side or rear of the building. (Such examples would include, but not
be limited to, pharmacies, banks, fast food restaurants, dry cleaners, and
photo shops.)
         2.   On the rear side of a building when less than 10% of the total
required parking is located in the rear of the building and the rear is not
adjacent to any public right-of-way.
      C.   If the requirements of this Article conflict with any other
requirements from other Articles of this ordinance, the more stringent shall
apply.
   10.9.6   Exceptions for underground parking and above ground parking
structures. When parking is provided underground or within buildings, the above
requirements shall not apply. However, if the parking is visible from a public
right-of-way or adjacent property, then it shall be screened from views from
streets and adjacent properties pursuant to Article 10.9.4(D) above. Unless
they are designed to look like, reflect the architectural style of, and blend
in with the adjacent buildings, dense landscaping should visually separate all
parking structures from the view of streets and adjacent property. If this is
not possible, then the walls of the structure should be softened by the use of
terracing, plantings, or other techniques.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.10 REMOVAL OF EXISTING TREES.
   A permit shall be required for the removal or destruction of a large or
small mature tree or trees. The permit shall be issued when the UDO
Administrator or his or her designee has determined that the mature tree or
trees to be removed are dead, diseased, irreparably damaged, hazardous, or
creating or potentially creating damage to the property or injury to person, or
an approved landscape plan has been issued pursuant to Article 10.5 of this
ordinance. A permit is not required for the area of an approved plan designated
as single-family or duplex residence exclusive of open space. Trees to be
removed from the public rights-of-way by electric utilities and other utilities
must be replaced by such entity in equal quantity with an approved species from
the suggested plant list.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.11 ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF COMPLIANCE.
   Alternate landscaping plans, plant materials, or planting methods may be
used where unreasonable or impractical situations would result from application
of landscaping requirements, or where necessary to protect existing vegetation.
Such situations may result from streams, natural rock formations, topography,
or other physical conditions; or from lot configuration, utility easements,
unified development design, or unusual site conditions.
   The UDO Administrator may approve an alternate plan that proposes different
plant materials or methods provided that quality, effectiveness, durability,
and performance are equivalent to that required by this ordinance.
   The performance of alternate landscaping plans shall be evaluated by the UDO
Administrator to determine if the alternate plan meets the intent and purpose
of this ordinance. This determination shall take into account the land use
classification of adjacent property, number of plantings, species, arrangement
and coverage, location of plantings on the lots, and the level of screening
height, spread, and canopy of the planting at maturity. Decisions of the UDO
Administrator regarding alternate methods of compliance may be appealed to the
Board of Adjustment.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.12 REVISIONS TO APPROVED LANDSCAPE PLANS.
   Due to seasonal planting problems and/or a lack of plant availability,
approved landscape plans may require minor revisions. Minor revisions to
planting plans may be approved by the UDO Administrator if:
      A.   There is no reduction in the quantity of plant material;
      B.   There is no significant change in size or location of plant
materials; or
      C.   The new plants are of the same general category (i.e., shade tree,
ornamental tree, evergreen, or shrub) and have the same general design
characteristics (mature height, crown spread) as the materials being replaced.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.13 INSPECTION OF SITES.
   The UDO Administrator or his or her designee may periodically inspect sites
subject to the provisions of this ordinance. If, through inspection, it is
determined that a person has failed to comply or is no longer in compliance
with the provisions of this ordinance, a notice to comply shall be served upon
that person by registered mail with return receipt or other means by the town.
The notice shall set forth that which will be necessary to comply with the
ordinance. The town shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it
may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this
ordinance and for this purpose may enter at reasonable times upon the property,
public or private, for the purpose of inspecting the site(s) subject to the
provisions of this ordinance. No person shall refuse entry or access to any
staff or authorized representative of the town who requests entry for the
purpose of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any
person obstruct, hamper, or interfere with that representative while in the
process of carrying out official duties.
   The UDO Administrator or his or her designee shall inspect the site one year
after the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy in order to ensure
compliance with the approved site plan and to ensure that the landscaping is
properly maintained.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.14 EMERGENCIES.
   In the case of emergencies such as windstorms, ice storms, fire, or other
disasters, the town may waive the requirements of this ordinance during the
emergency period so that the requirements of this ordinance will in no way
hamper private or public work to restore order in the town. This shall not be
interpreted to be a general waiver of the intent of this ordinance.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.15 REVEGETATION.
   The disturbance of any landscaped area or vegetation required by this
Article shall constitute a violation of the site or master plan. All disturbed
landscaped areas and vegetation shall be replanted to meet the standards of
this Article as well as the approved site or master plan.
   Where the vegetation that has been disturbed or damaged existed on the site
at the time the development was approved, all replacement vegetation shall meet
the standards set forth in this Article taking into account any unique site
conditions and significant vegetation remaining within the landscaped area.
Trees or vegetation that die within one year of construction completion shall
be removed and replaced with new vegetation of equal or greater size.
   Existing vegetation required to be preserved that has been damaged or
destroyed during the course of development activity shall be subject to civil
penalty and replaced in accordance with the requirements of this Article. Civil
penalty - a base fine of $2 for every square foot area of vegetation damaged or
destroyed, not to exceed $30,000. Refer to Article 6.
   A revegetation plan shall be submitted that takes into consideration the
development condition of the site, significant vegetation remaining within
landscaped areas, and the replacement plant materials. The town may require
equal amounts of new vegetation to be installed equal to the size of the
vegetation removed. Replacement consists of one or a combination of any of the
following measures.
   10.15.1   Replant according to the requirements of this article. A
replanting plan denoting the proposed installation shall be submitted to the
town for approval. The UDO Administrator may elect to present the replanting
plan to the Planning Board for final approval.
   10.15.2   Replace damaged or destroyed significant vegetation in both
perimeter and/or interior landscaped areas with an equal amount of new
vegetation according to the size of vegetation removed. Any tree with a caliper
of at least eight inches that is damaged or removed shall be replaced with one
or more trees that have a caliper of at least two and one-half inches and a
cumulative caliper equal to or greater than the original tree. Trees damaged or
destroyed less than eight inches in diameter shall be replaced to satisfy the
performance criteria of this Article. Understory plantings may also be required
to restore the buffer performance criteria for the disturbed area. A
revegetation plan denoting the proposed installation shall be submitted to the
town for approval. The UDO Administrator may elect to present the revegetation
plan to the Planning Board for final approval. This requirement may be modified
by the UDO Administrator based upon site conditions.
   10.15.3   For all other cases where existing vegetation is damaged or
removed, the type and amount of replacement vegetation required shall be of the
type and amount that is necessary to provide the type of landscaping required
under this Article or interior preservation area identified on the landscape
plan.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.16 LOCATION OF REPLACEMENT TREES AND VEGETATION.
   Replanting should be located within the vicinity of the violation. If the
area is too small for sufficient growth, a more suitable location on the site
may be selected as permitted by the UDO Administrator.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 10.17 INSPECTIONS AND CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   A permanent certificate of occupancy for the development shall not be issued
unless the landscaping required under this Article is installed in accordance
with these standards and in accordance with the approved site plan or
subdivision plat. The UDO Administrator or his or her designee shall inspect
the site one-year after the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy in
order to ensure compliance with the approved site plan and to ensure that the
landscape is properly maintained.

ARTICLE 11
SIGNS
§ 11.1 PURPOSE.
   In order to ensure that signage is designed and placed to complement the
character of the town, to minimize the distractions and obstruction of view
that contribute to traffic hazards and endanger public safety, to protect
existing development and promote high standards of quality in new development
by requiring appropriately designed, placed, and sized signage, and to provide
an effective guide for communicating identification through signage while
preventing signs from dominating the visual appearance of the areas in which
they are located, the following standards shall apply to all signs in all
zoning districts unless otherwise noted. Signs located within the jurisdiction
of a legally constituted HOA, POA, or similar entity may have additional
restrictions.
   Specifically excluded from these regulations and height and area
restrictions, are freestanding/ monument directional non-commercial signs
erected by local government, or by an agent of such, in any zoning district,
either within public lands or on private land owned by others with their
written consent and maintained by the town or by an agent of the town.
   Nonconforming signs and sign structures: see Article 5.5.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 11.2 PERMITS AND PLANS.
   11.2.1   Applicability. It shall be unlawful to construct, enlarge, modify,
move, or replace any sign or cause the same to be done without first obtaining
a zoning permit pursuant to Article 4.12.1 for such sign from the town.
   11.2.2   Application requirements. An application for a zoning permit to
allow a sign shall be submitted in accordance with Article 4.1.3 (Application
Requirements).
   Applications for permits shall contain or have attached the following
information:
      A.   The street number and/or the tax parcel number for the zoning lot on
which the sign is to be located;
      B.   The name, address, and telephone number for the applicant and the
owner of the property on which the sign is to be erected or affixed, and for
the licensed contractor erecting or affixing the sign;
      C.   If the applicant is not the owner of the property on which the sign
will be located, a copy of the lease agreement between the property owner and
the applicant or other legally constituted authorization;
      D.   A site plan, diagram, or aerial photo of the property involved,
showing accurate placement of the proposed sign(s) including setbacks, all
structures, access easements, adjacent streets and right-of- ways, and other
relevant site information;
      E.   One copy of scaled drawings of the plans and specifications of the
sign to be erected or affixed. Such plans shall include, but shall not be
limited to, details of dimensions, materials, copy, and size of the proposed
sign. For wall signs, dimensions of the building wall on which the sign is to
be affixed and the location and the size of existing wall signs shall also be
included;
      F.   Any structures (e.g., walls, columns, and the like) adjacent to an
entry or identification sign shall be shown in the application; and
      G.   Any information that the UDO Administrator may require to determine
full compliance with this and other applicable codes. All signs shall meet the
International Building Code with North Carolina amendments.
   11.2.3   Action by UDO Administrator. Following completion of the technical
reviews by staff, the UDO Administrator shall approve the permit, provided the
sign meets all requirements of this ordinance and all other applicable
electrical and construction requirements of the International Building Code
with North Carolina amendment requirements.
   11.2.4   Revocation and removal.
      A.   Any zoning permit issued in accordance with this ordinance shall
expire unless the work for which the permit was issued has visibly been started
within 365 days of the date of issue or if the work authorized by it is
suspended, not completed, or abandoned for 180 days.
      B.   The UDO Administrator or designee shall have the authority to order
the painting, repair, or removal of any sign that ceases functionality, or that
constitutes a hazard to the health, safety, or public welfare by reason of
inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, or obsolescence. Notice to the owner
shall be by personal service or registered mail, return receipt requested. Upon
notification, the owner shall have 30 days to remediate shortcomings. Failure
to do so within the appropriate time frame may result in the town proceeding
with legal actions pursuant to Article 6, Enforcement.
      C.   Any sign erected or posted in violation of, or not in accordance
with, provisions contained in this Article is subject to an order of immediate
removal. If the violator fails to remove the sign when ordered to do so, the
UDO Administrator may take necessary action to have the sign removed. A failure
on the part of the responsible person to remove the sign will also result in

regulated and may be prohibited by federal and state law. No such activities
shall be undertaken on any lot without prior consent in writing from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, and the state’s Department of Environment and Natural
Resources, Division of Water Resources, have been notified and all required
permits have been obtained.
   12.7.8   Water and sewer. Provision of water and sewer to each structure
(residential or nonresidential) shall be in accordance with the regulations
promulgated by the appropriate jurisdictional authority.
   12.7.9   Utilities.
      A.   All affected utility companies shall be provided with copies of the
preliminary and final plats by the subdivider and be expected to work with the
developer in designing the utilities plan for the subdivision.
      B.   All subdivision proposals which have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, shall have such systems
located and constructed to minimize flood damage and to comply with the town
flood damage prevention ordinance.
      C.   All utilities shall be installed underground. However, a developer
shall not be required to bury power lines when the power lines existed above
ground at the time of first approval of a plat or development plan by the town,
whether or not the power lines are subsequently relocated during construction
of the subdivision or development or the power lines are located outside the
boundaries of the parcel of land that contains the subdivision or the property
covered by the development plan.
   12.7.10   Street connectivity requirements.
      A.   General. The town hereby determines and recognizes that an
interconnected street system is necessary in order to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare. This will be accomplished by ensuring that streets
will function in an interdependent manner by providing continuous and
comprehensive traffic routes and adequate access for emergency and service
vehicles. The interconnected system of roads should also enhance non-vehicular
travel such as pedestrians and bicycles. Street interconnection design shall
address connection of the subject subdivision to the adjacent thoroughfare
within the subject subdivision. Rights-of-way for future street connections
shall be dedicated to the public at the time of final plat approval.
      B.   External access required.
         1.   External access to a development will meet the following
requirements. In determining the number of access points that shall be
required, the cumulative impacts of prior developments on the roads shall be
considered:
            a.   There shall be at least two points of access for development
with 120 or fewer lots, unless waived by the Planning Board. Certain land
characteristic may require more than two access points.
            b.   For developments with more than 120 lots, at least three
points of access to the roadway shall be provided. If the development is
bounded by more than one thoroughfare, there shall be at least one entrance to
each thoroughfare.
            c.   The required points of access shall be installed at the time
of final plat approval. If the development is being developed in phases and a
subject point of access is not necessary for the current phase, additional
point(s) of access may be approved as construction access.
         2.   A divided entrance shall count as one point of access.
         3.   The Planning Board may approve variations in the requirements of
this Article when additional access points are precluded in the following
circumstances:
            a.   If the only additional access points available would require
crossing floodplains, steep slopes, or other similar natural features; or
            b.   When the existing development pattern precludes additional
access points and fewer units than would otherwise be allowed would be out of
character with the surrounding development.
      C.   Access to adjacent property.
         1.   Access to existing developments shall be achieved by connecting
to temporary turnarounds or the equivalent provided in the existing
development.
         2.   Access to future developments is required on each side (as
defined by each of the cardinal directions) of a development as follows:
            a.   At least one future connection for every 1,400 linear feet on
any single side of the proposed development; and
            b.   Future connections are not required to adjoining sites that
are permanently protected from development through conservation easements or
ownership that precludes development. Nor are future connections required if
the only point of access would require crossing floodplains, wetlands, or other
similar natural features.
      D.   Within the proposed subdivision. All proposed streets shall be
continuous and connect to existing or platted streets. Street offsets are not
desired and must be approved by the Planning Board. Cul-de-sacs will be allowed
if they enhance the appearance of the neighborhood and the utilization of the
land. The street network for any subdivision shall achieve a “connectivity
ratio” of not less than 1.00 in all zoning districts.
         1.   The phrase CONNECTIVITY RATIO means the number of street “links”
divided by the number of “nodes” or link ends, including cul-de-sac heads.
         2.   A “link” means and refers to that portion of a street defined by
a node at each end or at one end. Approved stubs to adjacent property shall be
considered links.
         3.   A “node” refers to the terminus of a street or the intersection
of two or more streets, except that intersections that use a roundabout shall
not be counted as a node.
         4.   For purposes of Article 12.7.10, the street links and nodes
within the collector or thoroughfare streets providing access to a proposed
subdivision shall not be considered in computing the connectivity ratio.
      E.   The street connectivity requirements set forth in this Article are
established as standards. The town recognizes, however, that due to the
particular nature of a tract of land or other factors strict adherence to these
standards may not be practical or desirable and, therefore, the Planning Board
has discretion whether or not to require the actual connection to adjacent
property.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 12.8 STREETS.
   12.8.1   Street classification.
      A.   Classifications. In all new subdivisions, streets shall be
classified as provided in this Article.
         1.   The classification shall be based upon the projected volume of
traffic to be carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per
day.
         2.   The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be
used as a useful indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive.
         3.   Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that
formerly terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a
subdivision street will be continued beyond the subdivision at some future
time, the classification of the street will be based upon the street in its
entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision.
      B.   The classification of streets shall be as follows.
         1.   Alley. A vehicular way used for providing service access along
rear or side property lines of lots that are also served by one of the other
listed street types. Alleys are not intended to accommodate through traffic.
         2.   Minor. A street whose sole function is to provide access to
abutting properties, it serves or is designed to serve not more than nine
dwelling units or expected to or does handle up to 75 trips per day.
         3.   Local. A street whose sole function is to provide access to
abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve at least ten but no more
than 25 dwelling units or expected to or does handle between 75 and 200 trips
per day.
         4.   Cul-de-sac. A street that terminates in a vehicular turnaround.
      C.   Minimum right-of-way.
         1.   All streets.
            a.   Right-of-way widths may not be less than the following and a
four-foot wide sidewalk/multi-use path shall be required where indicated.
 ROW Sidewalk/Multi-Use Path
                                 ROW    Sidewalk/Multi-Use Path
Alley                             20     None
Arterial/Thoroughfare             100    One side
Collector                         70     One side
Cul-de-sac                        45     One side
Local Road/Street                 40     One side
Principal Arterial Freeways/Other 150/90 None
Subcollector                      50     One side
 
            b.   The subdivider is only required to dedicate up to 100 feet of
right-of-way, in cases where over 100 feet of right-of-way is required, the
subdivider will be required only to reserve the amount in excess of 100 feet in
width. In all cases in which right-of-way is sought for an access- controlied
facility, the subdivider will only be required to make a reservation.
         2.   Private streets. All new streets shall be constructed to meet all
NCDOT Minimum Construction Standards for Subdivision Streets. All private roads
shall be paved and provided with sidewalks on at least one side of the street.
      D.   Intersections.
         1.   All streets shall intersect at or as near to 90 degrees as
possible within topographic limits.
         2.   Offset intersections are to be avoided unless an exception is
granted by NCDOT, or by the Planning Board (for private streets). A minimum
length of 200 feet between survey centerlines should separate intersections
that cannot be aligned.
         3.   Intersections with arterials, collectors, and thoroughfares,
shall be at least 1,000 feet from centerline to centerline. Greater separation
distances may be required by the state’s Department of Transportation, or by
the Planning Board (for private streets).
      E.   Signage. Signs denoting the right-of-way boundaries of dedicated or
reserved unopened streets and future connections shall be erected and
maintained according to town standards.
      F.   Sign standards. Appropriate traffic control devices and signage
shall be installed based on traffic engineered studies. All signs shall meet
the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Device Standards.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 12.9 RECREATION SPACE.
   12.9.1   General provisions. Every subdivider of land for residential
purposes shall dedicate a portion of such land, as set forth herein, for the
purpose of providing active and passive recreation areas to serve the residents
of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision.
   12.9.2   Active and passive recreation space dedications. Recreation areas
shall be defined for active or passive recreation use as follows.
      A.   Active recreation consists of areas such as park land chosen without
regard to natural features for the explicit purposes of enhancing design, such
as village commons, or providing space for outdoor recreation activities that
may include, but not be limited to, golf courses, tennis courts, ball fields,
swimming pools, and tot lots with play equipment. No more than 25% of the
required active recreation may be located in an indoor facility such as, but
not limited to, exercise rooms, clubhouses, and gymnasiums. Parking spaces
associated with these uses, whether required or not, shall not be counted
towards satisfying the required active recreation space provision.
      B.   Passive recreation areas shall include amenities such as walking
paths, piers, picnic areas, and other passive recreational uses. Such uses
shall be subject to approval and/or permits issued by the proper authorities,
including any necessary CAMA approvals, and only will be allowed with minimal
disturbance of the vegetation. The passive recreation areas may consist of
undisturbed, unique, and sensitive natural features and may include streams,
floodplains, wetlands (excluding tidal marsh), conservation resources, and
natural heritage areas if identified. Undisturbed soils and natural vegetative
cover for wildlife habitat will characterize these natural spaces:
         1.   The town subject to the acceptance by the Town Council;
         2.   Other public jurisdictions or agencies, subject to their
acceptance;
         3.   Property owner, condominium or cooperative associations or
organizations; and
         4.   Shared, undivided interest by all property owners in the
subdivision, which interest shall run with the land and be transferred when the
individual properties are sold.
   12.9.3   Required recreation space.
      A.   All new residential subdivisions shall provide recreation space in
the amount of 10% of the gross acreage within the subdivision, with not more
than 25% of the recreation space to be used for active recreation. The
developer shall designate the area which meets the required recreation space on
the subdivision plan and in the event additional recreation space is provided
(in excess of the required amount), said excess recreation space shall not be
used in the future for any other purpose, but shall remain in perpetuity as
recreation space. The recreation space either shall be dedicated to the town or
a conservation easement shall be granted to the town.
      B.   Recreation space areas shall be of such minimum dimensions as to be
functionally usable and maintainable. Residential subdivisions that are small
enough so that the amount of required recreation space area does not exceed
20,000 square feet shall be exempt from providing such space when the Planning
Board determines that:
         1.   Recreation space area cannot be combined with such areas serving
adjacent property to form a functionally usable and maintainable area; or
         2.   The recreational needs of the development can be adequately met
by existing or planned town-owned park or recreation space areas located close
enough to such development to reasonably serve its residents. In determining
the size of a subdivision for the purposed of this Article, the Planning Board
shall consider the entire project developed on a single tract or contiguous
multiple tracts under common ownership, regardless of whether the subdivision
is constructed in phases or stages.
   12.9.4   Standards for park and recreation areas. Except as otherwise
approved by the appropriate governing body, all park, recreation, and open
space areas shall meet the following criteria.
         1.   Unity. The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land,
whether or not the subdivision is developed in phases or sections, except where
it is determined by the Planning Board that two or more parcels would be in the
best interests of the residents of the subdivision and the public; and in such
case, the Planning Board may require that such parcels be connected.
         2.   Usability. At least two-thirds of the total land dedicated must
be outside of wetland areas under the jurisdiction of federal and state
regulatory agencies and be usable for active and/or passive recreation.
         3.   Shape. The portion of dedicated land to be used for active
recreation shall be of such a shape to be usable for active recreation
facilities, including, but not limited to, tennis courts, racquetball courts,
swimming pools, exercise rooms, clubhouses, athletic fields, basketball courts,
swings, slides, and play apparatus. The developer shall include said areas(s)
on the preliminary and final subdivision plat, and must demonstrate that the
shape and size of the area is adequate for the intended purpose(s).
         4.   Access within the subdivision for which the land dedication is
made and can be combined. All dwelling units in the subdivision shall have
free, easy, and convenient ingress and egress to and from the park, recreation,
and open space areas provided within the development by means of improved
streets or dedicated walkways. Rights-of-way for such access shall be shown on
the preliminary plats and final plats.
         5.   Topography. The average slope of the portion of dedicated land
deemed usable for active recreation shall not exceed the average slope of the
entire subdivision to be developer, and in no case shall the slope of the land
dedicated be greater than 10%. The developer shall include said area(s) on the
preliminary and final subdivision plat, and must demonstrate that the land is
adequate for the intended purpose(s).
         6.   Landscaping. Park, recreation, and open space areas shall be
landscaped and shall be provided with sufficient natural or human-made
screening or buffer areas to minimize any negative impacts upon adjacent
residences.
         7.   Encroachments. The park, recreation, and open space areas
required by this section shall exclude roadways, parking areas, and other
accessory uses except recreational facilities.
   12.9.5   Procedure for dedication of land.
      A.   Designation of land to be dedicated. Subdividers shall designate on
the preliminary subdivision plat the area or areas to be dedicated pursuant to
this Article.
      B.   Review of land to be dedicated. A copy of the preliminary
subdivision plat showing the areas to be dedicated shall be submitted to the
Planning Board for review and approval at its next scheduled meeting.
      C.   Ownership. The owner, developer, or subdivider, subject to the
approval of the Planning Board, shall select the type of ownership of land
dedicated for park, recreation, or open space purposes. The type of ownership
may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following:
         1.   The town subject to the acceptance by the Town Council;
         2.   Other public jurisdictions or agencies, subject to their
acceptance;
         3.   Property owner, condominium, or cooperative associations or
organizations; and
         4.   Shared, undivided interest by all property owners in the
subdivision, which interest shall run with the land and be transferred when the
individual properties are sold.
   12.9.6   Flexibility in administration authorized.
      A.   The requirements set forth in this Article concerning the amount,
size, location, and nature of park, recreation, and open space areas to be
provided in connection with residential developments are established by the
Town Council as standards that preemptively will result in the provision of
that amount of recreational facilities and open space that is consistent with
officially adopted town plans. The town recognizes, however, that due to the
particular nature of a tract of land, or the nature of the facilities proposed
for installation, or other factors, the underlying objectives of this Article
may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical
precision. Therefore, the Planning Board is authorized to permit minor
deviations from these standards whenever it determines that:
         1.   The objectives underlying these standards can be met without
strict adherence to them; and
         2.   Because of peculiarities in the developer’s tract of land or the
facilities proposed, it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to
these standards.
      B.   Whenever some deviation from the standards set forth in this Article
is authorized, the official record of action taken on the development
application shall contain a statement of the reasons for allowing the
deviation.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 12.10 PROPERTY OWNER ASSOCIATIONS.
   12.10.1   Final plans shall not be approved until the Planning Board has
determined that adequate provisions have been made through legal covenants and
restrictions which shall govern a property owners association, or through other
legal agreements, that the responsibility for maintenance of streets,
utilities, storm water management facilities, drainage ditches or swales, or
other area designated as private areas is the responsibility of the property
owners association.
   12.10.2   Required conditions of property owners associations. Property
owners associations or similar legal entities that shall own and maintain park,
recreation, and open space areas, streets, utilities, storm water management
facilities, drainage ditches or swales, or other areas designated as private
areas or as common areas shall be established in such a manner that:
      A.   Provision for the establishment of the association or similar entity
shall be made before any lot in the development is sold or any building
occupied;
      B.   Membership must be mandatory for each property owner within the
subdivision;
      C.   The association shall be responsible for the liability insurance,
property taxes, and the maintenance of the areas;
      D.   Any sums levied by the association that remain unpaid shall become a
lien on the individual property owner’s property;
      E.   If all or any portion of the property held by the association is
being disposed of or if the association is dissolved, the passive and active
recreation and open space shall be first offered for dedication to the town;
      F.   The right of use of the passive and active recreation or open space
and all improvements shall be guaranteed to each resident of the subdivision;
and
      G.   The declaration of covenants and restrictions that will govern the
association shall be submitted for review by the Town Attorney and recorded
prior to the recording of any final plats for the subdivision and reference to
the deed book and page provided on the plat.
   12.10.3   Property owners associations shall be responsible for continuing
upkeep and proper maintenance of all private infrastructure facilities and
common areas within the respective subdivision.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 12.11 SITES FOR PUBLIC USE.
   In subdividing property, due consideration shall be given by the subdivider
to the reservation of suitable sites for schools and other public uses in
accordance with G.S. § 160D-804.

TEMPORARY USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 14.1 PURPOSE.
   This section allows for the establishment of certain temporary uses of
limited duration, provided that such uses do not negatively affect adjacent
properties or town facilities, and provided that such uses are discontinued
upon the expiration of a set time period. Temporary uses do not involve the
construction or alteration or any permanent building or structure. Temporary
uses may occur in permanent or temporary structures.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 14.2 TEMPORARY USE IN A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE.
   Temporary structures are built specifically for the temporary use described
below. Approval may include the structure as well as the intended event.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 14.3 TEMPORARY USE IN A PERMANENT STRUCTURE.
   Temporary use in a permanent structure refers to a specific event to be
conducted in a permanent structure that has already been approved by the town
and/or POA. Upon completion of the temporary event, the structure will be
returned to the original condition as required by the original approval.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 14.4 TABLE OF ALLOWED TEMPORARY USES INCLUDED IN TABLE 14.8.
§ 14.5 TEMPORARY USE PERMITS.
   All temporary uses and structures that are required to obtain a temporary
use permit by Table 14.8 shall obtain such permit pursuant to the procedures
set forth in this Article. A temporary use permit shall be reviewed, approved,
or revoked only in accordance with the regulations of §
14.8 below. Temporary uses must meet the requirements of the State Building
Code.
   14.5.1   General requirements for all temporary uses and structures. All
temporary uses or structures shall meet the following general requirements,
unless otherwise specified in this Article.
      A.   The temporary use complies with all applicable general and specific
regulations of this UDO, unless otherwise expressly stated.
      B.   Permanent alterations to the site are prohibited. Minor alterations
are allowed, but the site must be restored to the original state at the end of
the temporary use period. For temporary uses that are not continuous over the
temporary use period (e.g., one day per month over a multi-month period) the
site must be restored after each occurrence.
      C.   Signage shall comply with applicable provisions of Article 14.5 and
Article 11.
      D.   The temporary use or structure will not violate any applicable
conditions of approval that apply to a principal use on the site.
      E.   If the property is undeveloped, it must contain sufficient land area
to allow the temporary use or structure to occur, as well as any parking and
traffic movement that may be associated with the temporary use, without
disturbing protected resources, including required buffers.
      F.   If the property is developed, the temporary use must be located in
an area that is not actively used by an existing approved principal use, and
which would support the proposed temporary use, including parking, without
encroaching or disturbing existing buffers or required setbacks from buffers or
streetscapes, open space, landscaping, traffic movements, pedestrian
circulation.
      G.   Tents and other temporary structures, including temporary storage
units, will be located so as to not interfere with the normal operations of any
permanent use located on the property.
      H.   Off-street parking is approved by the UDO Administrator.
      I.   All inspections and permits required by applicable construction
codes have been made and approved.

         4.   Temporary quarters for a nonresidential use when the permanent
building has been damaged or destroyed by fire or other physical catastrophe,
provided that a building permit for the permanent facility is obtained within
90 days after approval of the temporary quarters. The UDO Administrator may
approve a written request for an extension of an additional 90 days for good
cause shown. Failure to obtain a building permit within the time frame allowed
will revoke approval for the temporary quarters. With justification, additional
time extensions may be applied for on a case by case basis; and
         5.   One temporary office per site to include, but not be limited to,
the following uses: hiring, membership solicitation, apartment office/leasing,
and other general office uses provided that the town has approved a site plan
or subdivision plan for the development. The number of modular buildings
housing such uses shall be limited to one, unless additional buildings are
approved by the UDO Administrator. Such modular buildings shall not be placed
on the property prior to the issuance of a building permit.
      B.   Standards and requirements for approval. In addition to meeting the
general standards of Article 14.5.1, all temporary structures approved pursuant
to this section shall meet the following standards and requirements:
         1.   Location. Temporary structures allowed under Article 14.6.1 may
be located anywhere on site, except within the following areas:
            a.   Existing or planned vegetated buffers or within the buffer

open space, vehicular use, or ingress/egress.
         2.   Other requirements.
            a.   Under skirting shall be installed around all temporary
structures.
            b.   For those temporary structures requiring site plan approval,
the temporary structure shall be compatible with the existing buildings on the
site in terms of exterior color.
            c.   Foundation plantings shall be required for temporary
structures intended for use as temporary recreation facilities.
            d.   A sketch plan shall be submitted to and approved by the UDO
Administrator prior to installation of the temporary structure.
         3.   Duration. Temporary structures under this section may remain on
the site for no more than 12 months. This period may be renewed for two 12-
month periods, for good cause shown, upon approval of a written request,
submitted to the UDO Administrator 30 days prior to the expiration of the
permit. In no event, however, shall such extensions allow the temporary
structure to remain on the site for more than three years.
   14.6.2   Real estate sales office and model sales home.
      A.   General requirements. One temporary real estate sales office or
model sales home may be allowed as incidental to a new residential or
nonresidential development provided that:
         1.   The use is located on a single-family lot or within a multi-
family development that was approved by the town as part of a residential
development, or within a nonresidential area of an approved planned unit
development;
         2.   Reserved;
         3.   The temporary use is aesthetically compatible with the character
of the community and the surrounding development in terms of exterior color,
predominant exterior building materials, and landscaping;
         4.   The temporary use complies with the minimum yard and setback
requirements of the zoning district in which it is located;
         5.   Parking spaces shall be provided on the lot in a number
sufficient to meet the projected demand;
         6.   For single-family developments, landscaping shall conform to the
general landscaping requirements of Articles 7 and 10 of the UDO;
         7.   A site plan, containing sufficient information to show compliance
with the above standards, shall be submitted to and approved by the Planning
Department prior to installation of the sales office;
         8.   The temporary use shall connect to public utilities; and
         9.   Upon termination of the temporary real estate sales office or
model sales home, the structure will be removed unless the structure will be
converted into a permanent structure and meets all applicable requirements for
permanent use.
      B.   Duration.
         1.   Temporary real estate sales offices. Temporary real estate sales
offices may be approved for a period of up to one year. This period may be
renewed for two additional 12-month periods, but not exceeding a total of three
years, for good cause shown, upon approval of a written request for such an
extension by the UDO Administrator, filed 30 days prior to the expiration date
of the existing approval. All temporary trailers shall be removed from the site
prior to the issuance of the last certificate of occupancy for the site.
         2.   Model sales homes. Model sales homes may be approved for a period
of up to three years. This period may be renewed for additional six-month
periods, for good cause shown, upon approval of a written request for such an

commercial purposes may take place on a developed site where the principal use
is retail sales, or on an immediately adjacent developed out-parcel of such a
site.
         4.   Non-commercial sales. A temporary sale of goods for public or
institutional purposes may take place on a developed site where the principal
use is retail sales, or on an immediately adjacent developed out-parcel of such
a site. Upon approval of the UDO Administrator, such sales may take place on
public property, including: public parks owned or maintained by the town,
public street rights-of- way, and any other property owned by the town.
      C.   Similar products, goods, and services. A temporary display or sale
of products, goods, and/or services for commercial purposes shall be limited in
scope to similar or complimentary products, goods, and/or services to those
offered by the existing principal use located upon the same site. The temporary
sale of non-agricultural products, goods, and/or services that differ from the
normal range of those offered by an existing principal use shall be prohibited.
      D.   Submittal requirements. The operator of the temporary sale of
products, goods, and/or services shall provide the UDO Administrator with the
following:
         1.   Written permission from the property owner;
         2.   A sketch plan showing:
            a.   The location of any tent or temporary structure to be used;

         1.   The temporary sale of non-agricultural products shall be allowed
on an individual parcel or site for no more than 90 total days per calendar
year.
         2.   The number of temporary sales of products per site per calendar
year shall not exceed 50 sales events, for a combined total of 90 days. For the
purposes of this section, SITE shall mean the entire parcel, including out-
parcels, whether it is a single tenant, multi-tenant, or shopping center use.
      G.   Requirements.
         1.   The UDO Administrator shall issue a temporary use permit for the
temporary display and/or sale of products if the proposed use satisfies the
following requirements:
         2.   The property contains an area that is not actively used, which
would support the proposed temporary sale of products without encroaching into
or disturbing existing buffers, open space, landscaping, or traffic movements;
         3.   Tents and other temporary structures will be located so as not to
interfere with the normal operations of any permanent use located on the
property;
         4.   All tents and other temporary structures shall match the
predominant color of the principal structure on the premises or be of a neutral
or earth tone color;
         5.   The temporary use will not occupy any existing parking required
for the principal use;
         6.   The temporary sale of products will not likely cause interference
with the movement of emergency vehicles to such an extent that adequate police,

(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 14.7 EVENTS.
   14.7.1   Purpose and intent. The purpose for this section is to establish
permit requirements, allowable time frames, and submittal requirements for four
recognized types of events. These provisions are intended to address potential
significant negative impacts to public or private properties from events or
event-related activities, not to prevent such activities from occurring or to
unduly restrict private events.
   14.7.2.   Types of events.
      A.   Community center events, public and private. Community centers are
locations or facilities where members of a community may gather for group and
club activities, social activities, information meetings, educational
activities, recreational activities, special events, and other purposes. They
are often facilities that community members (and sometimes others), can rent
for a function or event. They may sometimes be open for the whole community or
for a specialized group within the greater community. Examples of groups that
use community centers include youth groups, seniors, specific religious groups,
and the like. Community centers may be municipally owned (public facilities) or
privately owned. Parks and recreational centers/facilities are considered
community centers. The typical mission of community centers is to provide a
facility for programs that meet the served community needs, enhance the quality
of life, and promote community involvement through the provision of a venue for
recreation, cultural activities, education, health, wellness, and fitness
activities, as well as family life activities. Gymnasiums, ceramic rooms,
meeting rooms, kitchens, multipurpose activity rooms, weight/fitness rooms,
pre-school rooms, and restrooms are often found in community centers. Outdoor
amenities are often included in community centers (e.g., play equipment,
athletic fields, multipurpose courts, and parks). Municipally owned community
centers are duly chartered for such activities and are exempt from temporary
use permit requirements. The town’s Community Center is an example of a
municipally owned facility. Privately owned community centers approved by the
town and conforming to the requirements of this UDO are also exempt from
temporary use permit requirements for activities within the boundaries of the
approved charter and facilities.
      B.   Town-recognized event. A town-recognized event is one that is in
part or wholly sponsored by the town, recognized by the town, or proclaimed as
a town-recognized event by the Town Council.
      C.   Not-for-profit event. A not-for-profit event is any event that is
requested by, or held for, a recognized non-profit organization or other
charitable organization.
      D.   Special events. Special events are any organized event, specifically
including, but not limited to, a temporary sales event accessory to a principal
use, or a circus, carnival, cultural event, fair, celebration, communal
camping, groundbreaking, grand opening, religious service, musical, or other
show, which reasonably may be expected to attract 100 or more persons, but
which do not meet the criteria of a town-recognized event or a not-for-profit
event.
      E.   Private events. Private events are any organized events which are
not open to members of the general public, typically has a duration of less
than 12 hours, and which is not expected to have significant negative impacts
on surrounding properties. Examples of such events include, but are not limited
to wedding ceremonies, funerals, private parties, or other similar gatherings.
Events that take place in such venues as privately owned and managed clubs,
lodges, churches, gathering areas, sports facilities, and the like that may be
open to both members and non-members are exempt from temporary use permit
requirements, but are subject to meeting the facility conditions set forth in
Article 8.
      F.   POA/HOA events. Events that take place entirely within the
boundaries of a parcel or possess sites and/or subdivision plans approval for
such activities (e.g., assembly halls, convention centers, amphitheaters, or
event centers) are exempt from temporary use permit requirements but must meet
the facility conditions set forth in Article 8.
   14.7.3   No permit required.
      A.   The following types of events do not need to obtain temporary use
permits, but may be subject to the maximum allowable time frames, temporary
signage requirements, and specific regulations as listed in Table 14.8:
         1.   Athletic events held at approved sports facilities;
         2.   Temporary not-for-profit car washes held on developed sites;
         3.   Garage and/or yard sales;
         4.   Block parties occurring entirely upon the grounds of a private
residence, grounds privately owned by institutions (e.g., streets and parks
owned by an HOA, POA, and the like), or common area of a multi-family
residential development;
         5.   Other events with 99 people or fewer in attendance;
         6.   Private events on privately owned property, including privately
owned streets, parks, and the like, administered by an HOA/POA; and
         7.   Events that occur or take place entirely within the boundaries of
a parcel or parcels that possess site and/or subdivision plan approval for such
activities (e.g., assembly halls, convention centers, amphitheaters, parks,
community/recreation centers, or event centers).
   14.7.4   Permit required.
      A.   Special events. Special events or not-for-profit events shall
require a temporary use permit obtained in accordance with this section and the
procedures of this Article, unless otherwise exempted in Article 14.7.2 through
Article 14.7.3.
      B.   Application for permit. Any application to hold a special event or
not-for-profit event shall be made in advance of the event.
      C.   Organization representation. A permit to hold a special event or
not-for-profit event issued to one person or organization shall permit any
person to engage in any lawful activity in connection with the holding of the
permitted assembly.
      D.   Term of approval/permit. The maximum allowable time frame for all
allowable events is addressed in this Article of the UDO. The UDO Administrator
may extend the consecutive day limit or the annual limit upon approval of a
written request for such an extension, for good cause shown.
      E.   Additional planning requirements. In addition to meeting the general
standards of § 14.8, all not-for-profit and special events shall also meet the
planning requirements set forth below. The UDO Administrator shall be
responsible for determining the adequacy of submitted plans.
         1.   An adequate plan for security and safety shall be implemented on
and around the site of the event, including sufficient staffing, provision for
pedestrian safety, restroom facilities (if necessary), and traffic routing.
         2.   An adequate plan for public health, safety, and welfare on,
around, and outside the site of the event shall be implemented, including a
showing that the event will not likely cause interference with the movement of
emergency vehicles to such an extent that adequate police, fire, or other
emergency services cannot be provided throughout the town and will not likely
cause unreasonable or unwarranted disruption to vehicular or pedestrian
traffic.
      F.   Submittal requirements. All applications for special and not-for-
profit events shall include such information and supporting materials as are
required by the UDO Administrator, including, but not necessarily limited to,
the following:
         1.   A description of the proposed event, including the event’s
starting date and time, the event’s ending date and time, the date and time
preparatory activities will commence, and the date and time of completed post-
event clean-up;
         2.   The location of the property (properties) upon which the proposed
event will take place;
         3.   A security plan, if requested; and
         4.   A parking plan.

ARTICLE 15
LIGHTING
§ 15.1 SITE LIGHTING.
   15.1.1   Purpose and intent.
      The town desires to enhance the beauty of the area for its citizens, both
during the day and at night. Outdoor lighting is required for the safety and
beautification of the exterior environment during the night-time hours for
various uses.
      Nonresidential and multi-family buildings and projects, including
outparcels, shall be designed to provide safe, comfortable, attractive, and
efficient lighting for pedestrians and vehicles. Lighting shall be designed in
a consistent and coordinated manner for the entire site. Lighting equipment
shall be selected and located to be integrated with the exterior environment.
The lighting and lighting fixtures shall be designed so as to enhance the
visual impact of the project on the community or to blend seamlessly into the
surrounding landscape. Lighting design and installation shall meet on-site
lighting needs without intrusion on adjoining properties.
      This sets forth criteria for the installation of exterior lighting
visible from the exterior of buildings and structures, the purposes of which
are as follows:
         • Permit reasonable uses of outdoor lighting for night-time safety,
utility, security, productivity, enjoyment, and commerce;
         • Preserve and enhance public safety and security (i.e., deter crime);
         • Support adequate traffic and pedestrian safety;
         • Protect drivers from disabling glare thereby enhancing traffic
safety;
         • Provide consistent night-time illumination throughout the town
thereby enhancing the town’s night-time character;
         • Shield neighboring properties from nuisance glare and light
trespass;
         • Curtail light pollution to preserve the nighttime environment and
         • Promote energy conservation through efficient lighting design and
operation.
   15.1.2   Application. The requirements of this shall apply to:
      15.1.2.A.   All nonresidential or multi-family development; and
      15.1.2.B.   All residential subdivision development
   15.1.3   Exemptions.
      15.1.3.1   The following activities are exempt from the requirements of
this:
         • Outdoor lights used for a temporary event; permitted through a
temporary use permit.
         • Outdoor lights used exclusively for recreational activities,
concerts, plays, or other outdoor events that are open to the public, provided
that the event or function meets all other applicable ordinance requirements;
such lighting shall be located at least 50 feet from any adjoining residential
district or use.
      15.1.3.2   Outdoor lighting which is exempt from this shall only be
illuminated while the activity takes place and during high traffic periods
immediately before and after the event.
   15.1.4   Lighting plan submission. A site lighting plan shall be required as
part of the application review for all nonresidential and multi-family
development areas proposed for illumination that is proposed to illuminate an
area or facade fronting a road; where lighting equipment is proposed to be
mounted within one mounting height of the property line, or where one or more
pole-mounted luminaires are proposed. At a minimum, the submission shall
contain the following.
      15.1.4.1   Illuminance calculations. Provide a point-by-point footcandle
array in a printable format with suitable resolution and font size to be
legible on one or more 11 by 17 sheets of paper indicating the location and
aiming of illuminating devices. The point spacing shall not be greater than
five feet by five feet (greater spacing may be permitted for very large areas)
with a numerical value for horizontal illuminance (Ehorz) at grade given for
each point to the nearest 0.1 footcandle (fc).
   Provide a second point-by-point array with the same calculation grid raised
to five feet above grade with a numerical value for vertical illuminance
(Evert) for each point to the nearest 0.1 fc. The direction of the calculation
shall be selected to maximize approximation of illumination on pedestrian faces
and/or demonstrate compliance with trespass restrictions as applicable.
   For facade illumination projects, provide a vertical array showing the
illumination values perpendicular to the plane of the array.
   Provide a summary of all calculation points indicating compliance with all
illumination criteria required by this in tabular form.
      15.1.4.2   Luminaire schedule. Provide a tabular schedule of proposed
luminaires keyed to the point-by-point with fixture description to define the
fixtures, lamps, supports, reflectors, poles, raised foundations, and other
devices. Indicate the light loss factor used for each type.
      15.1.4.3   Catalog cut sheets. Provide product specification data from
the manufacturer or electric utility and/or drawings and photometric report
indicating the fixture BUG rating, cut-off classification, and a description
such as decorative post top, wall pack, and the like.
      15.1.4.4   Energy code summary. Submit a table indicating outdoor areas
by type, applied metric (linear feet or square feet), allowable wattage, and
proposed electric lighting load demonstrating compliance with North Carolina
Energy Conservation Code, 2012 or latest edition.
      15.1.4.5   Supplemental information. Any additional information that will
help to inform the review and/or convey the intent such as topography plans,
landscape planting plans, artistic rendering, and the like is encouraged.
   15.1.5   Site lighting design requirements. Lighting shall be designed to
sufficient levels to allow for safe use of a site while accenting key
architectural elements and emphasizing landscape features. Light fixtures shall
be designed as an integral design element that complements the design of the
project. This can be accomplished through style, material, and/or color.
   The Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), a not-for-profit professional
organization of lighting practitioners has established recommended design
standards for various lighting applications which should be followed within the
context of other established town standards and customs. All lighting fixtures
designed or placed so as to illuminate any portion of a site shall meet the
following requirements.
      15.1.5.1   Light source (lamp).
      A.   Preferred electric light sources are fluorescent, metal halide, or
static white light emitting diodes (LED), with a correlated color temperature
between 4000-5000K.
      B.   Color corrected high-pressure sodium is also acceptable.
      C.   Filament sources (incandescent, halogen, xenon) sources are
discouraged due to the safety and aesthetic implications of these short-lived
sources which also have poor efficacy.
      D.   Non color-corrected high-pressure sodium and low-pressure sodium
lamps are expressly prohibited.
      E.   The same light source type must be used for the same or similar
types of lighting on any one site throughout any development.
      15.1.5.2    Luminaires (lighting fixtures).
      A.   The light source, or luminous area or aperture, of a luminaire shall
be completely shielded behind an opaque housing and/or otherwise directed so
that the light source is not visible from any street rights-of-way or adjoining
properties. Full cutoff classification is preferred for all pole-mounted area
lighting above 15 feet. Cutoff classification is preferred for pole-mounted
lighting below 15 feet. Semi- cutoff classification is not permitted.
      B.   Canopy lighting fixtures should be completely recessed within the
canopy. Similarly, in- grade luminaires shall be fully recessed into the
finished grade. Open-structure canopies shall be designed to shield lighting
equipment so the source is not visible from the roadway or adjacent property
lines.
      15.1.5.3   Fixture height. Lighting fixtures shall be a maximum of 40
feet in height within parking lots and shall be a maximum of 15 feet in height
within non-vehicular pedestrian areas. This is inclusive of a raised base where
provided. All light fixtures located within 50 feet of any residential use or
residential property boundary shall not exceed 15 feet in height.
   The UDO Administrator may allow fixtures above this height to provide
internal lighting for stadiums, arenas, and similar facilities. All outdoor
sports field and outdoor performance area lighting fixtures shall be equipped
with a glare control package (louvers, shields, or similar devices). The
fixtures must be aimed so that their concentrated beam spreads are directed and
fall within the primary playing or performance area. The hours of operation for
the lighting system for any game or event shall not exceed one hour after the
end of the event.
      15.1.5.4   Mounting. Refer to 15.1.6 for mounting restrictions as they
relate to illumination levels. All light poles shall be round aluminum and
rated for the total EPA of the attached luminaires at 100 mph winds with a 1.3
gust factor. Pole bases shall be installed with a concrete base. Base detailing
shall be reviewed and sealed by a structural engineer registered in the state
of North Carolina.
      15.1.5.5   Limit lighting to periods of activity. The use of sensor
technologies, timers, or other means to activate lighting during times when it
will be needed may be required by the UDO Administrator to conserve energy,
provide safety, and promote compatibility between different land uses.
      15.1.5.6   Architectural facade lighting. Architectural facade lighting
is required for all nonresidential or multi-family buildings fronting a right-
of-way. Refer to 15.15 for quantitative lighting criteria. Refer to North
Carolina Energy Conservation Code for maximum allowable wattage per LZ1 of this
non-tradeable surface illumination. Light fixtures shall be carefully selected,
located, aimed, and shielded so that light is directed only onto the building
facade. Fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets or properties.
To the extent practicable, fixtures shall be mounted on the building, shielded,
and directed downward to wash or graze the facade or roof with light.
Luminaires used to uplight architectural elements, such as eaves, shall be
adjustable and aimed to ensure concentrated beam falls fully on subject
surface.
   15.1.6   Design metrics.
      15.1.6.1   Light loss factors. All illumination levels are intended as
maintained, meaning that an appropriate light loss factor (LLF) must be applied
to calculations to ensure that the light levels will be reasonably maintained
over the life of the system. The most typical and recoverable light loss
factors are lamp-lumen depreciation (LLD) and luminaire dirt depreciation (LDD)
which must be considered. The LDD shall be considered to be 0.80 which assumes
a moderately dirty environment, enclosed/ventilated luminaires, and maximum 36-
month maintenance cycle. The LLD per source is as follows:
      A.   Metal halide: 0.70;
      B.   Color-corrected high-pressure sodium: 0.90;
      C.   Fluorescent: 0.95; and

1. Apply strategically to 10% of building face thus uniformity is not
applicable. The intent is to highlight architectural features and entrances
and maximize visual impact.
2. Temporary increases in illumination are permitted so long as the return
to normal illumination is automatic such as by motion sensor.
 
   15.1.7   Excessive illumination.
      A.   Lighting within any lot that unnecessarily illuminates and
substantially interferes with the use or enjoyment of any other property is
prohibited. Lighting unnecessarily illuminates another lot if it exceeds the
requirements of this section.
      B.   All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the
maximum illumination at the property line does not exceed the lesser of 0.5 fc
horizontal and 0.1 fc vertical or 10% of average illuminance for the site on
neighboring residential sites.
      C.   All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that
illuminance at the property line does not exceed the lesser of 1.0 fc
horizontal and 0.5 fc vertical or 50% of the average illuminance for the site
on neighboring commercial sites and public rights-of-way.
      D.   BUG ratings: Free-standing luminaires (bollards, pole-mounted, and
the like) shall be installed and oriented in accordance with the respective
photometric data and shall have a glare rating of not more than two. Uplight
ratings greater than one will be allowed only by special permission. The
backlight component shall be not more than two where located within one
mounting height of the property line.
      E.   Lighting mounted to structures located in proximity to roadways
shall be selected, oriented, and shielded as required to focus the concentrated
beam away from streets to avoid distraction or interference with the vision of
drivers on such streets.
      F.   Fixtures used to accent architectural features, landscaping, or art
shall be located, aimed, and/or shielded to eliminate light spilling onto
roadways, adjacent properties, or into the night sky.
      G.   Blinking or flashing lights shall be prohibited unless the lights
are required as a safety feature (e.g., beacons on towers) or shall be
permitted as part of a sign in accordance with Article 13, Signs.
   15.1.8   Nonconforming lighting. Lighting fixtures existing as of the date
of the adoption of this section, may remain, and shall be considered pre-
existing luminaires. Modifications, replacement, or expansions shall conform to
the standards of this ordinance. This does not apply to routine maintenance of
the fixtures.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 15.2 ROADWAY LIGHTING.
   15.2.1   Policy purpose. The purpose is to establish an official policy for
the town pertaining to the installation of street lights for the purposes of
traffic safety. This sets forth criteria for the installation of roadway
lighting within the town limits in addition to general site lighting
requirements of 15.1.1 which shall be applied where practicable.
   The specific intent for this is as follows:
      • Establish standards for the installation and maintenance of roadway
lighting;
      • Define illumination criteria specific to roadway lighting; and
      • Identify lighting equipment to be used within the town.
   15.2.2   Application. This Article, upon adoption, shall apply to all
rights-of-way (streets and roads) within the municipal limits of the town and
any rights-of-way (streets and roads) annexed in the future until such time
that this is altered, modified, or rescinded by the Town Council. Lighting in
annexed areas would be considered exempt upon the day of annexation.
   15.2.3   Standards.
      15.2.3.1   Lighting equipment.
      Decorative pole lights are provided in residential areas. Luminaires
shall be American Electric Lighting (AEL) “Revolution” (or similar) with post
fitting. Poles are round, straight, aluminum to provide a 12-foot mounting
height. Bases are direct buried or set with a concrete base installed with a
minimal setback from the street, not to exceed the exposed pole height.
      Utilitarian roadway lighting is provided in commercial areas. Luminaires
shall be as determined by the furnishing utility. Poles are sized with respect
to base to provide a 25-foot mounting height.
      Most all of town roadway lighting is 4000K metal halide. Residential
decorative luminaires are typically 100-150W. Roadway luminaires are typically
250-400W. All new installations shall be metal halide or solid state light
emitting diodes (LED). LED lighting is to be 4000-5000K, or the latest
technology in lighting available.
      15.2.3.2   Design criteria and locations.
      A.   The placement of street lighting fixtures in residential areas shall
be at 200- to 300-foot intervals and should be consistent with adjacent or
adjoining residential areas unless:
         1.   The roadway length is less than 300 feet, in which case a street
light will be provided near the midpoint of the street located intelligently
for best coverage of the roadway and minimal encroachment of lot;
         2.   Where the roadway length is less than 150 feet and a street light
is placed at the intersection and no natural features create a problem, no
street light will be placed along the segment; or
         3.   The vertical and horizontal street alignment or natural features
necessitate shorter spacing intervals.
      B.   The placement of street lighting shall be in accordance with the
latest revision of the Illuminating Engineering Society’s Recommended Practice
for Roadway Lighting (RP-8) as follows which uses Luminance (L, cd/m2) rather
than Illuminance (E, fc) to evaluate outdoor lighting. For collector roads such
as St. James Drive, a recommended 0.4-0.6 cd/m2 is recommended depending upon
activity levels with average/minimum ratios and maximum/minimum ratios of 3.5
and 6.0, respectively. For the majority of town roads which are local roads, a
recommended 0.3-0.5 cd/m2 is recommended depending upon activity levels with
average/minimum ratios and maximum/minimum ratios of 6.0 and 10.0,
respectively.
      C.   Intersections and Crosswalks: A street light shall be provided at
all street intersections and at least one luminaire per end of crosswalk. It is
not necessary to duplicate lighting equipment for these functions where they
occur in proximity. Multi-purposing of lighting equipment for roadways,
intersections, and crosswalks is recommended. Furthermore, luminaires at inters
should be placed to illuminate street signs when feasible.
 
Intersections and Crosswalk Illumination
Subject Area                           Eavg      Evert     AVG: MIN
Collector road/local road intersection 1.0 - 1.6 n/a       4:1
Local road/local road intersection     0.8 - 1.4 n/a       6:1
Crosswalks1                            n/a       2.0+      n/a
Other pedestrian conflict areas        0.4 - 0.5 0.1 - 0.2 4:1 (horz)
Notes:
1. Recommendation is given for mid-block crosswalks based on driver
visibility. Illumination at crosswalks in areas of greater ambient
illumination (such as at inters) should be increased.
 
      D.   Street light fixtures shall conform to the following.
         1.   All fixtures in residential areas shall be either 100-watt
(8,500-lumen) metal halide or LED luminaires with 5000-7000 lumens delivered
and Type V distribution on standard poles 12 feet in height. The fixture shall
be placed as close to the “neck” of cul-de-sacs as possible.
         2.   All fixtures along thoroughfares shall be no greater than 250-
watt (23,800-lumen) metal halide lamp or LED luminaires with 14,000-19,000
lumens delivered in full-cutoff luminaires on standard poles 25 feet in height.
Variations in mounting height with proper justification may be approved by the
Zoning Administrator.
         3.   Through the site plan and subdivision plan approval process, the
Town Council may approve street lighting which exceeds the standard town
requirements for residential streets so as to reduce the length of sag vertical
curves, provided the street lights are operational prior to the issuance of any
certificates of occupancy on such street. In any case, the minimum allowable
length of sag vertical curves shall be as follows: residential streets - 20 x
A; cul-de-sacs and loop roads - 15 x A, where A is the algebraic difference in
gradients.
      15.2.3.3   Installation. The Town Council hereby establishes the
following.
      A.   Street lighting facilities and street lights shall be provided by
the developer on any roadway, portion of roadway, or widening prior to the
town’s acceptance of that section for financial responsibility unless otherwise
approved by the TOSJ UDO Administrator.
      B.   The owner, developer, or subdivider of a site plan or subdivision
shall be required to provide street lighting, via underground distribution,
along all proposed streets and along all adjoining existing streets and
thoroughfares in accordance with this unless specifically approved otherwise by
the Town Council.
      C.   Underground service for light fixtures within the corporate limits
of the town is the responsibility of developer in conformance with the National
Electric Safety Code (NESC) and National Electrical Code (NEC) standards at the
developer’s expense.
      D.   The developer, property owners association, and/or the town’s Fire
Department shall be responsible for all installation costs and monthly
operating costs above what is accepted by policy of the Town Council associated
with the street lights.
      15.2.3.4   Modifications. The town partners with the local utility,
Brunswick Electric Membership Corporation (BEMC), for installation and
maintenance of street lighting per BEMC’s published monthly rates. Therefore, a
developer may request to use decorative or “private” street lighting within a
development provided:
      A.   Street light fixture types and locations must meet the minimum
criteria set forth in this Article and must be approved by the town. Luminaires
and poles that do not fit the character of the town will be rejected;
      B.   The developer and/or homeowners association shall be responsible for
all installation costs and monthly operating costs above what is accepted by
policy of the Town Council associated with the street lights;
      C.   Additional maintenance associated with cleaning and tree-pruning may
be required to retain consistency with the rest of the town. All costs related
to additional maintenance will be the responsibility of the property owners
association;
      D.   The developer and/or homeowners association shall be responsible for
any costs associated with deletion of the street lights and any costs
associated with installing the town’s standard streetlights; and
      E.   The developer shall include all responsibilities of the homeowners
association pertaining to the street lighting in the development covenants. The
developer shall inform all purchasers of property in the development of these
same responsibilities.
   Residents along a street may request the relocation of a street light,
provided that the proposed street light location meets town standards and the
relocation is approved by the TOSJ UDO Administrator. Residents may request
through the town a modification of an existing light fixture.
(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)
§ 15.3 ACCEPTANCE AND OCCUPANCY.
   Authorization for street light installations shall occur at such time as:
      A.   The developer requests the installation of street lights. The town
is billed for the lease once the lights are installed and operational, unless
upon approval of the UDO Administrator, the developer is allowed to continue
paying BEMC. The lights must be operational prior to the issuance of any
certificates of occupancy being issued;
      B.   Certificate of occupancy is issued in the immediate area of the
proposed street light location; or
      C.   Thoroughfare, marginal access street, or collector street is
constructed or widened as a part of development. Thoroughfares, marginal access
streets, and collector streets that are constructed or widened by the town
shall be lighted immediately after construction.

lumens does not numerically exceed 25 (2.5%) at an angle at or above 90 degrees
above nadir, and 100 (10%) at a vertical angle at or above 80 degrees above
nadir. This applies to all lateral angles around the luminaire.
   DIRECT LIGHT. Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or
reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire.
   FIXTURE. The assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include all or
some of the following parts: housing, mounting bracket or pole, socket, lamp
holder, ballast, reflector or mirror, and/or refractor or lens.
   FLOOD LIGHT or SPOTLIGHT. Any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a
reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam
in a particular direction with a wide or narrow beam. (These fixtures and lamp

   FULLY SHIELDED LIGHTS. Outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so
that no light rays are emitted by the installed fixture at angles above the
horizontal plane.
   GLARE. The sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that is
sufficiently greater than the luminance to with the eyes are adapted
(subjective brightness) causing annoyance, discomfort (discomfort glare), or
loss of visual performance and visibility (disability glare).
   IES. The Illuminating Engineering Society is the recognized technical
authority on illumination, a not-for-profit professional organization of
lighting practioners with the mission to improve the lighted environment by
bringing together those with lighting knowledge and by translating that
knowledge into actions that benefit the public.
   ILLUMINANCE (E). The amount of light (luminous flux) falling on a surface
located at a point and relative to a direction as expressed in lumens per unit
area, typically footcandles or lux.
   ILLUMINANCE, AVERAGE (EAVE). The average of a number of points of footcandle
calculations or footcandle readings in a given area. They could be initial or
maintained.
   ILLUMINANCE, AVERAGE MAINTAINED. The average of a number of points of
footcandle calculations or footcandle readings in a given area which have been

(LDD) and lamp lumen depreciation (LLD).
   ILLUMINANCE, AVERAGE TO MINIMUM. The ratio of average footcandle value to
the minimum footcandle value at a point per a calculation or reading for a

initial. This ratio is an indicator of lighting uniformity. The lower the ratio
the better the uniformity.
   ILLUMINANCE, INITIAL (EINI). Footcandles calculated with no adjustment for
dirt buildup in the fixture or lamp lumen depreciation. Initial footcandles
should be measured when a lighting system is new and after 100 hours of lamp
burn-in time. Car dealerships are often designed to initial footcandles.
   ILLUMINANCE, MAINTAINED. Footcandles that are calculated with an adjustment
for a maintenance factor to include dirt buildup in the luminaire (fixture) and
lamp output depreciation. The system is in effect over designed initially and

and spreading the light being distributed from the light source thereby
reducing direct glare.
   LAMP. The component of a luminaire that produces visible fight.
   LIGHT LOSS FACTOR (LLF). A factor used in a lighting calculation to
approximate changes in light output of the system that occur over a given
period of time that is an aggregate of multiple factors such as temperature and
voltage variations, dirt accumulation (luminaire dirt depreciation, LDD),
luminaire surface depreciation, or reduced lamp output as the source ages (lamp
lumen depreciation, LLD).
   LIGHT POLLUTION. The added sky brightness caused by the scattering of
electric light into the atmosphere, often referred to as sky glow.
   LIGHT SOURCE. The element of a lighting fixture that is the point of origin
of the lumens emitted by the fixture.
   LIGHT TRESPASS. The effect of light that strays from the intended purpose
and causes annoyance, loss of privacy, or loss of intended functionality or is
a determent to visual performance. A luminaire producing light beyond the
boundaries of the property on which it is located and intended is considered to
be LIGHT TRESPASS.
   LUMEN (lm). The SI unit of luminous flux total quantity of light emitted
from a light source. One footcandle is one lumen per square foot. For the
purpose of this ordinance, the lumen-output values shall be the initial lumen
output ratings of a lamp as listed in a lamp catalog.

with the parts designed to distribute the light, to position and protect the
lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply.
   LUMINANCE. The quantity of light reflected or emitted toward an observer;
what an observer sees whether reflected from an object or coming directly from
a source; commonly referred to as brightness. All surfaces have some reflecting
qualities and therefore have LUMINANCE, light surfaces being more reflective
than dark surfaces.
   LUX (lx). The SI unit of measurement of illuminance relative to square-
meters. 1 lx = 10.76 fc.
   MOUNTING HEIGHT OF LUMINAIRE. The vertical distance between the ground, or
other referenced task plane, and the center of the apparent light source of the
luminaire.
   NON-CUTOFF. A luminaire light distribution where there is no candela
limitation in the zone above maximum candela.
   OUTDOOR LIGHTING. The nighttime illumination of an outside area or object by
any human- made device located outdoors or indoors that produces light by any
means.
   OUTDOOR LIGHTING, TEMPORARY. The nighttime illumination of an outside area
or object by any human-made device located outdoors that produces light by any
means for a limited period of time. This period can be specified by the town.
   PRE-EXISTING LUMINARIES. Luminaries not conforming to this ordinance that
were in place at the time this ordinance was voted into effect.
   ROAD CLASSIFICATION, COLLECTOR. Roads servicing traffic between major and
local streets. These are streets used mainly for traffic movement within
residential, commercial, and industrial areas.
   ROAD CLASSIFICATION, LOCAL. Streets used primarily for direct access to
residential, commercial, industrial, or other abutting property.
   ROAD CLASSIFICATION, MAJOR. The part of a roadway system that serves as the
principal network for through-traffic flow connecting areas of principal
traffic generation and important rural roadways entering and leaving a city.
These roads are also referred to as “thoroughfares” or “preferentials”.
   ROADWAY LIGHTING. Lighting provided for freeways, expressways, limited
access roadways, and roads on which pedestrians, cyclists, and parked vehicles
are generally not present to help motorists remain on the road and detect
obstacles within and beyond the range of vehicle headlamps. (See also STREET
LIGHTING).
   SAG (VERTICAL) CURVE. A vertical curve that connects a segment of roadway
with a segment of roadway that has a more positive grade, (downhill to level,
downhill to uphill.)
   SEMI-CUTOFF. A luminaire light distribution where the candela per 1,000 lamp
lumens does not numerically exceed 50 (5.0%) at an angle at or above 90 degrees
above nadir, and 200 (20%) at a vertical angle at or above 80 degrees above
nadir. This applies to all lateral angles around the luminaire.
   STREET LIGHTING. Lighting provided for major, collector, and local roads
where pedestrians and cyclists are generally present to help motorists identify
obstacles, provide adequate visibility of pedestrians and cyclists, and assist
in visual search tasks both on and adjacent to the street.
   UNIFORMITY. A description of the smoothness of the lighting pattern or the
degree of intensity of light and dark areas in the roadway or area to be
lighted. UNIFORMITY is usually expressed as a ratio such as max to min or
average to min. The lower the ratio the more uniform the lighting design.
   UPLIGHT. The luminaire lumens distributed above a luminaire between 90 and
180 degrees vertical. Subdivisions are considered to be UL (low) from 90-100
degrees vertical; UH (high) from 100- 180 degrees vertical.
   VEILING LUMINANCE. A luminance superimposed on the retinal image which
reduces its contrast. It is this veiling effect produced by bright sources or
areas in the visual field that results in decreased visual performance and
visibility. An example of this is this would be with oncoming automobile
headlights.
   VEILING LUMINANCE RATIO. Ratio of the maximum veiling luminance of the light
fixture in question in the area that is being lighted to the average luminance
of the area being lighted. The higher the ratio the worse the disability glare
and the lower the visibility. IESNA-RP-8-00 recommended ratios are 0.3 (0.3 to
1) for expressways and major roadways and 0.4 (0.4 to 1) for collector and
local roads. (The determination of this ratio is a function of a combination of
the road width pole spacing, rated lamp lumens, mounting height, and the
classification or type of fixture [cutoff, semi-cutoff, or non-cutoff].
Problems occur most often with non-cutoff post mounted fixtures at low mounting
heights [less than 20 feet] with low to medium lumen packages. To meet the
ratio requirements, the spacing of poles may need to be as close as 25 or 30
feet staggered spacing with the use of 9,500 lumens in a non-cutoff post-
mounted acorn fixture. Wider spacing can be accomplished with cutoff type
distribution fixtures.)
   WALL PACK. A type of light fixture typically flush-mounted on a vertical
wall surface.
   WIDE-BODY REFRACTIVE GLOBE. A translucent lamp enclosure used with some
outdoor fixtures to provide a decorative look (including, but not limited to,
acorn- and carriage light-style fixtures). WIDE-BODY refers to a wider than
average size globe (greater than 15.75 inches in diameter). REFRACTIVE refers
to the redirection (bending) of the light as it goes through the lens,
rendering the light fixture more effective. WIDE-BODY REFRACTIVE GLOBES are
intended to soften and spread the light being distributed from the light source
thereby reducing direct glare.

standards set in the local subdivision control ordinance. These maps may
include a site plan, grading plan, utilities plan, drainage plan, planting plan
and a map indicating street profiles and grades. Often it is helpful to require

   PUBLIC HEARING. Types of public hearings. There are two types of public
hearings, legislative and quasi-judicial, and it is important to understand the
distinction between them.
      •   Legislative public hearings. The purpose of a legislative public
hearing is to obtain public input on legislative decisions on matters of
policy. Legislative public hearings are required by state law when a city or
county addresses such matters as comprehensive land use plans or the annual or
biennial budget. Legislative public hearings are generally less formal than
quasi-judicial public hearings. They do not involve the legal rights of
specific, private parties in a contested setting, but rather affect a wider
range of citizens or perhaps the entire jurisdiction. The wisdom of legislative
decisions reached as a result of such hearings is not second-guessed by the
courts; if challenged, they are reviewed only to determine if they are
constitutional or violate state law.
      •   Quasi-judicial evidentiary hearings, unlike legislative ones, involve
the legal rights of specific parties, and the decisions made as a result of
such hearings must be based upon and supported by the “record” developed at the
hearing. Quasi-judicial hearings are subject to stricter procedural
requirements than legislative hearings. Most quasi-judicial hearings held by
local government bodies involve land use matters, including site specific
rezones, appeals, variances, and special uses. In conducting such hearings, the
statutory procedures provided in G.S. § 160D-406 shall be explicitly complied
with.
Q
   QUARRY. An operation for the dredging, digging, extraction, mining, or
quarrying of stone, sand, gravel, or minerals for commercial purposes.
   QUASI-JUDICIAL DECISION. A decision involving the finding of facts regarding
a specific application of a development regulation and that requires the
exercise of discretion when applying the standards of the regulation. The term
includes, but is not limited to, decisions involving variances, special use
permits, and appeals of administrative determinations.
R
   RECREATION. An activity undertaken by a person or persons for pleasure or
relaxation rather than as work; for example: bicycle riding, swimming, golf,
tennis, or bowling.
   RECREATION FACILITY. A building, use, or facility where recreation programs

Comprehensive Ordinance List
Publisher's Note: The following table lists all ordinances passed by the City
of Saint James beginning in 2023. The table includes links to the ordinances
(as maintained in PDF format) and to the code sections affected (where
applicable). For other legislation, including ordinances passed prior to 2023,

ordinances are not incorporated into the text of the Code until the amending
ordinances are effective. Ordinances that do not affect the code have been
grayed out and are not available in a PDF format for viewing.
