council members shall reside in the district they represent. When any elected

electoral district that he was elected to represent, the office is ipso facto
vacant.
Section 160A-60 Qualifications for appointive office.
   Residence within a city shall not be a qualification for or prerequisite to
appointment to any city office not filled by election of the people, unless the
charter or an ordinance provides otherwise. City councils shall have authority
to fix qualifications for appointive offices, but shall have no authority to
waive qualifications for ap-pointive offices fixed by charters or general laws.

appointment of the city council for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the
number of vacancies on the council is such that a quorum of the council cannot
be obtained, the mayor shall appoint enough members to make up a quorum, and
the council shall then proceed to fill the remaining vacancies. If the number
of vacancies on the council is such that a quorum of the council cannot be
obtained and the office of mayor is vacant, the Governor may fill the vacancies
upon the request of any remaining member of the council, or upon the petition
of any five registered voters of the city. Vacancies in appointive offices
shall be filled by the same authority that makes the initial appointment. This
section shall not apply to vacancies in cities that have not held a city
election, levied any taxes, or engaged in any municipal functions for a period
of five years or more.
   In cities whose elections are conducted on a partisan basis, a person
appointed to fill a vacancy in an elective office shall be a member of the same
political party as the person whom he replaces if that person was elected as
the nominee of a political party.

office unless he agrees thereto. The mayor, councilmen, and other elected
officers are. entitled to reimbursement for actual expenses incurred in the
course of performing their official duties at rates not in excess of those
allowed to other city officers and employees, or to a fixed allowance, the
amount of which shall be established by the council, for travel and other
personal expenses of office; provided, any fixed allowance so established
during a term of office shall not be increased during such term of office.
   (b)   All charter provisions in effect as of January 1, 1972, fixing the
compensation or allowances of any city officer or employee are repealed, but

consideration of his own financial interest or official conduct. In all other
cases, a failure to vote by a member who is physically present in the council
chamber, or who has withdrawn without being excused by a majority vote of the
remaining members present, shall be recorded as an affirmative vote. The
question of the compensation and allowances of members of the council is not a
matter involvinga member's own financial interest or official conduct.

not excused from voting on the question in issue (including the mayor's vote in
case of an equal division) shall be required to adopt an ordinance, take any
action having the effect of an ordinance, authorize or commit the expenditure
of public funds, or make, ratify, or authorize any contract on behalf of the
city. In addition, no ordinance nor any action having the effect of any
ordinance may be finally adopted on the date on which it is introduced except

of the council (not including the mayor unless he has the right to vote on all
questions before the council.)

and for that purpose may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, and compel the
production of evidence.

order requiring that its order be obeyed, and that court shall have
jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all proper parties. No
testimony of any witness before the council pursuant to a subpoena issued in
exercise of the power conferred by this section may be used against him on the
trial of any civil or criminal action other than a prosecution for false
swearing committed on the examination. If any person, while under oath at an
investigation by the council, willfully swears falsely, he is guilty of a
misdemeanor.

than 5,000.

ARTICLE A
Improvement of Public Streets
Sec. 4-1-1   Petition for street improvements.
    The city council will consider the improvement of any street where petition
for the improvements has been submitted to the city council on forms provided
by the city, signed by the property owners of 75% of the front footage of the
improvement to be considered.
Sec. 4-1-2   Street improvements defined; costs.
   (a)   For purposes of this article, "street improvements" shall include the
following:
   (1)   Curb and gutter as required by city specifications, normally improved
on only two (2) sides of the street at a time.
   (2)   Storm sewer drainage facilities, inlets and other incidentals as may
be required under street per N.C.D.O.T. standards, if necessary.
   (3)   Engineering cost.
   (4)   Grading to the necessary width.
   (5)   Base course material (stone or asphalt base) for the full width of the
street to be improved shall be according to city specifications.
   (6)   Street finish surface over base course shall be according to city
specifications.
   (7)   Driveway entrance, if necessary.
   (8)   Sidewalk improvements.
   (b)   The total paved width of any given street shall be governed by
location, usage, traffic count and city council action.
Sec. 4-1-3   Street assessment policy.
   (a)   It is hereby declared the policy of the city council that the city
will pay 50% of the cost of the improvements. The remaining 50% of the cost
shall be assessed to the abutting property owners prorated on a front foot
basis.
   (b)   The owners of assessed property shall have the option, within 30 days
after the publication of the notice that the assessment roll has been
confirmed, of paying the assessment either in cash or in not more than ten
annual installments, as may have been determined by the council in the
resolution directing the project giving rise to the assessment to be
undertaken. With respect to payment by installment, the council may provide:
   (1)   That the first installment with interest shall become due and payable
on the date when property taxes are due and payable, and one subsequent
installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same date in each
successive year until the assessment is paid in full; or
   (2)   That the first installment with interest shall become due and payable
60 days after the date that the assessment roll is confirmed, and one
subsequent installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of
the month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full.
   (c)   (1)   Any portion of an assessment that is not paid within 30 days
after publication of the notice that the assessment roll has been confirmed
shall bear interest until paid at a rate to be fixed in the assessment
resolution but not more than 8% per annum.
   (2)   If any installment of an assessment is not paid on or before the due
date, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately become due and
payable, unless the council waives acceleration. The council may waive
acceleration and permit the property owner to pay all installments in arrears
together with interest due thereon and the cost to the city of attempting to
obtain payment. If this is done, the remaining installments shall be reinstated
so that they fall due as if there had been no default. Waiver of acceleration
and reinstatement of future installments may be done at any time before
foreclosure proceedings have been instituted.
    (3)   Assessment liens may be foreclosed under any procedure prescribed by
law for the foreclosure of property tax liens, except that lien sales and lien
sale certificates shall not be required, and foreclosure may be begun at any
time after 30 days after the due date. The city shall not be entitled to a
deficiency judgment in an action to foreclose an assessment lien. The lien of
special assessments shall be inferior to all prior and subsequent liens for
state, local, and federal taxes, and superior to all other liens.
   (d)   Priorities as to the construction of street improvements will be
determined by the city council on a petition by petition basis, with
consideration given to the availability of funds, the projected work schedule,
and the value of the proposed improvement with respect to vehicular safety,
drainage control, and aesthetic value. (Ord. of 7/8/85, No. 74-85)
Sec. 4-1-4   Street improvement procedures.
   Upon receipt of a petition for street improvements, the city clerk shall
examine the petition and certify its sufficiency to the city council. No
petition shall be considered for street improvements where streets have been
opened after the effective date of the subdivision chapter if it is in
violation of the subdivision chapter or any other ordinance. No petition shall
be considered for a street less than 80 percent of a normal block. (Ord. of 11/
1/76, Sec. 4)
Sec. 4-1-5   Utilities installation.
    The council, prior to approving any street file improvement project, shall
determine if water and sanitary sewer or other necessary facilities have been
installed within that portion of the street located between curbs. In the event
such facilities have not been installed, or if facilities are inadequate and
will have to be replaced, the council may postpone the street improvements,
pending installation of the facilities. (Ord. of 11/1/76, Sec. 6)
Sec. 4-1-6   Responsibility of property owners.
   (a)   Property owners along streets which are surfaced and have curb and
gutter are responsible for replacing any driveway or walkway within the street
right-of-way as a result of building lot improvements. Driveway entrances and
aprons at the curb line will be constructed by the city at the location
designated by the propcity owners, and the cost thereof shall be paid in
advance.
   (b)   No trees may be planted in the street right-of-way, unless it conforms
to a city beautification plan.
   (c)   Old pipes and other materials on the right-of-way at the time of
construction, which were purchased by the property owners, will be re-moved and
placed on the lot of the owner for his disposition. The city will haul away
such items if requested by the owner.
   (d)   During the construction, it may be neces-sary to remove all trees and
shrubs that stand in the area of construction. Any trees or shrubs that the
property owner wishes to transplant shall be removed from this area by the
property owner before construction begins.
Sec. 4-1-7   Specifications.
   All street improvements shall be constructed in accordance with
specifications of the city and the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
All work shall be supervised by the appropriate city personnel.
(Ord. of 11/1/76, Sec. 8; Ord. of 11/7/16, No. 10-16)
Sec. 4-1-8   Opening and improving streets without petition.
   (a)   When, in the opinion of the council, a new street should be opened or
improved and no petition is filed asking for a prorated share of costs, and
when the council is of the opinion that the public benefit will be greater than
the benefit to abutting property owners, the council may direct that such
improvements be made and the cost paid by the city.
   (b)   This policy shall also be used for sidewalk improvements or
construction.
   (c)   The improvements shall conform to the construction standards adopted
by the council and kept on file in the office of the clerk.
(Ord. of 11/1/76, Sec. 9)
Sec. 4-1-9   Resurfacing improvements.
   Whenever it is necessary to resurface any street which has been surfaced
under this policy as herein established, the city will do such resurfacing when
funds are appropriated, and the city will pay the entire cost forsuch work.
(Ord. of 11/1/76, Sec. 10)

Sec. 5-1-67   Fats, oils, and grease program.
   In an effort to avoid sewer overflows caused by fats, oils and grease (FOG)
blockages in the city’s wastewater collection system that lead to public health
concerns and environmental degradation, the City of Claremont is required by
the North Carolina Division of Water Quality to develop, implement and
administer a FOG Control Program. The overall goal of the program is to form a
collaborative relationship between the City of Claremont’s Public Works
Department staff and local commercial and institutional food service
establishments (FSEs) to ensure protection of the sewer system, public health
and local water quality through implementation of appropriate and appropriately
sized FOG control devices. The city’s FOG Program will be evaluated
periodically and may be modified as necessary to maximize the effectiveness of
the FOG Program.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.1   Existing food service establishments.
   If required by the city, existing food service establishments (FSEs) shall
install an appropriately sized grease interceptor within 180 days after written
notification. Factors to be taken into consideration for interceptor sizing
include volume of wastewater discharge, types of cooking appliances, number and
size of dishwashing facilities, types of foods being prepared, number of dining
room seats, hours of operation and business location. FSEs with existing grease
interceptors will not be required to install new devices unless the city deems
the existing interceptor to be inadequately sized or insufficient.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.2   New food service establishments.
   All new FSEs (after the effective date of this FOG Program) shall be
required to install an external grease interceptor of appropriate size. No FSEs
shall begin operations until the grease interceptor is approved and inspected
by the city. Factors to be taken into consideration for interceptor sizing
include volume of wastewater discharge, types of cooking appliances, number and
size of dishwashing facilities, types of foods being prepared, number of dining
room seats, hours of operation and business location.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.3   Grease interceptor sizing criteria.
   (a)   Grease interceptors shall be designed to provide a minimum of 24
minutes of hydraulic retention time at peak wastewater flow from the facility.
The peak wastewater flow shall be calculated using the Manning Formula which
takes into account depth of flow in the pipe, slope of pipe, pipe diameter and
pipe roughness. The Manning’s equation to calculate the wastewater flowrate for
a pipe flowing full under a non-pressurized condition is:
   Qfull = [(s)/n] x (D/16)8/3
where:
   Qfull   =   full channel wastewater flowrate, cfs
   s   =   pipe slope, ft/ft
   n   =   pipe roughness coefficient, unitless = 0.012
   D   =   pipe diameter, inches
   (b)   The adjusted wastewater flowrate for a pipe flowing partially full
shall be calculated based upon the flow depth ratio in the pipe using:
   Qadj = Qfull x Q/Qfull
where:
   Qadj   =   adjusted wastewater flowrate, cfs
   Qfull   =   full channel wastewater flowrate, cfs
   Q/Qfull   =   flow ratio based on depth ratio in pipe, unitless
   (c)   To calculate the minimum grease interceptor volume with 24 minutes
hydraulic retention, use the following equation;
   V = Qadj x 60 sec/min x 24 minutes x 7.48 gal/cu.ft.
where:
   V   =   grease interceptor volume, gallons
   Qadj   =   wastewater flowrate, cfs
   (d)   The minimum grease interceptor size that shall be acceptable is 750
gallons. The maximum grease interceptor size shall be 1,500 gallons. If a
larger volume tank is required to meet the minimum hydraulic retention time,
multiple 1,500 gallon interceptors shall be constructed and plumbed in series.
   (e)   Only in specific ‘hardship’ cases will a FSE be permitted by the city
to install an under-the-sink or in-floor, automatic or manual, grease trap. In
addition to the sizing factors described above, additional factors to be taken
into consideration by the city shall include building space constraints, site
elevation constraints, and location of the city’s sewer main.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.4   Grease interceptor standards of construction.
   The following standards of construction are applicable to new external, in-
ground grease interceptors, Please refer to the drawing for reference:
   (a)   All grease interceptor design plans shall be approved by the city
prior to construction.
   (b)   Wastewater from sanitary facilities (bathrooms, non-kitchen sinks)
shall not be introduced into any grease interceptor.
   (c)   All dishwater drain lines or floor drains shall have permanently fixed
screens with maximum 1/4 inch openings to prevent pass through of large solids
into the grease interceptor.
   (d)   An inlet tee should be constructed to disperse influent wastewater in
the first chamber to avoid hydraulic short-circuiting and disrupting the grease
separation process. The inlet tee should extend 12 to 16 inches below the
static water level.
   (e)   A baffle wall with two (2) 6-inch baffle wall tees shall be placed
approximately 2/3rds of the length of the grease interceptor to create a first
chamber for solids settling and grease flotation, and a second chamber for
wastewater discharge and sampling. The baffle wall shall be connected to the
bottom of the tank and allow an air gap at the top of the tank. The 2 baffle
tees shall not extend greater than 30% below the static water level in the
first chamber.
   (f)   A minimum 6-inch outlet tee should be constructed extending no greater
than 50% below the static water level. The outlet tee should allow for a dip-
and-grab sample to be taken for laboratory analysis. The elevation differential
between the inlet and outlet tees shall be 2 inches.
   (g)   The top slab of the grease interceptor shall have minimum 24" access
openings installed at grade to allow access to the grease interceptor’s inlet
tee and outlet tee. If placed in a driveway, parking lot or other traffic area,
the entire grease interceptor shall be highway (H-20 load) rated.
   (h)   All grease interceptor joints shall be properly sealed using mastic,
butyl rubber or other pliable sealant that is waterproof, corrosion-resistant
and approved for use in septic tanks.
   (i)   In addition to the grease interceptor, a separate ‘sample vault’ may
also be constructed for more accurate effluent monitoring if preferred by the
FSE.
   (j)   A licensed North Carolina plumbing contractor shall install the grease
interceptor in compliance with the latest edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code.
   (k)   Approved internal under-the-sink or in-flbor grease traps shall be
sized to maximize hydraulic retention time and grease storage. These units
shall be installed by a licensed North Carolina plumbing contractor.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.5   Operation and maintenance responsibilities.
   FSEs shall be solely responsible for operating the grease interceptor or
trap within the operational capabilities for which it was designed.
   (a)   FSEs shall develop and implement best management practices (BMPs) to
minimize FOG discharges. FSEs shall be responsible for posting appropriate
signage and educating its employees in the proper disposal of food wastes and
dishwashing techniques. Written records shall be maintained by the FSE for
disposal of cooking oil, grease interceptor maintenance and any repairs.
Records shall be maintained for a minimum of 2 years by the FSE and document
the date of service, name of service provider, volume of waste removed and
other pertinent information. These records shall remain on the FSE premises and
be available for inspection by the city’s staff during normal business hours.
   (b)   Should new sinks or dishwashing units be installed, or existing units
replaced with new units of different capacities, which affect the volume of
wastewater being discharged to the city’s sewer system, it shall be the
responsibility of the FSE to notify the City of Claremont’s Public Works
Department in writing a minimum of 30 days prior to installing such new
facilities. The City of Claremont will evaluate whether the existing grease
interceptor is appropriately-sized to handle the additional flow. Operational
adjustments proposed by the FSE may also be considered by the city in lieu of
increased interceptor size.
   (c)   When settled solids in the grease interceptor’s first chamber
accumulate to 20% (l/5th) of the depth of the chamber or 60 days lapses between
cleanouts, whichever occurs first, the FSE shall be required to cleanout the
chamber by contracting a pump-and-haul service. Under-the-sink grease traps
shall be cleaned out weekly, or more frequently if needed, by the FSE.
   (d)   No solids greater than 1/2-inch shall be discharged into the grease
interceptor at any time. Grease interceptors shall be kept free from rocks,
grit, gravel, sand, shells, utensils, cigarettes, rags, and the like which may
reduce the effective treatment volume of the interceptor.
   (e)   The city may randomly schedule sampling of the wastewater exiting the
grease interceptor a minimum of one (1) time annually using a North Carolina
certified laboratory and report the results to the FSE. The laboratory shall
use USEPA Method 413.1 in analyzing the sample for FOG. The purpose of FOG
sampling shall be for data analysis to assist with the city’s scheduling of
downstream maintenance. The city does not intend to impose numerical FOG limits
on the wastewater discharge from individual FSEs, unless the city is
experiencing recurring FOG problems in the collection system downstream of the
FOG-producing discharge points and determines that numerical limits should be
assigned.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.6   Prohibitions.
   (a)   The use of hot water to ‘flush’ the grease interceptor is strictly
prohibited.
   (b)   The use of enzymes, chemical or biological additives is not considered
an acceptable grease interceptor maintenance practice.
   (c)   Disposal of fryer oil to the city’s sewer system or storm water system
is specifically prohibited.
   (d)   Wastes removed from the grease interceptors shall not be discharged
into the city’s sewer system or storm water system. All removed materials shall
be disposed of in accordance with federal, state and local statutes, policies
and ordinances.
   (e)   The practice of re-introducing wastewater pumped from grease
interceptors back into an interceptor is strictly prohibited. Interceptors must
be serviced and emptied of the waste content.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.7   Costs responsibility.
   FSEs shall be solely responsible for any and all costs related to the
construction, operation, maintenance, wastewater discharge samples taken by the
city or FSE, and any adjustments or repairs to the grease interceptors.if any
repairs are discovered by the city’s staff during facility inspection, the FSE
shall have 45 days from the time of first written notice by the city to make
necessary operational adjustments or repairs. It shall be the FSE’s
responsibility to notify the city in writing when adjustments or repairs have
been completed.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.8   Variance.
   A variance may be requested by the FSE of a design and/or maintenance
requirement if sufficient documentation and justification is submitted by the
FSE in writing to the city clearly explaining the need for a variance. The city
will notify the FSE in writing of the acceptance or denial of the variance
request. The city reserves the right to revoke an issued variance when deemed
necessary.A variance granted to a FSE by the city is not transferable and shall
become null and void upon transfer of building lessee or property ownership.
The new lessee or property owner shall be required to install a grease
interceptor in accordance with the provisions for new FSEs or request a new
variance from the city in accordance with the procedures set forth above.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.9   Inspections.
   Grease interceptors shall be inspected a minimum of once per month by the
FSE. FSEs shall allow city staff access at all reasonable times to all parts of
the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling and records examination.

necessary to conduct inspection, sampling and compliance monitoring. The city
will coordinate with the FSE to minimize business disruptions.
(Ord. of 11/7/11, No. 07-11)
Sec. 5-1-67.10   FOG Enforcement.
   (a)   If a grease interceptor fails an inspection, the City Inspector shall
notify the FSE or owner that maintenance must be performed in the interceptor
within a specified time frame but no more than 10 calendar days. The inspector
shall return to re-inspect to ensure compliance. If the interceptor fails re-
inspection, a notice of violation shall be issued and maintenance shall be
performed immediately.
   (b)   Any grease interceptor which receives three (3) notices of violations
within a 24-month period shall be deemed a nuisance by the City Manager and
shall require corrective actions as determined by the City Manager to cure the
nuisance, including, if deemed necessary termination of all discharges to the
City of Claremont collections system and tennination of water services.
   (c)   If any user is determined to be the source in whole or in part of a
sanitary sewer blockage and or overflow, the user will be assessed a fine of
not less than $500, plus remediation costs for the cleanup, in addition to any
fines dispensed from the State of North Carolina. The fines contained herein
are not exclusive and the City Manager may use other methods to remedy the
situation.

Sec. 5-1-86   Water service charges.
   The charges for water service shall be as established by the council. A copy
of current charges shall be kept on file at all times in the office of the
clerk. (Ord. of 4/5/77, Div. IV, Art. 1, revised)
Sec. 5-1-87   Sewer service charges.
   The charges for sewer service shall be as established by the council, and
shall be billed and collected with charges for water service. A copy of current
charges shall be kept on file at all times in the office of the clerk. (Ord. of
4/5/77, Div. IV, Art. 1)
Sec. 5-1-87.1    201 sewer service charges.
   The sewer service charges shall be computed on the following basis after the
“201" project operation begins. Until such time, existing rate methodology will
prevail:
   (1)   User charge:
   a.   As a result of P.L. 92-500, the City of Claremont is required to
develop user charges whereby each user (or class of users) will pay his
proportionate share of operation and maintenance costs.
   b.   The city council shall adopt at least bi-annually an adequate schedule
of user charges to defray the cost of operating and maintaining the city’s
sewerage system. The costs to be used as a basis for determining the charges
shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, operation and maintenance,
administration, collection and billing of charges, bond redemption, studies and
reports, professional fees, repairs, capital improvements, depreciation and
extraneous flow.
   c.   The user charges shall be published on a form for public distribution
and notice and shall become part of this section upon adoption and public
notification.
   d.   Each user shall be notified at least annually in conjunction with their
regular bill of the rate for the user charge which is attributable to the
wastewater treatment service.
   e.   The user charge system shall take precedence over any terms or
conditions of agreements or contract which are inconsistent with the
requirements of Section 204(B)(1)(a) of the Clean Water Act.
   (2)   Surcharge: The City Manager or his appointed designee may allow users
to discharge industrial waters or wastes in which the suspended solids exceed
250 parts per million by weight and industrial waters or wastes in which the
B.O.D. exceeds 250 parts per million by weight provided that the user
discharging such water or waste shall agree to the payment of a surcharge to
offset the entire cost incurred in treating the excess suspended solids or
B.O.D. This surcharge shall be imposed in addition to any other charges made
for sewer service.
   (3)   Industrial cost recovery (ICR) charge: The Clean Water Act of 1977
exempts industrial users with discharges of less than 25,000 gallons per day of
sanitary sewage equivalence from ICR charges. Based upon an analysis of the
wastewater discharge history of existing customers, few industries would be
subject to ICR charges at this time. However, each industry’s discharge volume
and strength must be analyzed at least annually to determine whether an ICR
charge will be required. The industrial cost recovery charges shall be
published annually on a form for public distribution and notice and shall
become part of this section upon ratification by city council and public
notification.
   (4)   Basis for charges:
   a.   Residential users: All residential users will pay a fixed fee plus a
user charge based upon 100 percent of their water usage as obtained from the
water meter readings.
   b.   Industrial and commercial users: All industrial and commercial users
will pay the following fees and charges based upon 100 percent of their water
usage as obtained from the water meter readings:
   1.   fixed fee resulting from the administration, capital recovery and debt
service of sewerage system;
   2.   user charges resulting from the operation and maintenance of sewerage
system;
   3.   surcharges resulting from additional costs incurred in treating wastes
containing 5-day BOD, suspended solids, and ammonia-nitrogen in excess of
allowable limits;
   4.   fees resulting from the monitoring, sampling and analysis of industrial
or commercial wastewater; and
   5.   industrial cost recovery charges.
   Measurements and spot check of flow rates, flow volumes, BOD5, and suspended
solids for use in determining the above described charges shall be made by the
city on all industrial and commercial wastewaters, unless specifically relieved
of such obligation by the supervisor. The charges shall be based on the usage
during the previous month. In case of a violation, the user shall be billed for
the violations for the period of time for which the violation occurs as

Statutes of the State of North Carolina, and shall be charged for water and
sewer service provided in accordance with the rates established pursuant to
Article D of this chapter.
   (b)   The city council shall consider the adoption of a preliminary
assessment resolution setting forth the intentions of the City of Claremont
with regard to the project, a general description of the nature and location of
the project, a statement of the proposed basis for making assessments, which
shall include a general description of the boundaries of the area benefitted if
the basis of assessment is either area or value added, a statement as to the
percentage of the cost of the work that is to be assessed, a statement as to
which, if any, assessments shall be held in abeyance and for how long, a
statement of the proposed terms of payment of the assessment, and an order
setting a time and place for a public hearing on all matters covered by the

   (1)   At least ten (10) days before the date set for the public hearing,
copies of the preliminary assessment resolution shall be mailed by first class
mail to the owners of all real property, as shown on the county tax records,
subject to assessment because of the proposed extension of the water or sewer
systems. The city clerk shall be responsible for mailing the preliminary
assessment resolution to the subject property owners, and shall file with the
city council a certificate showing that a copy of the preliminary assessment
was mailed by first class mail to the real property owners subject to the
proposed assessment and the date of mailing. A notice that a preliminary
assessment resolution has been adopted and of the public hearing shall also be
published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten (10) days before
the date set for the public hearing. The notice shall generally describe the
nature and location of the improvement.
   (2)   At the public hearing, the city council shall consider all comments
relative to the proposed extension of the water or sewer systems. The city
council may then adopt a resolution authorizing the extension and the proposed
methods of assessment and payment if the extensions are to be undertaken. Any
assessment resolution shall describe the project in general terms (which may be
by reference to projects described in the preliminary resolution) and shall set
forth the following:
   (i)   The basis on which the special assessment shall be levied, together
with a general description of the boundaries of the area benefitted if the
basis of assessment is either area or value added;
   (ii)   The percentage of the cost to be specially assessed; and
   (iii)   The terms of payment, including the conditions under which
assessments are to be held in abeyance, if any.
   The percentage of cost to be assessed may not be different from the
percentage proposed, and the projects authorized may not be greater in scope
than the projects described in the preliminary resolution.
   (c)   Upon completion of the water and/or sewer systems extension, the city
council shall adopt a resolution declaring the costs of improvements, ordering
the preparation of the preliminary assessment roll and calling for a public
hearing thereon. The preliminary assessment roll shall contain a brief
description of each lot, parcel, or tract of land assessed, the basis for the
assessment, the amount assessed against each, the terms of payment, including
any proposed abeyance of assessment pursuant to North Carolina General Statute
160A-237 or any schedule of discounts authorized pursuant to North Carolina
General Statute 160A-226.1, and the name of the owner of each parcel of land as
far as can be ascertained from the county tax records. A map of the project on
which is shown each parcel assessed, with the basis of its assessment, the
amount assessed against it, and the name of the owner, as far as can be
ascertained from the county records, shall be a sufficient assessment roll. The
preliminary assessment roll shall be filed in the city clerk’s office upon
completion and shall be available for public inspection.

preliminary assessment roll. A copy of a notice of hearing on the preliminary
assessment roll shall be mailed by first class mail to the owners of property
listed thereon; such notice shall give notice of the time and place of the
hearing, and shall state the amount of assessment against the property of the
owner to whom notice is mailed as shown on the preliminary assessment roll.

city clerk’s office. The city clerk shall be responsible for mailing these
notices to the affected property owners and certifying to the city council that
the notices were mailed by first class mail to the real property owners subject
to the proposed assessment and the date of mailing.
   (3)   At the public hearing, the city council shall consider all comments
from all interested persons who appear at the hearing relative to the water and
sewer systems extension project conducted under this article. The city council
may then or thereafter adopt a resolution levying the assessments for the water
or sewer system extensions. The resolution levying assessments may modify or
confirm the assessments, in whole or in part, by confirming the preliminary
assessments against any and all lots or parcels described in the preliminary
assessment roll, or by canceling, increasing or reducing them as may be proper
in compliance with the basis of the assessment; the assessment resolution shall
list any assessments as are to be held in abeyance under the provisions of
subsection (6) hereunder. If any property was omitted from the preliminary
assessment roll, the council may place it on the roll and levy the proper
assessment. Whenever the council confirms the assessment for any project under
this section, the city clerk shall enter in the minutes the date, hour and
minute of confirmation. From and after the time of confirmation, the assessment
shall be a lien on the property assessed of the same nature and to the same
extent as the lien for county and city property taxes, according to the
priorities set out in North Carolina General Statute 160A-233(c). After the
assessment roll is confirmed, a copy of it shall be delivered to the county tax
collector for collection in the same manner as property taxes, except as
otherwise may be provided in this article The public hearing and all council
action in confirming an assessment shall be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of North Carolina General Statute 160A-228.
   (4)   As part of its resolution levying an assessment under this section,
the city council may establish a schedule of discounts to be applied to
assessments paid before the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date that
the notice is published of confirmation of the assessment roll pursuant to
subsection (5) below. Such a schedule of discounts may be established even
though it was not included among the terms of payment as specified in the
preliminary assessment resolution. The amount of discount shall not exceed 30%
of the assessment.
   (5)   Notice of confirmation and levy of assessment shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation after the expiration of twenty (20) days from
the confirmation of the assessment roll. The notice shall state that
assessments may be paid without interest at any time before the expiration of
thirty (30) days from the date the notice is published, and if they are not
paid, all installments shall bear interest as provided in section
5-1-103. The notice shall also state the schedule of discounts, if one (1) has
been established, to be applied to assessments paid before the expiration date
for payments of assessments without interest.
   (6)   An assessment resolution adopted hereunder may provide that
assessments levied under this section for water or sewer improvements may be
held in abeyance without interest until improvements on the assessed property
are actually connected to the water or sewer system for which the assessment
was levied, or a date certain not more than ten (10) years from the date of
confirmation of the assessment roll, whichever event first occurs. If such an
assessment is to be held in abeyance, the assessment resolution shall classify
the property assessed according to general land use, location with respect to
the water or sewer system, or other relevant factors, and shall provide that
the period of abeyance shall be the same for all assessed property in the same
class. Illustrative classifications are:
   (a)   Properties which have no improvements to which the water system might
be connected;
   (b)   Properties currently served by an approved well (in case of water
extension);
   (c)   Properties currently served by an approved septic tank or other on-
site disposal system (in case of sewer extension); and
   (d)   Properties in agricultural use. Upon termination of the period of
abeyance, the assessment shall be paid in accordance with the terms set out in
the assessment resolution.

Sec. 5-1-103   Payment of assessments.
   (a)   If the water and sewer assessment has not been paid in advance, the

confirmed, of paying the assessment either in cash or in not more than ten (10)
annual installments, as provided by the city council in the resolution
directing the project be undertaken. With respect to payment by installment,
the resolution by the city council may provide:
   (1)   that the first installment with interest shall become due and payable
on the date when property taxes are due and payable, and one subsequent
installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same date in each
successive year until the assessment is paid in full; or
   (2)   that the first installment with interest shall become due and payable
sixty (60) days after the date the assessment roll is confirmed, and one
subsequent installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of

shall bear interest until paid at a rate to be fixed in the assessment
resolution, but not more than 8% per annum; an assessment held in abeyance
shall bear interest at said rate beginning with the date of connection or the
date certain set in accordance with section
5-1-102(6), whichever first occurs.
   (c)   If any installment of an assessment is not paid on or before the due
date, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately become due and
payable, unless the city council waives acceleration. The city council may
waive acceleration and permit the property owner to pay all installments in
arrears together with interest due thereon and the cost to the city of
attempting to obtain payment. If this is done, the remaining installments shall
be reinstated so that they fall due as if there has been no default. Waiver of
acceleration and reinstatement of future installments may be done at any time
before foreclosure proceedings have been instituted.
   (d)   Assessment liens may be foreclosed under any procedure prescribed by
law for the foreclosure of property tax liens, except that lien sales and lien
sale certificates shall not be required, and foreclosure may be begun at any
time after thirty (30) days after the due date. The city shall not be entitled
to a deficiency judgment in an action to foreclose an assessment lien. The lien
of special assessments shall be inferior to all prior and subsequent liens for
state, local and federal taxes, and superior to all other liens. (Ord. of 1/4/

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
Sec. 5-2-60   Monitoring Facilities.
   The city requires the user to provide and operate at the user’s own expense,
monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of
the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility
should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the city may, when such
a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the
facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so
that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the city.
(Ord. of 6/6/94, No. 223-94)
Sec. 5-2-61   Inspection and Sampling.
   The city will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city, approval authority and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval
authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user’s property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city,
approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the City
Manager, approval authority’s, or EPA’s access to the user’s premises shall be
a violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of
access.
(Ord. of 6/6/94, No. 223-94)
Sec. 5-2-62   Search Warrants.
   If the City Manager, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a
building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or the protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the City
Manager, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from
the appropriate Court.
(Ord. of 6/6/94, No. 223-94)
ARTICLE G
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless
the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the City Manager that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the user. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data.
   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, Non- discharge
permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions
of a report shall be available for use by the State or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
   All records relating to compliance with Pretreatment Standards shall be made
available to officials of the approval authority and EPA upon request.

ENFORCEMENT
Sec. 5-2-81   Administrative Remedies.
   (a)   Notification of Violation. Whenever the City Manager finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, wastewater permit,
or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other
pretreatment requirement the City Manager may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the
date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user.
Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (b)   Consent Orders. The City Manager is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to section
5-2-81(d), below.
   (c)   Show Cause Hearing.
   The City Manager may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible
for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this chapter or is in noncompliance
with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. In the event the City Manager determines that a
show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on
any agent or officer of a corporation.
   The City Manager shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and
determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the
assessment of a civil penalty under section
5-2-82 nor is any action or inaction taken by the City Manager under this
section subject to an administrative appeal under section
5-2-31(i).
   (d)   Administrative Orders. When the City Manager finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter, permits or orders
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the City Manager may
issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons
in noncompliance to do any of the following:
   (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
   (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
order;
   (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation;

related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (e)   Emergency Suspensions.
   The City Manager may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or
wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or Non-discharge permit.
   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or
the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A
hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension to determine
whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s waste discharge permit
terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the City Manager shall take steps as deemed necessary including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The City Manager shall
reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof
of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall
submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the
City Manager prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (f)   Termination of Permit. Any user who violates the following conditions
of this chapter, or applicable State and Federal regulations, is subject to
having its permit terminated:
   (1)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his discharge;
   (2)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
constituents and characteristics;
   (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring; or,
   (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination
of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause
under section
5-2-81 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken.

against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section
5-2-11(a) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in sections
5-2-11(b) (2), (3) and (5) through (7) of this chapter if it can prove that it
did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or
interference and that either:
   (a)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (b)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. of 6/6/94, No. 223-94)
Sec. 5-2-103   Bypass.
   (a)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of paragraphs [(b)] and [(c)] of this section.
   (b)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the City Manager, at least ten (10) days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
   (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the City Manager of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of this time the user

twenty-four (24) hours.
   (c)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the City Manager may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
   (i)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
   (ii)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of
auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgement to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
   (iii)   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (b) of this
section.
   (2)   The City Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering

   (b)   The grantee may make a charge to subscribers for installation or
connection to its CATV system, and a fixed monthly charge for service in
accordance with the schedule of rates and charges filed with the city. All
rates and charges for basic tier services and associated equipment must be
established in accordance with the rules and regulations established by this
subsection and must be determined to be within the maximum permitted rates for
regulated basic tier cable programming services and equipment. The maximum
permitted rates for regulated basic tier cable programming services and
equipment shall be determined in accordance with the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, as set forth
in Subpart N-Cable Rate Regulation of Title 47, Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 76.
   (1)   Basic service tier. Each cable system operator conducting business in
the city under a franchise granted by the city shall offer subscribers a basic
service tier which shall, at a minimum, include all signals of local commercial
television stations, qualified low power stations and noncommercial public or
educational television as provided by Sections 614 (47 U.S.C. 534) and 615 (47
U.S.C. 535) of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended, any governmental
programming required by the franchise to be carried on the basic tier, and any
additional video programming signals added to the basic tier by the cable
operator.
   (2)   Basic and cable programming service tier rates. Basic service tier and
associated equipment rates and charges shall be subject to regulation by the
city in order to assure that such rates and charges are in compliance with the
requirements of 47 U.S.C. 543. Rates or equipment charges that are
demonstrated, in accordance with the rules of the Federal Communications
Commission, Part 76, Subpart N of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations-
Cable Rate Regulation, not to exceed the "Initial Permitted per Channel Charge"
or the "Subsequent permitted Per Channel Charge" as described in said
regulations, will be accepted as being in compliance. The maximum monthly
charge per subscriber for the basic services tier services offered by a cable
system operator shall consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by
the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. The
maximum monthly charges for regulated programming services shall not include
any charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and
installations are to be calculated separately pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Section
76.923.
   (A)   Initial permitted per channel charge.
   (I)   The permitted per channel charge on the initial date of regulation
shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either:
   A.   A charge determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding; or
   B.   The "benchmark" charge specified in paragraphs 76.922 (b)(1)(ii)(A),(B)
or (C) as applicable of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as
amended, which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein:
Provided, however, that if within one (1) year of becoming subject to initial
regulation of one service tier, a cable system operator becomes subject to
initial regulation of another service tier or tiers, the cable operator must
elect the same method of determining the permitted per channel charge for all
regulated service tiers. The cable system operator must maintain a consistent
method for determining the permitted per channel charge across all service
tiers for a period of one (1) year from the date that the cable system operator
first becomes subject to regulation on either the basic service or cable
programming service tiers. Benchmark charges pursuant to 76.922(b)(1) (ii) (A),
(B), or (C) shall be applied unless the cable operator elects a charge
determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding.
   (II)   For purposes of this subsection (b) of Section
6-3-7, the initial date of regulation for the basic service tier shall be the
date on which local notice is given to the cable system operator that the
provision of basic tier is subject to regulation.
   (III)   For purposes of this subsection (b) of Section
6-3-7, rates in effect on the initial date of regulation or on September 30,
1992, shall be the rates charged to subscribers for service received on that
date.
   (IV)   A per channel rate for the basic service tier that is at, or below,
the benchmark level when the cable system becomes subject to regulation are
presumptively reasonable and shall be approved by the city. Rates exceeding the
applicable benchmark at the time regulation begins are presumptively
unreasonable.
   (B)   Subsequent permitted per channel charge. After the initial date of
regulation, the permitted channel charge for regulated programming services
shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either:
   (I)   A per channel rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing,
or
   (II)   The prior permitted per channel charge previously approved by the
city or the FCC, adjusted forinflation and external costs in accordance with
the price cap requirements set forth in paragraph 4 of this subsection.
   (C)   Price cap requirements.
   (I)   Inflation adjustments. Permitted per channel charges for regulated
programming services may be adjusted periodically on account of inflation.
Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of inflation shall be
based on changed in the Gross National Product Price Index ("GNP-PI") published
by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce.
   (II)   External costs. Permitted per channel charges for regulated
programming services may also be adjusted for changes in external costs
measured on a per channel per subscriber basis. To the extent external cost
increases are greater or less than the GNP-PI for the relevant period, the per-
channel charge will be adjusted accordingly. Per channel charges may not be
increased if external costs increase at a rate less than inflation. Permitted
per channel charges also shall be decreased on account of external costs to the
extent such costs decrease from previous levels:
   A.   Categories. External Costs shall consist of costs in the following
categories:
   1.   State and local taxes applicable to provision of cable television
service;
   2.   Franchise fees;
   3.   Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including costs of
providing public, educational, and governmental access channels as required by
the city;
   4.   Retransmission consent fees; and
   5.   Programming costs.
   B.   The permitted per channel charge for the basic services tier shall be
adjusted on account of programming costs and retransmission consent fees only
for broadcast signals offered on the basic services tier.
   C.   The permitted per channel charge shall not be adjusted for costs of
retransmission consent fees or charges in those fees incurred prior to October
6, 1994.
   D.   The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs for
basic tier services shall be the initial date of regulation.
   E.   Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to be
permitted per channel charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as
part of the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for basic tier services.
   F.   Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in
the costs of programming obtained from affiliated programmers, as defined in
Subpart N of Part 76 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, that
exceed inflation as long as the price charged to the affiliated system reflects
either prevailing company prices offered in the marketplace to third parties
(where the affiliated program supplier has established such prices) or the fair
market value of the programming.
   G.   Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in
the costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues
received by the operator from the programmer.
   (3)   Rates for equipment and installation used to receive the basic service
tier.
   (A)   The equipment regulated under this subsection consists of all
equipment in a subscriber's home that is used to receive the basic service
tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive
other tiers of regulated programming service and/or unregulated service. Such
equipment shall include, but is not limited to:
   (I)   Converter boxes;
   (II)   Remote control units;
   (III)   Connections for additional television receivers; and
   (IV)   Other cable home wiring.
   Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges on actual
costs in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Communications
Commission as set forth in Part 76, Subpart N, of Title 47 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, as amended, which is hereby incorporated by reference as
if fully set out herein.
   (4)   A cable system operator shall file its schedule of rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment with the City Clerk within thirty (30)
days of receiving written notification from the City of Claremont that the city
has been certified to regulate rates for the basic service tier and has adopted
the regulations set forth in this subsection (b) of Code Section
6-3-7.
   (5)   If it has not already done so in accordance with the rules of the
Federal Communications Commission, a cable system operator shall provide
written notification to subscribers of the availability of basic tier services
within three billing cycles from the date of adoption of these rules by the
city, and to new subscribers at the time of installation. This notification
shall include information that (I) basic tier services is available, (II) the
cost per month for basic tier service, and (III) a list of all services
included in the basic tier service.
   (6)   A cable operator shall provide written notice to the city and to all
subscribers located within the City of Claremont of any increase in the price
to be charges for the basic service tier or associated equipment at least 30
days before any proposed increase is to be effective. The notice shall include
the name and address of the City of Claremont as the local franchising
authority.
   (7)   After a cable operator has submitted its existing rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipmentcosts to the city, or a proposed increase
in these rates (including increases in the baseline channel change that results
from reductions in the number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will
remain in effect or the proposed rates will become effective after thirty (30)
days from the date of submission: Provided, however, that the city may toll
this thirty (30) day deadline for an additional time by issuing a brief written
order as described is paragraph (8) below within thirty (30) days of the rate
submission explaining that it needs additional time to review the rates.
   (8)   If the city is unable to determine, based upon the material submitted
by the cable system operator, that the existing or proposed rates are within
the Commission's permitted basic service tier charge or actual cost of
equipment as defined in Sections 76.922 and 76.923 of Subpart N of Title 47,
Part 76, of the Code of Federal Regulations, or if a cable operator has
submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to Sections 76.937(c) and 76.924,
seeking to justify a rate above the Commission's basic service tier charge as
defined in Sections 976.922 and 976.923 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, the city may toll the thirty (30) day deadline in paragraph (7) of
this subsection to request and/or consider additional information or to
consider the comments from interested parties as follows:
   (A)   For an additional ninety (90) days in cases not involving cost-of-
service showings; or
   (B)   For an additional one hundred fifty (150) days involving cost-of-
service showings.
   (9)   If the city has availed itself of the additional 90 or 150 days
permitted in paragraph (8) of this subsection, and has taken no action within
these additional time periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at
the end of the 90 or 150 day periods, or the existing rates will remain in
effect at such times, subject to refunds if the franchising authority
subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates:
provided, however, that in order to order refunds, the city must have issued a
brief written order to the cable system operator by the end of the 90 or 150
day period permitted in paragraph (8) of this subsection directing the operator
to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in
issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid.
   (10)   Within the time deadlines set forth in paragraphs (7) and (8) of this
subsection, the city will schedule a public hearing upon the cable system
operator's submission of existing initial rates and charges, or proposed
increased rates and charges, for basic service tier and associated equipment.
Notice of this public hearing shall be given by publication of a notice of the
public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of
Claremont at least once a week for two successive weeks immediately prior to
the public hearing. At the public hearing, reasonable opportunity shall be
afforded for consideration of the views of interested parties.
   (11)   The city shall issue a written decision in a ratemaking proceeding
whenever it disapproves an initial rate for the basic service tier or
associated equipment in whole or in part, disapproves a request for a rate
increase in whole or in part, or approves a request for an increase in whole or
in part over the objections of interested parties. The city shall not issue a
written decision that approves an unopposed existing or proposed rate for the
basic service tier or associated equipment. Public notice shall be given of any
written decision, including releasing the text of any written decision to the
public.
   (12)   A cable system operator has the burden of proving that its existing

U.S.C. 543 and Sections 76.922 and 923 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal
Regulations.
   (A)   For an existing or proposed rate for basic tier service or associated
equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual costs of
equipment as set forth in Part 76, Subpart N of Title 47 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, the cable system operator must submit the appropriate FCC form.
   (B)   For an existing or a proposed rate for basic tier service that exceeds
the permitted tier charge as set forth in part 76, Subpart N of Title 47 of the
Code of Federal Regulations, the cable operator must submit a cost-of-service
showing to justify the proposed rate increase.
   (13)   The city may require the production of proprietary information to
make a rate determination and in such case must apply procedures analogous to
47 C.F.R. 0459 regarding requests for confidentiality.
   (14)   The city may order a cable system operator to implement a reduction
in basic service tier or associated rates where necessary to bring rates into
compliance with the standards set forth in Part 76, Subpart N of Title 47 of
the Code of Federal Regulations.
   (15)   The city may prescribe a reasonable rate for the basic service tier
or associated equipment after it determines that a proposed rate is
unreasonable.
   (16)   The city may order a cable system operator to refund to subscribers
that portion of previously paid rates determined to be in excess of the
permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the
operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the rate
charged as reasonable. Before ordering such refund, the city shall give the
cable system operator notice of the proposed order of refund, and an
opportunity to comment.
   (A)   An operator's liability for refunds is limited to a one-year period,
except that an operator that fails to comply with a valid rate order shall be
liable for refunds commencing from the effective date of such order until such
time as it complies with such order.
   (B)   The refund period shall run as follows:

in the following manner:
   1.   By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid the
overcharges, either through direct payment or as a specifically identified
credit to those subscribers' bills; or
   2.   By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for the
basic service tier or associated equipment to cover the cumulative overcharge.
This shall be reflected as a specifically identified, one-time credit on
prospective bills to the class of subscribers that currently subscribe to the
cable system.
   (D)   Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates published
by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments.
   (17)   Appeals of decisions of the city on rates for the basic service tier

installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, or any
other type of structures or improvements. The city shall not be liable for any
disturbance of the grantee's installation resulting therefrom. The grantee
shall carry out the instructions and directions of the mayor wherever it is
necessary to raise or remove any of the grantee's wires or cable temporarily
for the purpose of moving or removing buildings or structures on the public
streets of the city, and shall perform such tree trimming or other maintenance
work as shall be required or as shall be directed by the city, all at grantee's
expense.
   (d) Wherever a grantee takes up or disturbs any pavement, sidewalk, or other
improvement of any street, the same shall be replaced and the surface restored
in as good condition as before entry, all in accordance with city ordinances,
regulations, technical standards, and fee schedules. The condition of the
replacement and restoration shall be guaranteed for a period of one year
following completion of the work. In the event any such work shall fail within
the period of one year, it shall again be replaced. Any opening or obstruction
in the street shall be guarded and protected at all times by the placement of
adequate barriers, fences, or boardings, the bounds of which shall be clearly
designated by warning lights of approved types. (Ord. of 5/3/82, No. 48-82)
Sec. 6-3-9   Permits; installation and service.
   (a)   Within 90 days after acceptance of any franchise, the grantee shall
commence proceedings and negotiations for obtaining all necessary permits and
authorizations which are required in the conduct of its business, including,
but not limited to, any utility joint use attachment agreements, licenses, and
authorizations required by duly-constituted regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the operations of CATV systems and service.
   (b)   The grantee shall commence construction in the franchise area where it
is determined by the grantee to be most economically feasible within a period
of one year after receiving FCC certification and all other necessary permits,
authorizations, and agreements required for the conduct of the grantee's
business. Thereafter grantee shall extend its construction into such other
portions of the franchise area as it determines to be economically feasible
within a period of four years. It is the intention of the city to encourage the
extension of CATV service to as much of the city as is practicable without the
impairment of the economic feasibility of a grantee's system.
   (1)   In the event that potential subscribers in a sparsely settled section
of the franchise area shall request service and the grantee shall be of the
opinion that the small number of potential subscribers makes such service
economically unfeasible, the grantee may make such service available by
requiring a reasonable contribution from the potential subscribers to the cost
of the extension of service. However, grantee shall not be required to make
such service available.
   (2)   Similarly, in the event potential subscribers in a non-sparsely
settled portion of the franchise area request service and grantee must run its
cables through a sparsely settled section in order to reach those potential
subscribers, the grantee may make service available by requiring a reasonable
contribution from the potential subscribers to the cost of the extension
through the sparsely settled section. However, grantee shall not be required to
make the service available.
   (3)   The areas of the city having less than 60 or more homes per street
mile shall be deemed "sparsely settled" as that term is used herein. The areas
of the city having 60 or more homes per mile shall be deemed "non-sparsely
settled" as that term is used herein.
   (4)   In determining the reasonable contribution from the subscribers as
herein provided, grantee shall take into account the size of the sparsely
settled areas through which it must run its cables from areas already served by
the grantee to new areas, and the cost of running its cables in a sparsely
settled area seeking service; and the economic effect of the proposed extension
and service upon the total operation of grantee's system.
   (c)   Failure on the part of the grantee to commence and diligently pursue
each of the foregoing requirements to complete each of the matters set forth
herein, or failure to commence rendering service to subscribers within 18
months after acceptance of the franchise, shall be grounds for termination of
the franchise. However, the city may extend time for the commencement and
completion of construction and the installation of service for additional
periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by
reason of circumstances beyond its control.
   (d)   The grantee shall file a map with the city on or before January 31 of
each year, showing the areas and locations of the city being served by the
system, and the location and identification of component parts of the system,
this map being accurate as of the end of the calendar year immediately
preceding the date of filing.

grantee shall comply with all requirements of duly-constituted regulatory
agencies having jurisdiction over CATV or the operation of CATV systems.

for the purpose of investigating and resolving service complaints, and of the
fact that subscribers may inform the city clerk in the event that complaints
are not resolved to their satisfaction.
   (5)   Retain complaint records available for inspection at any time and from
time to time by the city manager, showing the nature of the complaint and its
disposition.

tier services and associated equipment, the regulations of the FCC shall
control. (Ord. of 5/3/82, No. 48-82; Am. Ord. 3/8/94, No. 220-94)
Sec. 6-3-12   Violations; penalty.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for any person to make any unauthorized

quarters in the absence of sanitary facilities. Therfore, pursuant to the
authority granted by G.S. 160A-441, it is the intent of this article to provide
for the repair, closing or demolition of any such abandoned structures in
accordance with the same provisions and procedures as are set forth by law for

provide for the repair, closing or demolition of the structures;
   (3)   to keep an accurate record of all enforcement proceedings begun
pursuant to the provisions of this article; and
   (4)   to perform such other duties as may be prescribed herein or assigned

he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this article.
Sec. 9-2-64   Standards for enforcement.
   (a)   Every abandoned structure within the city shall be deemed in violation
of this article whenever the structure constitutes a hazard to the health,
safety or welfare of the city citizens as a result of:
   (1)   the attraction of insects or rodents;
   (2)   conditions creating a fire hazard;
   (3)   dangerous conditions constituting a threat to children; or
   (4)   frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the absence of sanitary
facilities.
   (b)   In making the preliminary determination of whether or not an abandoned
structure is in violation of this article, the city manager may, by way of
illustration and not limitation, consider the presence or absence of the
following conditions:

which might attract or admit rodents and insects, or become breeding places for
rodents and insects;

No. 37-02)
Sec. 9-3-22   Nonconforming uses.
   After the effective date of this chapter, existing structures, or the uses
of land or structures which would be prohibited under the regulations for the

chapter), shall be considered as nonconforming. Nonconforming structures or
uses (as defined in Article A of this chapter) may be continued provided they
conform to the following provisions. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)
Sec. 9-3-23   Continuing nonconforming uses of land.
   1.   Extension of use. The enlargement or extension of nonconforming uses of
land are discouraged; however, a nonconforming use of land may be enlarged or
extended once with the following provisions:
   a.   An application for a special use permit must be filed with the Board of
Adjustment and a public hearing held. The application shall include a site plan
with sufficient detail of the expansions and any alterations to be made.
   b.   Enlargement or alterations may not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of

Board of Adjustment shall consider:
   (1)   Probable traffic increase of each use.
   (2)   Parking requirements of each use.
   (3)   Probable number of persons on the premises at a time of peak demand.
   (4)   Off-site impacts of each use, such as noise, glare, dust, vibration,
or smoke and other impacts on surrounding properties or public health and
safety.
   d.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot other than occupied at the time of enactment of this
chapter.

Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-24   Continuing the use of nonconforming buildings.
   1.   Extension of use. Nonconforming buildings and nonconforming uses may be
enlarged provided the provisions of this section are met. Additionally, no
nonconforming structure or use may be enlarged or altered in anyway which
increases its dimensional deficiencies.
   2.   Change of use. The lawful use of a building existing at the time of the
adoption of this chapter may be continued, even though such use does not
conform to the provisions of this chapter. Furthermore, such building may be
reconstructed or structurally altered and any nonconforming use therein changed
subject to the following regulations:
   a.   The order of classification of uses from highest to lowest for the
purpose of this section shall be as follows: residential district uses,
business district uses, industrial district uses, as permitted by this chapter.
   b.   A nonconforming use may be changed to a use of higher classification
but not to a use of lower classification. A nonconforming use may not be
changed to another use of the same classification unless the new use shall be
deemed by the Board of Adjustment, after public notice and hearing, to be less
harmful to the surrounding neighborhood, than the existing nonconforming use.
   c.   A nonconforming commercial or industrial use may not be extended, but
the extension of a use to any portion of a building, which portion is at the
time of the adoption of this chapter primarily designed for such nonconforming
use, shall not be deemed to be an extension of a nonconforming use.
   d.   Existing single-family residential structures in the business or
industrial districts may be enlarged, extended or structurally altered or
rebuilt, provided that no additional dwelling units result therefrom.

city’s subdivision regulations. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)
Sec. 9-3-35   Vested rights.
   The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of N.C.G.S. 160D-
102 pursuant to which a statutory zoning vested right is established upon
approval of a site specific development plan.
   1.   Definitions.
   a.   Approval authority. The City Council, Planning Board, Board of
Adjustment, City Clerk, Zoning Administrator, or other board or official
designated by this chapter as being authorized to grant the specific zoning or
land use permit approval that constitutes a site specific development.
   b.   Site specific development plan. A plan of land development submitted to
the City of Claremont for purposes of obtaining one (1) of the following zoning
or land use permits or approvals:
   1.   Zoning permit as provided by this chapter.
   2.   Special use permit as provided by this chapter.
   3.   Variance as provided by this chapter.
   4.   Minor subdivision approval.
   5.   Major subdivision approval.
   6.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither a variance, a sketch plan, nor
any other document that fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type
and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property shall
constitute a site specific development plan.
   c.   Zoning vested rights. A right pursuant to N.C.G.S. 160D-102 to
undertake and complete the development and use of property under the terms and
conditions of an approved site specific development plan, provided that such
development shall begin within two (2) years following issuance of the zoning
vested right. Under the terms of this chapter, a two (2) year zoning vested
right shall be established upon issuance of a zoning permit. (Ord. of 12-7-04,
No. 37-02; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-36   Permitted accessory uses in all districts.
   1.   Accessory uses and structures that are clearly related to and
incidental to the permitted principal use or structure on the lot (Section
9-3-33).
   2.   Fences and walls. Fences consisting of masonry, rock, wire or wooden
material and hedges may be installed on the boundaries of any residential lot,
provided that the height of such fencing, walls or hedges shall be limited to a
maximum height of five (5) feet between the street right-of-way line and the
normal building line for that section adjacent to the street. Fencing, walls
and hedges on all other boundaries of residential property shall be limited to
a maximum of eight (8) feet in height. Retaining walls and required screenings
shall not be subject to the above height requirements. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No.
37-02)
Sec. 9-3-37   Location of driveways.
   All new driveways on city-maintained rights-of-way shall be a minimum of
one-hundred (100) feet from the nearest street intersection, or as close to
one-hundred (100) feet as possible without prohibiting access for that property
onto at least one public right-of-way on which it fronts. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No.
37-02)
Sec. 9-3-38   Sidewalks.
   New developments shall construct sidewalk along the public right-of-way if
the property is within three hundred (300) feet of existing sidewalk on the
same side of the right-of-way. If sidewalk already exists on the other side of
the right-of-way, no new sidewalk is required. However, all new development on
the south side of Centennial Boulevard shall construct sidewalk. All new
sidewalks shall meet the following requirements:
   1.   Concrete sidewalks, minimum five (5) feet wide, shall be built along
all street frontages of the lot according to city specifications (four (4)
inches thick except at non-residential driveways it shall be six (6) inches
thick). The sidewalk shall be separated from the street by a minimum four (4)
foot wide planting strip unless on-street parking is provided. The planting
strip width may be reduced when there is insufficient right-of-way on existing
streets. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)
Sec. 9-3-39   Transportation impact study.
   A transportation impact study (TIS) may be required by the City of Claremont
for any development or property that experiences a change in zoning
classification after the effective date of this chapter and is projected to
generate one thousand (1,000) daily trips. A TIS shall be required for all
development that experiences a change in zoning classification after the
effective date of this chapter and is projected to generate one thousand five
hundred (1,500) daily trips. A TIS may be required by the City of Claremont for
any redevelopment or change in use of an existing occupied development that has
experienced a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this
chapter that would generate one thousand (1,000) additional daily trips, and
shall be required when the subject development is expected to generate one
thousand five hundred (1,500) additional daily trips, subject to the exception
set out below.
   When sufficient information on the proposed development is available for the
City of Claremont to determine that the aforementioned criteria is met, a TIS
shall be submitted with all preliminary plats, site plans, site plan revisions,
and special use permit applications. The trip rates shall be based on trip
generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip Generation published
by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or any local trip generation rates
either published or approved by the City of Claremont. Additional trips shall
be determined by subtracting the gross trip generation of the existing use from
the gross trip generation of the proposed use. The additional trip calculation
shall apply to property that is occupied at the time of submittal or has been
occupied at any time prior to submittal.
   If a development or property experiences a change in zoning classification
after the effective date of this chapter and special circumstances exist, the
City of Claremont may require a TIS without regard to the expected trip
generation of the development. Factors that would warrant such a requirement
are:
   1.   There are existing levels of service deficiencies in the area of the
proposed development. (“Level of Service” as defined in the Highway Capacity
Manual - Transportation Research Board Special Report 209) and/or
   2.   Available accident data and/or operational and geometric factors
indicate safety concerns.
   Notwithstanding the above, a TIS shall not be required if the property to be
rezoned or developed has been the subject of a TIS within the previous three
(3) years and the projected trip generation of the newly proposed development
is equal to or less than the previous study performed and the trip distribution
has not significantly changed. As a part of subdivision, site plan and driveway
permit approval, the City of Claremont may require needed transportation
improvements for the property requesting development approval; however, a TIS
shall not be utilized as a means for staff to require the party developing the
property to make needed transportation improvements remote from the property
for which the TIS is submitted, nor shall identified deficiencies in level of
service automatically preclude approval of the proposed development.
   The TIS shall address the proposed land use, the trip generation therefrom,
site access, modal splits if appropriate, impacts on the transportation system
from the proposed development, and physical improvements or enforceable
management strategies to mitigate negative impacts. At a minimum, the TIS shall
identify the improvements necessary to maintain Level of Service D for streets
and intersections as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation
Research Board Special Report 209. Any TIS, whether required or voluntarily
prepared, must be prepared by a licensed engineer in accordance with city
guidelines. Additionally, the TIS should be reviewed and approved by city staff
before being considered by City Council or any planning agency of the city.
   Developments/properties that have not experienced a change in zoning
classification since the effective date of this chapter are not required to
prepare a TIS as a part of their site plan approval. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-
02; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)

ARTICLE C
Establishment of Districts
Sec. 9-3-41   Use districts.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the City of Claremont and its
extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction is hereby divided into six (6) base
districts and two (2) overlay districts designated as follows:
   Neighborhood Residential District (R-1)
   Residential Agricultural District (R-2)
   Central Business District (B-1)
   Community Business District (B-2)
   Highway Business District (B-3)
   Manufacturing District (M-1)
   Manufactured Home Overlay District (MHO)
   High Rise Sign Overlay District (HRSO)
(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 8-1-11, No. 02-11)
Sec. 9-3-42   District boundaries. 
   The boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on a map
entitled “Official Zoning Map, City of Claremont, North Carolina.” The zoning
map and all the notations, references and amendments thereto, and other
information shown thereon are hereby made a part of this chapter the same as if
such information set forth on the map were all fully described as set forth
herein. The zoning map shall be retained in the office of the City Clerk. (Ord.
of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)
Sec. 9-3-43   Rules governing boundaries.
   Where, due to the scale, lack of detail or illegibility of the zoning map,
there is uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to the intended location of
any zoning district boundary as shown thereof, the Zoning Enforcement Officer
shall make an interpretation of said map upon request of any person. Any person
aggrieved by such interpretation may appeal such interpretation to the Board of
Adjustment. The Zoning Enforcement Officer and the Board of Adjustment, in
interpreting the zoning map or deciding any appeal, shall apply the following
standards:
   1.   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
centerlines of streets or highways, street lines, or railroad right-of-way
lines or such lines extended, such centerlines, street lines or railroad right-
of-way lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
   2.   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
   3.   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways, or railroads, or rights-of-
way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel
thereto and at such distance there from as indicated on the zoning map. If no
distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale
shown on said zoning map.
   4.   Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership, the
district requirements for the least restricted portion of such lot shall be
deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such extensions shall not
include any part of such a lot more than thirty-five (35) feet beyond the
district boundary line. The term “least restrictive” shall refer to zoning
restrictions, not lot or tract size. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)

Sec. 9-3-55   Highway Business District (B-3).
   Intent. The Highway Business District (B-3) is appropriate and reserved
primarily for high intensity/density auto-dependent commercial development and
contemplates commercial development that utilizes the limited prime property
with I-40 access and thoroughfares of N. Oxford and Centennial as well as the
necessary utility infrastructure including water and sewer. While not easily
developed for a comfortable pedestrian environment, connectivity via sidewalks
is necessary. The Highway Business District (B-3) will serve not only the local
community, but interstate and highway travelers as well. Because of the scale
and access requirements of uses for this category, they often cannot be
compatibly integrated with the Central Business and Community Business
Districts. Development at district boundaries must provide a compatible
transition to uses outside the district and frontages on major or minor
arterials will require formal street tree planting.

   a.   Buildings shall be placed on the lot within the zone represented by the
hatched area. In most cases, the build-to-line will range from zero (0) feet to
fifteen (15) feet behind street right-of-way. Special site conditions such as
topography, pattern of lot widths, or setbacks of existing buildings permit a
larger building setback.
   b.   Building facades generally shall be parallel to front property lines.
   c.   Parking shall be located primarily to the rear of the building; side
yard parking shall occupy no more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the primary
frontage line and shall not be placed in any side yard abutting an intersecting
street. Where dimensions of existing lots restrict parking behind buildings,
the limitations on side yard parking may be modified.
   d.   Points of permitted access to parking are indicated by arrows.
   e.    Parking areas on adjacent lots shall be connected wherever practical.
   f.    Trash containers shall be located in a rear parking area (Article H)
and shall be screened from the right-of-way.
   g.   Mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the parking lot
side of building and away from buildings on adjacent sites.

   a.   Balconies, bay windows, arcades, porches at an upper level and their
supports at ground level, together with awnings above head height (minimum
seven (7) feet six (6) inches) are permitted within the sidewalk as shown by
the hatched area. Encroaching arcades should cover the entire sidewalk.
   b.   Primary pedestrian access into the building shall be from the street
frontage line (indicated by large arrow). Secondary access may be from parking
areas (indicated by smaller arrow).
   c.   When required, concrete sidewalks, minimum five (5) feet wide, shall be
built along all street frontages of the lot according to city specifications
(four (4) inches thick except at non-residential driveways it shall be six (6)
inches thick). The sidewalk shall be separated from the street by a minimum
four (4) foot wide planting strip unless on-street parking is provided. The
planting strip width may be reduced when there is insufficient right-of-way on
existing streets.
   3.   Description:
   The workplace building may be a large structure (fifteen thousand (15,000)
plus square feet) and may have a single use tenant. Office, industrial, and
commercial tenants are typical. These buildings are critical to the city as
employment centers and commercial service locations. The buildings will provide
space for industry, large offices, as well as large retail uses such as a full
service grocery store.
   4.   Special conditions:
   a.   Buildings in all locations should relate the principal facade to the
sidewalk and public space of the street.

conditions. Side setbacks on a minor street may be less than the front
dimension.
   c.   Within the limits described, front and side setbacks will vary
depending upon site conditions. Setbacks should be used in a manner that
encourages pedestrian activity. For example, squares or spatially defined
plazas within building setback areas can act as focal points for pedestrians.

clad with masonry, wood, vinyl siding, stucco, or similar material. Metal
paneling may not comprise a street fronting building face. Building elevations
fronting or visible from public streets shall not be covered with vinyl siding
in the Central Business District (B-1).
   (3)   The front elevations facing the street and the overall massing shall
communicate an emphasis on the human scale and the pedestrian environment.
   (4)   Each building should be designed to form part of a larger composition
of the area in which it is situated. Adjacent buildings should thus be of
similar scale, height, and configuration.
   (5)   Mobile units may not be used as permanent workplace buildings.
   (6)   At a minimum, the Americans with Disabilities Act standards for
accessibility shall be met.
   b.   Configurations:

total required parking, be placed in the front of the building. Side yard
parking shall occupy no more than fifty percent (50%) of the primary frontage
line and shall not be placed in any side yard abutting an intersecting street.
Where dimensions of existing lots restrict parking behind buildings, the
limitations on side yard parking may be modified.
   c .    Parking areas on adjacent lots shall be connecte d whereve r
practical .
   d .    Trash containe rs shall be located in a rear parking area (Article H)
and shall be screened from the right-of-way.

the hatched area. Encroaching arcades should cover the entire sidewalk.
   b.   Primary pedestrian access into the building shall be from the street
frontage line (indicated by large arrow). Secondary access may be from parking
areas (indicated by smaller arrow).
   c.   When required, concrete sidewalks, minimum five (5) feet wide, shall be
built along all street frontages of the lot according to city specifications
(four (4) inches thick except at non-residential driveways it shall be six (6)
inches thick). The sidewalk shall be separated from the street by a minimum
four (4) foot wide planting strip unless on-street parking is provided. The
planting strip width may be reduced when there is insufficient right-of-way on
existing streets.
   3.   Description: 
   The shopfront building is a small-scale structure, which can accommodate a
variety of uses. The structure is typically a maximum of fifteen thousand
(15,000) square feet. A group of shopfront buildings can be combined to form a
mixed-use neighborhood center. Individual shopfront buildings can be used to
provide some commercial service, such as a convenience food store, in close
proximity to homes. Traditional commercial buildings in the Central Business
District provide good examples.
   4.   Special conditions:
   a.   The intention of buildings in all locations must be to relate the
principal facade to the sidewalk and public space of the street.
   b.   Drive-through customer services, if permitted in the district, must be
located at the rear of the building or on a side that does not abut a street.
   c.   Corners: Setbacks at street corners will generally replicate frontage
conditions. However, side setbacks on a minor street may be less than the front
dimension.
   d.   Within the limits described, front and side setbacks will vary
depending upon site conditions. Setbacks should be used in a manner that
encourages pedestrian activity. For example, squares or spatially defined
plazas within building setback areas can act as focal points for pedestrians.

importance. Where possible, civic structures shall be designed to terminate
vistas or serve as key focal points in the neighborhood. The intention of
buildings in all locations must be to relate the principal facade to the
sidewalk and public space of the street. Civic buildings shall not be set back
on the lot behind a standard parking lot.

ARTICLE G
Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
Sec. 9-3-111   Purpose and legislative intent.
   1.   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Claremont’s
authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities. North Carolina General Statutes governing the
regulation of wireless telecommunication facilities, Chapter 160D, Article 9,
Part 3, provide for the safe and efficient integration of facilities necessary
for the provision of advanced wireless telecommunications services throughout
the community and to ensure the ready availability of reliable wireless
services to the public, government agencies and first responders, with the
intention of furthering the public safety and general welfare.
   2.   The City of Claremont finds that wireless telecommunications facilities
may pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character
and environment of the city and its inhabitants. The city also recognizes that
facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic
development asset to the city and of significant benefit to the city and its
residents. In order to assure that the placement, construction or modification
of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with the city’s land
use policies, the city is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless
telecommunications facilities application and permitting process. The intent of
this article is to minimize the physical impact of wireless telecommunications
facilities on the community, protect the character of the community to the
extent reasonably possible, establish a fair and efficient process for review
and approval of applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review of
environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and
welfare of the City of Claremont. (Ord. of 3/1/10; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)

provisions of this article, and all applications thereof, not having been
declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid, shall remain in full force and
effect.
   2.   Any special use permit issued pursuant to this article shall be
comprehensive and not severable. If part of a permit is deemed or ruled to be
invalid or unenforceable in any material respect, by a competent authority, or
is overturned by a competent authority, the permit shall be void in total, upon
determination by the city. (Ord. of 3/1/10; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)

   11.   The applicant will provide a written copy of an analysis, completed by
a qualified individual or organization, to determine if the proposed wireless
telecommunications facility is in compliance with Federal Aviation
Administration Regulation Part 77 and if it requires lighting. This requirement
shall also be for any where the application increases the height of the
wireless telecommunications facility. If this analysis determines that an FAA
determination is required, then all filings with the FAA, all responses from
the FAA and any related correspondence shall be provided with the application.
   12.   Application for new wireless telecommunications facility versus co-
location.
   a.   The applicant shall be required to submit a written report
demonstrating its meaningful efforts to secure shared use of existing wireless
telecommunications facilities or the use of alternative buildings or other
structures within the city that are at or above the surrounding tree height or
the tallest obstruction and are within one (1) mile of the proposed tower.
Copies of written requests and responses for shared use shall be provided to
the city in the application, along with any letters of rejection stating the
reason for rejection.
   b.   Telecommunications towers shall be prohibited in residential districts,
or historic districts, unless the applicant provides documentation (i.e. clear
and convincing evidence that there is no technological option) to demonstrate
that the telecommunications tower is necessary, that the area cannot be served
from outside the district, that no existing or previously approved wireless
telecommunications facility can reasonably be used for the antenna placement
instead of the construction of a new wireless telecommunications facility or
instead of increasing the height of an existing wireless telecommunications
facility, and that no alternative wireless telecoinmunications facility or
alternative type of wireless telecommunications facility can be used to provide
wireless telecommunications service to the district.
   c.   In order to better inform the public, in the case of a new
telecommunication tower, the applicant shall hold a “balloon test” prior to the
initial public hearing on the application. The applicant shall arrange to fly,
or raise upon a temporary mast, a minimum of a ten (10) foot in length brightly
colored balloon at the maximum height of the proposed new tower.
   d.   At least fourteen (14) days prior to the conduct of the balloon test, a
sign shall be erected so as to be clearly visible from the road nearest the
proposed site and shall be removed no later than fourteen (14) days after the
conduct of the balloon test. The sign shall be at least four (4) feet by eight
(8) feet in size and shall be readable from the road by a person with 20/20
vision.
   e.   Such sign shall be placed off, but as near to, the public right-of-way
as is possible.
   f.   Such sign shall contain the times and date(s) of the balloon test and
contact information.
   g.   The dates, (including a second date, in case of poor visibility or wind
in excess of fifteen (15) mph on the initial date) times and location of this
balloon test shall be advertised by the applicant seven (7) and fourteen (14)
days in advance of the first test date in a newspaper with a general
circulation in the city and as agreed to by the city. The applicant shall
inform the city in writing, of the dates and times of the test, at least
fourteen (14) days in advance. The balloon shall be flown for at least four (4)
consecutive hours between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on the dates chosen. The
primary date shall be on a week-end, but the second date, in case of poor
visibility on the initial date, may be on a week day. A report with pictures
from various locations of the balloon shall be provided with the application.
   h.   The applicant shall notify all property owners and residents located
within one thousand five hundred feet (1,500) of the nearest property line of
the subject property of the proposed construction of the tower and wireless
facility and of the date(s) and time(s) of the balloon test. Such notice shall
be provided at least fourteen (14) days prior to the conduct of the balloon
test and shall be delivered by first-class mail.
   i.   The wireless telecommunications facility shall be structurally designed
to accommodate at least six (6) antenna arrays as regards the load and stress
created on the structure, with each array to be sited in such a manner as to
provide for flush attachments to the greatest extent possible with the minimum
separation required without causing interference. An intermodulation study
shall be submitted to justify design claims as related to interference. A claim
of interference because of a need to have greater than six (6) feet of vertical
clearance between facilities, measured from the vertical centerline of one (1)
array to the vertical centerline of another, must be proven by technical data
showing that there is no technological alternative that would enable the
service to be provided that would require less vertical space, and not merely
verbal or written assertions. This requirement may be waived, provided that the
applicant, in writing, demonstrates that the provisions of future shared usage
of the wireless telecommunications facility is not reasonably feasible if co-
location is technically or commercially impractical or impracticable. The
applicant shall provide information necessary to determine whether co-location
is reasonably feasible-based upon:
   (1)   The kind of wireless telecommunications facility site and structure
proposed; and
   (2)   Available space on existing and approved wireless telecommunications
facilities.
   j.   The owner of a proposed new wireless telecommunications facility, and
his/her successors in interest, shall negotiate in good faith for the shared
use of the proposed wireless telecommunications facility by other wireless
service providers in the future, and shall:
   (1)   Respond within sixty (60) days to a request for information from a
potential shared-use applicant;
   (2)   Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use of
the new wireless telecommunications facility by other telecommunications
providers; and
   (3)   Allow shared use of the new wireless telecommunications facility if
another telecommunications provider agrees in writing to pay reasonable
charges. The charges may include, but are not limited to, a pro rata share of
the cost of site selection, planning, project administration, land costs, site
design, construction and maintenance financing, return on equity, less
depreciation, and all of the costs of adapting the wireless telecommunications
facility or equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing
electromagnetic interference.
   (4)   Failure to abide by the conditions outlined above may be grounds for
revocation of the special use permit.
   13.   The applicant shall provide certification with documentation (i.e.
structural analysis) including calculations that the telecommunications
facility and foundation and attachments, rooftop support structure, water tank
structure, or any other supporting structure as proposed to be utilized are
designed and will be constructed to meet all local, state and federal
structural requirements for loads, including wind and ice loads and including,
but not limited to all applicable ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
guidelines.
   14.   All applications for proposed wireless telecommunications facilities
shall contain a demonstration that the facility is sited and designed so as to
create the least visual intrusiveness reasonably possible given the facts and
circumstances involved, and thereby will have the least adverse visual effect
on the environment and its character, on existing vegetation, and on the
community in the area of the wireless telecommunications facility. The city
expressly reserves the right to require the use of stealth or camouflage
technology or techniques such as DAS (Distributive Antenna System technology)
or its functional equivalent to achieve this goal and such shall be subject to
approval by the Board.
   15.   The applicant shall furnish a visual impact assessment, which shall
include:
   a.   A computer generated “Zone of Visibility Map” at a minimum of one (1)
mile radius from the proposed structure shall be provided to illustrate
locations from which the proposed installation may be seen, with and without
foliage;
   b.   Pictorial representations (photo simulations) of “before and after”
views from key viewpoints inside of the city as may be appropriate and
required, including but not limited to state highways and other major roads,
state and local parks, other public lands, historic districts, preserves and
historic sites normally open to the public, and from any other location where
the site is visible to a large number of visitors, travelers or residents.
Guidance will be provided concerning the appropriate key viewpoints at the pre-
application meeting. In addition to photographic simulations to scale showing
the visual impact, the applicant shall provide a map showing the locations of
where the pictures were taken and the distance(s) of each location from the
proposed structure; and
   c.   A written description of the visual impact of the proposed facility,
including, as applicable, the tower base, guy wires, fencing and accessory
buildings from abutting and adjacent properties and streets as relates to the
need for or appropriateness of screening.
   16.   The applicant shall demonstrate and provide a description in writing
and by drawing how it shall effectively screen from view the base and all
related equipment and structures of the proposed wireless telecommunications
facility.
   17.   The wireless telecommunications facility and any and all accessory or
associated facilities shall maximize the use of building materials, colors and
textures designed to blend with the structure to which it may be affixed and to
harmonize with the natural surroundings. This shall include the utilization of
stealth or camouflage or concealment technology as may be required by the city.
   18.   All utilities at a wireless telecommunications facility site shall be
installed underground and in compliance with all laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations of the city, including specifically, but not limited to, the
National Electrical Safety Code and the National Electrical Code where
appropriate.
   19.   At a wireless telecommunications facility site an access road, turn
around space for an emergency vehicle and parking shall be provided to assure
adequate emergency and service access. Maximum use of existing roads, whether
public or private, shall be made to the extent practicable. Road construction
shall at all times minimize ground disturbance and the cutting of vegetation.
Road grades shall closely follow natural contours to assure minimal visual
disturbance and reduce soil erosion.
   20.   All wireless telecommunications facility shall be constructed,
operated, maintained, repaired, provided for removal of, modified or restored
in strict compliance with all current applicable technical, safety and safety-
related codes adopted by the city, state, or United States, including but not
limited to the most recent editions of the ANSI Code, National Electrical
Safety Code and the National Electrical Code, as well as accepted and
responsible workmanlike industry practices and recommended practices of the
National Association of Tower Erectors. The codes referred to are codes that
include, but are not limited to, construction, building, electrical, fire,
safety, health, and land use codes. In the event of a conflict between or among
any of the preceding the more stringent shall apply.
   21.   A holder of a special use permit granted under this article shall
obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses required by applicable
law, ordinance, rule, regulation or code, and must maintain the same, in full
force and effect, for as long as required by the city or other governmental
entity or agency having jurisdiction over the applicant.
   22.   There shall be a pre-application meeting for all intended
applications. The purpose of the pre-application meeting will be to address
issues that will help to expedite the review and permitting process and certain
issues or concerns the city may have. A pre-application meeting shall also
include a site visit, if there has not been a prior site visit for the
requested facility. Costs of the city’s consultants to prepare for and attend
the pre-application meeting will be borne by the applicant and paid for out of
a retainer based on the fixed hourly rate to be set in the city’s fee schedule
applied to the anticipated time customarily required for the review of similar
applications.
   23.   An applicant shall submit to the city the number of completed
applications determined to be needed at the pre-application meeting. However,
applications will not be transmitted to the Board for consideration until the
application is deemed complete.
   24.   If the proposed site is within two (2) miles of another jurisdiction,
written notification of the application shall be provided to the legislative
body of all such adjacent municipalities as applicable and/or requested.
   25.   The holder of a special use permit shall notify the city of any
intended modification of a wireless telecommunication facility and shall apply
to the city to modify, relocate or rebuild a wireless telecommunications
facility.
   26.   A zoning permit shall not be issued for construction of the wireless
telecommunications facility until there is an application for a specific
carrier that documents that the facility is necessary for that carrier to serve
the community and that co-location on an existing telecommunications structure
is not feasible within the applicant’s search ring. Co-location on an existing
structure is not reasonably feasible if co-location is technically or
commercially impractical or impracticable or the owner of the wireless
telecommunications facility is unwilling to enter into a contract for such use
at fair market value. Sufficient documentation in the form of clear and
convincing evidence to support such claims shall be submitted with a wireless
telecommunications facility application for the first carrier to determine
whether co-location on existing structures is reasonably feasible and to
document the need for a specific height and that less height will serve to
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service. (Ord. of
3/1/10; Ord. of 6/21/21, No. 41-21 Sec.1)
Sec. 9-3-118   Requirements for an application for the first antenna to be

of the FCC’s permitted standards and any portion(s) of the structure that would
be exposed to RF Radiation in excess of the FCC’s permitted standards. In
compliance with the FCC’s regulations, in such an instance the RF Radiation
from all wireless facilities at that location shall be included in the
calculations to show the cumulative effect on any area of the building or
structure deemed accessible by the public or workers. Such report or analysis
shall be signed and sealed by a professional engineer licensed in the state;
   z.   In an instance involving a tower where the new wireless

placing RF Radiation signs as needed and appropriate to warn individuals of the
potential danger; and
   bb.   A signed statement that the applicant will expeditiously remedy any
physical or RF interference with other telecommunications or wireless devices
or services.
   8.   To protect the nature and character of the area and create the least
visually intrusive impact reasonably possible under the facts and
circumstances, any attachment to a building or other structure with a facie,
the antennas shall be mounted on the facie, unless it can be proven that such
will prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service, and
all such attachments and exposed cabling shall use camouflage or stealth
techniques to match as closely as possible the color and texture of the
structure.
   9.   If attaching to a water tank, in order to maintain the current profile
and height, mounting on the top of the tank or the use of a corral shall only
be permitted if the applicant can prove that to locate elsewhere will prohibit
or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service. The provisions of
the preceding subsection 8. of this section shall also apply to any attachment
to a water tank.
   10.   The applicant shall provide a certification by a professional engineer
licensed in the state, along with documentation (a structural analysis),
including calculations, that prove that the wireless telecommunications
facility and its foundation as proposed to be utilized are designed and were
constructed to meet all local, city, state, federal and ANSI structural
requirements for loads, including wind and ice loads and the placement of any
equipment on the roof of a building after the addition of the proposed new
facilities.
   11.   So as to be the least visually intrusive wireless telecommunications
facility reasonably possible given the facts and circumstances involved, and
thereby have the least adverse visual effect and create the least intrusive or
lowest profile or visual silhouette reasonably possible, unless it can be
proven that such would be technologically impracticable, all antennas attached
to a tower or other structure shall be flush mounted or as near to flush
mounted as is possible without prohibiting or having the effect of prohibiting
the provision of service so as to minimize the visual profile of the antennas,
or prove technically, with hard data and a detailed narrative, that flush
mounting cannot be used and would serve to prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of service.
   12.   Unless it is deemed inappropriate or unnecessary by the city given the
facts and circumstances, the applicant shall demonstrate and provide in writing
and by drawing how it shall effectively buffer and screen from view the base
and all related equipment and structures of the proposed wireless
telecommunications facility up to a height of ten (10) feet.
   13.   The wireless telecommunications facility and any and all accessory or
associated facilities shall maximize the use of building materials, colors and
textures designed to blend with the structure to which it may be affixed and to
harmonize with the natural surroundings. This shall include the utilization of
stealth, camouflage or concealment technology as may be required by the city
and as is not impracticable under the facts and circumstances.
   14.   All utilities installed for a new wireless telecommunications facility
shall be installed underground and in compliance with all laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations of the city, including specifically, but not limited to,
the National Electrical Safety Code and the National Electrical Code where
appropriate.
   15.   If deemed necessary or appropriate, an access road, turn around space
and parking shall be provided to assure adequate emergency and service access.
Maximum use of existing roads, whether public or private, shall be made to the
extent practicable. Road construction shall at all times minimize ground
disturbance and the cutting of vegetation. Road grades shall closely follow
natural contours to assure minimal visual disturbance and reduce soil erosion
and shall comply with any local or state regulations for the construction of
roads. If the current access road or turn around space is deemed in disrepair
or in need of remedial work to make it serviceable and safe and in compliance
with any applicable regulations as determined at a site visit, the application
shall contain a commitment to remedy or restore the road or turn around space
so that it is serviceable and safe and in compliance with applicable
regulations. (Ord. of 3/1/10; Ord. of 6/21/21, No. 41-21 Sec.1)
Sec. 9-3-120   Location of wireless telecommunications facilities.
   1.   Applicants for telecommunications towers shall locate, site and erect
said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with the following
priorities, in the following order:
   a.   On existing city-owned wireless telecommunications facilities without
increasing the height of the tower or structure.
   b.   On existing wireless telecommunications facilities without increasing
the height of the tower or structure.
   c.   On city-owned properties or facilities.
   d.   On properties in areas zoned M-1 Manufacturing.
   e.   On properties in areas zoned B-3 Highway Business.
   2.   Applicants for all other wireless telecommunications facilities (e.g.
distributed antenna systems or buildings) shall locate, site and construct said
wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with the following
priorities, in order:
   a.   On existing city-owned wireless telecommunications facilities without
increasing the height of the structure.
   b.   On existing wireless telecommunications facilities without increasing
the height of the structure.
   c.   On city-owned properties or facilities.
   d.   On properties in areas zoned M-1 Manufacturing.
   e.   On properties in areas zoned B-3 Highway Business.
   f.   On properties in areas zoned R-2 Residential Agriculture.
   3.   If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed
above, then a detailed explanation and justification must be provided as to why
a site of all higher priority designations was not selected. The person seeking
such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why
such a permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that
would be incurred by the applicant if the permit were not granted for the
wireless telecommunications facility as proposed.
   4.   An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating the
site proposed is the only site leased or selected or because there is an
existing lease with a landowner. An application shall address co-location as an
option. If such option is not proposed, the applicant must explain to the
reasonable satisfaction of the city why co-location is technically or
commercially impracticable. Agreements between wireless telecommunications
facility owners limiting or prohibiting co-location shall not be a valid basis
for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.
   5.   Notwithstanding the above, the city may approve any site located within
an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the city finds that the
proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the
city and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature
and character of the community and neighborhood. Conversely, the city may
direct that the proposed location be changed to another location that is more
in keeping with the goals of this article and the public interest as determined
by the city.
   6.   Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of
highest priority or highest available priority, the city may disapprove an
application for any of the following reasons:
   a.   Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
   b.   Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or
district;
   c.   The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities which
is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use
designation;
   d.   The placement and location of wireless telecommunications facilities
which would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable probability of such,
to residents, the public, employees and agents of the city, or employees of the
service provider or other service providers;
   e.   The placement and location of a wireless telecommunications facility
would result in a conflict with or compromise in or change the nature or
character of the surrounding area;
   f.   Conflicts with the provisions of this article; and
   g.   Failure to submit a complete application as required under this
article.
   7.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, for good
cause shown, such as the ability to utilize a shorter or less intrusive
facility elsewhere and still accomplish the primary service objective, the city
may require the relocation of a proposed site, including allowing for the fact
that relocating the site chosen by the applicant may require the use of more
than one (1) site to provide substantially the same service if the relocation
could result in a less intrusive facility or facilities, singly or in
combination. The existence of a lease entered into prior to the approval of an
application shall not be deemed justification for the requested location. (Ord.
of 3/1/10)
Sec. 9-3-121   Shared use of wireless telecommunications facilities structures.
   1.   The city requires the co-location of antenna arrays on existing
wireless telecommunications facilities as opposed to the construction of a new
wireless telecommunications facility or increasing the height, footprint or
profile beyond the conditions of the approved special use permit for an
existing wireless telecommunications facility, unless such is proven to be
technologically impracticable. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive
report inventorying all existing wireless telecommunications facilities and
other suitable structures within one (1) mile of the location of any proposed
new wireless telecommunications facility, unless the applicant can show that
some other distance is more appropriate and reasonable and demonstrate
conclusively why an existing wireless telecommunications facility or other
suitable structure cannot be used.
   2.   An applicant intending to co-locate on an existing wireless
telecommunications facility shall be required to document the intent of the
existing owner to permit its use by the applicant.
   3.   Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum antenna array
technologically required to provide service primarily and essentially within
the city, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown. (Ord. of 3/1/
10; Ord. of 6/21/21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-122   Type and height of wireless telecommunications facilities.
   1.   All new towers shall be of the monopole type, unless such is able to be
proven to be technologically impracticable. No new towers of a lattice or guyed
type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly granted.
   2.   The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the total height of
any wireless telecommunications facility or antenna requested and the basis
therefore. Documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all
backup data used to produce the studies at the requested height and a minimum
of ten (10) feet lower height to enable verification of the need for the
requested height.
   3.   For a new wireless telecommunications facility a reduction in the
identified size of the identified service area of ten percent (10%) or less of
the predicted service area shall not be deemed justification for exceeding the
otherwise maximum allowable height of a wireless telecommunications facility.
   4.   The maximum permitted total height of a new wireless telecommunications
facility shall be ninety (90) feet above pre-construction ground level, unless
it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area within the
community. The maximum permitted height is not an as-of-right height, but
rather the maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for
a greater height.
   5.   For a wireless facility to be located on an existing wireless
telecommunications facility, such documentation will be analyzed in the context
of the justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and
essentially within the city, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is
shown. A reduction in the size of the identified service area of ten percent
(10%) or less of the predicted service area shall not be deemed justification
for increasing the height of a facility.
   6.   Notwithstanding the preceding subsection 4. of this section, wireless
telecommunications facilities shall be no taller than the minimum height
technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage
or capacity as needed within the community (i.e. the city, and its
jurisdiction).
   7.   Documentation substantiating the height necessary to provide for the
placement of an antennal array to provide wireless service to the community
shall be submitted by the applicant prior to issuance of a zoning permit for a
new wireless telecommunications facility, i.e. tower, but shall not be required
prior to the issuance of the special use permit, unless the requested height
exceeds the ninety (90) foot maximum height. Such documentation shall be
provided with an application for the first attachment of an antenna array and
for any proposed increase in the previously permitted height.
   8.   Relief from the maximum height for new wireless telecommunications
facilities shall only be considered where evidence substantiates a taller
height is necessary for the provision of wireless service to the community, to
the exclusion of any alternative option that is not technologically or
commercially impracticable, and where denial of a taller height would have the
effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless service to the community. Such
documentation shall be provided prior to consideration of a special use permit
when the requested height exceeds the ninety (90) foot maximum height.
   9.   Prior to issuing a zoning permit for the co-location of an antenna
array on an existing wireless telecommunications facility, an applicant shall
demonstrate that the co-location is located appropriately on the wireless
telecommunications facility with the overall goal being to preserve the
carrying capacity of the wireless telecommunications facility for future co-
locations and to minimize the visual intrusiveness and impact, including the
profile of the wireless telecommunications facility.
   10.   In determining the necessary height for a wireless telecommunications
facility, or the height or placement of a co-location on a wireless
telecommunications facility, the signal strengths analyzed shall be the
threshold or lowest signal strength at which the customer equipment is designed
to function, which may be required to be determined by the manufacturer’s
published specifications for the customer equipment.
   11.   As the city has made the policy decision that more towers of a shorter
height is in the public interest, as opposed to fewer taller towers, spacing,
or the distance between towers, shall be such that the service may be provided
without exceeding the maximum permitted height. (Ord. of 3/1/10; Ord. of 6/21/
21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-123   Visibility of wireless telecommunications facilities.
   1.   Wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be artificially
lighted or marked, except as required by federal regulations.
   2.   Stealth: All new wireless telecommunications facilities, including but
not limited to towers, shall utilize stealth or camouflage techniques and
technology, unless such can be shown to be either commercially or
technologically impracticable.
   3.   Dual mode: In order to minimize the number of antenna arrays and thus
the visual impact, the city may require the use of dual mode antennas to be
used, including by two (2) different carriers, unless it can be proven that
such will not work technologically and that such would have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of service in the city.
   4.   Wireless telecommunications facilities finish/color: Structures shall
be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-preventive paint of an appropriate
color to harmonize with the surroundings and shall be maintained in accordance
with the requirements of this article.
   5.   Lighting: If lighting is legally required or proposed, the applicant
shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as unobtrusive and
inoffensive an effect as is permissible under state and federal regulations.
For any wireless telecommunications facility for which lighting is required
under the FAA’s regulations, or that for any reason has lights attached, all
such lighting shall be affixed with technology that enables the light to be
seen as intended from the air, but that prevents the ground scatter effect so
that it is not able to be seen from the ground to a height of at least twelve
(12) degrees vertical for a distance of at least one (1) mile in a level
terrain situation. Such device must be compliant with or not in conflict with
FAA regulations. A physical shield may be used, as long as the light is able to
be seen from the air, as intended by the FAA.
   6.   In the event a wireless telecommunications facility that is lighted is
modified, at the time of the modification the city may require that the tower
be retrofitted with the technology set forth in the preceding subsection 5.
   7.   Flush mounting: All new or replacement antennas, except omni-
directional whip antennas, shall be flush-mounted or as close to flush-mounted
as is technologically possible on any wireless telecommunications facility, so
long as such does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service
to the intended service area, alone or in combination with another site(s),
unless the applicant can prove that it is technologically impracticable.
   8.   Placement on building - facie: If attached to a building, all antennas
shall be mounted on the facie of the building and camouflaged so as to match
the color and, if possible, texture of the building or in a manner so as to
make the antennas as visually innocuous and undetectable as is possible given
the facts and circumstances involved. (Ord. of 3/1/10)
Sec. 9-3-124   Security of wireless telecommunications facilities.
   All wireless telecommunications facilities shall be located, fenced or
otherwise secured in a manner that prevents unauthorized access. Specifically:
   1.   All wireless telecommunications facilities, including antennas, towers
and other supporting structures, such as guy anchor points and wires, shall be
made inaccessible to individuals and constructed or shielded in such a manner
that they cannot be climbed or collided with; and
   2.   Transmitters and telecommunications control points shall be installed
in such a manner that they are readily accessible only to persons authorized to
operate or service them. (Ord. of 3/1/10)
Sec. 9-3-125   Signage.
   Wireless telecommunications facilities shall contain a sign no larger than
four (4) square feet in order to provide adequate notification to persons in
the immediate area of the presence of RF Radiation or to control exposure to RF
Radiation within a given area. A sign of the same size is also to be installed
to contain the name(s) of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the antenna(s) as
well as emergency phone number(s). The sign shall be on the equipment shelter
or cabinet of the applicant and be visible from the access point of the site
and must identify the equipment owner of the shelter or cabinet. On tower
sites, an FCC registration site, as applicable, is also to be present. The
signs shall not be lighted, unless applicable law, rule or regulation requires
lighting. No other signage, including advertising, shall be permitted. (Ord. of
3/1/10)
Sec. 9-3-126   Setbacks.
   1.   All proposed telecommunications towers and any other proposed wireless
telecommunications facility attachment structures shall be set back from
abutting parcels, recorded rights-of-way and road and street lines by the
greater of the following distances: A distance equal to the height of the
proposed tower or other wireless telecommunications facility structure plus ten
percent (10%) of the height of the telecommunications structure, otherwise
known as the fall zone, or the existing setback requirement of the underlying
zoning district, whichever is greater. Any accessory structure shall be located
within the footprint as approved in the special use permit and so as to comply
with the applicable minimum setback requirements for the property on which it
is situated. The fall zone shall be measured from the nearest portion of the
right-of-way of any public road or thoroughfare and any occupied building or
domicile. Further, the nearest portion of any access road leading to a wireless
telecommunications facility shall be no less than fifteen (15) feet from the
nearest property line.
   2.   There shall be no development of habitable buildings within the fall
zone set forth in the preceding subsection 1. (Ord. of 3/1/10; Ord. of 6/21/21,
No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-127   Fees and retention of expert assistance.
   1.   Non-refundable fees, which are set by the City Council and subject to
change as may be warranted and justified, will be charged for the following:
   a.   Zoning permit fees for the construction of a new tower or increasing
the height of a tower by more than six (6) feet;
   b.   Attaching or co-locating on an existing tower or structure, where the
height is either not increased, or is increased by six (6) feet or less; or
   c.   A modification to an existing facility.
   2.   The city may hire a consultant and/or expert necessary to assist the
city in reviewing and evaluating the application for a proposed tower, co-
location, or modification. The city may also request expert assistance for
other issues, in order to ensure the general health, safety and welfare of the
public. The cost of the expert assistance will be paid by the applicant. The
cost is included in the zoning authorization permit fee. (Ord. of 3/1/10)
Sec. 9-3-128   Procedural requirements for a special use permit.
   1.   The procedures established for conditional uses in Article P, Section
9-3-267 shall apply where wireless telecommunications facilities require a
special use permit as required or otherwise specified in this article.
   2.   The city shall schedule the required public hearing once it finds the
application is complete and is not required to set a date if the application is
not complete. The city, at any stage prior to issuing a special use permit, may
require such additional information as it deems necessary as such relates to
the issue of the siting, construction or modification of a wireless
telecommunications facility.
   3.   A special use permit shall be issued for a wireless telecommunications
structure upon Board review and approval, but the zoning permit for said
telecommunications structure shall not be issued until an applicant has
provided substantiating documentation under the section governing the placement
of the first antenna array prior to construction of a new wireless
telecommunications facility. (Ord. of 3/1/10; Ord. of 6/21/21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-129   Action on an application for a special use permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities.
   1.   The city will undertake a review of an application pursuant to this
article in a timely fashion, consistent with its responsibilities, and shall
act within a reasonable period of time given the relative complexity of the

Sec. 9-3-161   Purpose.
   The purpose of this section is:
   1.   To maintain public safety and traffic safety by ensuring that signs are
properly designed, constructed, installed, and maintained;
   2.   To minimize the distractions and obstruction of view that contribute to
traffic hazards and endanger public safety;
   3.   To protect existing development and promote high standards of quality
in new development by encouraging appropriately designed, placed, and sized
signage;
   4.   To provide an effective guide for communicating identification through
signage while preventing signs from dominating the visual appearance of the
areas in which they are located. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)
Sec. 9-3-162   Applicability.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it shall be unlawful to
construct, enlarge, move or replace any sign or cause the same to be done,
without first obtaining a sign permit for such sign from the City of Claremont.
In addition, a certificate of occupancy for the change in the use of property
shall require compliance with Article I. Not withstanding the above, changing
or replacing the permanent copy on an existing lawful sign shall not require a
permit, provided the copy change does not change the nature of the sign so as
to render it in violation of this chapter. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)
Sec. 9-3-163   General provisions.
   The following provisions shall apply to all signs.
   1.   Construction standards. All signs shall be constructed and installed in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the North Carolina State Building
Code.
   2.   Electrical standards. All illuminated signs shall be installed in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the North Carolina State
Electrical Code and all detached signs shall be illuminated by an underground
electrical source. Any illuminated sign shall be so designed or placed so as to
prevent direct or reflected light from being cast upon adjacent properties, the
public right-of-way, or the night sky.
   3.   Maintenance of signs. All signs shall be maintained in good structural
and aesthetic condition. Deficiencies such as chipped paint, broken plastic,
missing letters and exposed light bulbs shall be evidence of a lack of
maintenance.
   4.   Content. Content of message, commercial or non commercial, is not
regulated by this chapter.
   5.   No sign shall be placed so as to obstruct the clear sight triangle at a
street intersection.
   6.   Electronic message boards and/or projected imagery technology shall
require compliance with Article I dimensional and location requirements. In
addition, the minimum time between electronic message board and/or projected
imagery technology display changes shall be three seconds for on-site
commercial signs and eight seconds for billboard signs.

However, in any case the sign shall no be closer than three (3) feet to a power
or other utility line or the outside edge of street pavement.

may not be mounted on a pole or pylon, nor raised by mounting on a man-made
berm, wall, or similar structure. Supporting elements may not exceed three (3)
feet in height and are included in measurement of sign height.
 
 
   b.   A raised sign may hang from a pole and beam frame as illustrated below,
or be placed within a frame mounted on up to two (2) supporting poles.
 
 
(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)
Sec. 9-3-166   Sign measurement.

Sec. 9-3-175   Nonconforming signs.
   Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, nonconforming signs
that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this article may be
continued provided they conform to the following provisions:

extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered
in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition. Nor may
illumination be added to any nonconforming sign.
   2.   A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the
sign into complete conformity with this article.
   3.   If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not
thereafter be repaired, reconstructed or replaced except in conformity with all
the provisions of this article, and the remnants of the former sign structure
shall be cleared from the land within thirty (30) days of destruction. For
purposes of this section, a nonconforming sign is destroyed if damaged to the
extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former stature or replacing
it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value (tax value if listed for
tax purposes) of the sign so damaged.
   4.   The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does
not create any new nonconformities (for example, by creating an off-premise
sign under circumstances where such a sign would not be allowed).
   5.   If a nonconforming sign other than a billboard advertises a business,
service, commodity, accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity
that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted, that sign shall be
considered abandoned and shall be removed within thirty (30) days after such
abandonment by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located
or other party having control over such sign.
   6.   If a nonconforming billboard remains blank for a continuous period of
one hundred eighty (180) days, that billboard shall be deemed abandoned and
shall, within thirty (30) days after such abandonment, be removed by the sign
owner, owner of the property where the sign is located or other person having
control over such sign. For purposes of this section, a sign is “blank” if:
   a.   It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction
or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or
conducted; or
   b.   The message displayed becomes illegible in whole or substantial part;
or

planted buffer shall reach a minimum height of eight (8) feet. Plants used on a
buffer shall be a species that forms a continuous year-round opaque screen
within three (3) years after planting. The planted buffer shall be composed of
two (2) rows of plants no more than ten (10) feet apart in each row. One (1) of
the plant types listed in subsection 4. below shall be used, and the plants
shall be located no further apart than the distance indicated for each plant
type. The planted buffer area shall be at least ten (10) feet wide.
   2.   Commercial or business zones (B-1, B-2, B-3) that abut residential
zones (R-1, R-2) and non-residential uses in residential zones (R-1, R-2). A
planted buffer shall reach a minimum height of six (6) feet. Plants used on a
buffer shall be a species that forms a continuous year-round opaque screen
within three (3) years after planting. The planted buffer shall be composed of
one (1) row of plants no more than ten (10) feet apart in the row. One (1) of
the plant types listed in subsection 4. below shall be used, and the plants
shall be located no further apart than the distance indicated for each plant
type. The planted buffer area shall be at least ten (10) feet wide.
   3.   Buffer topographic considerations and other exceptions.

to the elevation of the edge of the adjacent area to be screened. In such cases
as the ground elevation of the location at which the screen is to be planted is
less than the elevation of the proposed building site, the required height of
the screen shall be increased in an amount equal to said difference in
elevation.
   b.   In lieu of compliance with the above buffer and screening requirement,
an applicant may submit to the Planning Director for his or her review and
approval a detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening.
   c.   In situations where the topography would render most practical required
screening noneffective, the Planning Director may allow the screening to be
located outside of the required buffer and placed in a location that will
enable the screening to be effective in meeting the intent of this section.
   4.   Plant types and spacing. Below are listed the types of plants that
shall be used in planted buffers and the maximum distance each plant type shall
be planted apart. Substitution for another plant type not listed is to be made

Planned Unit Developments
Sec. 9-3-201   Planned Unit Developments.
   Intent: The purpose of the Planned Unit Development - Residential (PUD-R)
and the Planned Unit Development - Business (PUD-B) is to encourage the
development of environments, which meet the needs of the people who live and
work in them by providing certain development privileges in exchange for
preplanning and design considerations. The PUD-R and PUD-B provide flexibility
in utilizing new development concepts and in introducing variety into
neighborhoods by encouraging mixed uses, variable lot size, and environmentally
sensitive design which promotes the conservation of open space. The Board of
Adjustment may approve this form of development in the districts that allow it
as a special use, provided that the conditions specified in this article are
met.
   1.   Permitted uses and requirements.
   a.   Permitted uses within the PUD: Uses permitted within the zoning
district for which the project site is located.
   b.   Permitted building and lot types: Building and lot types permitted
within the zoning district for which the project site is located.
   c.   Permitted accessory structures and uses: Accessory structures and uses
permitted within the zoning district for which the project site is located.
   d.   General requirements:
   (1)   At the time of application for a PUD, all land, structures and other
real property shall be in single or joint ownership of whatever form, or the
petitioner shall have the right to acquire ownership under a valid option, and
this information shall be included in the submission of an application for a
Planned Unit Development - Residential.
   (2)   A PUD shall be located on a site containing at least two (2)
contiguous acres.
   (3)   The development shall be in full compliance with all density and lot
coverage limitations and requirements of the zoning district in which the
development is to be located.
   (4)   At least ten percent (10%) of the land area for a PUD-R shall be
dedicated as permanent open/recreational space. This area shall be identified
as open/recreation space on the submitted plans and shall be recorded as such
in the Office of the Register of Deeds. This requirement may be reduced or
eliminated upon approval by the Board of Adjustment if the proposed PUD-R is
located within one- quarter (1/4) mile of a city owned and maintained
recreational area or park. The Board of Adjustment must also determine if the
existing recreational area or park will meet the needs of the PUD-R and
surrounding development before it reduces any of the open space requirements.
   (5)   All new PUDs in R-1, R-2, B-1, B-2 and B-3 districts shall provide
concrete sidewalks along all existing and proposed public streets within.
Sidewalks shall only be required on the internal side of existing streets that
are on the perimeter of the PUD in the above listed zoning districts. Sidewalks
shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide and four (4) inches thick except that
at non-residential driveway entrances the sidewalk shall be six (6) inches
thick. Sidewalks will not be required along alleys. All pedestrian segments
shall meet or exceed ADA standards and shall be constructed of concrete.
   (6)   The Board of Adjustment may require buffering around the proposed PUD.
   (7)   In approving an application for a PUD, the Board of Adjustment shall
find that the proposed development will be compatible with comprehensive, land
use, and neighborhood development plans, will not place an excessive traffic
load on local streets, that the site can be developed according to a site plan
that will be compatible with existing neighborhood development, and that the
site can be provided with adequate utility services.
   (8)   Site development within the PUD shall conform to the schematic plan
and associated requirements of the special use permit approved by the Board of
Adjustment. Modification of the development plan may be made by the Board of
Adjustment subsequent to their initial approval upon application by the owner
of the property.
   (9)   Following approval by the Board of Adjustment of a PUD special use
permit, the property for which approval was granted shall be labeled “PUD-R” or
“PUD-B” on the official zoning map.
   e.   Application requirements: An application for a special use permit to
allow a PUD shall be accompanied by schematic plans showing the information
listed below. In addition, the Board of Adjustment may require additional
information necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (1)   Proposed location of buildings and their general exterior dimensions;
   (2)   Proposed use of all the land within the area requested for a PUD;
   (3)   Dimensions between all buildings and from buildings to property lines;

Administration, Enforcement and Penalties
Sec. 9-3-241   Zoning Enforcement Officer.
   This chapter shall be administered and enforced by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer who shall be appointed by the City Manager, and is hereby empowered:
   1.   To issue a zoning permit when these regulations have been followed or,
to refuse to issue the same in the event of noncompliance. Written notice of
such refusal and reason therefore shall be given to the applicant.
   2.   To collect the fees set forth herein for a zoning permit, variances,
appeals, rezonings, special use permits and subdivisions.
   3.   To make and keep all records necessary and appropriate to the office,
including record of the issuance and denial of all zoning permits and of
receipt of complaints of violation of this chapter and action taken to the
same.
   4.   To inspect any building and/or land to determine whether any violations
of this chapter have been committed or exist.
   5.   To enforce this chapter and take all necessary steps to remedy any
condition found in violation by ordering in writing the discontinuance of
illegal uses or illegal work in progress and may institute injunction,
mandamus, or other necessary action.
   6.   To keep the Board of Adjustment advised of all matters other than
routine duties pertaining to the enforcement of this chapter and to transmit
all applications and records pertaining to appeals, variances, or requests for
special use approval. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-242   Zoning permit required.
   Within the corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of
Claremont no building, sign or other structure shall be erected, moved, added
to or structurally altered before a zoning permit has been issued by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer of the City of Claremont. Written notice of such
determination refusal and reason therefore shall be given to the applicant and
property owner (G.S. 160D-403(b)), the Zoning Enforcement Officer may provide
their determination in print or electronic form; if electronic form is used
then it must be protected from further editing (G.S. 160D-403(a)). (Ord. of 12-
7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-243   Application for zoning permit.
   1.   Each application for a zoning permit to the Zoning Enforcement Officer
of the City of Claremont shall be accompanied by a fee, set by the City
Council, and a plan in duplicate, drawn to scale, one (1) copy of which shall
be returned to the owner upon approval. The plan shall show the following:
   a.   The actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon;
   b.   The size and location of all buildings existing on the lot;
   c.   The size and location of the proposed new construction;
   d.   The existing and intended use of all parts of the land or building;
   e.   Such other information with regard to the lot and neighboring lots as
may be necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of this chapter.
   2.   Vesting. Zoning permits expire one year after issuance unless work has
substantially commenced. Expiration of a local development approval does not
affect the duration of a vested right established as a site specific vesting
plan, a multiphase development plan, a development agreement, or vested rights
established under common law. A site specific plan or planned unit development
shall remain vested for a period of two years. The City may provide for rights
to be vested for a period exceeding two years but not exceeding five years. The
determination for extension by the City shall be made following the processes
specified for the approval of a site specific or planned unit development
vesting plan (G.S. 160D-108.1). A multi-phase development shall remain vested
for a period of seven years from the time a site plan is approved. For the
purposes of this chapter, a multi-phase development must contain 25 acres or
more and is submitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more
than one phase and is a master plan that includes a requirement to offer land
for public use (G.S. 160D-108(d)).
   3.   Revocation of development approvals. Development approvals may be
revoked by the local government issuing the development approval by notifying
the permit holder in writing stating the reason for the revocation. The local
government shall follow the same development review and approval process
required for issuance of the development approval, including any required
notice or hearing, in the review and approval of any revocation of that
approval. Development approvals shall be revoked for any substantial departure
from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure
to comply with the requirements of any applicable local development regulation
or any State law delegated to the local government for enforcement purposes in
lieu of the State; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in
securing the permit approval. Any development approval mistakenly issued in
violation of an applicable State or local law may also be revoked. The
revocation of a development approval by a staff member may be appealed to the
board of adjustment pursuant to G.S. 160D-405. If an appeal is filed regarding
a development regulation adopted by a local government pursuant to this
Chapter, the provisions of G.S. 160D-405(e) regarding stays shall be applicable
(G.S. 160D-403(f)). (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-244   Certificate of occupancy required.
   No land within the corporate limits or extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction
of the City of Claremont shall be used or occupied and no building within the
corporate limits or extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction of the City of
Claremont shall hereafter be erected, structurally altered, converted or
changed in use until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer stating that the building or the proposed use
thereof complies with the provisions of this chapter. A certificate of
occupancy either for the whole or a part of a building shall be applied for
coincident with the application for a zoning permit and shall be issued within
ten (10) days after the erection or structural alteration of such building, or
part, shall have been completed in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer for a period not exceeding six (6) months during
alterations or construction for partial occupancy of a building pending its
completion, or for bazaars, carnivals, and revivals, provided that such
temporary permit shall require such conditions and safeguards as will protect
the safety of the occupants and the public. A record of all certificates shall
be kept on file in the office of the Zoning Enforcement Officer and copies
shall be furnished on request to any person requesting it. (Ord. of 12-7-04,
No. 37-02)
Sec. 9-3-245   Penalties for violations.
   1.   Any person violating any provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished for each offense by a fine
not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00) or by imprisonment not to exceed
thirty (30) days.
   2.   In addition to the penalty in subsection 1. above, a violation of this
chapter shall also be a civil offense and shall subject the offender to a civil
penalty in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day that the violation
continues. Any person violating this chapter shall be issued a written
citation. The penalty shall be paid to the City of Claremont within seventy-two
(72) hours from the time of issuance of the written citation.
   3.   Each day’s continuing violation shall be a separate and distinct
offense.
   4.   In addition to the penalties imposed under 1. and 2. above, the
provisions of this chapter may also be enforced through equitable remedies
issued by a court of competent jurisdiction including injunction and order of
abatement.
   5.   This chapter may be enforced by any one, all or a combination of the
remedies authorized herein. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)

involved, if the landowner is not the holder of the development approval, by
personal delivery, electronic delivery, or first class mail and may be provided
by similar means to the occupant of the property or the person undertaking the
work or activity. The notice of violation may be posted on the property. The
person providing the notice of violation shall certify to the local government
that the notice was provided and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in
the absence of fraud (160D-404(a)).
   In case any building is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
repaired, converted or maintained, or any building or land is used in violation
of this chapter, the Zoning Enforcement Officer or any other appropriate city
authority or any person who would be damaged by such violation, in addition to
other remedies, may institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action
in proceeding to prevent the violation.
   In case any sign shall be installed, erected or constructed in violation of
any of the terms of this chapter, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall notify
by personal notice or registered mail the owner or lessee thereof to alter such
sign so as to comply with this chapter and to secure the necessary permit
therefore or to remove the sign. If such an order is not complied with within
ten (10) days, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall remove the sign at the
expense of the owner or lessee thereof. In the event that such sign should
become insecure, or in danger of falling, the person maintaining the same
shall, upon written notice from the Zoning Enforcement Officer, forthwith, in
case of immediate danger, and in any case, within ten (10) days secure it in a
manner approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02;

than seven (7) members participate officially in any meeting or hearing. Should
population in either the city or extraterritorial jurisdiction change enough to
require an additional member to the Planning Board or the Zoning Board of
Adjustment then numbers appointed by the City Council and the Claremont County
Board of Commissioners will be changed accordingly.

Board of Adjustment
Sec. 9-3-261   Establishment of Board of Adjustment.
   A Board of Adjustment is hereby established as provided in Section 160D-302
of the General Statutes of North Carolina. The Planning Board shall function as
the Board of Adjustment as provided in Section 160D-302(b) of the General
Statutes of North Carolina. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide
applications for special use permits, requests for variances, and appeals of
decisions of administrative officials charged with enforcement of the code of
ordinances. As used in this section, the term “decision” includes any final and
binding order, requirement or determination. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord.

Sec. 9-3-262   Jurisdiction and decision of Board of Adjustment.
   The concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the Board of Adjustment
- six (6) of the seven (7) voting members - shall be necessary to approve any
variance of the ordinance. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Zoning Enforcement Officer of the City of Claremont, or to
decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is required to pass
under the ordinance. A simple majority vote shall be all that is required for
issuance of a special use permit. In accordance with N.C.G.S. 160D-109
(d),members of the Board of Adjustment shall not participate in or vote on any
quasi-judicial matter in a manner that would violate affected persons'

prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex
parte communications, a close familial, business, or other associational
relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of
the matter. If an objection is raised to a board member's participation at or
prior to the hearing or vote on that matter and that member does not recuse
himself or herself, the remaining members of the board shall by majority vote
rule on the objection. For purposes of this section, a close familial
relationship means a spouse, parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, or
grandchild. The term includes the step, half, and in-law relationships.12 (G.S.
160D-109(d), (e), (f)). Alternate members may serve temporarily (including
voting) in the absence or temporary disqualification of any regular member or
to fill a vacancy pending appointment of a regular member. Alternate members
shall be eligible for appointment by the City Council as a regular member of
the Board of Adjustment.

conducted as follows:
   1.   Hearings.
   a.   All hearings of the Board shall be open to the public.
   b.   No final action shall be taken on any matter unless a quorum is
present. A quorum shall consist of a majority of the total members of the
Board.
   c.   A notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the person or entity whose
appeal, application, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of
the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate
the hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land
that is the subject of the hearing; and to any other persons entitled to
receive notice as provided by the zoning ordinance. In the absence of evidence
to the contrary, the city may rely on the county tax listing to determine the
owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in
the mail at least ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the
hearing. Within that same time period, the city shall also prominently post a
notice of the hearing on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an
adjacent street or highway right-of-way.
   d.   The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, an indication
of such fact. All decisions shall be made within a reasonable time and shall be
based upon competent, material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each
decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Board's determination of
contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. The decision
is effective upon filing the written decision with the City Clerk. The final
disposition of appeals shall be made by recorded resolution indicating the
reason of the Board therefore, all of which shall be a public record. The
decision of the Board shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail
or by first class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person who
has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision
becomes effective. The Chairman of the Board of Adjustment shall certify that
proper notice of the decision has been made at the time of filing of the
written decision with the Clerk.
   2.   Appeals. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals
decisions of administrative officials charged with enforcement of the zoning
ordinance and may hear appeals arising out of any other ordinance that
regulates land use or development, pursuant to N.C.G.S. 160D-405, except as
provided by 160D-1403.1, and all of the following:
   a.   Any person who has standing under N.C.G.S. 160D-1042(c) or the city may
appeal a decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a
notice of appeal with the City Clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the
grounds for the appeal.
   b.   The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the
owner of the property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who
sought the decision, if different from the owner. The written notice shall be
delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail.
   c.   The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written
notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal
shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive
notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.
   d.   It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to
appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing
the words "Zoning Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" in letters at least six
inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information
about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of
the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least 10 days.
Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting
shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the
posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Absent an
ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall not be required.
   e.   The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the
appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if
the appellant is not the owner.
   f.   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays
enforcement of the action appealed from unless the official who made the
decision certifies to the Board of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been
filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in
nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In
that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining
order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not
stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited
hearing of the appeal and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal
within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed
use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further
review of an application for permits or permissions to use such property; in
these situations the appellant may request and the Board may grant a stay of a
final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the issue
being appealed.
   g.   The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a
witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in
the notice of appeal. If any party or the city would be unduly prejudiced by
the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal the board
shall continue the hearing. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any
order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The Board
shall have all the powers of the official who made the decision. (Ord. of 12-7-
04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 8-7-06, No. 18-06; Ord. of 3/3/14, No. 09-13; Ord. of 6-
21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-265   Stay of proceedings.
   An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Zoning Enforcement Officer certifies to the Board of
Adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in his opinion cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
of Adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer and on due cause shown. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord.

(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 8-7-06, No. 18-06; Ord. of 6-21-21, No.
41-21)
Sec. 9-3-267   Powers and duties of Board of Adjustment.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have the powers and duties enumerated below:
   1.   Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer in the enforcement of this chapter. A majority vote
of the Board of Adjustment members is required to decide any appeal.
   2.   Special uses. To grant in particular cases and subject to the
appropriate conditions and safeguards, permits for special uses as authorized
by this chapter and set forth as special uses under the various use districts.
A majority vote of the Board of Adjustment members is required to grant any
special use. The Board shall not grant a special use permit unless and until:
   a.   A written application for a special use permit is submitted to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer indicating the section of this chapter under which
the special use permit is sought;
   b.   A public hearing is held. In accordance with Section 9-3-264, notice of
such public hearing shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal,
application or request is the subject of the hearing, to the owner of the
property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the
hearing, to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that
is the subject of the hearing or within one hundred (100) feet of the property
for which the special use permit is sought.
   c.   The Board of Adjustment finds that in the particular case in question
the use for which the special use permit is sought.
   1.   Does not materially endanger the public health or safety.
   2.   Meets all required conditions and specifications
   3.   Would not substantially injure the value of adjoining property or, that
if it does, there is a public necessity for siting the use as proposed.
   4.   Will be in harmony with the area in which it is located and will be in
general conformity with adopted plans (including but not limited to
Thoroughfare Plans, Metropolitan Transportation Plans, Small Area Plans, Action
Plans, Comprehensive or Land Development Plans, Recreation Plans, Downtown
Development Plans and Economic Development Plans).
   d.   Compliance with other codes. Granting a special use permit does not
exempt the applicant from complying with all of the requirements of building
codes or other ordinances.
   e.   Revocation. If at any time after a special use permit has been issued,
the Board of Adjustment finds that the conditions imposed and agreements made
have not been or are not being fulfilled by the holder of a special use permit,
the permit shall be terminated and the operation of such a use discontinued. If
a special use permit is terminated for any reason, it may be reinstated only
after a public hearing is held.
   f.   Expiration. In any case where a special use permit has not been
exercised within the time limit set by the Board of Adjustment or within a
period of one year if no specific time limit has been set the without further
action the permit shall be null and void. Exercised, as set forth in this
division, shall mean that binding contracts for construction of the main
building shall have been let, or in the absence of contracts, that the main
building is under construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite
conditions involving substantial investment are contracted for, in substantial
development, or completed (sewerage, drainage, etc). When construction is not a
part of the use, exercised shall mean that the use is in operation in
compliance with the conditions set forth in the permit.
   g.   Careful record. A careful record of such application and plat, together
with a record of the action taken thereon, shall be kept in the office of the
Zoning Enforcement Officer.
   h.   Minor modifications to a special use permit may be administratively
approved by the zoning administrator if issues arise after the special use
permit has been approved by the Board of Adjustment that keep the applicant
from carrying out the strict interpretation of the ruling. The Zoning
Administrator is authorized to review and approve administratively a minor
modification to an approved special use permit. Minor modifications include
reconfiguring parking design, changing landscaping or buffering arrangements,
or slightly altering road and lot configurations for a development that has
already gone through the full approval process, or similar minor modifications
subject to the following limitations.
   (1)   General Limitations. The minor modification:
   A.   Does not involve a change in uses permitted or the density of overall
development permitted;
   B.   Does not increase the impacts generated by the development on traffic
or similar impacts beyond what was projected for the original development
approval; and
   C.   Meets all other ordinance requirements.
   D.   An adjustment to landscape standards up to 10% percent of required
landscaping.
   3.   Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances
from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owning to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
the chapter will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed,
public safety and welfaresecured, and substantial justice done. To vary any
provisions of this article, a concurring four-fifths (4/5) vote of the members
of the Board is required. The existence of a non-conforming use of neighboring
land, buildings, or structures in the same district or of permitted or non-
conforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the
requested variance. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out
the strict letter of a zoning ordinance, the Board of Adjustment may vary any
of the provisions of the ordinance upon a showing of the following:
   a.   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the
ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
   b.   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property
such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal
circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common
to the neighborhood of the general public may not be the basis for granting a
variance.
   c.   The hardship did not result from the actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing the property with knowledge that the
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as self- created hardship.
   d.   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose and
intent of the ordinance, such that public safety, is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.
   e.   Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance provided that the
conditions are reasonable and related to the variance.
   f.   The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or
structure which is not permitted by right or by special exception in the
district involved.
   g.   Any other ordinance that regulates land use or development may provide
for variances consistent with the provisions of this division.
   4.   Decision of the Board of Adjustment. In exercising the above mentioned
power, the Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may
modify any order, decision or determination and to that end shall have the
power of the official from whom the appeal is taken. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-
02; Ord. of 8-7-06, No. 18-06; Ord. of 3/3/14, No. 09-13; Ord. of 9-26-16, No.
06-16; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-268   Appeals from Board of Adjustment.
   Any person or persons, jointly or severally, that have standing under G.S.
160D-1402, may appeal a decision of the Board. An appeal is taken by presenting
to the Superior Court of Catawba County a petition duly verified, setting forth
that such decision is illegal in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of
illegality, whereupon such decision of said Board shall be subject to review by
certiorari as provided by law G.S. 160D-1402. The petition to appeal shall be
filed within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of
the City Clerk, but not thereafter, or after a written copy thereof is given in
accordance with G.S. 160D-406(j). When first-class mail is used to deliver
notice, three days shall be added to the time to file the petition. G.S. 160D-
1405(d).
   When hearing an appeal, the hearing shall be based on the record stated in
G.S. 160D-406(h)(i)(j) and (k). Quasi-judicial decisions shall be subject to
review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari
pursuant to G.S. 160D-1402. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 8-7-06, No.

ARTICLE Q
Amendments
Sec. 9-3-271   Procedure for amendments.
   The City Council may amend, supplement or change the text regulations and
zoning district lines according to the following procedures:
   1.   Initiation of amendments. Proposed changes or amendments may be
initiated by the City Council, Planning Board, Board of Adjustment, or by one
or more owners or lessees of property within the area proposed to be changed or
affected.
   2.   Petition. A petition for any change or amendment shall contain a
description and/or statement of the present and proposed zoning regulation or
district boundary to be applied and the names and addresses of the owner or
owners of the property. Such petition shall be filed with the Zoning
Enforcement Officer not later than three (3) weeks prior to the meeting at
which the petition is to be considered.
   3.   Fee. A fee, set by the City Council, shall be paid to the City Clerk of
the City of Claremont, North Carolina, for each petition for an amendment to
cover the costs of advertising and other administrative expenses involved.
(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 8-7-06, No. 18-06)
Sec. 9-3-272   Action by Planning Board.
   The Planning Board shall consider and make recommendations to the City
Council concerning every proposed amendment, supplement, change, modification
or repeal to this chapter as directed in G.S. 160D-604. The Planning Board, at
its own discretion, may hold a public hearing if deemed necessary by the
Planning Board. Otherwise, the Planning Board will send its recommendation
directly to the City Council who shall hold a public hearing for every proposed
zoning amendment.
   Members of the Planning Board shall not participate in or vote on any zoning
amendment matter in a manner that would violate affected persons'
constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations
of due process include, but are not limited to, a close familial, business, or
other associational relationship with an affected person, or a financial
interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised to a board
member's participation at or prior to the hearing or vote on that matter and
that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members of the
board shall by majority vote rule on the objection. For purposes of this
section, a close familial relationship means a spouse, parent, child, brother,
sister, grandparent, or grandchild. The term includes the step, half, and in-
law relationships.12 (G.S. 160D-109(d), (e), (f)). (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02;
Ord. of 8-7-06, No. 18-06; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-273   City Council consideration.
   The City Council shall consider changes and amendments to this chapter as
often as necessary, provided, however, that should the City Council deny a
request for a zoning amendment, it shall not thereafter accept any other
petition for the same change of zoning district affecting the same property, or
any portion thereof, until the expiration of one (1) year from the date of such
previous denial.
   Plan consistency. When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map
amendment, the City Council shall approve a brief statement describing whether
its action is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive plan.
The requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear
indication in the minutes of the City Council, that at the time of action on
the amendment, the City Council was aware of and considered the planning
board's recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive
plan. If the amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with
the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending
any future land use map in the approved plan and no additional request or
application for a plan amendment shall be required. A plan amendment and a
zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The plan consistency statement
is not subject to judicial review. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a
"large-scale rezoning" under G.S. 160D-602(b), the City Council statement
describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how
the analysis and polices in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the
action taken.
   Members of the City Council shall not participate in or vote on any zoning
amendment matter in a manner that would violate affected persons'
constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations
of due process include, but are not limited to, a close familial, business, or
other associational relationship with an affected person, or a financial
interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised to a board
member's participation at or prior to the hearing or vote on that matter and
that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members of the
board shall by majority vote rule on the objection. For purposes of this
section, a close familial relationship means a spouse, parent, child, brother,
sister, grandparent, or grandchild. The term includes the step, half, and in-
law relationships.12 (G.S. 160D-109(d), (e), (f)). (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02;
Ord. of 8-7-06, No. 18-06; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-3-274   Required notifications.
   1.   Legal notice of public hearing. No amendment shall be adopted by the
City Council until after public notice and hearing. In accordance with N.C.G.S.
160D-601, notice of public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City of Claremont at least once each week for two (2)
successive weeks prior to the hearing. The first notice shall appear in the
newspaper at least ten (10) days but not more than twenty-five (25) days prior
to the hearing.
   2.   Mail notice requirements. In accordance with N.C.G.S. 160D-601,
whenever the amendment involves a change in the zoning classification of a
parcel of land, the owner of that parcel of land as shown on the county tax
listing, and the owners of all parcels of land abutting or within one hundred
(100) linear feet of that parcel of land as shown on the county tax listing,
shall be mailed a notice of the proposed reclassification and a notice of the
public hearing required in subsection 1. above. Such notice shall be sent by
first class mail to the last address listed for such owners on the county tax
listing. The person responsible for making the mailed notice shall certify to
the City Council that such notice was indeed prepared and mailed.
   3.   Substitute notice.
   a.   In accordance with N.C.G.S. 160D-601 individual mailed notices may be
waived in lieu of a substitute notice if the amendment meets at least one of
the following criteria:
   (1)   If the zoning reclassification directly involves more than fifty (50)
properties, owned by a total of at least fifty (50) different owners;
   (2)   If the proposal involves an amendment to the text of this chapter such
that it changes the permitted, conditional, or accessory uses of a zoning
district;
   (3)   If the city is adopting a water supply watershed protection program as
required by N.C.G.S. 143-214.5.
   b.   Notice requirements for amendments meeting any of the three criteria of
subsection 3(a) above are as follows:
   (1)   Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City of Claremont at least once each week for four
(4) consecutive weeks prior to the hearing. The notice must include a map no
less than one-half (½) the size of the newspaper page. The map must show the
boundaries of the area affected by the proposed amendment;
   (2)   The city must post at least one (1) or more prominent signs
immediately adjacent to the subject area. The signs must be of a type and size
that may be reasonably expected to provide adequate notice of the proposal to
the public;
   (3)   The city must notify by first class mail any property owner who
resides outside the city’s zoning jurisdiction or outside the circulation area
of the newspaper in which the notice is published. The notice must be mailed to
the last address listed for such owners on the most recent county tax listing.

41-21)
Sec. 9-3-275   City Council action.
   Before taking such lawful action as it may deem advisable, the City Council
shall consider the Planning Board’s recommendations on each proposed zoning
amendment. If no recommendations are received from the Planning Board within
thirty (30) days after their meeting, the governing board may act on the
amendment without the planning board report. Under no circumstances shall the
City Council adopt such amendments that would cause this chapter to violate the
watershed protection rules as adopted by the North Carolina Environmental
Management Commission. Amendments affecting the watershed protection portions
of this chapter shall be filed with the North Carolina Division of
Environmental Management, the North Carolina Division of Environmental Health,
and the North Carolina Division of Community Assistance. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No.

General Provisions
Sec. 9-4-1   Title.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the subdivision ordinance of
the city and may be referred to as the subdivision ordinance.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92; Ord. of 3-6-06, No. 5-06)
Sec. 9-4-2   Purpose.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures and standards for the
development and subdivision of land within the territorial jurisdiction of the
city. It is further designed to provide for the orderly growth and development
of the city; for the coordination of streets and highways within proposed
subdivisions with existing or planned streets and highways and with other
public facilities; for the dedication or reservation of recreation areas
serving residents of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision and of
rights-of-way or easements for street and utility purposes; and for the
distribution of population and traffic in a manner that will avoid congestion
and overcrowding and will create conditions essential to public health, safety,
and the general welfare. This chapter is designed to further facilitate
adequate water, sewerage, parks, schools, and playgrounds, and also to
facilitate the further resubdivision of larger tracts into smaller parcels of
land.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92; Ord. of 3-6-06, No. 5-06)
Sec. 9-4-3   Authority.
   This chapter is hereby adopted under the authority and provisions of the
General Statutes of North Carolina, Chapter 160D, Article 8.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-4-4   Jurisdiction.
   The regulations contained herein, as provided in G.S. 160D Article 8; 160D-
903 shall govern each and every subdivision within the city and the city’s
extraterritorial jurisdiction.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-4-5   Prerequisite to plat recordation.
   After the effective date of this chapter, each major subdivision plat of
land within the city's jurisdiction shall be approved by the City Council on
recommendation from the Planning Board prior to plat recordation. Minor
subdivisions, as defined in this chapter, shall be approved by the Subdivision
Administrator prior to plat recordation. Nothing herein compels the approval of
any proposed subdivision by the City Council or the Subdivision Administrator
except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92; Ord. of 3-6-06, No. 5-06)
Sec. 9-4-6   Acceptance of streets.
   No street shall be maintained by the city nor street dedication accepted for
ownership and maintenance in any subdivision for which a plat is required to be
approved unless and until such final plat has been approved by the city.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92)
Sec. 9-4-7   Thoroughfare plans.
   Where a proposed subdivision includes any part of a thoroughfare which has
been designated as such upon the officially adopted thoroughfare plan of the
city, such part of such thoroughfare shall be platted by the subdivider in the
location shown on the plan and at the width specified in this chapter.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92)
Sec. 9-4-8   School sites on land use plan.
   If the city and the Catawba County Board of Education have jointly
determined the specific location and size of any school sites to be reserved
and this information appears in the land development plan, the Planning Board
shall immediately notify the Board of Education whenever a sketch plan for a
subdivision is submitted which includes all or part of a school site to be
reserved. The Board of Education shall promptly decide whether it still wishes
the site to be reserved. If the Board of Education does not wish to reserve the
site, it shall so notify the Planning Board. If the Board of Education does
wish to reserve the site, the subdivision shall not be approved without such
reservation. The Board of Education shall then have 18 months beginning on the
date of final approval of the subdivision within which to acquire the site by
purchase or by initiating condemnation proceedings. If the Board of Education
has not purchased or begun proceedings to condemn the site within 18 months,

ARTICLE B
LEGAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 9-4-11   General procedure for final plat approval.
   (a)   After the effective date of this chapter, no subdivision plat of land
within the city’s jurisdiction shall be filed or recorded until it has been
submitted to and approved by the appropriate Board or official as set forth in
section 9-4-5 of this chapter, and until this approval is entered in writing on
the face of the plat by the City Council and attested by the City Clerk for
major subdivisions, or the Subdivision Administrator for minor subdivisions.
   (b)   The Register of Deeds shall not file or record a plat of a subdivision
of land located within the territorial jurisdiction of the city that has not
been approved in accordance with these provisions, nor shall the Clerk of
Superior Court order or direct the recording of a plat if the recording would
be in conflict with this section.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92; Ord. of 3-6-06, No. 5- 06; Ord. of 6-21-21, No.
41-21)
Sec. 9-4-12   Statement by owner.
   The owner of land shown on a subdivision plat submitted for recording, or
his authorized agent, shall sign a statement on the plat stating whether or not
any land shown thereon is within the subdivision-regulation jurisdiction of the
city.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92)
Sec. 9-4-13   Effect of plat approval on dedications.
   Pursuant to G.S. 160D-806, the approval of a plat shall not be deemed to
constitute or affect the acceptance by the municipality or public of the
dedication of any street or other ground, public utility line, or other public
facility shown on the plat. However, the City Council may by resolution accept
any dedication made to the public of lands or facilities for streets, parks,
public utility lines, or other public purposes, when the lands or facilities
are located within its subdivision regulation jurisdiction. Acceptance of
dedication of lands or facilities located within the subdivision regulation
jurisdiction but outside the corporate limits of the municipality shall not
place on the city any duty to open, operate, repair, or maintain any street,
utility line, or other land or facility, and the municipality shall in no event
be held to answer in any civil action or proceeding for failure to open, repair
or maintain any street located outside its corporate limits.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-21)
Sec. 9-4-14   Penalties for violation.
   (a)   After the effective date of this chapter, any person who, being the
owner or agent of the owner of any land within the territorial jurisdiction of
this chapter, thereafter subdivides his land by reference to, exhibition of, or
any other use of the plat showing a subdivision of land before the plat has
been properly recorded in the Office of the Catawba County Register of Deeds,
shall be guilty of a Class I misdemeanor. The description by metes and bounds
in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling
or transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The
city, through its attorney or other official designated by the City Council,
may enjoin illegal subdivision, transfer or sale of land by action for
injunction. Further, violators of this chapter shall be subject, upon
conviction, to fine and/or imprisonment as provided by G.S. 14-4 (G.S. 160D-
807).
   (b)   The violation of any provision of this chapter shall subject the
offender to a civil penalty in the amount of $50 to be recovered by the city.
Violators shall be issued a written citation which must be paid within ten
days.
   (c)   Each day’s continuing violation of this chapter shall be a separate
and distinct offense.
   (d)   Notwithstanding subsection (b) above, this chapter may be enforced by
appropriate equitable remedies issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the use of
remedies available to the city. The city may seek to enforce this chapter by
using any one, all, or a combination of remedies.
   (f)   The provisions of this section do not prohibit any owner or its agent
from entering into contracts to sell or lease by reference to an approved
preliminary plat for which a final plat has not yet been properly approved
under the subdivision regulation or recorded with the register of deeds,
provided the contract does all of the following:
   (1)   Incorporates as an attachment a copy of the preliminary plat
referenced in the contract and obligates the owner to deliver to the buyer a
copy of the recorded plat prior to closing and conveyance.
   (2)   Plainly and conspicuously notifies the prospective buyer or lessee
that a final subdivision plat has not been approved or recorded at the time of
the contract, that no governmental body will incur any obligation to the
prospective buyer or lessee with respect to the approval of the final
subdivision plat, that changes between the preliminary and final plats are
possible, and that the contract or lease may be terminated without breach by
the buyer or lessee if the final recorded plat differs in any material respect
from the preliminary plat.
   (3)   Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat does not differ
in any material respect from the plat referred to in the contract, the buyer or
lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any earlier than
five days after the delivery of a copy of the final recorded plat.
   (4)   Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat differs in any
material respect from the preliminary plat referred to in the contract, the
buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any
earlier than 15 days after the delivery of the final recorded plat, during
which 15-day period the buyer or lessee may terminate the contract without
breach or any further obligation and may receive a refund of all earnest money
or prepaid purchase price.
   (g)   The provisions of this section do not prohibit any owner or its agent
from entering into contracts to sell or lease land by reference to an approved
preliminary plat for which a final plat has not been properly approved under
the subdivision regulation or recorded with the register of deeds where the
buyer or lessee is any person who has contracted to acquire or lease the land
for the purpose of engaging in the business of construction of residential,
commercial, or industrial buildings on the land, or for the purpose of resale
or lease of the land to persons engaged in that kind of business, provided that
no conveyance of that land may occur and no contract to lease it may become
effective until after the final plat has been properly approved under the
subdivision regulation and recorded with the register of deeds.

Sec. 9-4-15   Separability.
   Should any section or provision of this chapter be decided by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92)
Sec. 9-4-16   Variances.
   The Board of Adjustments may authorize a variance from these regulations
when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance. In
granting any variance, the Board shall make the findings required below, taking
into account the nature of the proposed subdivision, the existing use of land
in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed
subidivsion and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic
conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the Board
finds:
   (a)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the
regulation. It is not necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
   (b)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability.
   (c)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the
property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-
created hardship.
   (d)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.
   Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the
conditions are reasonably related to the variance (G.S. 160D-705).

Sec. 9-4-17.   Amendments.
   (a)   The City Council may from time to time amend the terms of this
chapter, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been
proposed by or shall have been submitted to the Planning Board for review and
recommendation. The Board shall have 30 days from the time the proposed
amendment is submitted to it within which to submit its report. If the Board
fails to submit a report within the specified time, it shall be deemed to have
recommended approval of the amendment.
   (b)   No amendment shall be adopted by the governing body until they have
held a public hearing on the amendment. Notice of the public hearing shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city area at least once
a week for two consecutive calendar weeks prior to the hearing. The initial
notice shall appear not more than 25 nor less than ten days prior to the
hearing date. In computing the ten-to-twenty-five day period, the date of first
publication shall be counted, but the date of the hearing shall not be counted.

Sec. 9-4-18   Abrogation.
   It is not intended that this chapter repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or
interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions,
agreements, rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued
pursuant to law. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall govern.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92)
Sec. 9-4-19   Re-enactment and repeal of existing subdivision chapter.
   This chapter in part carries forward by re-enactment some of the provisions
of the subdivision regulations of Claremont, adopted by the City Council in
June, 1978, as amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-
enact and continue in force such existing provisions so that all rights and
liabilities that have accrued hereunder are preserved and may be enforced. All
provisions of the subdivision regulations of the city enacted in June, 1978, as
amended, which are not continued in effect are hereby repealed. All suits at
law or in equity and/or all prosecutions resulting from the effect, which are
now pending in any of the courts of the United States, shall not be abated or
abandoned by reason of adoption of this chapter, but shall be prosecuted to
their finality the same as if this chapter had not been adopted, any and all
violations of the existing subdivision regulations, prosecutions for which have
not yet been instituted, may be hereafter filed and prosecuted, and nothing in
this chapter shall be construed as to abandon, abate or dismiss any litigation
or prosecution now pending, and/or which may heretofore have been instituted or
prosecuted.

   Pursuant to G.S. 160D-804; 804.1, a final plat shall be prepared, approved,
and recorded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter whenever any

(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92; Ord. of 3-6-06, No. 5-06; Ord. of 6-21-21, No. 41-
21)
Sec. 9-4-31   Approval prerequisite to plat recordation.
   Pursuant to G.S. 160D-803, no final plat of a subdivision within the
jurisdiction of the city as established in section

street;
   (2)   Not involving any new street or prospectively requiring any new street
for access to interior property;

Sec. 9-4-33   Approval process for minor subdivisions.
   If the land to be subdivided meets the requirements of a minor subdivision
as defined in section
9-4-32 above, the subdivider will not have to follow the same procedures as for
a major subdivision. The review process for minor subdivisions shall be
adequate to protect the public interest, but shall also provide minimum delay
and expense to the subdivider. A preliminary plat is not required. The
subdivider may go from a sketch plan to a final plat with approval of the
subdivision administrator. However, the following minor plat approval process
may be used only where the subdivision meets the requirements of section
9-4-32 above.
(Ord. of 4-6-92, No. 190-92; Ord. of 3-6-06, No. 5-06)
Sec. 9-4-34   Procedure for review of minor subdivisions.

subdivision, if applicable; and
   (11)   A statement from the Catawba County Health Department that a copy of
the sketch plan has been submitted to them, if septic tanks or other on-site
water or wastewater systems are to be used in the subdivision.
   (b)   The subdivision administrator shall review the sketch plan for general
compliance with the requirements of this article, and shall advise the
subdivider or his agent of the regulations pertaining to the proposed minor
subdivision and the procedures to be followed in the preparation and submission
of the final plat.
   (c)   The subdivision administrator, after determining that all requirements
of this article have been met, shall advise the subdivider to proceed with the
preparation of a final plat which conforms to the submitted sketch plan. The
approval of the sketch plan shall in no way be construed as constituting
official approval of the final plat.

Sec. 9-4-36   Final plat for minor subdivisions.
   (a)   The subdivision administrator shall review the final plat for complete

minor subdivision regulations. The final plat shall be complete and show all
information required for final plats in section
9-4-42, and all certifications and notarizations required in section
9-4-37 for final plat approval of a minor subdivision.
   (b)   The final plat shall be prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor
currently licensed and registered in the state by the North Carolina State
Board of Registration for professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. The final
plat shall conform to the provisions for plats, subdivisions, and mapping
requirements set forth in G.S. 47-30 as amended and the Manual of Practice for

Sec. 9-4-39   Preliminary plat submission and review.
   (a)   For every subdivision within the territorial jurisdiction established
by section
9-4-4 of this chapter, which does not qualify for the abbreviated minor
subdivision procedure, the subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat which
shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Board before any construction or
installation of improvements may begin.
   (b)   Ten copies of the preliminary plat (as well as any additional copies
which the subdivision administrator determines are needed to be sent to other

the appropriate agencies.
   (g)   The Planning Board shall, in writing, recommend approval, conditional
approval with recommended changes to bring the plat into compliance, or
disapproval with reasons within 20 days of its first consideration of the plat.
   (h)   If the Planning Board recommends approval of the preliminary plat, it
shall retain one copy of the plat for its minutes, and transmit two copies of
the plat to the City Council with its recommendation.
   (i)   If the Planning Board recommends conditional approval of the
preliminary plat it shall keep one copy of the plat for its minutes, transmit
two copies of the plat and its recommendation to City Council, and return the
remaining copies of the plat and its recommendation to the subdivider.
   (j)   If the Planning Board recommends disapproval of the preliminary plat,
it shall retain one copy of the plat for its minutes, transmit two copies of
the plat and its recommendation to the City Council, and return the remaining

Sec. 9-4-40   Performance, defects, and maintenance guarantees.
   (a)   Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the City Council, the
subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the final plat, and the
installation of or arrangement for required improvements in accordance with the
approved preliminary plat and the requirements of this chapter. Prior to
approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall have installed the improvements
specified in this chapter or guaranteed their installation as provided herein.
No final plat will be accepted for review by the Planning Board or City Council
unless accompanied by written notice by the City Manager and/or City Engineer
acknowledging compliance with the improvement and guarantee standards of this
chapter. The final plat shall constitute only that portion of the preliminary
plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at that time; such
portion shall conform to all requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   Type - In lieu of requiring the completion, installation and
dedication of all improvements prior to final plat approval, the city may enter
into an agreement with the subdivider whereby the subdivider shall agree to
complete all required improvements. The type of performance guarantee shall be
at the election of the developer. Once said agreement is signed by both parties
and the security required herein is provided, the final plat may be approved by
City Council, if all other requirements of this chapter are met. To secure this
agreement, the subdivider shall provide, subject to the approval of City
Council, either one, or a combination of the following guarantees not exceeding
125% of the entire cost as provided herein (G.S. 160D-804.1):
   (1)   Surety performance bond(s). The subdivider shall obtain a performance
bond(s) from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in North
Carolina. The bonds shall be payable to the city and shall be in an amount
equal to 125% of the entire cost, as estimated by the subdivider and approved
by City Council, of installing all required improvements. The duration of the
bond(s) shall be until such time as the improvements are accepted by City
Council.
   (2)   Cash or equivalent security. The subdivider shall deposit cash, an
irrevocable letter of credit or other instrument readily convertible into cash
at face value, either with the city or in escrow with a financial institution
designated as an official depository of the city. The use of any instrument
other than cash shall be subject to the approval of City Council. The amount of
deposit shall be equal to 125% of the cost, as estimated by the subdivider and
approved by City Council, of installing all required improvements.
   If cash or other instrument is deposited in escrow with a financial
institution as provided above, then the subdivider shall file with City Council
an agreement between the financial institution and himself guaranteeing the
following:
   a.   That the escrow account shall be held in trust until released by the
City Council and may not be used or pledged by the subdivider in any other
matter during the term of the escrow; and
   b.   That in case of a failure on the part of the subdivider to complete
said improvements, the financial institution shall, upon notification by the
City Council, and submission by City Council to the financial institution of an
engineer’s estimate of the amount needed to complete the improvements,
immediately either pay to the city the funds estimated to complete the
improvements, up to the full balance of the escrow account, or deliver to the
city any other instruments fully endorsed or otherwise made payable in full to
the city.
   (3)   Other form of guarantee that provides equivalent security to a surety
bond or letter of credit.
   (c)   Duration - The duration of the performance guarantee shall initially
be one year, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the
required improvements necessitates a longer duration. In the case of a bonded
obligation, the completion date shall be set one year from the date the bond is
issued, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the required
improvements necessitates a longer duration.
   (d)   Upon default, meaning failure on the part of the subdivider to
complete the required improvements in a timely manner as spelled out in the
performance bond or escrow agreement, then the surety, or the financial
institution holding the escrow account shall, if requested by the City Council,
pay all or any portion of the bond or escrow fund to the city up to the amount
needed to complete the improvements based on an engineering estimate. Upon
payment, the City Council, in its discretion, may expend such portion of said
funds as it deems necessary to complete all or any portion of the required
improvements. The city shall return to the subdivider any funds not spent in
completing the improvements.
   (e)   Release - The City Council may release a portion of any security
posted as the improvements are completed. If the City Council approves said
improvements, then it shall immediately release any security posted. The city
shall return letters of credit or escrowed funds upon completion of the
required improvements to its specifications or upon acceptance of the required
improvements, if the required improvements are subject to city acceptance. When
required improvements that are secured by a bond are completed to the
specifications of the city, or are accepted by the city, if subject to its
acceptance, upon request by the developer, the city shall timely provide
written acknowledgment that the required improvements have been completed.
   (f)   The City Council shall require a bond guaranteeing utility taps,
curbs, gutters, street pavement, sidewalks, drainage facilities, water and
sewer lines, and other improvements against defects for one year. The bond
shall be determined by the city manager or consulting engineer and shall be in
cash or made by a surety company authorized to do business in North Carolina.
   (g)   The City Council shall require the subdivider to submit a letter to
the City Clerk in which he agrees to maintain all improvements and any ditch
which has been dug in connection with the installation of such improvements.
The letter shall be binding to the subdivider for a period of one year
following acceptance of the improvements by the city.
   (h)   Amount. - The amount of the performance guarantee shall not exceed one
hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the reasonably estimated cost of
completion at the time the performance guarantee is issued. The city may
determine the amount of the performance guarantee or use a cost estimate
determined by the developer. The reasonably estimated cost of completion shall
include one hundred percent (100%) of the costs for labor and materials
necessary for completion of the required improvements. Where applicable, the
costs shall be based on unit pricing. The additional twenty-five percent (25%)
allowed under this subdivision includes inflation and all costs of
administration regardless of how such fees or charges are denominated. The
amount of any extension of any performance guarantee shall be determined
according to the procedures for determining the initial guarantee and shall not
exceed one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the reasonably estimated cost
of completion of the remaining incomplete improvements still outstanding at the
time the extension is obtained.
   (i)   Timing. - The city, at its discretion, may require the performance
guarantee to be posted either at the time the plat is recorded or at a time
subsequent to plat recordation.
   (j)   Coverage. - The performance guarantee shall only be used for
completion of the required improvements and not for repairs or maintenance
after completion.
   (k)   Legal responsibilities. - No person shall have or may claim any rights
under or to any performance guarantee provided pursuant to this subsection or
in the proceeds of any such performance guarantee other than the following:
   (1)   The city to whom the performance guarantee is provided.
   (2)   The developer at whose request or for whose benefit the performance
guarantee is given.
   (3)   The person or entity issuing or providing the performance guarantee at
the request of or for the benefit of the developer.
   (l)   Multiple guarantees. - The developer shall have the option to post one
type of a performance guarantee as provided for in subdivision (b) of this
section, in lieu of multiple bonds, letters of credit, or other equivalent
security, for all development matters related to the same project requiring
performance guarantees.
   (m)   Exclusion. - Performance guarantees associated with erosion control
and stormwater control measures are not subject to the provisions of this
section.

ARTICLE D
Required Improvements, Dedication,
Reservation, and Minimum Standards of Design
Sec. 9-4-50   Major subdivision types.
   Each major subdivision shall contain the improvements specified in this
article, which shall be installed in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter and paid for by the subdivider, unless other means of financing is
specifically stated in this chapter. Land shall be dedicated and reserved in
each major subdivision as specified in this article. Each major subdivision
shall adhere to the minimum standards of design established by this article.
   (a)   Conservation Subdivision: Conservation subdivisions are permitted only
in the R-2 Residential Agriculture zoning district. The purpose is to preserve
agriculture and forestry lands, natural and cultural features, and rural
community character that might be lost through conventional development
approaches. To accomplish this goal, greater flexibility and creativity in the
design of such developments is encouraged and required. Conservation
subdivisions are subject to all requirements of this ordinance, including this
article. However, components of this article may be modified to meet the
following design standards:
   (1)   Open Space: Each conservation subdivision shall reserve a minimum of
40% of the total property for open space: This does not include lots that will
be built upon, but requires a separate parcel designated for open space. This
open space may consist of the conservation areas listed in subsection b. below,
or other forms of passive space such as greenways or trails. Natural features
shall be maintained in their natural condition, but may be modified to improve
their appearance, functioning, or overall condition, as recommended by experts
in the particular area being modified. Permitted modifications may include:
   a.   Reforestation;
   b.   Pasture or cropland management;
   c.   Buffer area landscaping; and/or
   d.   Stream bank protection/restoration.
   e.   Each new area of open space shall be consciously designed to adjoin
each other whenever possible to form a network of open space throughout the
property being subdivided as well as adjacent properties. Unless accepted for
dedication or otherwise agreed to by the city, another unit of local
government, the state or a private non-profit land conservancy, the cost and
responsibility of maintaining the open space and any facilities located thereon
shall be borne by the property owner and/or a homeowners association.
   (2)   Conservation: The following natural and cultural resources shall be
accurately portrayed on the preliminary and final plat and shall, as the
highest priority areas to be used for open space, be preserved and protected
whenever possible:
   a.   Productive agricultural and forestry soils;
   b.   Floodplains (100-year) identified by a Flood Insurance Rate Map;
   c.   Steep slopes (> 25%);
   d.   Significant wildlife habitat;
   e.   Historic and archaeological sites including, but not limited to, those
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State's National
Register study list, or any site locally designated as a historic landmark or
district; and
   f.   Scenic views, especially of natural and cultural features, including
views from the road as well as views outward from potential home sites.
   (3)   Streets: Streets shall be built in accordance with the city’s adopted
standard specifications shall be aligned to provide vehicular access to each
house in the most reasonable and economical manner. Lots and streets shall be
aligned to avoid, or at least minimize, impacts on conservation areas. Street
connections are encouraged to minimize the number of cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs
serving more than six homes shall be designed with a central island containing
indigenous trees and shrubs. Single-loaded streets (homes only on one side) are
encouraged to maximize open space views for new homes.
   (4)   Sidewalks and trails: Sidewalks in conservation subdivisions must be
at least five feet wide and must conform to the city’s standard specifications.
Formal and informal trails can be made of a variety of materials and shall be
appropriately designed to fit within the type of open space they access.
Sidewalks and trails shall connect whenever possible to maximize the network of
pedestrian facilities. Additionally, trails shall link to existing trails or
other pedestrian facilities on adjacent properties whenever possible.
   (5)   Clustering: Clustering of homes on smaller lots is encouraged to
maximize the conservation of natural and cultural resources. Lots in
conservation subdivisions may be smaller than the minimum lot sizes established
in the Zoning Ordinance, provided the subdivision's overall average lot size
meets the Zoning Ordinance requirements.
   (6)    Stor mw ater: Stor mw ater runo ff, drai nage , rete ntio n and filtr
atio n shal l be managed through natural systems to ensure adequate groundwater
recharge and should be in accordance with the city’s standard specifications.
These systems may include, but are not limited to, ditches, swales and
naturally vegetated retention areas.
 
 
   (b)   Urban Subdivision: Urban subdivisions are permitted in every zoning
district except R-2 Residential Agriculture and shall meet all requirements of
this article. The purpose is to ensure that new subdivisions in the more
urbanized areas of the city create sustainable neighborhoods with a clear sense
of community and place.

Sec. 9-4-51   Suitability of land.
   (a)   Land which has been determined by the City Council on the basis of
engineering or other expert surveys to pose an ascertainable danger to life or
property by reason of its unsuitability for the use proposed shall not be
platted for that purpose, unless and until the subdivider has taken the
necessary measures to correct said conditions and to eliminate said dangers.
   (b)   Areas that have been used for disposal of solid waste shall not be
subdivided.
   (c)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage. If water and/or sewer systems are in the area of the new
subdivision, the proposed subdivision must use these facilities, whichever is
available.

Sec. 9-4-53   Subdivision design.
   (a)   Blocks.
   (1)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to: provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the type of use contemplated; zoning requirements; needs for vehicular and
pedestrian circulation; control and safety of street traffic; limitations and
opportunities of topography; and convenient access to water areas.
   (2)   Blocks are encouraged to be no more than 500 feet. If block length
exceeds 500 feet, then additional traffic calming devices shall be used at an
interval of no more than 500 feet.
   (3)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth except where single tier lots are required to separate
development from through vehicular traffic or another type of use, in
nonresidential subdivisions, or where abutting a water area.
   (4)   Where deemed necessary by the Planning Board, a pedestrian crosswalk
at least 15 feet in width may be required to provide convenient public access
to a public area such as a park or school, to a water area, or to areas such as
shopping centers, religious or transportation facilities.
   (5)   Block numbers shall conform to the city or county street numbering
system, if applicable.
   (b)   Lots.
   (1)   All lots in new subdivisions shall conform to the zoning requirements
of the district in which the subdivision is located. Conformance to zoning
requirements means, among other things, that the smallest lot in the
subdivision must meet all dimensional requirements of the zoning code. It is
not sufficient merely for the average lot to meet zoning requirements.
   (2)   Lots shall meet any applicable Catawba County Health Department
requirements.
   (3)   Double frontage lots shall be avoided wherever possible.
   (4)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to or radial to
street lines.
   (c)   Easements.
   (1)   Easements for underground or above ground utilities shall be provided,
where necessary, across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines and shall be
at least 25 feet wide for water and sanitary sewer lines and as required by the
companies involved, for telephone, gas and power lines. The subdivision
administrator will determine whether one easement is sufficient or whether
several easements are necessary to accommodate the various facilities and the
subdivider shall provide the required easements.
   (2)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a stream or drainage way, a
drainage easement shall be provided conforming with the lines of such stream
and of sufficient width as will be adequate for the purpose.
   (d)   Access Points:
   (1)   Subdivisions that front more than one public road shall provide a
minimum of one access point on at least two public roads. Exceptions may be
made due to extreme topography, water and other natural features.
   (2)   If a subdivision has more than one access point on the same public
road those access points must be separated by at least 300 feet or as many feet
as possible based on the property's road frontage, topography, water and other
natural features affecting the property.
   (e)   Open Space: Each subdivision shall reserve a minimum of 25% of the
total property for open space. The open space may consist of any combination of
active space (playgrounds, ball fields, etc.) or passive space (greenways,
trails, natural vegetation, etc.). Unless accepted for dedication or otherwise
agreed to by the city, another unit of local government, the state or a private
non-profit land conservancy, the cost and responsibility of maintaining the
open space and any facilities located thereon shall be borne by the property
owner and/or a homeowners association.

acceptance into the state highway system shall be constructed to the standards
necessary to be put on the state highway system or the standards in this
chapter, whichever is stricter, in regard to each particular item and shall be
put on such system.
   (e)   Streets not dedicated to the city which are not eligible to be put on
the state highway system because there are too few lots or residences shall,
nevertheless, be dedicated to the public and shall be in accordance with the
standards in this chapter or the standards necessary to be put on the state
highway system, whichever is stricter in regard to each particular item, so as
to be eligible to be put on the system at a later date.
   (f)   A written maintenance agreement with provisions for maintenance of the
street until it is accepted by the city or is put on the state system shall be
included with the final plat.

   (a)   Water and sanitary sewer systems. Each lot in all subdivisions within
the corporate limits of the city shall be provided, at the subdivider's
expense, with an extension of the municipal water and sanitary sewer systems.
Outside the corporate limits, if water and/or sewer systems are in the area of
the new subdivision, the proposed subdivision must use these facilities,
whichever is available. If these facilities are not available, then well and/or
septic systems may be used.
   (b)   Storm water drainage system. The subdivider shall provide a surface
water drainage system constructed to the city’s standard specification, subject
to review by the City Engineer.
   (1)   No surface water shall be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer.
   (2)   Where feasible, the subdivider shall connect to an existing storm

Sec. 9-6-1   Statutory authorization.
   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of
Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of
Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local
governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   Therefore, the City Council of the City of Claremont, North Carolina, does
ordain as follows:
(Ord. of 11/4/02, No. 363-02; Ord. of 8/6/07, No. 1-08)
Sec. 9-6-2   Findings of fact.
   (1)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Claremont are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. of 11/4/02, No. 363-02; Ord. of 8/6/07, No. 1-08)
Sec. 9-6-3   Statement of purpose.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and

elevations of the base flood as published in the flood insurance study. When
the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area, it may be
obtained from engineering studies available from a federal, state, or other
source using FEMA approved engineering methodologies. This elevation, when
combined with the freeboard, establishes the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
   Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
   (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
   (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic
structure.
   Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
chapter.
   Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in Articles D and E is presumed to be
in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
   Water surface elevation (WSE) means the height, in relation to mean sea
level, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of
coastal or riverine areas.
   Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other

any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the floodproofed design
elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to
mean sea level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by
same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data, the
operational plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit
approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required
corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to
construct in accordance with the certified design shall be cause to withhold
the issuance of a certificate of compliance/occupancy.
   (c)   If a manufactured home is placed within Zone A, AO, AE, or A1-30 and
the elevation of the chassis is more than thirty-six (36) inches in height
above grade, an engineered foundation certification is required in accordance
with the provisions of Article E, section
9-6-42(3)(b).
   (d)   If a watercourse is to be altered or relocated, a description of the
extent of watercourse alteration or relocation; a professional engineer’s

submitted with the application for a variance.
   (6)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
   (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
twenty- five dollars ($25) per one hundred dollars ($100) of insurance
coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (8)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the State of North Carolina upon request.

the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation shall apply.
(Ord. of 11/4/02, No. 363-02; Ord. of 8/6/07, No. 1-08)
Sec. 9-6-42   Specific standards.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in Article C, section
9-6-22, or Article E, section
9-6-44, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of Article E,
Section
9-6-41, are required:
   (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in Article B of this chapter.
   (2)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in Article B of this chapter.
Structures located in A, AE, AO, and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed to the
regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all
areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with Article E, section 9-6-47(2). A registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this
subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator as set forth in Article D, section
9-6-32(3), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
   (3)   Manufactured homes.
   (a)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the
reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in Article B of this chapter.
   (b)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis
thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall
be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation
of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height, an engineering
certification is required.
   (c)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of Article E, section
9-6-42(4).
   (d)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents
of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home
parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This plan shall be
filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the local Emergency
Management coordinator.
   (4)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
   (a)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be
used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
   (b)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to
the regulatory flood protection elevation;
   (c)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to

entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
   (i)   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
   (ii)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one (1)
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
   (iii)   If a building has more than one (1) enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
   (iv)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than one
(1) foot above the adjacent grade;
   (v)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
   (vi)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures
for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry
or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an
enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (5)   Additions/improvements.
   (a)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition
and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the
existing structure are:

be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-conforming
than the existing structure.
   (ii)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
   (b)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
   (c)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
   (i)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements only
must comply with the standards for new construction.
   (ii)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
   (6)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
   (a)   Be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days
and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently
attached additions); or
   (b)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
   (7)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the
   Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure(s) in the
event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning notification.
The following information shall be submitted in writing to the Floodplain
Administrator for review and written approval:

(i.e., minimum of seventy-two (72) hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
   (d)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
   (e)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside the
special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (8)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, etc.) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the
following criteria shall be met:
   (a)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation (including
working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
   (b)   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
   (c)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
   (d)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
   (e)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with the
provisions of Article E, section
9-6-41(1);
   (f)   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of Article E, section
9-6-41(4); and
   (g)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in
conformance with the provisions of Article E, section
9-6-42(4)(c).
   An accessory structure with a footprint less than one hundred fifty (150)
square feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an
elevation or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing
certifications are required for all other accessory structures in accordance
with Article D, section
9-6-31(3).
(Ord. of 11/4/02, No. 363-02; Ord. of 8/6/07, No. 1-08)
Sec. 9-6-43   Standards for floodplains without established base flood
elevations.
   Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Approximate Zone A and
established in Article C, section
9-6-22, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the
following provisions, in addition to the provisions of Article E, section
9-6-41, shall apply:
   (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of twenty
(20) feet each side from top of bank or five (5) times the width of the stream,
whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (2)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined based on the following criteria:
   (a)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources,
all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also
comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be elevated or
floodproofed in accordance with standards in Article E, sections
9-6-41 and
9-6-42.
   (b)   When floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other

shall also comply with the requirements of Article 5, Sections B and F.
   (c)   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home
sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in
accordance with Article C, section
9-6-22 and utilized in implementing this chapter. However, this requirement may
be waived if the development ensures that all building envelopes exclude any
special flood hazard areas.
   (d)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal,
state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated
or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation, as defined in Article 2. All other applicable provisions of Article
5, Section B shall also apply.

Sec. 9-6-44   Standards for riverine floodplains with BFE but without
established floodways or non-encroachment areas.
   Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available
from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are
identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report,
the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (1)   Standards of Article E, sections
9-6-41 and
9-6-42; and
   (2)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the
community.
(Ord. of 8/6/07, No. 1-08)
Sec. 9-6-45   Floodways and non-encroachment areas.
   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within
the special flood hazard areas established in Article C, section
9-6-22. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards
outlined in Article E, sections
9-6-41 and
9-6-42, shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
   (a)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result in
any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based
on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice according to FEMA guidelines and presented to the
Floodplain Administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit, or
   (b)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by
FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of
the proposed encroachment.
   (2)   If Article E, section
9-6-45(1) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
   (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
provided the following provisions are met:
   (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of Article E, section
9-6-42(3); and
   (b)   The no encroachment standard of Article E, section
9-6-45(1).
(Ord. of 8/6/07, No. 1-08)
Sec. 9-6-46   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (Zone AO).
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Article C,
section
9-6-22, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3)
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to Article E, sections
9-6-41 and
9-6-42, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
   (1)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two (2) feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two
(2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
   (2)   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed
to the same level as required in Article E, section 9-6-47(1) so that the
structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that
level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is
required in accordance with Article D, section
9-6-32(3) and Article E, section
9-6-42(2).
   (3)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes,
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

Article A
General
§ 9-7-1   Chapter includes.
   Work under this chapter includes, but is not limited to piping and
appurtenances for a complete storm drainage system.
(Ord. of 11-7-16, No. 10-16)
§ 9-7-2   Design criteria.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   The City of Claremont recognizes that there are numerous methods
and computer models available to calculate peak flows, generate and route
hydrographs to determine peak discharges, and to size pipes/culverts, drainage
ways and emergency spillways. It is the responsibility of the design engineer
to select the appropriate methods suitable for the site to design the
stormwater system needed to meet the requirements of this section and the
city's ordinances.
      (2)   In general the city recognizes and accepts the methodologies
outlined in the publication entitled "Elements of Urban Stormwater Design" by
H. Rooney Malcom, P.E.
   (b)   Collection system.
      (1)   A collection system includes the inlets and pipes used to collect
stormwater runoff from a parking area, street and/or a subdivision. It also
includes ditches or channels constructed to convey runoff to inlets or pipes
and to existing natural drainage features.
      (2)   All collection system components shall be sized to adequately pass
the 10-year recurrence interval storm. However, pipes or larger drainage
structures crossing collector or arterial streets, shall be sized to
accommodate the 25-year recurrence interval storm.
   (c)   Stormwater detention.
      (1)   Permanent detention facilities shall conform to the requirements
stated herein and to the city's ordinances.
      (2)   The facility shall be designed such that the 10-year peak discharge
after development is no greater than the 10-year discharge from the same area
prior to development. The detention pond shall be of adequate size/volume to
detain the excess runoff volume.
      (3)   Unless otherwise approved by the city, all detention facilities
shall be "dry ponds".
      (4)   A pipe or weir may be used as the primary outlet device.
      (5)   An emergency by-pass spillway will be provided that will pass the
runoff generated by the 50-year storm, after the impoundment area has reached
its capacity.
      (6)   Emergency by-pass shall be open, broad-crested weirs. Spillways
constructed or earthen fill embankments must be asphalt or concrete lined with
sufficient approach and exit sections provided to prevent any possible erosion.
Earthen embankments constructed in cut areas will require only a vegetated
spillway.
      (7)   Structures shall be designed not to fail during the 100-year storm.
   (d)   Easements. All storm sewers shall be constructed in dedicated street
rights-of-way or permanent easements. Minimum width of easement shall be as
follows:
      (1)   15-inch thru 36-inch pipe      20 feet
      (2)   42-inch thru 72-inch pipe      30 feet
      (3)   >72-inch pipe         To be determined by city
      (4)   Constructed drainageways      To be determined by city

   Buffer. An area of natural or planted vegetation through which stormwater
runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that the runoff does not become channelized
and which provides for infiltration of the runoff and filtering of pollutants.
The buffer is measured landward from the normal pool elevation of impounded
structures and from the bank of each side of streams or rivers.
   Building. Any structure having a roof supported by columns or by walls, and
intended for shelter, housing or enclosure of persons, animals, or property.
The connection of two buildings by means of an open porch, breezeway,
passageway, carport, or other such open structure, with or without a roof,
shall not be deemed to make them one building.

and Materials, laid a least four inches thick over a geotextile fabric; a trail
as defined in G.S. 113A-85 that is either unpaved or paved as long as the
pavement is porous with a hydraulic conductivity greater than 0.001 centimeters
per second (1.41 inches per hour); or landscaping material, including, but not
limited to, gravel, mulch, sand, and vegetation, placed on areas that receive

or to the ridge line of the watershed (whichever comes first); or one-half mile
upstream from the intake located directly in the stream or river (run-of-the-
river), or the ridge line of the watershed (whichever comes first). Local
governments may extend the critical area as needed. Major landmarks such as
highways or property lines may be used to delineate the outer boundary of the
critical area if these landmarks are immediately adjacent to the appropriate
outer boundary of one-half mile.

   (b)   Calculation of project density. The following requirements shall apply
to the calculation of project density:
      (1)   Project density shall be calculated as the total built-upon area
divided by the total project area;
      (2)   A project with "Existing Development," as defined in this chapter,
may use the calculation method in sub-item (1) of this Item or may calculate
project density as the difference of total built-upon area minus existing
built-upon area divided by the difference of total project area minus existing
built-upon area;
      (3)   Expansions to existing development shall be subject to 15A NCAC 02B
.0624 except as excluded in Rule15A NCAC 02B .0622 (l)(d).
      (4)   Where there is a net increase of built-upon area, only the area of
net increase shall be subject to density and built upon area limits.
      (5)   Where existing development is being replaced with new built-upon
area, and there is a net increase of built-upon area, only the area of net
increase shall be subject to density and built upon area limits.
      (6)   Total project area shall exclude the following:
         a.   Areas below the Normal High Water Line (NHWL); and
         b.   Areas defined as "coastal wetlands" pursuant to 15A NCAC 07H
.0205, herein incorporated by reference, including subsequent amendments and
editions, and available at no cost at http://reports.oah.state.nc.us/ncac.asp,
as measured landward from the NHWL; and
      (7)   Projects under a common plan of development shall be considered as
a single project for purposes of density calculation except that on a case-by-
case basis, local governments may allow projects to be considered to have both
high and low density areas based on one or more of the following criteria;
         a.   Natural drainage area boundaries;
         b.   Variations in land use throughout the project;
         c.   Construction phasing.
   (c)   Low density projects. In addition to complying with the project
density requirements of Item (A) of this Rule, low density projects shall
comply with the following:
      (1)   Vegetated conveyances. Stormwater runoff from the project shall be
released to vegetated areas as dispersed flow or transported by vegetated
conveyances to the maximum extent practicable. In determining whether this
criteria has been met, the local government shall take into account site-
specific actors such as topography and site layout as well as protection of
water quality. Vegetated conveyances shall be maintained in perpetuity to
ensure that they function as designed. Vegetated conveyances that meet the
following criteria shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this Sub-
Item:
         a.   Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical)
unless it is demonstrated to the local government that the soils and vegetation
will remain stable in perpetuity based on engineering calculations and on-site
soil investigation; and
         b.   The conveyance shall be designed so that it does not erode during
the peak flow from the 10-year storm event as demonstrated by engineering
calculations.
      (2)   Curb outlet systems. In lieu of vegetated conveyances, low density
projects shall have the option to use curb and gutter with outlets to convey
stormwater to grassed swales or vegetated areas. Requirements for these curb
outlet systems shall be as follows:
         a.   The curb outlets shall be located such that the swale or
vegetated area can carry the peak flow from the 10-year storm and at a non-
erosive velocity;
         b.   The longitudinal slope of the swale or vegetated area shall not
exceed five percent except where not practical due to physical constraints. In
these cases, devices to slow the rate of runoff and encourage infiltration to
reduce pollutant delivery shall be provided.
         c.   The swale's cross section shall be trapezoidal with a minimum
bottom width of two feet;
         d.   The side slopes of the swale or vegetated area shall be no
steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical);
         e.   The minimum length of the swale or vegetated area shall be 100
feet; and
         f.   Low density projects may use treatment swales designed in
accordance with 15A NCAC 02H .1061 in lieu of the requirements specified in Sub
Items a. through e. of this sub- item.
   (d)   High density projects. In addition to complying with the project
density requirements of Item (A) of this Rule, high density projects shall
comply with the following:
      (1)   Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) shall be designed, constructed,
and maintained so that the project achieves either "runoff treatment" or
"runoff volume match" as those terms are defined in 15A NCAC 02B .0621;
      (2)   For high density projects designed to achieve runoff treatment, the
required storm depth shall be one inch. Applicants shall have the option to
design projects to achieve runoff volume match in lieu of runoff treatment;
      (3)   Stormwater runoff from off-site areas and existing development,
shall not be required to be treated in the SCM. Runoff from off-site areas or
existing development that is not bypassed shall be included in sizing of on-
site SCMs;
      (4)   SCMs shall meet the relevant minimum design criteria set forth in
15A NCAC 02M .1050 through . 1062; and
      (5)   Stormwater outlets shall be designed so that they do not cause
erosion downslope of the discharge point during the peak flow from the 10-year
storm event as shown by engineering calculations.
   (e)   Options for implementing project density. Local governments shall have
the following options in place of or in addition to the requirements of Item
(a) above, as appropriate:
      (1)   Local governments may allow only low density development in their
water supply watershed areas in accordance with this section.
      (2)   Local governments may regulate low density single-family detached
residential development using the minimum lot size requirements, dwelling unit
per acre requirements, built-upon area percentages, or some combination of
these.
      (3)   10/70 Option. Outside of WS-I watersheds and the critical areas of
WS-II, WSL Ill, and WS-IV watersheds, local governments may regulate new
development under the "10/70 option" in accordance with the following
requirements:
         a.   A maximum of 10 percent of the land area of a water supply
watershed outside of the critical area and within a local government's planning
jurisdiction may be developed with new development projects and expansions of
existing development of up to 70 percent built-upon area.
         b.   In water supply watersheds classified on or before August 3,
1992, the beginning amount of acreage available under this option shall be
based on a local government's jurisdiction as delineated on July 1, 1993. In
water supply watersheds classified after August 3, 1992, the beginning amount
of acreage available under this option shall be based on a local government's
jurisdiction as delineated on the date the water supply watershed
classification became effective. The acreage within the critical area shall not
be counted towards the allowable 10/70 option acreage;
         c.   Projects that are covered under the 10/70 option shall comply
with the low density requirements set forth in Item (c) above unless the local
government allows high density development, in which case the local government
may require these projects to comply with the high density requirements set
forth in Item (d);
         d.   The maximum built-upon area allowed on any given new development
project shall be 70 percent;
         e.   A local government having jurisdiction within a designated water
supply watershed may transfer, in whole or in part, its right to the 10/70 land
area to another local government within the same water supply watershed upon
submittal of a joint resolution and approval by the Commission; and
         f.   When the water supply watershed is composed of public lands, such
as National Forest land, local governments may count the public land acreage
within the watershed outside of the critical area in calculating the acreage
allowed under this provision.
      (4)   New development shall meet the development requirements on a
project-by project basis except local governments may submit ordinances that
use density or built-upon area criteria averaged throughout the local
government's watershed jurisdiction instead of on a project-by-project basis
within the watershed. Prior to approval of the ordinance, the local government
shall demonstrate to the Commission that the provisions as averaged meet or
exceed the statewide minimum requirements and that a mechanism exists to ensure
the planned distribution of development potential throughout the local
government's jurisdiction within the watershed.
      (5)   Local governments may administer oversight of future development
activities in single-family detached residential developments that exceed the
applicable low density requirements by tracking dwelling units rather than
percentage built-upon area, as long as the SCM is sized to capture and treat
runoff from 1) all pervious and built-upon surfaces shown on the development
plan and 2) any off-site drainage from pervious and built-upon surfaces, and
when an additional safety factor of 15 percent of built-upon area of the
project site is figured in.
(Ord. of 7-10-23, No. 05-24)
Sec. 9-8-4.4   Density Averaging.
   An applicant may average development density on up to two noncontiguous
properties for purposes of achieving compliance with the water supply watershed
development standards if all of the following circumstances exist:
   (1)   The properties are within the same water supply watershed. However, if
one of the properties is located in the critical area of the watershed, the
critical area property shall not be developed beyond the applicable density
requirements for its classification.
   (2)   Overall project density meets applicable density or stormwater control
requirements under 15A NCAC 2B .0200
   (3)   Vegetated setbacks on both properties meet the minimum statewide water
supply, watershed protection requirements.
   (4)   Built upon areas are designed and located to minimize stormwater
runoff impact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated stormwater flow,
maximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas, and maximize the flow
length through vegetated areas,
   (5)   Areas of concentrated density development are located in upland areas
and to the maximum extent practicable, away from surface waters and
drainageways.
   (6)   The property or portions of the properties that are not being
developed will remain in a vegetated or natural state and will be managed by a
homeowners' association as common area, conveyed to a local government as a
park or greenway, or placed under a permanent conservation or farmland
preservation easement unless it can be demonstrated that the local government
can ensure long-term compliance through deed restrictions and an electronic
permitting mechanism. A metes and bounds description of the areas to remain
vegetated and limits on use shall be recorded on the subdivision plat, in
homeowners' covenants, and on individual deeds. Any such limitations or
restrictions on uses shall be irrevocable.
   (7)   Development permitted under density averaging and meeting applicable
low density requirements shall transport stormwater runoff by vegetated
conveyances to the maximum extent practicable.
   (8)   A certificate shall be obtained from the local Watershed Review Board
to ensure that both properties considered together meet the standards of the
watershed ordinance and that potential owners have record of how the watershed
regulations were applied to the properties.
(Ord. of 7-10-23, No. 05-24)
Sec. 9-8-4.5   Cluster Development.
   Cluster development is allowed in all Watershed Areas [except WS-I] under
the following conditions:
   (a)   Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single family cluster
development projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the
number of lots allowed for single family detached developments in Section
9-8-4.3. Density or built-upon area for the project shall not exceed that
allowed or the critical area balance of watershed or protected area, whichever
applies.
   (b)   All built-upon area shall be designed and located to minimize
stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated
stormwater flow, maximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas, and
maximize the flow length through vegetated areas.
   (c)   Areas of concentrated density development shall be located in upland
area and as far as practicable from surface waters and drainageways.
   (d)   The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural
state. The title to the open space area shall be conveyed to an incorporated
homeowners association for management; to a local government for preservation
as a park or open space; or to a conservation organization for preservation in
a permanent easement.
   (e)   Cluster developments that meet the applicable low density requirements
shall transport stormwater runoff by vegetated conveyances to the maximum
extent practicable.
(Ord. of 7-10-23, No. 05-24)
Sec. 9-8-4.6   Vegetated Setbacks Required.
   (a)   A minimum 100 foot vegetative setback is required for all new
development activities that exceed the low density option; otherwise, a minimum
thirty (30) foot vegetative setback for development activities is required
along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S. 1
(7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by local government
studies. Desirable artificial streambank or shoreline stabilization is
permitted.
   (b)   Where USGS topographic maps do not distinguish between perennial and
intermittent streams, an on-site stream determination may be performed by an
individual qualified to perform such stream determinations.
   (c)   No new development is allowed in the buffer except for water dependent
structures, other structures such as flag poles, signs and security lights
which result in only diminutive increases in impervious area and public
projects such as road crossings and greenways where no practical alternative
exists. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff
away from the surface waters and maximize the utilization of stormwater Best
Management Practices. Any such development must obtain a Watershed Review Board

   (a)   Faithful attendance at meetings of the Board and conscientious
performance of the duties required of members of the Board shall be considered
a prerequisite to continuing membership on the Board.
   (b)   No Board member shall take part in the hearing, consideration, or
determination of any case in which he is personally or financially interested.
A Board member shall have a "financial interest" in a case when a decision in
the case will: 1) cause him or his spouse to experience a direct financial
benefit or loss, or 2) will cause a business in which he or his spouse owns a
ten per cent (10%) or greater interest, or is involved in a decision-making
role, to experience a direct financial benefit or loss. A Board member shall
have a "personal interest" in a case when it involves a member of his immediate
family (i.e., parent; spouse, or child). The intent is to prohibit members of
the Board from acting in situations where they have a conflict of interest in a
manner similar to the prohibition in N.C.G.S. 14-234(c)(1). Please also see
N.C.G.S. 160D - 109 - standards for conflicts of interest for local government
development decisions.

proper judgement of any case prior to its determination on that case, and shall
not form a fixed opinion on the case prior to the hearing on that case.

eight (48) hours prior to the hearing of any potential conflict of interest
which he has in a particular case before the Board.
   (f)   No Board member shall vote on any matter that decides an application
or appeal unless he had attended the public hearing or watched a recording of
the meeting on that application or appeal.
(Ord. of 7-10-23, No. 05-24)
Sec. 9-8-6.7   Powers and Duties of the Watershed Review Board.
   (a)   Administrative Review. The Watershed Review Board shall hear and
decide appeals from any decision or determination made by the Watershed
Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter.
   (b)   Variances. The Watershed Review Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, minor variances from the terms of this chapter,
and may review major variance requests and make recommendations to the
Environmental Management Commission regarding the same.
In addition, the City of Claremont shall notify and allow 60 days for all other
local governments having jurisdiction in the designated watershed where the
variance is being considered.
      (1)   Applications for a variance shall be made on the proper form
obtainable from the Watershed Administrator and shall include the following
information:
         a.   A site plan, drawn to a scale of at least one (1) inch to forty
(40) feet, indicating the property lines of the parcel upon which the use is
proposed; any existing or proposed structures; parking areas and other built-
upon areas; and surface water drainage. The site plan shall be neatly drawn and
indicate north point, name and address of person who prepared the plan, date of
the original drawing, and an accurate record of any later revisions.
         b.   A complete and detailed description of the proposed variance,
together with any other pertinent information which the applicant feels would
be helpful to the Watershed Review Board in considering the application.
         c.   Evidence or proposed witness testimony that tends to support a
finding that each of the factors listed in subsection (b)(3), below, are met.
      (2)   The Watershed Administrator shall notify in writing each local
government having jurisdiction in the watershed and the entity using the water
supply for consumption. Such notice shall include a description of the variance
being requested. Local governments receiving notice of the variance request may
submit comments to the Watershed Administrator prior to a decision by the
Watershed Review Board. Such comments shall become a part of the record of
proceedings of the Watershed Review Board.
      (3)   Before the Watershed Review Board may grant a variance, it shall
make the following three findings, which shall be recorded in the permanent
record of the case, and shall include the factual reasons on which they are
based:
         a.   There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the
way of carrying out the strict letter of the chapter. In order to determine
that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Board must
find that the five following conditions exist:
            1.   If he complies with the provisions of the chapter, the
applicant can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his
property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be
made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the Board in
granting an variance. Moreover, the Board shall consider whether the variance
is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the chapter that will make
possible the reasonable use of his property.
            2.   The hardship results from the application of the chapter to
the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other
hardship.
            3.   The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's
property such as its size, shape, or topography, which is different from that
of neighboring property.
            4.   The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant
who knowingly or unknowingly violates the chapter, or who purchases the
property after the effective date of the chapter, and then comes to the Board
for relief.
            5.   The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather
than the result of conditions that are widespread. If other properties are
equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a
variance would be special privilege denied to others, and would not promote
equal justice.
         b.   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
the chapter and preserves its spirit.
         c.   In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare
have been assured and substantial justice has been done. The Board shall not
grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the
public health, safety, or general welfare.
      (4)   In granting the variance, the Board may attach thereto conditions
regarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed building,
structure, or use that relate to the purpose and standards of this chapter. If
a variance for the construction, alteration or use of property is granted, such
construction, alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site
plan.
      (5)   The Watershed Review Board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an
application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been
no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or
application.
      (6)   A variance issued in accordance with this Section shall be
considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit
or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant
within six (6) months from the date of the decision.
      (7)   If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and
if the Watershed Review Board decides in favor of granting the variance, the
Board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate
speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall include:
         a.   The variance application;
         b.   The hearing notices;
         c.   The evidence presented;
         d.   Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on
them;
         e.   Proposed findings and exceptions;
         f.   The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be
added to the permit.
   The preliminary record shall be sent to the Environmental Management
Commission for its review.
   (c)   Subdivision approval. See Section 9-8-3.
   (d)   Public health. See Section 9-8-5.
   (e)   Approval of all development greater than the low density option.
(Ord. of 7-10-23, No. 05-24)
Sec. 9-8-6.8   Appeals from the Watershed Review Board.

Court within thirty (30) days from the date of the Board's written decision.
Decisions by the Superior Court will be in the manner of certiorari.

Third Party Use of Facilities
§

§
10-3-2   Procedures.
Sec. 10-3-1   Statement of policy.
   It is the policy of the city council to make the park and recreation
facilities available to as many residents of the city and vicinity as is
reasonably possible, and to do so in a manner which does not discriminate
against any person or group by reason of age, sex, race, religion, political
affiliation, or national origin, but which does recognize the obligation of the
city to first attempt to meet the needs of its citizens before responding to
the requests of non-resident individuals and groups. (Ord. of 6/2/86, No. 87-
86)
Sec. 10-3-2   Procedures.
   (a)   Recognizing the limited availability of city personnel to organize,
conduct, and supervise all recreational activities at town facilities, the city
council may from time to time authorize such groups or individuals as the
council may deem necessary and appropriate to program activities and events at
town park or recreation facilities.
   (b)   Selection of groups or individuals who wish to conduct recreational
programs and events shall be based upon determinations by the council that the
proposed programs or events are in the best interest of the citizenry, that the
same can or will be conducted in accordance with the policies and the intent of
this chapter, and that they represent the maximum beneficial use of available
facilities.
   (c)   The city council may from time to time authorize the city manager or
his designee to authorize the use of city recreation or park facilities by
groups or individuals without prior approval by the council. If this authority
is granted to the manager, the same shall be noted upon the minutes of the
council, and among the policies and procedures which may be adopted from time
to time pursuant to this chapter.
   (d)   The city council may adopt, or authorize the manager to adopt,
policies and procedures governing access to and use of city park and
recreational facilities. These policies and procedures shall be consistent with
this chapter, and may include, but not be limited to, fees for use of
facilities, use of concession stands for sale of food and drink, shared use of
facilities, application procedures and forms for the use of facilities, and
related matters. (Ord. of 6/2/86, No. 87-86)
