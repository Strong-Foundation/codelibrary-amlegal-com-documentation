MEETINGS
§ 30.01 ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING.
   At the first regular meeting in December (at any time after the results of
the municipal election have been officially determined and published) following
a general election in which Council members are elected, the Mayor and Council
members shall take and subscribe the oath of office as the first order of
business. As the second order of business, the Council shall elect from its
members a Mayor Pro Tempore who shall hold office at the pleasure of the
Council.
(Ord. passed 2-19-2015)
§ 30.02 REGULAR MEETINGS.
   (A)   The Council shall hold a regular meeting(s) each month. At its
organizational meeting, the Town Council shall fix the time and place of its
regular meetings. By ordinance, resolution or other official action, its
regular meeting schedule may be changed by the Council, but it shall direct
that a current copy of the revised schedule, showing the time and place of
regular meetings, be kept on file with the Clerk. A revised schedule shall not
take effect less than seven calendar days following its adoption.
   (B)   The Town Council shall ensure that its schedule of regular meetings is
posted to the town’s Web site.
(Ord. passed 3-20-2014; Ord. passed 2-19-2015)
§ 30.03 SPECIAL MEETINGS.
   (A)   A SPECIAL MEETING is any non-emergency meeting of the Council held at
any time other than that specified in §
30.02. The Council acknowledges that special meetings of the Town Council,
although sometimes needed for the effective governance of the town, create
significant burdens on town staff and may impose significant costs on the town.
Excluding quarterly public hearings, budget workshops and properly called
emergency meetings under §
30.04, and recognizing the provisions of G.S. § 160A-71 regarding the calling
of a special meeting, in order to control those burdens and costs, the Council
shall seek to limit the number of special meetings called in any calendar year
to 12 or fewer, with the goal of no more than three meetings held each calendar
quarter. To facilitate this end, the Council shall ordinarily refrain from
scheduling a special meeting when the item of business for which a special
meeting is considered may be adequately addressed at another meeting of the
Council. In general, special meetings shall be used for matters involving the
following:
      (1)   Decisions, although not constituting an emergency, which must be
made prior to another scheduled meeting of the Council;
      (2)   Issues of scope or complexity that they cannot be accommodated
within the available times for other scheduled meetings of the Council; or
      (3)   Matters which, due to their nature, require the attendance of non-
staff guests who are unavailable at other scheduled meetings of the Council.
   (B)   The Mayor, the Mayor Pro Tempore or any two members of the Council
may, at any time, call a special meeting by signing a written notice stating
the time and place of the meeting, and the subject to be considered.
   (C)   Notice of the meeting shall be given to Council members as provided in
this division (C), preferably 48 hours, but not less than six hours, before the
meeting:
      (1)   Written notice shall be delivered personally to each Council
member; or
      (2)   If notice cannot be personally delivered, notice may be left at the
Council member's usual place of dwelling. In this event, administration shall
make every reasonable effort to contact the Council member by telephone.
   (D)   Special meetings may be held when all Council members are present and
consent thereto or when those not present have signed a written waiver of
notice, provided that the notice to the media required by division (E) below is
given.
   (E)   Administration shall give notice of a special meeting to the public
and the media at least 48 hours before the meeting by:
      (1)   Posting a notice of the time and place of the meeting on the town’s
principal bulletin board;
      (2)   Mailing or delivering notice of the meeting to each of the media
who has requested it in accordance with the Open Meetings Law;
      (3)   Mailing or delivering notice of the meeting to any person who has
filed with the Clerk a written request for it in accordance with the Open
Meetings Law; and
      (4)   Posting of notice of the meeting on the town’s Web site.
   (F)   Only those items of business specified in the notice may be transacted
at a special meeting unless all members are present or have signed a written
waiver of notice and all members present agree.
   (G)   A special meeting may also be called or scheduled by vote of the
Council in open session during another duly called meeting. The motion or
resolution calling or scheduling the special meeting shall specify its time,
place and purpose.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Ord. passed 3-20-2014)
§ 30.04 EMERGENCY MEETINGS.
   (A)   An EMERGENCY MEETING is a meeting of the Council called because of
generally unexpected circumstances that require immediate consideration.
   (B)   The Mayor, the Mayor Pro Tempore or any two members of the Council
may, at any time, call an emergency meeting by signing a written statement
stating the time and place of the meeting and the subjects to be considered.
   (C)   Notice of the meeting shall be given to Council members in the same
manner as notice of special meetings.
   (D)   Emergency meetings may also be held when all Council members are
present and consent thereto or when those not present have signed a written
waiver of notice, provided that the notice to the media required by division
(E) below is given.
   (E)   Administration shall give notice of an emergency meeting to each of
the media who has requested it in accordance with the Open Meetings Law. This
notice shall be given either by telephone or by the same method used to notify
Council members and shall be given immediately after the notice has been given
to those members.
   (F)   Only business connected with the emergency may be transacted at an
emergency meeting. No item may be added for action at an emergency meeting with
the exception of a request for the scheduling of another emergency meeting in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
(Ord. passed 9-21-2010)
§ 30.05 CONTINUED OR RECESSED MEETINGS.
   (A)   By majority vote, the Council may continue or recess any regular,
special, or emergency meeting to any place and time specified in the motion to
continue or recess the meeting.
   (B)   In the event of a continued or recessed meeting, the Council shall
direct the Town Clerk to post notice of the continued or recessed meeting on
the town’s Web site setting out the date, time, and location of the meeting. No
further notice need be given of any continued or recessed session of a meeting
set in accordance with division (A) above.
(Ord. passed 3-20-2014)
§ 30.06 AGENDA.
   (A)   Regular meetings.
      (1)   Requests to be placed on agenda. The Town Clerk shall provide
notice each month of the deadline for submission of items requested to be
placed on the agenda. Such notice shall be posted on the town’s website and on
the town’s principal bulletin board at least seven calendar days in advance of
the deadline. A request for an item to be placed on the agenda shall include a
description of the subject matter involved and an explanation of the action
which is requested. When appropriate, it shall be accompanied by such materials
and documents as may be needed in order to explain or understand the request.
As feasible, a copy of all proposed ordinances shall be provided with a request
that an ordinance be considered.
      (2)   Preparation of agenda. The Town Manager or his or her designee
shall prepare the agenda for the meeting.
      (3)   Distribution of agenda. On the Friday preceding the regular meeting
date, the Clerk shall provide a copy of the agenda to the Mayor and each member
of the Council, as well as each town department head. In addition, a copy of
the agenda shall be mailed, e-mailed, or delivered to each newspaper, wire
service, radio station, and television station that has filed a written request
for notice with the Clerk and to any person, in addition to the representatives
of the media listed above, who has filed a written request with the Clerk. Each
newspaper, wire service, radio station, and television station submitting a
written request for notice must renew its request annually by January 10 of
each year. Persons other than the media who request a copy shall be charged a
fee of $10 per calendar year for notice other than by e-mail, for which no
charge shall be made, and must renew their requests annually by January 10 of
each year. A copy of the agenda shall also be posted on the town’s Web site.
      (4)   Additions and deletions. As its regularly-scheduled meetings, the
Council may, by unanimous vote of the Council members present, add an item of
business or delete an item from the meeting agenda. Unless otherwise specified
by the Council, additions to the agenda shall be considered at the conclusion
of all other regular business.
      (5)   Inspection and distribution. Copies of the agenda and attachments
shall be available for public inspection as soon as they are completed.
Additional copies of the agenda shall be available for the press and interested
members of the public.
   (B)   Special and emergency meetings. The Town Manager or his or her
designee shall prepare the agenda for any special or emergency meeting,
including therein only such matters as have been included in the notice of the
meeting. Distribution of the agenda shall be in accordance with the

30.03 and
30.04.
(Ord. passed 3-20-2014; Ord. passed 4-24-2014; Ord. passed 2-19-2015; Ord.
passed 6-16-2016)
§ 30.07 ORDER OF BUSINESS.
   (A)   Items of business shall be taken up at a meeting in the order that
they appear on the agenda, except as provided in division (D) below.
   (B)   Items shall be placed on the agenda according to the “order of
business” in conformity with subsection (H).
   (C)   Broad categories of business may be included as agenda items; examples
included but are not limited to“members of the public wishing to be heard,”
“matters by the Manager,” or “matters by the Attorney.”
   (D)   Items may be considered out of order by consent of all the members
present or by majority vote upon a motion.
   (E)   Persons desiring to address the Council shall, if at all possible,
call the office of the Town Clerk and give their names, addresses, and subject
matters to be discussed and shall meet the agenda item request submission
deadlines as set forth at §
30.06(A)(1) if they wish to appear as part of an agenda item. Such deadlines do
not apply to a person addressing the Council as part of the “public comment”
part of the meeting. Persons desiring to speak on an agenda item will be
recognized to speak when the agenda item is reached if the agenda item
authorizes the receipt of public comment or the Council, by majority vote,
authorizes public comment in connection with a particular agenda item. No
person, in addressing the Town Council, except as otherwise provided herein,
shall be allowed to speak more than five minutes unless the presiding officer
allows an extension of time. The presiding officer may, in his or her
discretion, shorten the time for speaking when an unusually large number of
persons have registered to speak.
   (F)   Any person wishing to address the Council at any regular meeting, who
has not been authorized to address the Council as part of an agenda item, shall
place his or her name on a sign up sheet available for this purpose. The person
shall be entitled to speak under “Public Comment,” subject to the following
rules and regulations:
      (1)   Speakers shall be recognized in the order in which they have signed
up.
      (2)   During the public comment period, no person shall be allowed to
speak for more than five minutes unless the presiding officer allows an
extension of time. When the Mayor or other presiding officer determines that
there are more speakers than can be reasonably heard during the 15-minute
initial public comment period, the Mayor or presiding officer may limit each
speaker's presentation to less than five minutes. Likewise, the Town Council,
by motion and majority vote, may limit the time allotted to each speaker to
less than five minutes and may grant a speaker more than five minutes to
complete a public comment. Any person who wishes to address the Town Council
but is unable to speak during the initial 15-minute public comment period due
to the number of persons offering public comment who signed up ahead of that
person shall be given an opportunity to address the Town Council at the
conclusion of all business scheduled for open session, subject to the same
procedures and rules which apply to the initial 15-minute public comment
period.
      (3)   Should more than one person wish to make substantially the same
comments regarding the same subject, or where a group of persons supports or
opposes the same positions, the presiding officer may require that all persons
designate a spokesperson for their group to address the Town Council, and the
presiding officer may allot a larger amount of time for the presentation of the
group position by the spokesperson.
      (4)   When the number of persons wishing to address the Town Council
during the “public comment” period exceeds the number of people who can be
safely accommodated within the Town Council chambers or other location of the
meeting, the presiding officer may require that all persons select delegates
from the groups of persons supporting or opposing the same positions to address
the Town Council, and the presiding officer may allot a larger amount of time
for the presentation of the group position by each delegate.
      (5)   All persons addressing the Town Council during the public comment
period shall be treated respectfully by other persons in attendance at the
meeting, and all speakers shall conduct themselves with proper decorum. Should
any person present during a public comment period substantially interfere with
the ability of a person offering public comment or engage in behavior which
violates norms of accepted decorum, or should a person offering public comment
engage in behavior which violates norms of accepted decorum, after warning the
person(s) and, except in a situations where there is a risk of harm to any
person present, providing the person(s) the opportunity to alter his, her, or
their behavior to bring it into conformity with norms of accepted behavior, the
presiding officer may direct that the person(s) be removed from the meeting.
However, a person expressing positions which are critical of town policies or
actions, or criticizing the Mayor, Town Council members, town staff, town
officials, or town policies or actions shall not, on that basis alone, be
considered to have engaged in behavior which violates norms of accepted
decorum.
      (6)   Unless the agenda is amended in accordance with this section so as
to allow action on an item raised during the public comment period, the matter
presented by the speaker shall be for information.
   (G)   Items shall be placed on the agenda in the order directed by the Town
Manager, and shall generally include: call to order; announcements; public
hearings (other than quasi-judicial hearings); public comment; requested
appearances; consent agenda adoption; quasi-judicial hearings; Council matters;
announcements of vacancies to boards, commissions, task forces, advisory
bodies, and committees; appointments to boards, commissions, task forces,
advisory bodies, and committees; resolutions requesting appointments by the
County Commission of ETJ members to the Planning Commission and Board of
Adjustment; public comment not reached during the initial public comment
period; closed session; and adjournment. By general consent of the Council or
majority vote, items may be considered out of order and items not fitting into
one of the named categories may be considered. The Council may, by unanimous
vote of those present, add items to or subtract items from the proposed agenda,
except that the Council may not add items to the proposed agenda stated in the
notice of a special meeting called by the Mayor, Mayor Pro Tempore, and two
Council members, unless all members are present and agree, or those who are
absent sign a written waiver of notice, and all members who are present agree;
and only business connected with an emergency may be considered at an emergency
meeting. The Council shall not deliberate, vote, or otherwise take action on
any matter by reference to a letter, number or other designation, or other
secret device or method with the intention of making it impossible for persons
attending a meeting of the Council to understand what is being deliberated,
voted, or acted on. The Council may, however, deliberate, vote, or otherwise
take action by reference to an agenda, if copies of the agenda, sufficiently
worded to enable the public to understand what is being deliberated, voted, or
acted on, are available for public inspection at the meeting.

§ 30.08 PRESIDING OFFICER.
   (A)   The Mayor shall preside at meetings of the Council, except as provided
in division (C) below. A member must be recognized by the Presiding Officer in
order to address the Council.
   (B)   As Presiding Officer, the Presiding Officer shall have the following
powers, in addition to those conferred elsewhere in this chapter:
      (1)   To rule motions in or out of order, including the right to rule out
of order any motion patently offered for obstructive or dilatory purposes;
      (2)   To determine whether a speaker has gone beyond reasonable standards
of courtesy in his or her remarks and to entertain and rule upon objections
from other members on this ground;
      (3)   To entertain and answer questions of parliamentary law or
procedure, subject to being overruled by a two-thirds vote of the membership of
the Council;
      (4)   To call a brief recess at any time; and
      (5)   To adjourn in the event of an emergency.
   (C)   If the Mayor is unable to attend the Council meeting, or if the Mayor
becomes actively engaged in debate on a particular proposal, he or she may
delegate the duty to preside to the Mayor Pro Tempore or to any other member of
the Council who is not so engaged and who acquiesces in the delegation. The
temporary Presiding Officer may only preside over the debate and may not
participate in it; however, he or she does not forfeit his or her right to vote
on the issue by acting as temporary Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer
shall resume the duty to preside as soon as action upon the matter is
concluded.
§ 30.09 QUORUM.
   A majority of the actual membership of the Council and the Mayor, excluding
vacant seats, shall constitute a quorum. A quorum is necessary for the Council
to take any official action. A member who has withdrawn from a meeting without
being excused by majority vote of the remaining members present shall be
counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
§ 30.10 TAKING OFFICIAL ACTION.
   (A)   The Council shall proceed by motion. Any member may make a motion. A
motion shall require a second; it brings the matter before the Council for its
consideration. A member may make only one motion at a time.
   (B)   A motion may be withdrawn by the introducer at any time prior to a
vote. A substantive motion is out of order while another substantive motion is
pending.
   (C)   Subject to §
30.13 and other provisions of law, official action of the Council shall be by
majority vote. A motion shall be adopted by a majority of the votes cast, a
quorum being present, unless otherwise required by these rules of the laws of
the state.
§ 30.11 DEBATE.
   (A)   Once a motion has been introduced and seconded, the Mayor shall open
the floor to debate upon it.
   (B)   The Mayor shall preside over the debate according to the following
general principles:
      (1)   The introducer (the member who makes the motion) is entitled to
speak first;
      (2)   A member who has not spoken on the issue shall be recognized before
someone who has already spoken; and
      (3)   To the extent possible, the debate shall alternate between
proponents and opponents of the measure.
§ 30.12 VOTING.
   (A)   Once a member is physically present at a Council meeting, any
subsequent failure to vote shall be recorded as an affirmative vote unless the
member has been excused from voting in accordance with division (B) below or
has been allowed to withdraw from the meeting in accordance with division (C)
below.
   (B)   A member may be excused from voting on a particular issue by voting on
a particular issue by majority vote of the remaining members present if the
matter at issue involves the member's own financial interest or official
conduct.
   (C)   A member may be allowed to withdraw from the entire remainder of a
meeting by majority vote of the remaining members present for any good and
sufficient reason other than the member's desire to avoid voting on matters to
be considered at that meeting.
   (D)   A motion to allow a member to be excused from voting or excused from
the remainder of the meeting is only in order if made by or at the initiative
of the member directly affected.
   (E)   All votes shall be recorded.
   (F)   When this chapter specifies that action shall be taken by majority
vote or fails to specify the vote required, that shall be interpreted to mean a
vote of the majority of those present and not excused from voting. When a two-
thirds vote is required, that shall be interpreted to mean a vote of two-thirds
of those present and not excused from voting. When a vote of a certain
percentage of the Council membership is required, that shall be interpreted to
mean the specified percentage of all seats of the Council, excluding vacant
seats.
§ 30.13 ADOPTION OF ORDINANCES.
   (A)   An affirmative vote equal to a majority of all the members of the
Council not excused from voting on the question in issue (including the Mayor's
vote in case of an equal division) shall be required to adopt an ordinance, to
take any action that has the effect of an ordinance or to make, ratify or
authorize any contract on behalf of the town. Subject to the provisions of G.S.
Ch. 159 (Local Government Finance), no ordinance or action that has the effect
of an ordinance may be finally adopted on the date on which it is introduced,
except by an affirmative vote equal to or greater than two-thirds of all the
actual membership of the Council, excluding vacant seats, and not including the
Mayor unless he or she has the right to vote on all questions before the
Council. No ordinance shall be adopted unless it has been reduced to writing
before a vote on adoption is taken.
   (B)   When an ordinance requires a public hearing, the ordinance shall be
considered introduced at the meeting when the Council sets a date for the
public hearing.
   (C)   Franchise ordinances and amendments shall not be finally adopted until
passed at two regular meetings of the Council. Except as provided in this
section, motions, resolutions and ordinances will be deemed adopted if passed
upon one reading.
   (D)   Adoption of the budget ordinance notwithstanding the provisions of any
charter, general law or local act.
      (1)   Any action with respect to the adoption or amendment of the budget
ordinance may be taken at any regular or special meeting of the Council by a
simple majority of those present and voting, a quorum being present;
      (2)   No action taken with respect to the adoption or amendment of the
budget ordinance need be published or is subject to any other procedural
requirement governing the adoption of ordinances or resolutions by the Council;
and
      (3)   The adoption and amendment of the budget ordinance and the levy of
tax in the budget ordinance are not subject to the provisions of any charter or
local act concerning initiative or referendum. During the period beginning with
the submission of the budget to the Council and ending with the adoption of the
budget ordinance, the Council may hold any special meetings that may be
necessary to complete its work on the budget ordinance. Except for the notice
requirements of the Open Meetings Law, which continue to apply, no provision of
the law concerning the call of a special meeting applies during that period so
long as each member of the Council has actual notice of each special meeting
called for the purpose of considering the budget; and no business other than
consideration of the budget is taken up. This rule does not allow, and may not
be construed to allow, the holding of closed meetings or closed sessions by the
Council if it is otherwise prohibited by law from holding a meeting or session.
(G.S. § 159-17)
§ 30.14 CLOSED SESSIONS.
   The Council may hold closed sessions as provided by law. The Council shall
only commence a closed session after a motion to go into closed session has
been made and adopted during an open meeting. The motion shall state the
general purpose of the closed session and must be approved by the vote of a
majority of those present and voting. The Council shall terminate the closed
session by majority vote. Only those actions specifically authorized by statute
may be taken in closed session. A motion to adjourn or recess the Council
meeting shall not be in order during a closed session. Minutes shall be kept of
closed sessions, but they may be withheld from public inspection so long as
public inspection would frustrate the purpose of the closed session.
§ 30.15 PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   (A)   (1)   Public hearings required by law or deemed advisable by the
Council shall be organized by a special order, adopted by a majority vote that
sets forth the subject, date, place, and time of the hearing as well as any
rules regarding the length of time for each speaker, and other pertinent
matters.
      (2)   The rules may include but are not limited to rules fixing the
maximum time allotted to each speaker; providing for the designation of
spokespersons for groups of persons supporting or opposing the same positions;
providing for the selection of delegates from groups of persons supporting or
opposing the same positions when a number of persons wishing to attend the
hearing exceed the capacity of the hall (so long as arrangements are made for
those excluded from the hall to listen to the hearing); and providing for the
maintenance of order and a quorum and the conduct of the hearing.
      (3)   All notice and other requirements of the Open Meetings Law
applicable to Council meetings shall also apply to public hearings at which a
majority of the Council is present. A public hearing for which any notices
required by the Open Meetings Law or other provisions of law have been given
may be continued to a time and place certain without further advertisement.
      (4)   The requirements of adjourned (or recessed) meetings shall be
followed and continuing a hearing at which a majority of the Council is
present.
   (B)   (1)   At the appointed time for the hearing, the Mayor or his or her
designee shall call the hearing to order and then preside over it.
      (2)   When the allotted time expires or when no one wishes to speak that
has not done so, the presiding officer shall declare the hearing ended.
   (C)   A quorum of the Council shall be required at all public hearings
required by state law. If a quorum is not present at a hearing, the hearing
shall be continued until the next regular Council meeting without further
advertisement or may be scheduled for a special hearing of the Council without
further notice so long as the date, time, and location of the special hearing
is announced.
(Ord. passed 3-20-2014)
§ 30.16 MINUTES.
   (A)   Full and accurate minutes of the Council proceedings shall be kept and
shall be open to the inspection of the public, except as otherwise provided in
this rule. The results of each vote shall be recorded in the minutes.
   (B)   (1)   Accurate minutes shall be kept of all actions taken during
closed sessions.
      (2)   Minutes and other records of a closed session may be withheld from
public inspection so long as public inspection would frustrate the purpose of
the closed session.
MOTIONS
§ 30.30 SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL MOTIONS.
   (A)   A substantive motion is a motion that seeks to have the Council
exercise any of its powers, duties or responsibilities. A motion to amend a
substantive motion is also a substantive motion. A substantive motion, other
than to amend, is out of order while another substantive motion is pending.
(Note: This rule sets forth the basic principle of parliamentary procedure that
distinct issues will be considered and dealt with one at a time, and a new
proposal may not be put forth until action on the preceding one has been
concluded.)
   (B)   A procedural motion is a motion that relates either to the manner in
which the Council conducts its business in general or the manner in which the
Council deals with a particular substantive issue or substantive motion that is
before it.
   (C)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, all motions authorized by this
subchapter may be amended and debated.
§ 30.31 MOTION TO AMEND.
   (A)   An amendment to a motion must be pertinent to the subject matter of
the motion. An amendment is improper if adoption of the amended motion has the
same effect as a rejection of the original motion.
   (B)   A motion may be amended, and that amendment may be amended, but no
further amendments may be made until the last offered amendment is disposed of
by a vote.
   (C)   Any amendment to a proposed ordinance shall be reduced to writing
before the vote on the amendment of any member.
§ 30.32 MOTION TO DISPOSE OF ISSUE WITHOUT DECIDING MERITS.
   (A)   Motion to defer consideration until a date certain. This motion
requires that a date be set when without further action by the Council a matter
will again be placed on the agenda.
   (B)   Motion to defer consideration indefinitely. Adoption of this motion
removes the issue from the Council's consideration until the time as a motion
to revive consideration is adopted (see §
30.33(A)).
   (C)   Motion to refer to a committee. Unless this motion includes an
instruction to report the matter back by a date certain, or unless a motion is
adopted under §
30.33(B), a matter referred to a committee remains there until returned to the
Council by the committee.
§ 30.33 MOTIONS TO REVIVE OR RECONSIDER AN ISSUE.
   (A)   Motion to revive consideration of an issue. Adoption of this motion
brings an issue back before the Council for its consideration, regardless of
whether the issue had been deferred indefinitely or to a date certain.
   (B)   Motion to recall an issue from committee. Adoption of this motion may
bring a matter immediately before the Council, or the motion may direct a
committee to report an issue back to the Council by a date certain.
   (C)   Motion to reconsider a vote. This motion may be made only at the
meeting at which the vote in question was taken and only by a member who voted
with the prevailing side. If adopted, the effect is to negate the earlier vote
and bring the matter back before the Council as if the earlier vote had never
taken place.
§ 30.34 RENEWAL OF MOTIONS.
   A motion that is defeated may be renewed at any subsequent meeting.
§ 30.35 MOTION TO TERMINATE DEBATE.
   A motion to call the previous question is a motion to cut off debate on a
matter under consideration and put the matter to a vote. This motion shall be
in order at any time, but unless each Council member present has had an
opportunity to speak at least once on the issue, the motion requires a two-
thirds vote for adoption. This motion is not debatable and may not be amended.
§ 30.36 PROCEDURAL MOTIONS.
   In addition to substantive proposals, the following procedural motions, and
not others, shall be in order. Unless otherwise noted, each motion is
debatable, may be amended and requires a majority of the votes cast, a quorum
being present, for adoption:
   (A)   Divide a complex question and consider it by paragraph;
   (B)   Suspend the rules. The motion requires for adoption a vote equal to
two-thirds of the actual membership of the Council, excluding the Mayor and
vacant seats. The Council may not suspend provisions of the rules that state
requirements imposed by law on the Council;
   (C)   To take a brief recess;
   (D)   To adjourn. The motion may be made only at the conclusion of action on
pending substantive matter; it can not interrupt deliberation of a pending
matter. A motion to adjourn (or recess) to a time and place certain shall also
comply with requirements of §
30.05; and
   (E)   To rescind or appeal. The motion is not in order if recession or
repeal of an action is forbidden by law.
OTHER COUNCIL MATTERS
§ 30.50 QUALIFICATIONS FOR OFFICE.
   Upon the motion of any member, the Council shall determine the
qualifications of any member. An office may be declared vacant by majority vote
of the Council membership if the member fails to meet any of the statutory or
constitutional requirements of office.
§ 30.51 APPOINTMENTS.
   (A)   All appointments made by the Council shall be made in open session.
The Council may not consider the qualifications, competence, performance,
character, fitness, appointment or removal of a member of the Town Council or
another body and may not consider or fill a vacancy among its own membership,
except in an open meeting. Final action making an appointment or discharge or
removal by a public body having final authority for the appointment or
discharge or removal shall be taken in an open meeting.
   (B)   Appointments to vacancies on Town Council. A vacancy on Town Council
shall be filled by the Council for the remainder of the unexpired terms.
      (1)   A candidate for appointment to a vacancy must complete and return
to the Town Clerk an application for appointment, on a form approved by the
Town Council and available from the town's website and the Town Clerk, by the
application deadline established by the Town Council or the Town Clerk.
      (2)   To be qualified for appointment to a vacant Town Council position,
a candidate must affirm the following on the application, under oath or by
affirmation:
         (a)   The candidate is or will be 21 years of age as of the date of
the application deadline; and
         (b)   The candidate resides within the town limits of Boone and has
resided within the town limits of Boone for the 30 days prior to the
application deadline, so that the candidate would have been qualified to vote
in a Town of Boone municipal election had an election been held on the date of
the application deadline.
      (3)   The Town Clerk shall reject any application in which the candidate
fails to affirm that the candidate meets the requirements of the foregoing
divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2).
      (4)   Procedure for appointment.
         (a)   Voting for appointment to a vacant Town Council position shall
first proceed by the nomination and ballot method:
            1.   The Mayor shall first open the floor to nominations.
Nominations shall be made by Council members from the applicants properly
before the Council, but a nomination shall require no "second." Once all
nominations have been made, the names of nominees shall be put forward by the
members and debated. Upon the conclusion of the debate, the Mayor shall propose
each name in alphabetical order and the members shall cast their votes. A
nominee receiving a majority of the votes cast shall be appointed.
            2.   Each Council member shall be entitled to one vote for each
position. If there are more than two nominees and no person receives a majority
of votes in the first vote, the applicant receiving the fewest votes shall be
excluded from further votes, and a second vote shall be taken. Unless excused
from voting, each member of the Council must cast a vote in each round of
voting. Voting rounds may continue in this fashion until a candidate receives a
majority of the votes or only two candidates remain for consideration.
         (b)   In the event voting by nomination and ballot results in a dead-
lock between two candidates, Council members shall proceed to vote by normal
motion procedure as provided at §§
30.10 through
30.13 herein.
   (C)   Vacancy in Office of Mayor. In case of a vacancy in the office of
Mayor, the remaining members of the Council may appoint a successor for the
unexpired term.
   (D)   All other appointments. The Council shall use the following procedure
to appoint individuals to various subordinate boards, commissions, task forces,
advisory bodies or committees, but this shall not apply to the designation by
the Council of one or more of its own members to participate or act as liaison
to boards, commissions, task forces, advisory bodies, committees or other
entities of its own creation or designation or appointment of one more of its
own members to participate or act as liaison to other bodies not created by the
town.
      (1)   At least two months before any anticipated vacancy on any board,
commission, task force, advisory body or committee (the "body") due to the
expiration of a term, the department head staffing the body shall notify the
Town Clerk of the expected vacancy. For vacancies created by resignation or
removal for failed attendance, the department head shall notify the Town Clerk
as soon as practical.
      (2)   At least 20 days before the Town Council meeting when the action is
to be taken, the Town Clerk shall cause to be published on the town's website
notice of the vacancies on town boards, commissions, task forces, advisory
bodies and committees for which appointments are contemplated, with the date
when action on the appointments is expected. So long as the advertisements
soliciting interest for an appointment to a body fully and accurately describe
criteria for membership that applies to multiple appointments to that body, the
Town Council may fill more than one position on the body from the applications
which are received, without regard to the time the vacancy occurs.
      (3)   Any person seeking appointment to a body, including individuals
seeking reappointment to the body and student representatives to the body, must
complete and submit to the Town Clerk an "Application for Appointment to a
Board, Commission, Task Force, Advisory Body or Committee" on a form approved
by the Town Council and available from the town's website and the Town Clerk.
      (4)   The Town Clerk shall include in the Board book for the meeting
where the appointment shall be considered:
         (a)   A copy of each timely application received for the appointment;
         (b)   A current roster of the membership of the body in question, with
terms shown; and
         (c)   A copy of the selection criteria, if any, established under
state law or town ordinance, such as the Unified Development Ordinance.
      (5)   Should an application be submitted too late for inclusion in the
Board book, it shall be included in the Board book of the Council’s regular
meeting the following month. Unless a person’s application is provided in the
Board book, the person shall not be considered for the appointment, but this
provision shall not prevent the Town Council from delaying appointment of the
position in question until a later meeting.
      (6)   Except as superseded by state law or otherwise directed by other
town ordinance, a person must be 18 years or older to be eligible for
appointment to a board.
      (7)   Except as superseded by state law or otherwise directed by other
town ordinance, people who reside in the town shall generally be favored for
appointment to town bodies over people who reside outside the town. However,
when an applicant does not reside in the town, but has particular skills or
experience that make appointment of that applicant desirable, the applicant may
nevertheless be appointed.
      (8)   The Town Council shall generally avoid appointment of any one
person to more than two bodies. In addition, no person other than a Town
Council member shall be allowed to serve on more than three concurrently
existing town bodies, including boards, commissions, task forces, advisory
bodies, committees or other entities. Any person inadvertently appointed to
more than three bodies shall be given an opportunity to resign from a
sufficient number of bodies to meet this limit, but after notice, if the person
fails to effectuate the resignations by notice to the Clerk within 30 days, the
Town Council shall designate the bodies upon which the person shall continue to
serve, and the designation shall operate to remove the person from all other
bodies.
      (9)   Council member may request that applicants for a body be present at
the Council meeting during which the appointment is expected to be made so that
the applicant may be questioned by members of the Council as to the applicant’s
qualifications. Even if no request is made, it shall be proper for Council
members to directly contact applicants to discuss the applicant’s interest in
and qualification for the appointment.
      (10)   At the meeting during which an appointment is to be made, the
Mayor shall first open the floor to nominations. Nominations shall be made by
Council members from the applicants properly before the Council, but a
nomination shall require no “second”. Once all nominations have been made, the
names of nominees shall be put forward by the members and debated. Upon the
conclusion of the debate, the Mayor shall propose each name in alphabetical
order and the members shall cast their votes.
      (11)   Each Council member shall be entitled to one vote for each
position, and when multiple appointments are made, each member cast each vote
for a different nominee. Voting shall continue until a nominee receives a
majority of the votes cast, whereupon that person shall be appointed. If more
appointments are to be made and an insufficient number of nominees receives a
majority of votes, there shall be successive votes until the requisite
appointments are made by majority vote. In each successive vote, any persons
receiving a majority of votes in the previous round and the applicant with the
fewest votes from the previous vote shall be excluded from further votes. If no
person receives a majority of votes in the second vote, the applicant receiving
the fewest votes in the second vote shall be excluded from further votes, and a
third vote shall be taken. Unless excused from voting, each member of the
Council must cast a vote in each round of voting.
      (12)   Members of a board, commission, task force, advisory body,
committee and other entity (hereafter, “the body”), except in cases in which a
particular term of service is specified, are appointed for the duration of the
body. However, if the duration of the body is indefinite, unless the Town
Council specifies a different term of membership, membership will be for three
years and may be renewed for one additional three-year term. Unless otherwise
specified by the Town Council, no person may serve on the body for more than
six consecutive years, but a person may be reappointed to the body following a
one-year period of non-membership. Unless the Town Council takes specific
action to excuse the absences and reappoints a member of the body after being
informed by the Town Clerk of the member’s removal, a member shall be
automatically removed for failure to attend three consecutive meetings or for
failure to attend 50% of the meetings within any 12-month period. Absence due
to sickness, death or other emergencies of like nature shall be recognized as
excused absences, and shall not be included in the attendance calculations nor
affect the member’s status on the body; except that, in the event of a long
illness or other cause for prolonged absence, the member shall be replaced. The
Town Clerk shall notify any member who has been removed. In addition, a member
of the Town Council may propose removal of a member for any cause related to
the performance of official duties, but before removal on that basis, the
member shall be given an opportunity to appear before the Town Council to
address the issues involved.
      (13)   Except for age and residency requirements, any of the foregoing
provisions may be waived by a four-fifths majority vote of Council where deemed
necessary in light of exigent circumstances. The Council recognizes that the
urgency of filling such vacancies may vary depending upon the circumstances of
the vacancy.

§ 30.52 CODE OF ETHICS.
   (A)   General principles underlying the Code of Ethics.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to establish
guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for members of the Town Council,
including the Mayor and members of the town's various volunteer boards,
committees and task forces (hereinafter, "committees") and to provide guidance
in determining what conduct is appropriate in particular cases. This Code
should not be considered a substitute for the law or for a Council member's
best judgment, and the provisions herein should be considered minimum standards
and examples. Town Council and committee members shall strive to bring the
perception and actual honesty to all endeavors related to town matters or which
may reflect on the public perception of the town.
      (2)   Commitment to the Code of Ethics. No person elected or appointed to
the Town Council or appointed to a committee of the town shall begin official
duties until that person has certified that he or she has read this Code of
Ethics. Each person so elected or appointed shall be provided by the Town Clerk
with a copy of this Code of Ethics.
      (3)   Foundation of Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics is founded on the
following ideas and they shall inform the interpretation of the Code of Ethics.
         (a)   The stability and proper operation of democratic representative
government depends upon public confidence in the integrity of the government
and upon responsible exercise of the trust conferred by the people upon their
elected officials and the other persons they appoint to transact the
government's business.
         (b)   Governmental decisions and policy must be made and implemented
through proper channels, and fair and open processes of the governmental
structure to the extent possible.
         (c)   Elected local government officials must be able to act in a
manner that maintains their integrity and independence, yet is responsive to
the interests and needs of those they represent, without fear of reprisal or
condemnation.
         (d)   Elected local government officials must always remain aware that
at various times they play different roles:
            1.   As advocates, who strive to advance the legitimate needs of
the citizens;
            2.   As legislators, who balance the public interest and private
rights in considering and enacting ordinances, orders and resolutions; and
            3.   As fair and impartial decision-makers, when making quasi-
judicial and administrative determinations.
         (e)   Elected local government officials must know how to distinguish
among these roles, to determine when each role is appropriate, and to act
accordingly.
         (f)   Elected local government officials must be aware of their
obligation to conform their behavior to standards of ethical conduct that
warrant the trust of their constituents. Each official must ultimately find
within his or her own conscience the touchstone by which to determine what
conduct is appropriate.
         (g)   People serving on the various boards, committees and task forces
(hereinafter referred to as "committee members") that often inform the
legislative, administrative and decision-making processes must exercise their
roles in a manner as to justify the trust placed upon them by their elected
officials, and they must not use their positions for improper purposes.
   (B)   Code of Ethics.
      (1)   (a)   Principle 1-1. Town Council and committee members should obey
all laws, including state and federal laws and regulations, and local
ordinances which apply to their official actions.
         (b)   Principle 1-2. Town Council and committee members should be
guided by the spirit as well as the letter of the law in whatever they do.
         (c)   Principle 1-3. Town Council and committee members shall endeavor
to keep themselves up to date about new or ongoing legal or ethical issues they
may face in their official positions. They should avail themselves of resources
and training in these areas which may be reasonably available to them. Town
Council and committee members should review the pertinent sections in the
town's code, Unified Development Ordinance and other sources concerning the
procedures by which they perform their duties so that they will be
knowledgeable and informed as they do so.
      (2)   Mandates:
         (a)   Town Council and committee members must ask to be recused from
voting on matters involving their own direct or indirect financial interests or
official conduct and must not participate in the deliberations or votes
regarding the matters. They must avoid attempting to influence others who are
involved in approving, making or administering a contract with the town if they
will derive a direct benefit from the contract.
         (b)   Town Council and committee members must avoid soliciting or
receiving any gift or reward in exchange for recommending, influencing or
attempting to influence the award of any contract by the town.
         (c)   Town Council members and committee members shall reject any gift
or favor from a current, past or potential contractor of the town.
         (d)   Town Council members and committee members should not knowingly
accept any gift unless it falls within one of the exceptions set forth below. A
prohibited gift shall be promptly declined, returned, paid for at fair market
value, or donated to charity or the city.
            1.   Exceptions. These prohibitions shall not apply to any of the
following:
               a.   Gifts from the official’s extended family, or a member of
the same household.
               b.   Anything generally made available or distributed to the
general public without charge.
               c.   A memento such as a commemorative shovel, plaque, figurine,
trinket, or novelty item related to a civic occasion or event.
               d.   Informational materials relevant to the duties of the
official.
               e.   Food and beverages for immediate consumption in connection
with any of the following gatherings, so long as the official pays the same
amount, if any, that other attendees are charged for attending the gathering or
for the food and drink:
                  i.   A meeting of the Town Council (or committee).
                  ii.   Business meetings.
                  iii.   A gathering open to the general public.
               f.   Tickets or admittance to, and food and beverages for
immediate consumption at, an event or meeting where the official is clearly
representing the town and where the town has a legitimate purpose in being
represented at the event. By way of illustration but not limitation, this would
include community events sponsored by the town and events or meetings hosted by
the Boone TDA, the Downtown Boone Development Association, local government
agencies and authorities, Appalachian University and other educational
institutions, and similar organizations.
            2.   For purposes of this division,“gift” means anything of
monetary value given or received without fair market value given in return or,
for loans or other contractual arrangements, on terms that are not available to
the general public in the normal course of business. Gifts do not include the
following:
               a.   Academic or athletic scholarships given based on the same
criteria as applied to the general public.

Ch. 163, Art. 22A (North Carolina Campaign Contributions Law).
               c.   Expressions of condolence related to a death of an

food or beverages for immediate consumption, or donations to a religious
organization, charity, the state or a political subdivision of the state, not
to exceed a total of $200 per death per donor.
         (e)   Town Council and committee members shall avoid using knowledge
of a contemplated action by the town, or information learned in their official
capacities and not made public, to acquire a financial interest in any
property, transaction or enterprise, or to otherwise gain a financial benefit
that may be affected by the information or contemplated action, and they shall
not help another person in doing so.
         (f)   Town Council and committee members shall not participate in or
vote upon any quasi-judicial matter coming before them if prior to hearing the
evidence of the case they have a fixed opinion that is not susceptible to
change; they have had undisclosed ex parte communications regarding the
substance of the matter involved; they have a close familial, business or other
associational relationship with an affected person; or they have a financial
interest in the outcome of the matter.
         (g)   Every Town Council member shall attend statutorily mandated
ethics training.
      (3)   (a)   Principle 2-1. Town Council and committee members should act
with integrity and with independence from improper influence as they exercise
the functions of their offices.
         (b)   Principle 2-2. Town Council and committee members should use
their best independent judgment to pursue the common good as they see it,
presenting their opinions to all in a reasonable, forthright and consistent
manner.
         (c)   Principle 2-3. Town Council and committee members should not be
subject to improper influence by family, friends, business associates or others
who are motivated by self-interest rather than the common good, but they must
be able to consider the opinions and ideas of others throughout the community
as they formulate approaches to the issues with which they are presented.
         (d)   Principle 2-4. Town Council and committee members should strive
to show respect toward other persons with whom they interact, including each
other, recognizing that they may often be perceived as representing the town
itself even when they are acting in a personal capacity.
         (e)   Principle 2-5. Town Council and committee members shall strive
to not form a final opinion regarding an issue until all sides have been given
a reasonable opportunity to present their viewpoints.
         (f)   Principle 2-6. In situations in which recusal from voting or
participation is not allowed, but an objective observer may believe that a
conflict of interest exists, Town Council members shall seek to explain their
inability to seek recusal while striving to discharge their responsibilities to
advance the common good.
      (4)   Mandates:
         (a)   Town Council and committee members must be free to assert policy
positions and opinions without fear of reprisal from fellow Town Council or
committee members or citizens. So, to assert that a Town Council or committee
member is behaving unethically based simply upon a disagreement with that Town
Council or committee member related to a question of policy, as opposed to the
Town Council or committee member's actual unethical behavior, is unfair,
dishonest, irresponsible and itself unethical.
         (b)   Town Council and committee members who are involved in quasi-
judicial procedures shall actively avoid inappropriate contacts with interested
persons regarding the issues involved in those procedures, and when despite
their best efforts they engage in the contacts, they shall disclose them and
withdraw from participation in the procedures.
      (5)   (a)   Principle 3-1. Town Council and committee members should
avoid impropriety in the exercise of their official duties. Their official
actions should be above reproach.
         (b)   Principle 3-2. Town Council and committee members should
recognize that they are part of a larger group and should act accordingly. They
should respect their office and not behave in ways that reflect badly on it.
They should treat other Town Council and committee members and the public with
respect, and should honor the opinions of others even when they disagree.
         (c)   Principle 3-3. If a Town Council or committee member concludes
that his or her actions which the Town Council or committee member believes are
legal and ethical may be misunderstood, he or she should seek the advice of the
Town Attorney as to whether the actions are legal and ethical. Alternatively,
he or she may state on the record the facts of the situation and the steps
taken to resolve it.
      (6)   Mandates:
         (a)   A Town Council or committee member should never make a request
to a town employee, including the Town Manager, for an action, forbearance or
other thing of value which would benefit himself or herself or any other person
or entity, whether or not the Town Council and committee member has a familial,
business or other relationship with that person or entity, unless as an
ordinary citizen of the town it would be appropriate to make a request. Even in
instances where a request would ordinarily be appropriate, a Town Council or
committee member making a request must disclose to the employee that he or she
is not entitled to preferential treatment, that the request should be rejected
if it would not customarily be granted to an ordinary citizen of the town, and
that the employee may refuse the request without fear of reprisal.
         (b)   Town Council and committee members shall not attempt to
influence a decision by the Town Council or the committee on which they serve
relative to any action from which they will derive a direct financial benefit,
although they shall not be precluded from appearing in an individual capacity
to testify in quasi-judicial zoning procedures which have a substantial impact
upon their own property interests so long as those interests are disclosed.
         (c)   Town Council and committee members shall not solicit or accept
any gift or other thing of value which might be perceived as affecting any vote
or decision involving the donor, but the receipt of an honorarium for
participating in a meeting, the receipt of an advertising item or souvenir of
nominal value or a meal furnished at a banquet will not be considered a
violation of this principle so long as it does not actually influence the Town
Council or committee member in the discharge of his or her official duties. In
the event a Town Council or committee member has inadvertently accepted a gift
or other thing of value from a person seeking action by the town, the Town
Council member or committee member may not attempt to influence the decision or
participate in any vote relating to the decision.
         (d)   Town Council and committee members must recognize that unless
specifically charged with representing the town, Council or committee, they are
not authorized to act on behalf of the town, Council or committee, and they
should not offer their opinions, positions or analysis as representing the
views of the town, Council or committee unless the Council or committee has
itself taken official action as a body in conformity with those opinions,
positions or analysis.
         (e)   Town Council members and committee members shall not demand
information from other Town Council members or committee members to which they
are not legally entitled by threatening to take formal legal action or by
making a public records request against the other if the recipient of the
request refuses to provide the requested information.
      (7)   (a)   Principle 4-1. Town Council and committee members should be
faithful in the performance of the duties of their offices.
         (b)   Principle 4-2. Town Council and committee members should be
diligent in their attendance at meetings and in their preparation for those
meetings. They should carefully analyze all credible information that is
provided to them and recognize the importance to the well being of the town and
its citizens of many of their decisions.
         (c)   Principle 4-3. Town Council members shall seek full
accountability from those over whom the Town Council has authority,
particularly with regard to the expenditure of public funds.
         (d)   Principle 4-4. Town Council members should set a good example
for others in the community, keeping in mind that trust and respect must
continually be earned.
         (e)   Principle 4-5. Town Council and committee members should be
willing to bear their fair share of the workload, commensurate with their
skills and other commitments.
         (f)   Principle 4-6. Town Council members in particular should strive
to recognize that by accepting the public trust, they may have to subordinate
their personal endeavors to discharge their official responsibilities. To the
extent appropriate, they should be willing to put the town's interests ahead of
their own.
      (8)   Mandates:
         (a)   Town Council and committee members should keep confidential
information entrusted to them in legally called and held closed sessions, the
disclosure of which has or may have a negative impact on the interests of the
town itself, and they shall keep private confidentially obtained information
about other members which would embarrass those members or expose them to
public ridicule, but which has no bearing on the performance of any official
duty.
         (b)   Unless such service has been authorized by action of a super
majority of the Town Council, four-fifths of the members in attendance, upon a
finding that individual service is in the interests of the town as a whole and
that an exception should therefore be made, members of the Town Council shall
not serve on the boards of directors of organizations that have contracts with
the town, or that seek funding or similar support from the town.
      (9)   (a)   Principle 5-1. Town Council and committee members shall
conduct the affairs of their boards in an open and public manner.
         (b)   Principle 5-2. Town Council and committee members should
remember when meeting that they are conducting the public's business.
         (c)   Principle 5-3. Town Council and committee members should
remember that except for those records otherwise protected by law against
public disclosure, the records of the town belong to the public and not to them
or the town's employees. They should make clear that a climate of openness is
to be maintained at all times in the town.
         (d)   Principle 5-4. In order to ensure strict compliance with the
laws governing openness, Town Council members should prohibit unjustified
delays in fulfilling public records requests should they become aware of the
delays. They should assure themselves before they go into closed session that
the closed session is called for a lawful purpose.
      (10)   Mandates: Town Council and committee members must comply with all
applicable laws governing open meetings and public records.
   (C)   Censure procedures.
      (1)   If the Town Council has reason to believe that one of its members
or a member of a town committee has violated a mandate of this Code of Ethics,
by majority vote of the Town Council members present and voting, it may open an
investigation into the matter, using the resources of the town to compile the
necessary information to make a determination. If the proceeding involves a
Town Council member's actions, that member shall not participate in the vote to
authorize the investigation.
      (2)   Following investigation, all information compiled, including any
grounds for the finding of probable cause that a mandate has been violated
shall be summarized in writing by the Town Manager, Town Attorney or other
person as may be designated by the Town Council, and the written summary shall
be shared with the accused Town Council or committee member promptly when it is
available. All information pertaining to the case shall be open to public
inspection and copying as pursuant to G.S. §§ 132-1 et seq.
      (3)   Following the investigation and report, should the Town Council
determine, by vote of a two-thirds majority of those present and voting, that
it wishes to proceed further with a censure proceeding, it shall call for and
schedule a quasi-judicial hearing at a regular meeting or special meeting
convened for that purpose. If the proceeding involves a Town Council member's
actions, that member shall not participate in the vote to proceed or schedule
the hearing.
      (4)   The notice of the hearing stating its time, place, and purpose
shall be published at least two times, once each in two separate calendar weeks
in a newspaper of general circulation, or it shall be advertised daily for at
least ten days on the town's official website. If placed in the newspaper, the
initial notice shall be published at least ten days and not more than 25 days
before the date set for the hearing and shall state that the summary regarding
the allegations against the Town Council or committee member is available for
public inspection and copying in the office of the Town Clerk.
      (5)   The hearing shall be convened at the time and place specified. Any
and all votes during the hearing and any deliberations that follow shall be
taken by a vote of the full Town Council in attendance and participating, and
each vote shall be recorded in the minutes. The hearing and any deliberations
shall be conducted in open session in accordance with the requirements of the
state's open meetings statutes, G.S. §§ 143-318.9 and 143-318.10.
      (6)   The accused Town Council or committee member shall have the right
to challenge the participation in the case of any other Town Council member or
the Presiding Officer, based on bias or self-interest. If a challenge is made,
the Town Council shall immediately hear evidence and vote on the challenge in a
separate hearing conducted for that purpose. It shall not be a basis for
removal of a Town Council member that he or she was the person who offered the
motion to investigate the behavior in question or to conduct the hearing.
Neither the accused Town Council member, if any, nor the Town Council member
whose participation is challenged, may vote on the challenge although both may
offer evidence. The challenge shall be decided by a majority vote of those
present and voting, a quorum being present not including the person accused and
the person challenged. If more than one person's participation is challenged,
however, a separate hearing shall be conducted as to each challenged member's
participation and all members, except the accused member and challenged member
shall participate in the vote as to the right of the challenged member to
participate.
      (7)   The rules governing any hearing as to bias and the hearing on the
underlying ethical charges shall be those that apply to a standard quasi-
judicial hearing, and an audio or video recording of the proceedings shall be
made. All hearings on this policy shall be conducted by the Town Attorney.
During the hearing, the accused Town Council or committee member shall have the
right:
         (a)   To have counsel present;
         (b)   To present and cross-examine expert and other witnesses; and
         (c)   To offer evidence.
      (8)   Any person in attendance at the hearing with knowledge of the
alleged incident(s) giving rise to or materially related to the allegation
shall be given an opportunity to testify, and all testimony shall be taken
under oath.
      (9)   Once the hearing is concluded, it shall be closed by majority vote.
The Presiding Officer shall then entertain a motion to adopt a non-binding
resolution censuring the Town Council or committee member based on specified
violations of the mandates of the Code of Ethics. Any motion made must be an
affirmative one in favor of adopting a non-binding resolution of censure. If
the motion or resolution does not state particular grounds for censure under
the Code of Ethics, the Presiding Officer shall rule it out of order. If a
motion to adopt a non-binding resolution of censure stating particular grounds
under the Code of Ethics has been made, the Board shall debate the motion. The
accused Town Council member, if any, and any other Town Council member who has
been removed from participation because of bias or self-interest may remain
present, but shall not be allowed to participate in the debate. At the
conclusion of the debate, the Town Council shall vote, except for the accused
Town Council member, if any, and any other Town Council member who has been
removed from participation. If the motion is approved by a minimum two-thirds
vote of those present and voting, a quorum being present, the motion will be
approved and the non-binding resolution of censure adopted. The quorum
requirement shall be met if the requisite number is present, even though
removal of some from participation may prevent a quorum from actually voting on
the issue.
      (10)   If a resolution of censure is adopted, it shall become a part of
the official record of the Town Council. If it pertains to a member of a
committee, it shall be the basis for further action, which may be taken
immediately following the vote of censure, to remove the committee member from
the committee upon which he or she serves.

Manager refuses to waive or make any adjustment in the amount in question.
However, in cases in which the Town Manager has declined to exercise authority
or where the amount a current customer seeks to have waived or modified exceeds
$3,000, the request shall be referred to the Town Council for action. The Town
Council may waive or modify the amount up to a total of $15,000, and may
authorize repayment of any amount which is not waived in equal installments
over a period of up to eight months. For the Town Council to exercise any
authority under this section, it must conclude that the cause of the unpaid
bill was beyond the control of the customer, that the customer acted
expediently in the case of a leak once the existence of the leak was
discovered, and that the customer has acted in good faith and with an interest
in minimizing any loss of water to the town’s system. In general, neither the
Town Manager, nor the Town Council, should waive any portion of an unpaid
amount which has accrued over a period exceeding three billing cycles.
      (2)   The Director of Public Utilities shall provide the Town Manager

or her recommendation. In each case in which Town Council approval must be
sought, the Director of Public Utilities shall also provide the Town Council
with the report and recommendation.
   (C)   In cases in which the amount sought to be waived is caused by a water
leak and the amounts incurred by the customer relate to both water and sewer
charges, the Town Manager can also modify and waive the indebtedness relating
to the sewer charges without limit, if it is determined that none of the water
for which the charges are waived actually discharged into or impacted the sewer
system.

§ 50.106 CLASSIFICATION OF SERVICE.
   All services are classified under two categories, residential and
commercial.
   (A)   Residential service shall be service to any residential customer or
unit with a meter size up to one inch.
   (B)   Commercial service shall be service to any non-residential customer,
unit(s) or building regardless of meter size, including a school or church, or
to any single-family or multi-family residential property or unit(s) with a
meter size greater than one inch.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Ord. passed 7-17-2012)
§ 50.107 RATE SCHEDULE AND DEPOSITS.
   (A)   All customers will be charged a deposit and billed at the rates

or entity. In addition, the applicant must provide satisfactory evidence, such
as, but not limited to, a tax bill, deed or lease, that the person or entity in
whose name the person is acting is the owner of the property in question. By
signing a waiver of deposit and personal guarantee, the property owner
authorizes the Administrator to add to his or her account any unpaid, past due
charges incurred by the user of the residential service. By signing the waiver
of deposit and personal guarantee, the property owner/guarantor agrees that in
the event that the user of the residential service fails to pay any bill in
full when due, the delinquent account balance owed to the town will be
automatically added to the guarantor’s account.
   (D)   A separate deposit is required for each customer and adjunct customer.

§ 50.109 INDIVIDUAL METERING REQUIRED; EXCEPTION FOR MASTER METERS FOR
MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Policy statement. To ensure a fair distribution of system costs among
its customers, it is the general policy of the town to require that every
customer have its own meter and that each customer represent an individual
water user, consisting of a single commercial unit or a single residential
living unit. Since the town recognizes that certain current customers’ water
connections may not conform to this policy, the following rules seek to balance
the need for implementation of this policy with the costs which might result if
immediate and full compliance were required, while ensuring that customers are
treated in a fair and uniform way in sharing the costs of the town’s water
system.
   (B)   Meters for commercial developments.  In accordance with the following
rules and at the times specified herein, each commercial unit shall have a
separate meter installed, and each commercial customer’s service must be
separately metered at a single delivery and metering point. For purposes of
this section, a commercial “unit” consists of each commercial use separately
classified under the North Carolina Rate Discharge Schedule. For example, each
separate bay, retail store, office, restaurant, and the like, within a shopping
center or mall, and every such unit existing on a single parcel of property, is
considered a separate commercial unit. A commercial “development” consists of
each separate parcel of land upon which there is one or more commercial units,
excluding mixed-use developments as defined herein.
      (1)   New water service will only be provided to a commercial unit
constructed, erected or relocated at or to a location where no prior commercial
unit existed if the unit is individually metered for water service. Each new
unit constructed, erected or relocated is required to have its own individual
meter.
      (2)   Before any new water service will be provided or current service
maintained to an existing commercial development which has been repaired,
replaced, renovated, or reconstructed, in which the total cost of all repair,
replacement, renovation or reconstruction exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing development, each and every commercial unit within the commercial
development shall be separately metered. However, if the Administrator
determines that the configuration of the existing commercial development is
such that the costs involved in installing individual meters is so excessive as
to significantly outweigh the interests of the town in individual metering, he
may waive this requirement in whole or in part.
         (a)   For purposes of this section, “the total cost of all repair,
replacement, renovation or reconstruction” shall be the actual cost of the
repair, replacement, renovation or reconstruction. “Actual cost” includes the
cost of all materials and services utilized to accomplish the repair,
replacement, renovation or reconstruction, including, but not limited to sales
tax, the costs of design, engineering fees, and all construction costs, whether
undertaken at one time or in stages extending over a period of up to two years
or such longer period as is authorized by any single special use permit,
special use permit modification, building permit, or conditional zoning
district approval or modification, as applicable.
         (b)   For purposes of this section, the “value of the existing
development” shall be considered the value of the property, as determined by
the Watauga County Tax Administrator and reflected in the tax rolls of Watauga
County, North Carolina, at the time the repair, replacement, renovation or
reconstruction is commenced.
      (3)   Although an existing, non-conforming, commercial development in
which separate commercial units receive water service through a single meter
may continue to receive water service until such time, if any, that the
development must install individual meters in accordance with this section, the
minimum water and sewer fees for each meter which serves multiple commercial
units shall be the amount of the minimum fees which would apply if each
separate commercial unit had its own meter, sized according to the size of the
water line actually serving each separate commercial unit.
   (C)   Meters for mixed-use developments. Mixed use developments are
individual parcels of land upon which both one or more commercial units and one
or more residential units exist. For purposes of this section, a “residential
unit” is each separate dwelling unit, consisting of a room or group of rooms
within a structure forming a single independent habitable unit and containing
independent kitchen, sanitary, and sleeping facilities. Except as provided at
division (E) below for buildings containing five or more residential units, and
in accordance with the following rules and at the times specified herein, each
commercial unit and each residential unit within a mixed-use development shall
have a separate meter installed and must be separately metered at a single
delivery and metering point.
      (1)   New water service will only be provided to a commercial or
residential unit constructed, erected or relocated in a mixed unit development
at or to a location where no prior like (commercial to commercial; residential
to residential) commercial or residential unit existed, if the unit is
individually metered for water service. Each new unit constructed, erected or
relocated is required to have its own individual meter.
      (2)   Before any new water service will be provided or current service
maintained to an existing mixed use development in which each separate
commercial and residential unit not individually metered for water service is
repaired, replaced, renovated, or reconstructed, and the total cost of all
repair, replacement, renovation or reconstruction of the commercial portion of
the development exceeds 50% of the value of the existing commercial
development, each and every commercial unit within the commercial development
must be separately metered. When an existing mixed use development in which
each separate commercial and residential unit not individually metered for
water service is repaired, replaced, renovated, or reconstructed, and the total
cost of all repair, replacement, renovation or reconstruction of the
residential portion of the development exceeds 50% of the value of the existing
residential development, each and every residential unit within the mixed use
development shall be separately metered before any new water service will be
provided or current service maintained. However, if the Administrator
determines that the configuration of the existing commercial or residential
portion of the development is such that the costs involved in installing
individual meters is so excessive as to significantly outweigh the interests of
the town in individual metering, he or she may waive this requirement in whole
or in part.
         (a)   For purposes of this section, “the total cost of all repair,
replacement, renovation or reconstruction” shall be the actual cost of the
repair, replacement, renovation or reconstruction. “Actual cost” includes the
cost of all materials and services utilized to accomplish the repair,
replacement, renovation or reconstruction, including, but not limited to sales
tax, the costs of design, engineering fees, and all construction costs, whether
undertaken at one time or in stages extending over a period of up to two years
or such longer period as is authorized by any single special use permit,
special use permit modification, building permit, or conditional zoning
district approval or modification, as applicable.
         (b)   For purposes of this sub-section, the “value of the existing . .
. development,” whether referring to the commercial portion or residential
portion of the mixed use development, shall be considered the value of that
particular portion of the property, as determined by the Watauga County Tax
Administrator and reflected in the tax rolls of Watauga County, North Carolina,
at the time the repair, replacement, renovation or reconstruction is commenced,
or if the Tax Administrator has not assigned separate values to the commercial
and residential portions of the property, the appraised value of the individual
portions, as provided by the customer. Should the Tax Administrator not have
assigned separate values and no appraisal be provided, the Administrator will
pro-rate the value of each portion based upon the square footage of each
portion compared to the whole development to calculate the applicable value.
      (3)   Although an existing, non-conforming mixed use development in which
separate commercial and/or residential units receive water service through a
single meter may continue to receive water service until such time, if any,
that the development must install individual meters in accordance with this
section, the minimum water and sewer fees for each meter which serves multiple
commercial and/or residential units shall be the amount of the minimum fees
which would apply if each separate commercial and/or residential unit had its
own meter, sized according to the size of the water line actually serving each
separate commercial and/or residential unit.
   (D)   Meters for residential developments. In accordance with the following
rules and at the time specified herein, each residential unit shall have
installed a separate meter, and each residential customer’s service must be
separately metered at a single delivery and metering point. For purposes of
this section, a “residential unit” is each separate dwelling unit, consisting
of a room or group of rooms within a structure forming a single independent
habitable unit containing independent kitchen, sanitary, and sleeping
facilities.
      (1)   New water service will only be provided to a residential unit
constructed, erected or relocated at or to a location where no prior
residential unit existed if the unit is individually metered for water service.
Each new unit constructed, erected or relocated is required to have its own
individual meter.
      (2)   Before any new water service will be provided or current service
maintained to an existing residential development in which each separate
residential unit not individually metered for water service is repaired,
replaced, renovated, or reconstructed, and the total cost of all repair,
replacement, renovation or reconstruction exceeds 50% of the value of the
existing development, each and every residential unit within the residential
development shall be separately metered. However, if the Administrator
determines that the configuration of the existing residential development is
such that the costs involved in installing individual meters is so excessive as
to significantly outweigh the interests of the Town in individual metering, he
may waive this requirement in whole or in part.
         (a)   For purposes of this section, “the total cost of all repair,
replacement, renovation or reconstruction” shall be the actual cost of the
repair, replacement, renovation or reconstruction. “Actual cost” includes the
cost of all materials and services utilized to accomplish the repair,
replacement, renovation or reconstruction, including, but not limited to sales
tax, the costs of design, engineering fees, and all construction costs, whether
undertaken at one time or in stages extending over a period of up to two years
or such longer period as is authorized by any single special use permit,
special use permit modification, building permit, or conditional zoning
district approval or modification, as applicable.
         (b)   For purposes of this section, the “value of the existing
development” shall be considered the value of the property, as determined by
the Watauga County Tax Administrator and reflected in the tax rolls of Watauga
County, North Carolina, at the time the repair, replacement, renovation or
reconstruction is commenced.
      (3)   Although an existing, non-conforming residential development in
which separate residential units receive water service through a single meter
may continue to receive water service until such time, if any, that the
development must install individual meters in accordance with this section, the
minimum water and sewer fees for each meter which serves multiple residential
units shall be the amount of the minimum fees which would apply if each
separate residential unit had its own 3/4" meter.
   (E)   Divisions (C) and (D) above shall not apply, and individual meters
shall not be required where there are five or more residential units in an
existing building or proposed new building. In any such building, a single
master meter may be installed and used for the residential units; provided:
      (1)   Each such master meter arrangement shall be specifically approved
in writing by the Public Works Director or his or her designee. Once a master
meter arrangement is established for any property, it may be changed to
separate metering only by agreement of the public works director or his or her
designee, on a time schedule convenient to the town, and only if the owner or
other party responsible for the master meter bill shall cover the full cost to
the town of any such change.
      (2)   In addition to the regular utility rate based on water and sewer
usage through such master meter, the minimum water and sewer fees for each
meter which serves multiple residential units shall be the amount of the
minimum fees which would apply if each separate residential unit had its own
meter, sized according to the size of the water line actually serving each
separate residential unit.
      (3)   Total tap fees, installation fees, system development fees, and
other town charges and fees relating to or arising from installation of new
service or for improvements or any other installations relating to existing
service shall be assessed at the same rates as would apply if all residential
units in the building were each separately metered.
(Ord. passed 7-17-2012; Ord. passed 5-28-2025)
§ 50.110 LOCATION OF METERS.
   (A)   All water meters must be located so that, as determined by the
Administrator, they may be easily accessed by the town for measuring water
usage, for repair and for replacement, and the requirements of this section and
§
50.114 regarding the customer’s responsibilities relative to the meter must be
met at all times.
   (B)   No new water meter may be installed in a publicly owned sidewalk
unless there is neither available and suitable public right-of-way nor suitable
location on the property to be served upon which to install the meter. When
five or more water meters must be installed to serve any one location, they may
not be installed in public right of way unless, as determined by the
Administrator, there is no suitable location on the property to be served upon
which to install them.
   (C)   A new water meter may only be installed on the property to be served
at a location agreed upon by the Administrator and the property owner, and
prior to the installation of the meter, the property owner must execute and
deliver to the Administrator an easement, in a form acceptable to the
Administrator and suitable for recording, conveying all rights necessary for
the town to install, read, service, and replace the meter, and to maintain all
appurtenant equipment, lines and facilities between the public water main and
the meter.
(Ord. passed 7-17-2012)
§ 50.111 CONNECTION OF SERVICE BY TOWN.
   (A)   The town shall only be required to run a service line from the town’s
distribution line to the agreed upon location for the customer’s meter if the
customer’s nearest property line is adjacent to a public right-of-way. When the
customer’s nearest property line is not adjacent to a public right-of-way, the
customer is solely responsible for installing and maintaining all piping and
other required facilities and for acquiring and providing proof of all
necessary easements from the customer’s property to the appropriate public
right-of-way. In every case it is the customer’s responsibility to connect and
maintain all piping and facilities from the meter to the customer’s plumbing
system.
   (B)   When the town installs two or more meters on the same property for
different customers, they shall be closely grouped, but shall be labeled so as
to identify to which customer each meter applies.
(Ord. passed 7-17-2012)
§ 50.112 TOWN NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTAIN MATTERS OR DAMAGES.
   The town shall not be responsible for the following matters or damages. The
failure to mention a particular type of claim or damage in the following
paragraphs shall not authorize liability on the part of the town, does not
constitute a waiver of governmental or sovereign immunity, and no
responsibility or liability may be inferred by its exclusion. Among others:
   (A)   Although the town shall make a good faith effort to notify affected
customers before service is discontinued or interrupted, the customer or
adjunct customer, by making application for service, a customer or adjunct
customer agrees to hold the town harmless from liability for any damages that
may occur due to discontinuance or interruption of service.
   (B)   The town is not responsible for inspecting the customer’s or adjunct
customer’s piping or plumbing apparatus and facilities and is not responsible
for the condition of that piping, plumbing or facilities. A customer’s piping
or plumbing apparatus and facilities consists of all piping or apparatus from
the customer’s side of the meter on the customer’s property or on property the
customer has crossed.
   (C)   The town is not liable for damage of any kind whatsoever resulting
from water or the use of water on the customer’s or adjunct customer’s
premises, unless the damage results directly from negligence on the part of the
town and is covered by the town’s liability insurance coverage. The town is not
responsible for damage done by or resulting from any defect in the piping,
facilities, fixtures or appliances on the customer’s or adjunct customer’s side
of the water meter. The town is not responsible for damage caused, wholly or in
part, by the negligence of the customer, adjunct customer, or third parties or
damage caused by forces beyond the control of the town.
   (D)   To the extent practicable, the town will notify the customer of any
anticipated interruption of service, but any failure on the part of the town to
give the notice will not create any liability on the part of the town.

   (D)   System development fees will not be charged on buildings or other
improvements constructed to replace like buildings provided that the
replacement will not result in any increased capacity requirements over that
required to serve the replaced building. System development fees are
transferable between locations on different parcels of property as long as the
parcels are contiguous or separated only by a street or alley and part of a
single or multi-phased project shown on an approved site plan at the time of
issuance of a building permit.
   (E)   No system development fee shall be charged or assessed with respect to
any new development for which a system development fee under this subchapter
has been collected at the time of plat recordation involving the subdivision of
land and the amount of capacity associated with that payment of the system
development fee has not increased at the time of application for the building
permit. If the amount of capacity is increased at the time of application for a
building permit, then a system development fee may be charged for the
difference in the amount of the increased capacity minus the system development
fee previously paid under this section.
   (F)   (1)   For new development involving the subdivision of land, the
system development fee shall be collected at the later of the time of
application for a building permit, or when water or sewer service is committed
by the town.
      (2)   For all other new development, system development fees are due at
the earlier of the time of application for connection of the individual unit of
development to the service or facilities, or when water or sewer service is
committed by the town.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, water and/or sewer service shall be
deemed committed by the town at such time as the Public Works Department has
approved the connection. Fees shall be assessed based on the schedule of fees
in effect at the time the fees are collected.
   (G)   System development fees for connections for uses not listed in 15A
NCAC 2T.0114 shall be established by the Town Manager after consultation with
town staff based upon the considerations set forth at division (J)(2) below.
System development fees established in this manner may be appealed to the Town
Council.
   (H)   Additions, alterations to or replacements or change in use of existing
buildings shall be required to pay a system development fee based on the rates
applicable at the time of connection or at the time such addition, alteration,
replacement or change in use is placed into service. When a change in use
occurs, the new use will pay the difference calculated between the existing use
and the proposed use.
   (I)   Buildings that contain more than one use shall have the system
development fee calculated from the sum of each use in the building.
   (J)   (1)   The following system development fee shall be paid for
connections to the town municipal water and sewer systems based on the
customer's calculated anticipated daily flow rate converted to Equivalent
Residential Units (ERUs). The system development fee shall be the same
regardless of the customer's location inside or outside the municipal limits of
the town.
TABLE 1
15A NCAC 02T .0114 WASTEWATER DESIGN FLOW RATES
         (a)   This rule shall be used to determine wastewater flow rates for
all systems covered by this section unless alternate criteria are provided by a
program specific rule and for flow used for the purposes of 15A NCAC 02H.0105.
These are minimum design daily flow rates for normal use and occupancy
situations. Higher flow rates may be required where usage and occupancy are
atypical, including, those in paragraph (e) of this rule. Wastewater flow
calculations must take hours of operation and anticipated maximum occupancies/
usage into account when calculating peak flows for design.
         (b)   In determining the volume of sewage from residential dwelling
units, the flow rate shall be as provided pursuant to G.S. § 143-215.1(f3)
(currently 75 gallons per day per bedroom and 75 gallons per day per each
additional bedroom). Each bedroom or any other room or addition that can
reasonably be expected to function as a bedroom shall be considered a bedroom
for design purposes.
         (c)   The wastewater design flow ratesset forth at 15A NCAC 02T .0114
(as such may be amended from time to time), provided below, shall be used to
determine the minimum allowable design daily flow of non-residential wastewater
facilities. It is recognized that the design flow figures in 15A NCAC 02T.0114
may be questioned for any given establishment/use; however, these are the
figures developed by the state and are the figures the town must use in seeking
permits from the state. Design flow rates for establishments not identified
below shall be determined using available flow data, water-using fixtures,
occupancy or operation patterns, and other measured data.

new development to water or sewer facilities.

§ 50.114 CUSTOMER’S AND ADJUNCT CUSTOMER’S RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   Every customer and adjunct customer shall arrange for piping on the
premises to be installed so that the connections to the town’s meter, lines or
mains are conveniently located.
   (B)   When a meter is installed on the premises of a customer, the customer
shall provide and maintain a suitable place to locate the meter so that it is
unobstructed and accessible at all times to the meter reader.
   (C)   Every customer and adjunct customer shall furnish and maintain a
private cut-off valve on the customer’s side of the meter.
   (D)   Every customer and adjunct customer shall maintain all town piping,
apparatus and facilities within the customer’s control in proper condition.
   (E)   Every customer and adjunct customer shall protect any town property
placed on the customer’s or adjunct customer’s property and shall only permit
access to it by authorized representatives of the town.
   (F)   Every customer and adjunct customer shall provide the town’s
representatives access to his or her property, as necessary for the town to
maintain the town’s water and/or sewer lines, to install or remove town
property, to read or test the customer’s water and/or sewer meter(s) and for
any other purpose reasonably necessary for the town to efficiently provide
service to the customer and adjunct customer, and to maintain and protect its
system.
   (G)   If so requested, every customer and adjunct customer shall grant or
convey to the town a perpetual easement and right-of-way across the customer’s
property wherever the perpetual easement and right-of-way is reasonably needed
by the town to effectively furnish and maintain service to the customer. The
refusal of a customer, adjunct customer, or applicant for service as either to
grant or convey the town an easement is a basis for denying or discontinuing
service to a customer or adjunct customer .
   (H)   The customer is responsible for keeping the town informed at all times
of the customer’s current billing address. An adjunct customer must likewise
provide the town with a contact address and telephone number, and must keep
such information current.
   (I)   In the event that any loss or damage to the property of the town is
caused by the customer, adjunct customer, their invitees, agents or employees,
or in the event the negligence or any wrongful act by the customer, adjunct
customer, their invitees agents or employees results in any accident or injury
to persons or property for which the town is held responsible, the customer
must pay the cost of the necessary repairs or replacements to the town; and the
customer shall assume any liability otherwise resulting from the customer’s or
adjunct customer’s wrongful actions or omissions. The actual amount of such
loss or damage and/or the actual cost to the town of repairs shall be added to
the customer’s bill; and if not timely paid, service to the customer and any
adjunct customer may be discontinued by the town.
   (J)   By applying for and accepting service from the town, the customer and
adjunct customer agree to hold the town harmless from liability for any damages
that may occur due to a temporary discontinuance or interruption of service by
the town for emergency reasons, whether or not the customer or adjunct customer
receives prior notification of the discontinuance or interruption.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Ord. passed 7-17-2012)
§ 50.115 METER READING; BILLING; COLLECTING.
   (A)   Meters will be read, weather and other considerations permitting and
bills shall be rendered monthly, but the town reserves the right to vary the
dates or length of the period between meter readings and covered in the
customer’s bill.
   (B)   Charges for water and sewer will be figured in accordance with the
town’s published rate schedule then in effect, in §
50.460, based on the amount of water consumed or estimated and actual or
estimated sewer use for the period covered by the meter readings.
   (C)   Charges for service commence when the meter is installed and the
connection made, whether any water is immediately used or not.
   (D)   A separate bill, including appropriate base charges, will be issued
for each separate meter even if more than one meter is in the same customer’s
name.
   (E)   Bills are due when rendered and become delinquent 20 days following
the date of the bill. Bills not paid prior to the delinquent date are subject
to the late fee currently in effect and subject the customer and any adjunct
customer to an immediate termination of service.
   (F)   A claimed failure to receive a bill does not prevent a bill from
becoming delinquent or relieve the customer from timely payment, late charges
or the other town remedies contained in this subchapter.
   (G)   At the request of a customer and deposit of the actual cost of
testing, the town will test a customer’s meter. If the meter is found to
register use more than 10% higher than the correct volume, no charge for the
testing will be made and the customer’s deposit for the test will be refunded.
If testing indicates that the meter registers use within 10% higher of the
actual use or less, the deposit shall be retained.
   (H)   If the seal of a meter is broken, other than by the town’s
representative, or if the meter fails to register correctly or is stopped for
any cause, the customer shall be required to pay a bill for each period for
which no reliable meter reading was made in an amount estimated from the record
of the customer’s previous 12 bills for which use was reliably measured, if
available, and/or from other appropriate data.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Ord. passed 7-17-2012)
§ 50.116 INVOLUNTARY DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The town reserves the right to discontinue or interrupt service
temporarily to make emergency repairs, due to an insufficient supply of water
or treatment capacity or due to any other cause which threatens the safe and
effective delivery of service to the town’s customers. In that event, the town
will make a good faith effort, as practical, to notify affected customers
before service is discontinued or interrupted. A customer has the
responsibility to notify adjunct customers using the customer’s meter of such
discontinuation or interruption.
   (B)   The town will discontinue residential service in which the water and/
or sewer bill is delinquent. The town may lock or remove the meter any time
service is discontinued.
   (C)   The town will discontinue service to any commercial establishment,
unit or property in which the water and sewer bill is delinquent. The town may
lock or remove the meter any time service is discontinued.
   (D)   In addition to discontinuance of service for non-payment, the town may
suspend service to prevent fraud or abuse by a customer or adjunct customer or
for any violation by the customer or adjunct customer to comply with the
provisions of this code.
   (E)   The town reserves the right, upon action by the Town Council, to
discontinue its water and/or sewer service to any customer whose property is
outside the corporate limits of the town, upon giving a minimum 60-day written
notice of its intent to terminate water and/or sewer service.
   (F)   Upon discontinuance of service for non-payment, any deposit made by
the customer or adjunct customer on the unpaid account or any other account
shall be applied by the town to the account relating to the discontinued
service. If the deposit on the account in question exceeds the arrearage, any
surplus will be refunded to the customer or adjunct customer, whichever has
made the deposit, and if there are multiple deposits, any refund shall be
prorated in proportion to the relative amounts of the deposits which have been
applied. If the deposit(s) is not sufficient to pay the arrearage in full, the
town may proceed to collect the balance from the customer or any other user of
the system in the usual way provided by law for the collection of debts. If a
deposit from a second account is applied to the delinquency on an unpaid
account, the customer will be required to supplement the deposit on the second
account to the level required by §
50.460 in order to maintain service on the second account.
   (G)   The town shall make a good faith effort to notify affected customers
before service is discontinued or interrupted as provided in division (A).
However, every customer and every adjunct customer, by making application for
service, agrees to hold the town harmless from liability for any damages that
may occur due to discontinuance or interruption of service for any of the above
mentioned causes.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Ord. passed 7-17-2012)
§ 50.117 PROCEDURES FOR DISCONTINUATION OF SERVICE OR DENIAL OF SERVICE AND
CUSTOMER’S APPEAL RIGHTS.
   (A)   Before the town cuts off a customer’s or adjunct customer’s water or
sewer service, the town will send the customer or adjunct customer a notice
explaining the basis for the action, the date service will be terminated and
the customer’s or adjunct customer’s appeal rights. The notice to a customer
may be included in the monthly bill for water or sewer service. If an applicant
for service as a customer or adjunct customer is denied service, the applicant
may request a hearing in righting within five days and these procedures shall
apply. An adjunct customer shall have no appeal rights under this section to
challenge a threatened disconnection of a customer’s service, even if the
adjunct customer’s services will also be terminated as a result of the action.
   (B)   Within five days of the date of mailing of a disconnection notice or
within ten days of the date of mailing of the bill containing the stated
disconnection information, if the information is included with the normal
monthly bill, the customer or adjunct customer may request in writing a hearing
to either dispute the circumstances for which disconnection is threatened or,
if the customer believes the bill is in error, the customer can request a
hearing to dispute the amount of the bill.
   (C)   If the customer or adjunct customer files a timely request for a
hearing, prior to disconnecting service, the town will conduct a hearing on the
request, presided over by a town employee or other disinterested person, as
designated by the Town Manager, who was not involved in the original decision
to discontinue service.
   (D)   The hearing will be conducted within three business days of the town’s
receipt of the request and may be held by telephone or at the request of the
customer and option of the town, in person. The hearing may not be delayed in
the case of non-payment of a bill or a dispute as to the amount of a bill
unless the customer pays the town a deposit equal to the amount of the disputed
bill.
   (E)   At the hearing, the customer or adjunct customer will be given an
opportunity to present the facts and other matters which the customer or
adjunct customer maintains should prevent the disconnection of service. The
customer or adjunct customer may be represented by an attorney, shall have the
opportunity to examine any documents relied upon by the town in disconnecting
service and shall be given the opportunity to cross-examine any witnesses who
testify against the customer or adjunct customer. Within 24 hours following the
hearing, the town employee or other disinterested person conducting the hearing
will issue a decision affirming the action by the town, reversing the action by
the town or modifying the action by the town by allowing any past due amount to
be paid in monthly payments totally no more than four. The decision may be
communicated to the customer or adjunct customer verbally or in writing, but,
if verbally, will be followed within five days by a written communication
setting out the decision.
   (F)   The decision by the town employee or other disinterested person
conducting the hearing shall constitute the final decision by the town.
      (1)   If the decision upholds the town’s determination that facts exist
which justify the discontinuation of service, unless the customer or adjunct
customer makes immediate payment of all amounts for service incurred through
the date of the decision, service may be disconnected as soon as the decision
is made and an attempt to communicate the decision to the customer or adjunct
customer is made by contacting the customer or adjunct customer at the
telephone number or e-mail address provided by the customer for that purpose at
the hearing.
      (2)   If the employee or other disinterested person conducting the
hearing concludes that the discontinuation of service is justified, but
circumstances beyond the control of the customer or adjunct customer exist
which make unfair a demand for immediate full payment of all amounts for
service incurred through the date of the decision and that the customer should
be entitled to pay the delinquent or disputed amount in monthly payments
totaling no more than four, should any monthly payment be themselves
delinquent, discontinuation of service may occur without further process.
      (3)   If the employee or other disinterested person conducting the
hearing determines that the town’s action or charges were in error, the
customer’s account shall be adjusted appropriately.
   (G)   Pursuit of the aforesaid appeal shall not prevent a customer from
seeking an adjustment in a bill by the Town Manager or Town Council in amounts
authorized by this chapter, but the requests shall not stay a discontinuation
of services unless they are requested prior to the hearing provided in this
section.
   (H)   The procedures provided by this section are available to an adjunct
customer only with regard to a discontinuation of service or denial of
application which is specific to the adjunct customer and not to actions
relating to the customer whose meter through which the adjunct customer
receives service, even if the result of a discontinuation of service to the
customer or denial of an application for service by a customer affects the
ability of the adjunct customer to receive service.

town to an amount equal to two times the average monthly bill in the previous
12 months or the average monthly bill for the full period of service if service
has been in effect for less than 12 months.
      (3)   If a customer with a delinquent account files for bankruptcy
protection and duly notifies the town of the filing, pending final action by
the bankruptcy court, no demand will be made for payment of delinquencies
incurred prior to the bankruptcy filing.
      (4)   However, any delinquencies for service provided after the
bankruptcy filing shall result in a discontinuation of service and the town
shall require a deposit equal to two times the average monthly bill in the
previous 12 months or the average monthly bill for the full period of service
if service has been in effect for less than 12 months, before service will be
reinstated.
   (C)   Service will not be reinstated after it has been disconnected for
fraud or misconduct on the part of the customer or adjunct customer, such as
engaging in one or more of the acts identified in §
50.122, without the approval of the Town Council.
   (D)   Service to a customer or adjunct customer whose service has been
discontinued will not be reinstated until the customer pays the reconnection

§ 50.125 REQUESTS FOR ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Adjustments may be made to customer water and/or sewer bills in the
event of extenuating circumstances due to leaks or pipe breaks (collectively,
“leaks”) as follows:
      (1)   When a customer receives a utility bill that reflects extraordinary
charges for a billing period, he or she shall present his or her claim for an
adjustment in person or in writing to the town no more than 30 days after
receiving the bill.
      (2)   A claim for an adjustment shall not prevent discontinuance of
services for delinquency in payment as heretofore provided. Customers are
responsible to pay the entire amount due within the normal payment period or
enter into payment arrangements for the billed amount in order to remain in
good standing on all current billings. The customer’s payment of a bill
reflecting extraordinary charges shall not prejudice his or her claim for an
adjustment.
      (3)   Where the customer demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of
the town that a leak on the customer’s side of the meter was the cause of the
extraordinary charges, an adjustment may be made to the customer’s water bill
in accordance with the provisions of this section. The customer must also
present proof, such as a plumber’s invoice and receipt, that the leak was
repaired.
   (B)   An adjustment may be made to the utility bill if no leak adjustment
has been made within the previous 12 month period for the same account, and:
      (1)   There is a concealed leak in the customer’s piping, and the
customer submits a statement from a licensed plumber, or a signed statement
from the property owner or his/her legal representative, that the leak has been
repaired and that the repair meets or exceeds the plumbing codes of the town;
or
      (2)   There are other circumstances, such as theft of water, where the
evidence indicates a leak or other loss of water that is not the fault of the
owner such that an adjustment is appropriate under the circumstances and
consistent with the purpose and spirit of this section.
   (C)   If an adjustment is granted, it shall be made for the following
amounts:
      (1)   On the water portion of the utility bill, an adjustment of up to
75% of the portion of the bill that exceeds the customer’s average consumption;
      (2)   On the sewer portion of the utility bill, where the excess water
from the break or leak did not enter the sanitary sewer system, an adjustment
of up to the total amount of the bill that exceeds the customer's average sewer
bill;
      (3)   On the sewer portion of the utility bill, where the excess water
from the break or leak entered the sanitary sewer system, an adjustment of up
to 75% of the portion of the bill that exceeds the customer's average
consumption.
      (4)   “Average consumption” shall be calculated as the prior 12-month
average monthly consumption at the premises, not including months that do not
have readings, that have readings for less than a full month, or that have zero
usage readings.
      (5)   No adjustment shall be made unless the gallons billed are at least
10,000 gallons more than the average billing (on a monthly basis).
      (6)   The adjustment may not cover more than two consecutive months.
   (D)   To be eligible for an adjustment under this policy, the leak must be a
concealed leak. Leaks that are or should be known to the customer shall not be
considered concealed leaks, and include but are not limited to the following:
leaking or running toilets; treatment systems; air-conditioning cooling towers;
leaking faucets, whether inside or outside; water heaters; exposed piping;
washing machine hoses; hose bibs; water fountains; dishwashers; swimming pools;
and exposed pressure reducing valves and backflow preventers.
   (E)   Vacant homes and buildings do not qualify for leak adjustments.
   (F)   No adjustment will be allowed where the break or leak occurred during
a period when the premises was left vacant or unattended by the customer for a
period in excess of two weeks and the customer failed to turn the water off at
the meter. This provision shall not apply, though, to the sewer portion of the
utility bill where the excess water did not enter the sanitary sewer system.
   (G)   Upon being notified by Water Department personnel or otherwise
discovering that a leak exists the customer shall take immediate steps to
correct the situation. Undue delay by the customer shall cause forfeiture of
any benefits from this adjustment policy.
   (H)   The Public Works Director, or his or her designee, shall consider and
have authority to grant a requested adjustment of up to $3,000. A request for
any adjustment exceeding $3,000 shall be considered and decided by the Town
Manager. The decision of the Public Works Director or Town Manager, as
applicable, shall be final.
   (I)   The town may enter into appropriate payment plans with customers
unable to pay extraordinarily high bills. Customers may inquire of the Public
Utilities Department for alternative payment options.

§ 50.290 HARDSHIP CONNECTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN LIMITS FOR SINGLE-FAMILY AND
DUPLEX RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS EXISTING AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018.
   (A)   No obligation to provide or continue to provide service.
      (1)   The town has no responsibility to provide water or sewer service to
property located outside the corporate limits, nor any continuing obligation to
provide water or sewer service after having voluntarily provided such service.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any grant of water or
sewer service to a property outside the town limits creates no property rights
for the property owner or such owner’s assignees or transferees, and may be
revoked at any time by the town for any or no reason.
      (2)   The town may allow new connections for hardship cases outside the
town limits as follows in this section.
   (B)   Hardship connections outside of the town limits for single-family and
duplex residential dwellings existing as of January 1, 2018. Where a service
connection is available, the Administrator may authorize a service connection
for water or sewer services to a habitable, single-family or duplex,
residential dwelling already existing as of January 1, 2018, subject to all
other relevant provisions of this code, under the following circumstances:
      (1)   As to a request for a water connection, when the applicant has been
approved for a hardship sewer connection per division (B)(2) below, or when the
applicant has shown a hardship as follows:
         (a)   The applicant has established, through clear and convincing
evidence, the current contamination of a residential well by toxins in amounts
determined by the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources or the United
States Environmental Protection Agency as harmful to human life or health; or
         (b)   The applicant has established, through clear and convincing
evidence, that an existing well cannot supply an adequate amount of water; and
that:
            1.   The lack of adequate water could not have been reasonably
predicted and was not reasonably foreseeable at the time the well was installed
or development of the property served was last undertaken;
            2.   No reasonable alternative exists for the provision of the
water to the property, including that no alternative well can be established
that will adequately provide water; and
            3.   The amount of water requested is limited to that needed for
the current use of the property served.
      (2)   As to a request for a sewer connection, when the applicant has been
approved for a water connection hardship per division (B)(1) above, or when the
applicant has shown a hardship by establishing through clear and convincing
evidence that:
         (a)   An existing septic or other wastewater system has or will soon
fail;
         (b)   Due to lot size or other feature of the property outside the
control of the applicant, not caused by the applicant and unknown to the
applicant at the time of the acquisition of the property, the system cannot be
repaired or an alternative wastewater system installed (e.g., if the unsuitable
lot size has been caused by the applicant or an entity related to the applicant
having subdivided the property originally served by the septic system, the
applicant shall not be entitled to claim a connection hardship);
         (c)   The lack of an adequate septic system or other wastewater system
could not have been reasonably predicted and was not reasonably foreseeable at
the time the current wastewater system was installed or development of the
property served was last undertaken;
         (d)   No other reasonable alternative exists for the provision of a
private wastewater system to the property; and
         (e)   No change in use of the property is planned or anticipated.
   (C)   Hardship connections for vacant lots and existing single-family
dwellings located in single-family neighborhoods previously connected to town
service. A vacant (undeveloped) lot or single-family dwelling located outside
the town limits may be approved for connection to an existing water or sewer
main in the following circumstances:
      (1)   The vacant lot or dwelling is located in a neighborhood of at least
ten single-family lots and as of January 1, 2018 (i) at least of one-half of
the lots in the neighborhood are already developed with single-family
dwellings; and (ii) at least one-half of existing dwellings in the neighborhood
are already connected to an existing water or sewer main;
      (2)   The vacant lot or dwelling is subject to deed restrictions and/or
conditions, covenants and restrictions as of title record that limit the use of
the lot to one single-family home.
      (3)   The property owner voluntarily agrees to develop the vacant lot in
compliance with the Town's current development regulations relating to (i) soil
erosion and sediment control; (ii) stormwater control; (iii) viewshed
protection; and (iv) steep slope development. For these purposes, a lot will be
deemed subject to regulations just as it would be if it was within the
corporate limits of the town and zoned in the R-A district. The Director of the
Town's Planning Department shall make all determinations with respect to the
applicability and requirements of the town's development regulations, in the
Director's sole discretion, and no appeal shall lie from any such
determination.
      (4)   As used in this division (C), the term "neighborhood" shall mean a
defined area of lots laid out on a recorded plat and sharing the same access
road(s).
   (D)   Conditions of approval. If a connection is allowed under this section,
such approval shall only be granted upon the following additional conditions:
      (1)   The property owner shall agree to the conditions set forth in this
division (D) and any other conditions provided in this section, in writing in
whatever form and at whatever date such agreement is requested by the town. The
agreement may be recorded as of record with the County Register of Deeds as the
town deems advisable in its sole discretion.
      (2)   In the town's discretion and upon its request, a property owner
granted a water connection shall also connect to the town's sewer, if a sewer
connection is available, and vice versa. Further, the owner shall commit in
writing to connect into the town's water system or sewer system should the town
request at any time that such a connection be made.
      (3)   The town shall provide the connection only upon the property owner
agreeing to voluntary annexation of the property.
         (a)   The property owner shall petition for annexation if requested to
do so by town staff. A complete petition shall be filed no more than 90 days
after a hardship connection has been approved or, in the case of a vacant lot,
prior to approval of the connection.
         (b)   In the event the town does not request immediate filing of a
petition for annexation, the property owner shall execute such agreement to
annex in the future as the town may require within 30 days of being approved
for service or at such later time as the town may require or request.
         (c)   Whether or not an agreement to annex such as is contemplated in
the immediately foregoing division is executed, the property owner agrees to
petition for annexation within 30 days of receiving a written request by the
town that the owner make such petition. The town may make such a request at any
time of its choosing, in its sole discretion, and may repeat such a request
however many times it sees fit; provided, however, that a property owner shall
not be responsible to pay more than one annexation petition fee.
      (4)   Any connection is granted only as to the structures existing on the
property as of the date the connection is approved or, in the case of a vacant
lot, for one single family home. Following the making of a connection, service
automatically shall be terminated upon 90 days advance written notice in the
event a substantial change is planned for or made to the property. For purposes
of this provision, "substantial change" shall mean any remodeling,
redevelopment, change of use or other modification resulting in:
         (a)   An increase of more than 500 square feet of the footprint of the
structure(s) on the property;
         (b)   An increase of more than 50% of the gross floor area of the
structure(s) on the property; or
         (c)   A change in the use or occupancy of the dwelling resulting in a
materially different or more intense use (e.g., from single-family to duplex,
multi-family or commercial).
      (5)   The owner shall sign a statement affirming the owner's
understanding and agreement that the owner has no right to service, that the
town is providing the service without any commitment to maintain the service in
the future, and that the town may terminate service at any time should the
owner fail to abide by any of the conditions set forth in this section or for
any other reason considered good and sufficient by the Town Council in its sole
discretion.
      (6)   The conditions and restrictions set forth in this section and any
additional covenants, conditions and restrictions set forth in any agreement
between the owner and the town regarding a water or sewer connection approved
under this section run with the real property at issue, and are binding on the
owner and the owner's successors and assigns and on all those claiming an
interest in the real property by, through, or under such owner, in perpetuity.
   (E)   Procedures.
      (1)   An application shall be submitted on such forms and with such
accompanying information and documentation as the Administrator deems
appropriate. The Administrator may require additional information or
documentation as the Administrator deems necessary, and may deny an application
that is determined to be incomplete. A decision by the Administrator that an
application is incomplete is final and unappealable, but a new application may
be submitted.
      (2)   The Administrator may decline to make a decision on a complete
application, in which event the application shall be heard by the Town Council
as provided at division(E)(4) below.
      (3)   Except for a denial based on the incompleteness of an application,
a decision by the Administrator to deny or terminate a hardship service
connection may be appealed to the Town Council. The appeal must be filed with
the Administrator, on such form as the Administrator may provide, no more than
ten calendar days following the applicant’s receipt of written notice of the
denial or termination. The applicant shall be conclusively presumed to have
received written notice of the denial or termination three days after such
notice was mailed to the applicant’s address provided on the application or
(for terminations) used for billing purposes.
      (4)   The Town Council shall hear and determine an appeal of a denial or
termination, or an application not decided by the Administrator, on a de novo
basis, according to such quasi-judicial procedures as it may adopt, and its
decision shall not be subject to further appeal. Any hardship connection
permitted by Town Council shall be approved, subject to the conditions set
forth at division (D) of this section.

WATER CONSERVATION REGULATIONS
§ 50.305 APPLICABILITY.
   Whenever the conditions described in §
50.311 are met, a water shortage stage at the level indicated shall be declared
in accordance the procedures and regulations of this subchapter. Recognizing
that there may be situations in which those "triggers" do not fully reflect the
threat to the town's water supply, however, even if the conditions have not
been strictly met, in the event it appears to the Director of Public Utilities
that outflow from the town water system may exceed its raw water supply or
transmission capabilities, the Director of Public Utilities shall notify the
Town Manager. The Town Manager, following consultation with the Town Council,
may declare a Stage I Water Shortage requesting voluntary water conservation by
customers. If voluntary conservation measures fail to adequately decrease
outflow from the system or if conditions exist that make it likely in the
opinion of the Town Manager that voluntary measures will be inadequate; the
Town Manager may, after consultation with the Director of Public Utilities or
following consultation with the Town Council, declare a Stage II or Stage III
Water Shortage. In exercising this authority, the Town Manager shall consider
water shortage levels and available sources or supply, draw-patterns and
availability of water from other sources. However, this subchapter is not
intended to supersede or amend the town's responsibilities under another
interconnect agreement with another water system.

§ 50.306 ANNOUNCEMENT OF WATER SHORTAGE.
   (A)   If a water shortage is declared, the Director of Public Utilities
shall initiate an extensive publicity campaign, using public media and other
measures to the public's knowledge about an impending or existing water
shortage. All publicity campaigns shall at a minimum inform the public of the
existing or anticipated level of the shortage and the implications of a
shortage, in terms of voluntary and involuntary restrictions on the use of
water and the campaign shall encourage and recommend specific conservation
measures.
   (B)   The Director of Public Utilities shall also inform all employees of
the Public Utilities Department and town of the impending or existing shortage.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011)
§ 50.307 GOALS FOR EACH WATER SHORTAGE.
   (A)   The water use reduction goal for a Stage I Water Shortage is 10%
average daily demand for the same calendar month each of the previous three
calendar years.
   (B)   The water use reduction goal for a Stage II Water Shortage is 25%
average daily demand for the same calendar month each of the previous three

   (A)   Purpose and policy.
      (1)   This subchapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and
indirect contributors into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) for the
town, and enables the town to comply with all applicable state and federal
laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and the general
pretreatment regulations (40 C.F.R. Ch. 1, Subch. N, part 403). The objectives
of this subchapter are:
         (a)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that
will interfere with the operation of the POTW or contaminate the resulting
sludge;
         (b)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that
will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into any waters of the
state or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;
         (c)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludges from the POTW;
         (d)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the
operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW;
         (e)   To protect both town personnel who may be affected by
wastewater, sludge and effluent in the course of their employment, as well as
protecting the general public; and
         (f)   To ensure that the town complies with the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for non-discharge permit conditions,
sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal and state laws to
which the POTW is subject.
      (2)   This subchapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the POTW, through the issuance of wastewater permits to certain
industrial wastewater contributors and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other contributors, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires contributor reporting, and provides for the setting of
fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program
established herein.
      (3)   This subchapter shall apply to all contributors to the POTW, as
authorized by G.S. § 160A-312. The town shall designate an administrator of the
POTW and pretreatment program, hereafter referred to as the POTW Director.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the POTW Director shall administer,
implement and enforce the provisions of this subchapter. Any powers granted to
or assigned to the POTW Director may be delegated by the POTW Director to other
appropriate town personnel.
      (4)   By discharging wastewater into the POTW, an industrial wastewater
contributor located within or outside the town limits agrees to comply with the
terms and conditions established in this subchapter, as well as any wastewater
permits, enforcement actions, or orders issued hereunder. These requirements
apply to every industrial wastewater contributor discharging into the
wastewater collection system owned by any satellite POTW.

   (A)   Any contributor who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance that, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. part 261. The notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type
of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the contributor discharges more
than 100 kilograms of the waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information, to the extent the
information is known and readily available to the contributor: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of the constituents in the wastestream
discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this division must be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under § 50.359 of this chapter. The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by
contributors subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-
monitoring requirements of §§
50.355,
50.357 and
50.358 of this chapter.
   (B)   Contributors are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in
40 C.F.R. parts 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. parts 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
contributor discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulation under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the contributor must notify the POTW Director,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the
effective date of the regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
contributor shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume
and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated, to the degree it has determined to
be economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a wastewater permit
issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in
good working order at all times. If a contributor fails to keep its monitoring
facility in good working order, it may not claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
   (B)   Grab samples. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds and any other
pollutants as required by 40 C.F.R. part 136. The town shall determine the
number of grabs necessary to be representative of the contributor's discharge.
See 40 C.F.R. part 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements
for BMR and 90-day compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW Director may
allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period that are composited
prior to analysis, as allowed under 40 C.F.R. part 136.
   (C)   Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected
with at least hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour in which there is a
discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow-
proportional, composite-collection techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Director. When
authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be
representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 50.380 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   The town requires the contributor to provide and operate, at the
contributor’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling
and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems.
The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the contributor’s
premises, but the town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the contributor, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near the
sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense
of the contributor. Whether constructed on public or private property, the
sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
town’s requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the town.

complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the town, approval authority and EPA, or their
representatives, ready access, at all reasonable times, to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in
the performance of any of their duties. The town, approval authority and EPA
shall have the right to set up on the contributor’s property such devices as
are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or
metering operations. Where a contributor has security measures in force that
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the contributor shall make necessary arrangements with its security
guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from
the town, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay,
for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the
POTW Director’s approval authority’s or EPA’s access to the contributor’s
premises shall be a violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may
constitute denial of access.

CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL STANDARDS
§ 50.415 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to define the authority of the
Public Utilities Department of the town as the water purveyor in the
elimination of all cross-connections within its public potable water supply.
   (B)   This chapter shall apply to all users connected to the town potable
water supply regardless of whether the user is located within the city limits
or outside of the city limits.
   (C)   This chapter will comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act
(Pub. Law No. 93-523), the State Administrative Code (Title 15A, Subchapter 8C)
and the State Building Code (Volume II) as they pertain to cross-connections
with the public water supply.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011)
§ 50.416 OBJECTIVES.
   The specific objectives of this subchapter are as follows:
   (A)   To protect the public potable water supply of the town against actual
or potential contamination by isolating within the consumer's water system,
contaminants or pollutants which could, under adverse conditions, backflow
through uncontrolled cross-connections into the public water system;
   (B)   To eliminate or control existing cross-connections, actual or
potential, between the consumer's potable water system(s) and non-potable or
industrial piping system(s); and
   (C)   To provide a continuing inspection program of cross-connection control
which will systematically and effectively control all actual or potential
cross-connections which may be installed in the future.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011)
§ 50.417 RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   Responsibility: town.
      (1)   Except as, otherwise provided herein, it is the town's
responsibility to ensure a safe water supply, which begins at the source and
includes all of the public water distribution system, including the service
connection, and ends at the point of delivery to the consumer's water system
(water meter). In addition, the town shall exercise reasonable vigilance to
ensure that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public
potable water system. To ensure that the proper precautions are taken, the
Public Utilities Department shall determine the degree of hazard or potential
hazard to the public potable water system; the degree of protection required;
and proper containment protection through an on-going inspection program.
      (2)   When it is determined that a backflow prevention assembly is
required for the protection of the public system, the town shall require the
consumer, at the consumer's expense, to install an approved backflow prevention
assembly at each service connection, to test immediately upon installation and
thereafter at a frequency as determined by the Public Utilities Department, to
properly repair and maintain the assembly or assemblies and to keep adequate
records of each test and subsequent maintenance and repair, including materials
and/or replacement parts.
   (B)   Responsibility: plumbing inspections.
      (1)   The Department of Planning and Inspections and the Department of
Public Utilities for the town shall review building plans and inspect plumbing
as it is installed and shall prevent cross- connections from being designed and
built into any plumbing system within the Department of Planning and
Inspection's jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests or
detects the potential for cross-connections being made an integral part of the
plumbing system, the Plumbing Inspector shall require that the cross-
connections be either eliminated or provided with backflow prevention equipment
approved by the State Building Code.
      (2)   The Plumbing Inspector's responsibility begins at the point of
delivery (downstream of the first installed backflow prevention assembly) and
continues throughout the entire length of the consumer's water system. The plan
inspector should inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it
is suspected that a cross-connection might be made or where one is actually
called for by the plans. When such is discovered, it shall be mandatory that a
suitable, approved backflow prevention assembly approved by the State Building
Code be required by the plans and be properly installed. The primary protection
assembly for containment purposes only shall have approval from the town's
Public Utilities Department, the State Building Code and the State Department
of Environment, Health and Natural Resources.
   (C)   Responsibility: consumer. The consumer has the primary responsibility
of preventing pollutants and contaminants from entering his or her potable
water system(s) or the public potable water system. The consumer's
responsibility starts at the point of delivery from the public potable water
system and includes all of his or her water system(s). The consumer, at his or
her own expense, shall install, operate, test and maintain approved backflow
prevention assemblies as directed by the town's Public Utilities Department.
The consumer shall maintain accurate records of tests and repairs made to
backflow prevention assemblies and shall maintain the records for a minimum
period of three years. The records shall be on forms approved by town's Public
Utilities Department and shall include the list of materials or replacement
parts used. Following any repair, overhaul, repiping or relocation of an
assembly, the town shall test it to ensure that it is in good operating
condition and will prevent backflow. Tests, maintenance and repairs of backflow
prevention assemblies shall be made by a certified backflow prevention assembly
tester employed by the town.
   (D)   Responsibility: certified backflow prevention assembly tester.
      (1)   The certified backflow prevention assembly tester will have the
following responsibilities:
         (a)   Making competent inspections and for repairing or overhauling
backflow prevention assemblies and making reports of the repair to the consumer
and responsible authorities on forms approved by the town's Public Utilities
Department;
         (b)   Including the list of materials or replacement parts used;
         (c)   Being equipped with and being competent to use all the necessary
tools, gauges, manometers and other equipment necessary to properly test,
repair and maintain backflow prevention assemblies; and
         (d)   Ensuring that original manufactured parts are used in the repair
of or replacement of parts in a backflow prevention assembly. The tester shall
not change the design, material or operational characteristics of an assembly
during repair or maintenance without prior approval of the town's Public
Utilities Department. The tester shall perform the work and be responsible for
the competency and accuracy of all tests and reports. The tester shall provide
a copy of all test and repair reports to the consumer and to the town's Public
Utilities Department within ten business days of any completed test or repair
work. A tester shall maintain the records for a minimum period of three years.
      (2)   All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must use the
backflow prevention assembly test equipment provided by/approved by the town's
Public Utilities Department. All test equipment shall be registered with the
town's Cross-Connection Control Department. All test equipment shall be checked
for accuracy annually (at a minimum), calibrated, if necessary and certified to
town as to the calibration, employing an accuracy/calibration method acceptable
to the town's Public Utilities Department.
      (3)   All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must become re-
certified every two years through an approved backflow prevention certification
program.

(Ord. passed 6-21-2011)
§ 50.420 ELIMINATION OF CROSS-CONNECTIONS; DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   When cross-connections are found to exist, the owner, his or her agent,
occupant or tenant will be notified in writing to disconnect the same within
the time limit established by the town's Public Utilities Department. The
degree of protection required and maximum time allowed for compliance will be
based upon the potential degree of hazard to the public water supply system.
The maximum time limits are as follows:
   (A)   Cross-connections with private wells or other auxiliary water
supplies: immediate disconnection;
   (B)   All facilities which pose a health hazard to the potable water system
must have a containment assembly in the form of a reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention assembly within 60 days;
   (C)   All industrial and commercial facilities not identified as a health
hazard shall be considered non-health hazard facilities. All non-health hazard
facilities must install, as a minimum containment assembly, a double check
valve assembly within 90 days;
   (D)   If, in the judgment of the town's Public Utilities Department, an
imminent health hazard exists, water service to the building or premises where
a cross-connection exists may be terminated unless an air gap is immediately
provided or the cross-connection is immediately eliminated;
   (E)   Based upon recommendation from the town, the consumer is responsible
for installing sufficient internal isolation backflow prevention assemblies
and/or methods (i.e., air gap, pressure vacuum breakers, reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly, double check valve assembly);
   (F)   Water mains served by Appalachian State University, but not maintained
by the town, should be considered cross-connections, with degree of hazard to
be determined by town's Public Utilities Department; the degree of protection
shall be based upon the degree of hazard, as determined by the town's Public
Utilities Department.
   (G)   In the event that a town Cross-Connection Control Inspector does not
have sufficient access to every portion of a private water system (i.e.,
classified research and development facilities; federal government property) to
allow a complete evaluation of the degree of hazard associated with the private
water systems, an approved reduced pressure principle assembly shall be
required as a minimum of protection.
   (H)   No person shall fill special-use tanks or tankers containing
pesticides, fertilizers, other toxic chemicals or their residues from the
public water system except at a location equipped with an air gap or an
approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly properly
installed on the public water supply.

State Building Code and the State Division of Health Services (NCDEHNR), shall
be made available to the town for review and approval and to determine the
degree of hazard.
   (C)   Ownership, testing and maintenance of the assembly shall be the
responsibility of the customer.
   (D)   All double check valve assemblies must be installed in drainable pits
wherever below-ground installation is necessary, in accordance with detailed
specifications provided by the town's Public Utilities Department.
   (E)   Reduced pressure principle assemblies must be installed in a
horizontal position and in a location in which no portion of the assembly can
become submerged in any substance under any circumstances (pit and/or below
grade installations are prohibited). Double check valve assemblies may be
installed in a vertical position with prior approval from the town's Cross-
Connection Control Department; provided, the flow of water is in an upward
direction.
   (F)   The installation of a backflow prevention assembly which is not
approved must be replaced with an approved backflow prevention assembly.
   (G)   The installer is responsible to make sure a backflow prevention
assembly is working properly upon installation and is required to furnish the
following information to the town's Cross-Connection Control Program Department
within 15 days after a reduced pressure principle backflow preventer (RP),
double check-detector assembly (DCDA), pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) or reduced
pressure principle detector assembly (RPDA) is installed:
      (1)   Service address where assembly is located;
      (2)   Owner (and address, if different from service address);
      (3)   Description of assembly's location;
      (4)   Date of installation;
      (5)   Installer's name, plumbing company represented, plumber's license
number and project permit number;
      (6)   Type of assembly, size of assembly;
      (7)   Manufacturer, model number, serial number; and
      (8)   Test results/reports.
   (H)   When it is not possible to interrupt water service, provisions shall
be made for a parallel installation of backflow prevention assemblies. The
town's Public Utilities Department will not accept an unprotected bypass around
a backflow preventer when the assembly is in need of testing, repair or
replacement.
   (I)   The town shall, upon notification, install the appropriate containment
assembly not to exceed the following time frame:
      (1)   Health hazard: 60 days; and
      (2)   Non-health hazard: 90 days.
   (J)   Following installation, all RP, DCVA, PVB, DCDA and RPDA are required
to be tested by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester within ten
days.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011)
§ 50.422 TESTING AND REPAIR OF ASSEMBLIES.
   (A)   Testing of backflow prevention assemblies shall be made by a certified
backflow prevention assembly tester or may be contracted out to the town's
Cross-Connection Control Department at the customer's expense. The tests are to
be conducted upon installation and annually thereafter or at a frequency
established by town's Public Utilities Department. A record of all testing and
repairs is to be retained by the customer. Copies of the records must be
provided to the town's Public Utilities Cross- Connection Control Department
within ten business days after the completion of any testing and/or repair
work.
   (B)   Any time that repairs to backflow prevention assemblies are deemed
necessary, whether through annual or required testing or routine inspection by
the owner or by the town's Public Utilities Department, these repairs must be
completed within a specified time in accordance with the degree of hazard. In
no case shall this time period exceed:
      (1)   Health hazard facilities: 14 days; and
      (2)   Non-health hazard facilities: 21 days.
   (C)   All backflow prevention assemblies with test cocks are required to be
tested annually or at a frequency established by town's Department of Public
Utilities. Testing requires a water shutdown usually lasting five to 20
minutes. For facilities that require an uninterrupted supply of water and when
it is not possible to provide water service from two separate meters,
provisions shall be made for a parallel installation of backflow prevention
assemblies.
   (D)   All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must utilize the
backflow prevention assembly test equipment which has been provided/approved by
the town's Public Utilities Department. All test equipment shall be registered
with the town's Cross-Connection Control Department. All test equipment shall
be checked for accuracy annually (at a minimum), calibrated, if necessary and
certified to the town as to the accuracy/calibration, employing a calibration
method acceptable to the town. (See §
50.417.)
   (E)   It shall be unlawful for any customer or certified tester to submit
any record to the town which is false or incomplete in any material respect. It
shall be unlawful for any customer or certified tester to fail to submit to the
town any record which is required by this chapter. The violations may result in
any of the enforcement actions outlined in §
50.426.

   (A)   FSE shall install grease removal device(s), at FSE expense, as
required by the POTW Director.
   (B)   FSE shall hire a grease removal device manufacturer, commercial
plumber, architect or engineer to determine the correct size, design and
location for the grease removal device.
   (C)   The hired manufacturer, commercial plumber, architect or engineer
should size interceptors for a 30-minute HRT and traps for the proper flow
rating. The POTW Director will not advise any FSE about the specific
installation or sizing of the grease removal device.
   (D)   FSE shall install only the size grease removal device that is
recommended by the hired manufacturer, commercial plumber or engineer and
approved by the POTW Director and the local code official.
   (E)   Flow control devices and solids screens shall be required prior to
grease traps.
   (F)   The maximum size for an interceptor/trap shall be 2,000 gallons. If
the calculated minimum size is larger than this, two or more interceptors of
approximately equal size shall be installed in series.
   (G)   Grease removal device selection and installation shall be done
according to all applicable laws and building codes, even where not indicated
in this subchapter.
   (H)   Grease removal device installation and operation shall be done
according to all manufacturer’s instructions, unless more stringent
instructions are given by the POTW Director.
   (I)   All compartments of grease removal devices shall be readily and easily
accessible for FSE maintenance requirements and town inspection.
   (J)   The following shall be connected to the grease removal device: all
fixtures and drains to wastewater lines in kitchens, food and beverage prep and
bar areas (exceptions may be made for drink fountains and condensate drains
that are not flush with the floor). Automatic dishwashers shall be plumbed to
grease interceptors, but shall not be plumbed to grease traps. Kitchens with
automatic dishwashers bypassing a grease trap must have a pre-rinse sink
present.
   (K)   Food grinders shall be connected to grease interceptor/traps. The
interceptor/trap size should be increased by 30% to accommodate the high solid
waste stream, and when connected to a grease trap, a solids interceptor will be
required prior to the grease trap. It is strongly recommended that food grinder
use be discontinued and the food grinder removed as it increases the FSE cost
of installation and maintenance.
   (L)   In the case where grease removal device installation occurred before
this subchapter was approved by town and the grease removal device does not
meet the standards of this subchapter, the FSE shall upgrade its grease removal
device, when the POTW Director determines it is necessary.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Am. Ord. passed 12-13-2012)
§ 50.444 MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   FSE shall ensure that interceptor(s) are pumped out by a grease waste
hauler, removing all water, floatable oil, settled solids and any other visible
signs of grease anywhere within the grease interceptor, at a frequency adequate
for the proper function of the interceptor and at a minimum of every three
months. Any other pumping schedule that is less frequent shall be subject to
written approval by the POTW Director.
   (B)   The cleaning frequency of a grease trap shall be adequate for the
proper function of the trap and at a minimum of every one month. Any other
pumping schedule that is less frequent shall be subject to written approval by
the POTW Director. The trap must have surface grease and oil removed, settled
solids removed, all sides scraped, removable parts removed and cleaned,
inspected for damage and corrosion, and properly reassembled.
      (1)   If a grease waste hauler pumps the trap, then all contents must be
removed as described in divisions (A) through (H) of this section; except that,
it must be done at the frequency indicated in this division (B).
      (2)   When cleaned by FSE personnel (i.e., surface grease and settled
solids have been removed), water in trap may remain in the unit or may be
flushed to the sewer. FSE shall be responsible for appropriate disposal of the
removed substances. Removed substances shall not be reintroduced to the sewer
collection system.
   (C)   To ensure proper function, grease interceptor/trap shall be cleaned
whenever the combined thickness of the floating greases and settled solids is
equal to or greater than 25% of the total liquid depth in the interceptor/trap.
   (D)   No FSE shall allow a grease waste hauler to skim the waste in an
interceptor/trap. Both sides of the interceptor/trap shall be cleaned to the
bottom at all times as indicated above. Washdown water shall be pumped out as
well.
   (E)   Reintroduction of wastewater (e.g., decanting) removed from a grease
interceptor/trap is prohibited, whether it has been treated by the grease waste
hauler or not, except as noted in division (B)(2) above.
   (F)   It is recommended that the FSE be witness to interceptor/trap
cleaning.
   (G)   FSEs shall not use any chemical and/or biological product to remove
grease from the grease removal device. (These products move grease into the
sewer collection system and defeat the purpose of having interceptor/traps in
the first place.)
   (H)   All needed repairs shall be completed within 30 days of discovery,
unless otherwise instructed by the town.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Am. Ord. passed 12-13-2012)
§ 50.445 RECORDS AND REPORTS.
   (A)   The fat, oil and grease prevention program (FOGPP) packet, provided by
the town, shall be kept on-site for reference and management training for the
duration of the operation of the FSE at its present site. The FSE shall make
this packet available upon request by the POTW Director.
   (B)   FSE shall retain, on site, each invoice, receipt and cleaning log from
the grease waste hauler for a period of three years from the date the waste was
removed from the FSE’s site. Upon request by the POTW Director, the FSE shall
make any and all original copies of the invoices, receipts and cleaning logs
from the grease waste hauler available for review.
   (C)   FSE shall submit a copy of the invoice or receipt from the grease
waste hauler each time the interceptor/trap is cleaned. The document from the
grease waste hauler must have the following information on it or a town waste
manifest form must accompany it: name and physical address of the FSE;
contracted service frequency; name, physical address and phone number of grease
waste hauler; identification of specific grease removal device pumped; date of
service. FSEs that clean their own trap(s) shall submit a copy of the cleaning
log used by FSE staff each month. These reports are due by the last day of the
month that follows the month in which the interceptor/trap was cleaned.
   (D)   FSE wishing to obtain or maintain a waiver from the FOGPP must request
and submit an application for the waiver annually by January 30. Waivers are
given to FSE that cannot contribute grease waste to the sewer due to FSE
operations. Waivers are given to FSEs that are exempt from Health Department
regulations (G.S. §§ 130A-247 through 130A-250), unless the FSE has a deep
fryer or is causing grease waste to accumulate in the sewer.
   (E)   (1)   All reports required by the town shall be submitted to the town
at the following address, unless other arrangements are made with pretreatment
staff:
      Town of Boone - WWTP
      Pretreatment Section
      P.O. Box 192
      Boone, N.C. 28607
      (2)   All reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Am. Ord. passed 12-13-2012)
§ 50.446 INSPECTION.
   The FSE shall provide access to all compartments of the grease removal
device for inspection by an authorized representative from the town. The
inspection may include the interior and exterior structure of the grease
removal device, the waste sources and types that are plumbed to the grease
removal device, and the waste levels inside the grease removal device. Any
corrective actions indicated by the Inspector shall be enforceable.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Am. Ord. passed 12-13-2012)
§ 50.447 FEES.
   An annual program fee will be assessed and is due in July of each year. The
annual program fee will be waived for each FSE that received zero violations
during the previous calendar year. The amount of this fee will be listed on the
schedule of charges and fees.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011; Am. Ord. passed 12-13-2012)
§ 50.448 ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE PLAN.

§ 50.461 OVERDUE FEES AND OTHER CHARGES.
   (A)   Except for monthly water and sewer consumption fees that are subject
to late penalty charges, all fees and charges assessed pursuant to this
chapter, including but not limited to connection or extension fees, meter fees,
and system development fees, must be paid within 30 days of the date of
invoicing. In the event fees and charges are not paid within 30 days of
invoicing, interest shall accrue at the rate of 1.25% per month or the highest
rate allowed by law, whichever is lowest, and in addition, the town may revoke
or suspend any permits it has issued authorizing the construction or use and/or
issue a stop work order until such fees and charges are paid.
   (B)   The Administrator may in his or her discretion allow construction or
use to proceed without payment in full of all fees and charges but subject to
interest charges as previously specified where the applicant signs a written
agreement to pay such fees, charges, and interest prior to issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy or other final approval authorizing the use or
occupancy (“final certificate”). The Administrator ordinarily will allow such
late payment, subject to interest charges, in the absence of extenuating
circumstances. Extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to,
circumstances in which the Administrator has reasonable grounds to believe that
all fees, charges and interest will not be paid by the applicant before a
certificate of occupancy or other final certificate is issued, and in cases
where the applicant has failed to pay all fees, charges and/or interest when
due on one or more other projects.
   (C)   All fees, charges and accrued interest must be paid before a
certificate of occupancy or other final certificate may be issued and before a
permanent service account may be opened.

§ 50.462 USER CHARGE METHODOLOGY.
   (A)   Debt service based on 3% interest, 20-year declining payments.
   (B)   Billable flow projections:
      (1)   Year 1: 1.35 mgd; and
      (2)   Year 20: 2.12 mgd.
   (C)   Annual O&M costs are based on a year one estimate of $888,047 and year
20 estimate of $1,643,273, projected linearly.
(Annual Debt Service (Principal & Interest) + Annual O&M) ÷ (Billable Flow
(Gallons) x 365) x 1,000 = Cost Per 1,000 Gallons
   (D)   Methodology for toxics must be determined on a case-by-case basis
according to the specific nature of the toxic and its impact on the POTW.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2011)
§ 50.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any user or contributor who is found to have failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter, except §§
50.240 through
50.243, or the orders, rules, regulations and wastewater permits issued
hereunder, may be assessed a civil penalty up to $25,000 per day per violation,
as stated in G.S. § 143-215.6A, 15A 02H NCAC .0918 and/or G.S. § 143-215.3(a).
In no case, shall the amount be less than the amount of the penalty, if any,
imposed upon the town as a result of the violation. Minimum actions to be taken
in response to violations are charted below, but elevated enforcement as
described in §
50.999 may occur at the discretion of the POTW Director.
      (1)   Continuing violation. Each days continuing violation of any section
of this chapter, except §§
50.240 through
50.243, shall be a separate and distinct offense.
      (2)   Violation of chapter. Any person, industry, commercial activity,
institution or other type of business found violating any provision of this
chapter shall become liable to the town for any expense, loss or damage
incurred by the town due to the violation.
      (3)   Court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding divisions (1) and
(2) above, this chapter may also be enforced by appropriate equitable remedies
issued from a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (4)   In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the POTW Director
shall consider the following:
         (a)   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to
the public health, or to public or private property resulting from the
violation;
         (b)   The duration and gravity of the violation;
         (c)   The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or on
air quality;

      (5)   Penalties between $10,000 and $25,000 per day per violation may be
assessed against a violator:
         (a)   For any class of violation, only if a civil penalty has been
imposed against the violator within the five years preceding the violation; or
         (b)   In the case of failure to file, submit or make available, as the
case may be, any documents, data or reports required by this chapter, except §§
50.240 through
50.243, or the orders, rules, regulations and wastewater permits issued
hereunder, only if the POTW Director determines that the violation was
intentional and a civil penalty has been imposed against the violator within
the five years preceding the violation.
      (6)   A contributor in violation will be issued a notice of violation
explaining the violation and what penalty, if any, is being assessed. The
assessment will be added to the contributor's next scheduled sewer service
charges, and the POTW shall have the remedies for the collection of the
assessment as it has for collection of other service charges.
      (7)   Appeals of civil penalties assessed in accordance with this section
shall be as provided in §
50.339.
   (B)   Remedies, in addition to those previously mentioned in this chapter,
are available to the POTW Director who may use any single one or combination
against a noncompliant user or contributor. Additional available remedies
include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Criminal violations. Referral to the District Attorney for the 24th
Judicial District for the prosecution of noncompliant users or contributors who
violate the provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B.
         (a)   Under North Carolina law, it is a crime to negligently violate
any term, condition or requirement of a pretreatment permit (called wastewater
permits in this chapter), or negligently fail to apply for a pretreatment
permit, issued by local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B(f)), to knowingly and
willfully violate any term, condition or requirement of a pretreatment permit,
or knowingly and willfully fail to apply for a pretreatment permit issued by
local governments (G.S. 143-215.6B(g)), to knowingly violate any term,
condition or requirement of a pretreatment permit issued by local governments,
or knowingly fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that
a person is placed in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury (G.S.
143-215.6B(h)), and to falsify information required under Article 21 of Chapter
143 of the General Statutes (G.S. 143-215.6B(i));
         (b)   Violation of a prohibition or requirement of a Stage III Water
Shortage shall be a misdemeanor, pursuant to G.S. § 14-4, punishable by a fine
equal to the stated civil penalty, up to a maximum of $500 and imprisonment for
each offense of up to 30 days;
      (2)   Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial wastewater contributor is
in violation of the provisions of this chapter, or an order or permit issued
hereunder, the POTW Director may petition the Superior Court of Justice for the
issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent injunction,
which restrains or compels the activities in question;
      (3)   Performance bonds. The POTW Director may refuse to reissue a
wastewater permit to any industrial wastewater contributor that has failed to
comply with the provisions of this chapter, or any order or previous permit
issued hereunder, unless the industrial wastewater contributor first files with
it a satisfactory bond, payable to the POTW, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the POTW Director to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance;
      (4)   Water supply severance. 
         (a)   Whenever an industrial wastewater contributor is in violation of
the provisions of this chapter, or an order or permit issued hereunder, water
service to the industrial wastewater contributor may be severed and service
will only recommence, at the contributor’s expense, once the contributor has
paid the town all costs associated with re-establishing service as well as all
customary charges for initiating service, and has also demonstrated
satisfactorily the ability and willingness to comply;
         (b)   The town may disconnect a user from the town's water supply
after two or more violations of §§
50.309 and
50.310 during any 36-month period or the duration of a water shortage
declaration, whichever is longer. Should service be disconnected pursuant
thereto, a $100 reconnect fee shall be imposed before service is restored. If
three or more violations of §§
50.309 and/or
50.310 occur during any 36-month period or the duration of the water shortage
declaration, whichever is longer, the town may also, pursuant to the discretion
of the POTW Director, remove the user's water meter and in that event, all
previously unpaid fees and deposits shall be forfeited. Reconnection thereafter
shall only be made with the approval of the Town Manager. Before service is

    For the purpose of this Title VII, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADMINISTRATOR. The person or persons designated by the Town Manager to
administer and enforce this title. Whenever this title authorizes or requires
the Administrator to install a traffic-control device controlling parking or
regulating the movement of traffic on, to or from a state-highway-system street
and the installation of a device is in practice a function of the State
Department of Transportation, the Administrator may discharge his or her
responsibility by requesting the State Department of Transportation to install
the device.
   DRIVER. The operator of a vehicle.
   HIGHWAY or STREET. The entire width between property or right-of-way lines
of every way or place of whatever nature, when any part thereof is open to the
use of the public as a matter of right for the purposes of vehicular traffic.
The terms HIGHWAY or STREET or a combination of the two terms shall be used
synonymously.
   INTERSECTION. The area embraced within the prolongation of the lateral curb
lines or, if none, then the lateral edge of roadway lines of two or more
highways which join one another at any angle, whether or not one highway
crosses the other. Where a highway includes two roadways 30 feet or more apart,
then every crossing of each roadway of the divided highway by an intersecting
highway shall be regarded as a separate intersection. In the event that the
intersecting highway also includes two roadways 30 feet or more apart, then
every crossing of two roadways of the highways shall be regarded as a separate
intersection.
   MOTOR VEHICLE. Every vehicle that is self-propelled and every vehicle
designed to run upon the highways which is pulled by a self-propelled vehicle.
This shall not include mopeds, as defined in G.S. § 20-4.01(27)d1.

otherwise, the limitations on parking and standing in this title apply only to
locations within a street right-of-way. In no case do these limitations on
parking and standing in this title apply only to locations within a street
right-of-way. In no case do these limitations apply when a vehicle is stopped
to avoid conflict with other traffic or in compliance with law or the
directions result of an emergency or because the vehicle is disabled.
   ROADWAY. The portion of a highway improved, designed or ordinarily used for
vehicular travel, exclusive of the shoulder. In the event a highway includes
two or more separate roadways, the term. ROADWAY, as used herein, shall refer
to any roadway separately, but not to all roadways collectively.
   SAFETY ZONE. A traffic island or other space that is officially set aside
within a highway for the exclusive use of pedestrians and that is so plainly
marked or indicated by proper signs as to be plainly visible at all times while
set apart as a safety zone.

state highway system. Whenever this title regulates parking or the movement of
traffic on, to or from a state highway system street, then to the extent that
concurrence by the State Department of Transportation is necessary (by passage
of a concurring ordinance or otherwise) the regulation shall not become

bicycles, skateboards and the like
   
71.02   Bicycle equipment and operating regulations
 
   
71.99   Penalties
§ 71.01 SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR NON-MOTORIZED WHEELED VEHICLES, INCLUDING
BICYCLES, SKATEBOARDS AND THE LIKE.
   (A)   Skateboards, skates, and similar devices. The following provisions
govern the operation of non-motorized vehicles other than bicycles, including
but not limited to roller skates, in-line skates, skateboards, coasters,
scooters, and toy vehicles (collectively referred to hereafter as "skating
device") on any public right-of-way or on any property open to the public or
used by the public for pedestrian or vehicular purpose:
      (1)   No person may ride a skating device upon any roadway, except while

upon all of the following conditions:
         (a)   The roadway has a posted speed limit of 20 mph or less;
         (b)   The road is not a through street; and
         (c)   The rider yields to all vehicular traffic and pedestrians.
      (2)   No person riding a skating device may attach himself or herself or
the skating device to any moving motor vehicle.
      (3)   A person may ride a skating device upon a sidewalk only upon the
following conditions:
         (a)   The rider must yield to all pedestrians. Pedestrians shall at
all times have the right-of-way upon a sidewalk. In the case of any doubt of
safe and untouched passage by a pedestrian, a person riding a skating device
shall stop or dismount such device until the pedestrian passes.
         (b)   Riding a skating device is prohibited on the sidewalks adjacent
to King Street from Water Street to Appalachian Street.
   (B)   Bicycles. The following provisions govern the operation of bicycles on
any public right-of-way, including roads, sidewalks, and greenways.
      (1)   Helmets and other equipment must be used as provided at §
71.02 herein.
      (2)   Bicycles may only be ridden on public sidewalks if:
         (a)   The bicyclist is a minor, or is an adult transporting a minor on
the bicycle consistent with the requirements of §
71.02; or
         (b)   The sidewalk is adjacent to a road that the bicyclist reasonably
considers unsafe for bicycling.
      (3)   Bicyclists riding upon a public sidewalk adjacent to a street with
sidewalks available on both sides of the street shall ride in the same
direction as the immediately adjacent lane of motor vehicle traffic where it is
reasonably possible and practical to do so, taking into consideration the
intended route of the bicyclist, the availability of safe alternatives, and
other relevant considerations. Warnings may be issued for violations of this
division, but a citation may be issued only where the bicyclist has
demonstrated repeated and reckless disregard for his or her safety or the
safety of others in the course of violating this provision.
      (4)   Bicyclists must yield to pedestrians. Pedestrians shall at all
times have the right-of-way upon a sidewalk or crosswalk. In the case of any
doubt of safe and untouched passage by a pedestrian, a bicyclist shall stop or
dismount until the pedestrian has passed.
      (5)   Bicyclists riding upon a sidewalk against the direction of the
motor vehicle traffic in the immediately adjacent lane of the street must yield

vehicle is entering onto the adjacent street from an intersecting driveway or
road, or exiting that adjacent street onto an intersecting road or driveway.
      (6)   Bicycling is prohibited on the sidewalks adjacent to King Street
from Water Street to Appalachian Street.
   (C)   A bicyclist may not carry any other person upon the handlebars or any
other part of the bicycle not designed for carrying passengers.
   (D)   The limitations stated in this section shall not apply to bicycles
operated by the town's police officers who are engaged in the pursuit or
apprehension of violators. This exemption shall not, however, protect the
driver of any vehicle from the consequence of a reckless disregard of the
safety of others.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019; Ord. passed 1-19-2021)

(Ord. passed 12-15-2016; Ord. passed 6-28-2023)
§ 73.03 ADVANCE NOTICE OF TRESPASS TOWING OR BOOTING REQUIRED.
    It shall be unlawful for any person to authorize, direct, engage in, or
contract for trespass towing or booting in a private parking lot unless advance
notice is given as follows:
   (A)   The parking lot has one or more warning signs posted at such locations
and heights so as to provide a conspicuous warning to drivers of vehicles who
are not familiar with that parking lot that the lot is private and that
unauthorized vehicles will be towed or booted.
      (1)   Each sign shall be no smaller than four square feet and no larger
than six square feet, with a white background and red letters, printed in fonts
that can easily be read by a driver of ordinary vision, and shall contain the
following information, as applicable:
         (a)   That the parking lot is a private parking lot and that
unauthorized vehicles will be towed or immobilized and subject to a fine/fee
for removal of the boot, e.g., "Private Parking Lot - Towing Enforced" or

"Parking for Customers Only - Towing Enforced," or "Parking for Residents Only
- Unauthorized Vehicles Will Be Immobilized and Fined ", or similar phrasing.
         (b)   The name and telephone number of the towing company and/or
booting service that enforces parking in that lot.
      (2)   If applicable, the following information must be contained either
on the warning sign(s) required per the preceding division (A)(1) or on
separate sign(s) attached immediately adjacent on the same post or structure:
         (a)   If the parking lot serves a shopping center, mall, or office
building, then at the option of the property owner or lessor either:
            1.   The name of the shopping center or mall or office building; or
            2.   The names of all businesses within that shopping center or
mall or office building, and a warning that parking is authorized only for
persons patronizing that shopping center or mall or office building.
         (b)   If the parking lot serves multiple locations (other than a

served by the parking lot and a warning that parking is authorized only for
persons patronizing one of those establishments.

complaints about parking enforcement in this lot, please call [name; telephone
number]" with the name and telephone number of the owner or lessee of the lot
who contracts for parking enforcement services. For clarification, such name
and telephone number must be that of the owner or lessee itself, and may not be
that of an agent of the lot owner or lessee, such as the parking enforcement
company. If at any time the telephone number on this sign is not in working
order to reach the property owner or lessee during regular business hours, then
said property owner or lessee is in violation of this chapter and subject to
citation.
            2.   Exceptions. This division (A) shall not apply to parking
spaces that require display of a permit (e.g., hang-tag or decal) or are
administered through a pay-upon-parking system.
      (3)   There shall be a minimum of one warning sign for each vehicular
entrance to the parking lot and such other signs as are required so that an
ordinary driver who is not familiar with that parking lot is warned by the

exiting the parking lot as a pedestrian that the lot is private and that
unauthorized vehicles are subject to towing or booting.
      (4)   One or more police officers designated by the Chief of Police (the
"liaison officer") shall direct and approve the number and placement of warning
signs in his or her reasonable discretion to ensure that signs are conspicuous
to warn vehicle drivers as specified per the foregoing provisions of this
division (A). If the property owner or lessee disagrees with the direction
provided by the liaison officer, the owner or lessee may appeal to the Chief of
Police. The determination of the Chief of Police shall be final and non-
appealable.
      (5)   If one or more credible complaints are received by the Police
Department from any person to the effect that the warning signs posted on a
parking lot are not sufficiently conspicuous as required per this division (A),
the liaison officer shall re-consider the sign layout and may require the re-
location of signs or the installation of new signs.
   (B)   As an alternative to the signage required per division (A) above, the
parking lot may have a sign at every parking space within the lot as to which
parking is to be enforced, each such sign being posted in a conspicuous
location facing the parking space, no smaller than 120 square inches, with a
white background and red letters, identifying the space as private property,
and warning that unauthorized vehicles will be towed or booted (for example,
"Private Parking - Towing Enforced"). In addition, the name and telephone
number of the towing company or booting service must be posted either:
      (1)   On each sign facing the individual parking spaces; or
      (2)   On at least one other sign, no smaller than four square feet and no
larger than six square feet, placed in a conspicuous location in the parking
lot.
   (C)   As an alternative to the signage required per division (A) or (B)
above, a trespass tow is authorized where a weather-proof (e.g., laminated)
written notice, not less than 8.5 inches by 11 inches, is placed on the front
driver's side windshield and/or the driver's window of the car, affixed in
manner that will not mar the vehicle but will insure that the notice will not
blow away, at least eight hours prior to the trespass towing of the vehicle,
which notice contains all of the following information on both sides of the
notice in large, easily readable type:
      (1)   That the parking lot is a private parking lot and unauthorized
vehicles will be towed;
      (2)   The name and telephone number of the towing company and location
where any towed vehicle is taken;
      (3)   The towing charges imposed by the towing company;
      (4)   The amount of any storage charges related to the storage by the
towing company of the vehicle, and the terms and conditions for the imposition
of storage charges; and
      (5)   The time and date that the notice has been placed on the vehicle
and the time and date as of which the vehicle will become subject to towing.
   (D)   Once an owner or operator of a vehicle has been notified of
unauthorized use pursuant to division (C) above, it shall be unnecessary for
the person authorizing, directing, engaging in, or contracting for the trespass
tow to give any further notification should there be any future unauthorized
parking of the same vehicle at the same parking lot, and upon its discovery,
the vehicle may be immediately towed.

   (A)    An occupied vehicle may not be towed or attached to a towing vehicle.
   (B)   A towing company may not attempt to impede or block an occupied
vehicle from being removed from a parking lot by its owner or operator.
   (C)   A towing company must accept at least two nationally-recognized credit
cards (such as MasterCard or Visa) and any debit card in payment for any fees
charged in connection with a trespass tow.
   (D)   Whenever a towing company is attempting a trespass tow but the vehicle
has not yet been removed from the parking lot, and the owner or operator of the
vehicle appears and states a desire that the vehicle not be towed, the towing
company shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator upon the payment of
its noticed fees and charges.
   (E)   A towing service engaged in a trespass tow shall, upon request of the
owner or operator of the motor vehicle, permit the owner or operator access to
the trespass vehicle for the purpose of retrieving personal property from the
vehicle. If personal items are removed from the motor vehicle by the towing
service, then upon request those items will be returned to the owner or
operator.
   (F)   A towing company that engages in a trespass tow shall, prior to or
immediately upon removing the vehicle from the private parking lot, report to
the Police Department by telephone to its non-emergency number the fact that a
vehicle is to be towed and shall provide a description of the vehicle including
make, color, and license tag number, the parking lot from which it is to be
towed, and the place it is to be stored.
   (G)   For six hours immediately following a trespass tow and during the next
business day, the towing company must respond within one-half hour to a
telephone call from the vehicle's owner or operator to the contact number
provided by the towing company. During its response call, upon the request of
the operator or owner of the towed vehicle, the towing company must make
arrangements for the release of the vehicle upon the full payment of fees.
      (1)   The towing company must arrange for and allow the full payment of
fees within one-half hour of responding to a call from the owner or operator of
the vehicle. If the towing company is located more than ten miles from the
location from which the vehicle was towed, and the owner or operator has
requested the opportunity and indicated a willingness to pay the fees, but
states an inability to obtain transportation to the location of the vehicle,
the company must travel to the location of the operator or owner of the towed
vehicle to allow the full payment of fees to be made. The towing company may
charge an additional fee for this service.
      (2)   The towing company must arrange for the release of the towed
vehicle within one hour of payment. If the vehicle is more than ten miles from
the location from which it was towed, the company must return the vehicle to
the public street nearest the location from which the vehicle was towed within
one hour of payment. The towing company may charge an additional fee for this
service.
   (H)   No storage fee may be charged for days when the towing company is not
open during the full normal business hours of at least 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
for the recovery of a trespass towed vehicle. A towing company that is not open
for the recovery of a towed vehicle 24 hours a day shall not charge a storage
fee for the storage of the towed vehicle until at least one full business day
(no less than 24 hours) has elapsed from the time the towing company is next
open for the recovery of a towed vehicle after the towing.
(Ord. passed 12-15-2016; Ord. passed 6-28-2023)
§ 73.05 BOOTING PRACTICES.
   (A)    An occupied vehicle may not be booted.
   (B)   A booting service may not attempt to impede or block an occupied
vehicle that has not yet been booted from being removed from a parking lot by
its owner or operator.
   (C)   A booting service must accept at least two nationally-recognized
credit cards (such as MasterCard or Visa) and any debit card in payment for any
and all fees charged in connection with booting.
   (D)   (1)   No natural person may engage in booting in any capacity (whether
as an employee, subcontractor, officer, sole proprietor, and the like) until he
or she has obtained an identification badge from the town. Identification
badges shall be issued for a single calendar year and must be renewed annually.
In order to obtain an identification badge from the town, the applicant must:
         (a)   Authorize a criminal background review by the Police Department
or such other entity as the town may enlist;
         (b)   Fully complete an application, on a form provided by the town,
disclosing his or her name, address, telephone number, date of birth, gender,
company affiliation, if any (to include the legal name, mailing address, and
physical location of the affiliated company), and status as an employee or
independent contractor of the company (by stating whether and by whom income
taxes and FICA taxes are withheld from his or her pay); and
         (c)   Disclose and certify, under oath, any and all criminal
convictions described at §
73.10 below. An identification badge may not be issued to a person who has been
convicted as described at §
73.10.
      (2)   A natural person engaged in booting must display on his or her
person at all times the picture identification badge issued by the town. The
identification must be plainly visible, either attached to the exterior
clothing or on a lanyard hanging around the neck. Upon request, the person
engaged in booting must allow the operator or owner of the vehicle which has
been immobilized to examine and copy any information from the identification
badge. In addition, a person engaged in booting must wear clothing that
identifies in a manner that is conspicuous and easily readable to other persons
with whom that persons engages the name of the business for whom that person
works and includes in either the name of the business or otherwise a
description of the parking control device or method used, e.g., “ABC Wheel-lock
Company.” The letters on such insignia shall be no less than three-quarters of
an inch in height.
   (E)   Any vehicle used in connection with booting must have insignia on both
the operator's door and the front passenger door or a car-top-mounted sign that
identifies the company with which the attendant is employed or associated by
name and telephone number and includes either in the name of the company or
otherwise a description of the parking control device or method utilized, e.g.,
“ABC Wheel-lock Company.” All letters on such insignia shall be no less than
three inches in height; provided, that notwithstanding any other provision of
this chapter, vehicle insignia must comply with this three-inch minimum
requirement when new insignia is purchased, when insignia is replaced, or by
June 30, 2017, whichever occurs earlier.
   (F)   After immobilizing a vehicle, the booting service must place a
weather-proof (e.g., laminated) notice on the driver's side windshield of the
car, affixed in manner that will not mar the vehicle but will insure that the
notice will not blow away. This notice must be brightly colored (e.g., yellow
or orange), a minimum of 8.5 inches by 11 inches, and contain the following
information, all of which shall be in a large, plainly readable type:
      (1)   In capital letters: “YOUR VEHICLE HAS BEEN WHEEL-LOCKED BECAUSE IT
WAS PARKED IN A PRIVATE LOT WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION. DO NOT DRIVE THIS VEHICLE OR
YOU MAY DAMAGE YOUR CAR AND THE WHEEL LOCK”;
      (2)   All fees that may be charged prior to release of the vehicle;
      (3)   That all fees may be paid by cash, credit card or debit card; and
      (4)   A telephone number to call to have the wheel lock removed. The fees
that may be charged must be specifically and precisely disclosed; that is, the
notice may not refer to minimum or maximum fees or a range of fees.
      (5)   If a fee is charged in the event that (and on grounds that) the
notice itself is destroyed, then in capital letters “DO NOT DESTROY THIS
NOTICE. AN ADDITIONAL FEE OF $____ WILL BE CHARGED IF YOU DO NOT RETURN THIS
NOTICE TO [NAME OF PARKING ENFORCEMENT COMPANY]”.
   (G)   A booting service must arrange to respond to a telephone call from the
owner or operator of an immobilized vehicle within no more than 15 minutes.
   (H)   A booting service must make a reasonable effort to release the
immobilized vehicle within 30 minutes of responding to the telephone call from
the owner or operator of an immobilized vehicle.
   (I)   After a vehicle is booted, it shall be unlawful for any person to
authorize, direct or contract for the trespass towing of that vehicle for a
period of at least eight hours following such booting. Once a boot has been
applied, the vehicle subsequently may be trespassed towed after the vehicle has
been booted for at least eight hours, so long as the requirements of either §
73.03(A) or (C) are met as to that trespass tow.
   (J)   A booting company may not charge more than one boot removal fee for
the booting of a particular vehicle in a particular instance, and may not
charge a higher removal fee based solely on the length of time that a boot has
been attached to a vehicle; provided, however, that this provision is not
intended to prevent a booting service from charging additional fees for
separate and additional services, such as a service call to meet an owner or
operator of a vehicle to remove a boot where the owner or operator does not
appear and has to be rescheduled.
   (K)   Should the town receive and verify three or more unrelated and
credible complaints within any three-month period asserting the failure of a
booting service to respond within 15 minutes to telephone contact by the owners
or operators of immobilized vehicles and to arrange the vehicles’ release
within 30 minutes thereafter, it shall be presumptively concluded that the
booting service does not have the capacity to respond within the required
times. Thereafter for the following 12-month period, a duly authorized person
must be on duty and present in the parking lot at all times when any vehicle is
booted, and the person must remain on the property until the owner or operator
of the vehicle returns, with the ability to remove the boot upon payment of
fees. After the 12-month period, the booting service shall not be required to
maintain a duly authorized person at all times in parking lots where vehicles
are booted, unless and until such time as the town again receives and verifies
three or more complaints as set forth in the first sentence of this division.

§ 73.06 NOTICE OF FEES AND PAYMENT OPTIONS; FEES TO BE REASONABLE.
   (A)    With respect to every trespass tow or booting subject to this
chapter, plain and conspicuous notice must be given to the owner or operator of

trespass tow or booting, including storage and any other fee or charge of any

section §
73.03(A) or (B)(2) above, or on separate sign(s) attached to the same sign post

         (b)   On the weather-resistant notices to be attached to the vehicle's
windshield as provided at sections §§
73.03(C) or
73.05(F) above, in the same or a larger type size than that used for the other
information provided in the notice; or
         (c)   On the vehicle insignia on the towing vehicle or booting service
vehicle, provided that such vehicle is easily viewable by the owner or operator
of the vehicle when arrangements are being made for payment of the towing or
booting fees.
   (B)   Any towing company engaged in trespass towing shall post in a
conspicuous location at its place(s) of business and in size sufficient to be
easily read a schedule of fees that states, at a minimum, its consensual towing
fee(s), its trespass towing fee, its daily storage fee and its hours of
operation. The schedule of fees shall be posted in a location(s) so that a
person may obtain the information at times when the towing company is not open
for business.
   (C)   Any towing company or booting service engaged in activities subject to
this chapter must provide to the Police Department (i) a schedule of all its
fees and charges and (ii) a true and correct copy of the notice(s) employed by
the service pursuant to §§
73.03(C) and/or
73.05(F) herein, and such schedule of fees and notices must be kept current at
all times. Fees must be specifically and precisely disclosed; the required
schedule of fees may not refer to minimum or maximum fees or to a range of
fees.
   (D)   A towing company or booting service may not assess any fee or other
charge in connection with a trespass tow or booting unless all of the following
conditions are met:
      (1)   The fee or other charge has been publicly noticed as required per
divisions (A) and (B) above; and
      (2)   The fee or other charge is set forth in a schedule of fees and
charges that has been on file with the Police Department for at least 24 hours
prior to the assessment of the fee. In the case of any discrepancy in the
amount of a fee or other charge noticed by posting in any manner provided at
division (A) above or provided to the Police Department on a schedule of fees,
only the lowest fee or other charge so noticed may be charged.
      (3)   The particular trespass tow or booting at issue has been conducted
in full and complete compliance with all requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   Any fee charged in connection with a trespass tow or booting regulated
under this chapter must be reasonable in relation to the cost of providing the
service or item, inclusive of reasonable overhead and profit.
   (F)   A towing or booting service may not charge or collect any fee or other
charge for a trespass tow or booting that is conducted in a manner that is in
violation of any requirement of this chapter. Any fee or other charge that is
paid in violation of the foregoing provision must be refunded upon demand.
Failure to comply with this division (F) constitutes a separate and distinct
violation of this chapter and shall be subject to citation in addition to the
underlying violation.

      (1)   A breakdown of individual fees charged;

violation of this section. 
   (N)   Any condition that is specifically defined as a nuisance pursuant to
any other provision of this Code; provided, that this subdivision does not
apply to conditions declared to be nuisances under Chapter 50 ("Water and
Sewer") and any such conditions shall be governed by the provisions of that
Chapter.

prejudicial to the public health, safety, and general welfare of inhabitants of
the town and declared to be a public nuisance by a code enforcement officer and
affirmed to be a public nuisance by the town council. The code enforcement

and be heard, to declare that the conditions existing constitute a danger to

(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 80.07 NOTICE OF EXISTENCE OF NUISANCE; SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice of existence and opportunity to abate nuisance. 
      (1)   Upon a determination that a public nuisance as described in this
chapter exists, the code enforcement officer shall notify in writing the
property owner and, to the extent actually known to the code enforcement
officer, any other responsible person of the condition constituting the public
nuisance and shall order the prompt abatement thereof.
      (2)   The notice of violation shall notify the recipient of the
following:
         (a)   That condition(s) exist on the property which constitute a
public nuisance;
         (b)   The condition(s) existing and the Code provision(s) that are
violated by such condition(s);
         (c)   The location of such condition(s);
         (d)   That the property owner and any other responsible person are
ordered to abate the public nuisance, and that, unless the condition is abated
within the prescribed period, the conditions constituting a nuisance will be
abated by the town and the cost of abatement shall constitute a lien against
the premises, may be collected in the nature of a civil action, and may result
in civil penalties;
         (e)   A statement that civil penalties and an administrative fee of
one hundred dollars $100 will be assessed for a second and any subsequent
notice of violation issued under this chapter within 12 months of the first
such notice of violation.
   (B)   Manner of notice.
      (1)   The notice of a violation of this chapter shall be served on the
property owner by:
         (a)   Personal delivery of such notice;
         (b)   By mail sent by both regular first class mail and by certified
mail, return receipt requested to the address then on file in the county
property tax assessor's office; or
         (c)   By electronic mail, if the property owner confirms receipt of
the notice by electronic mail.
      (2)   Any such notice may be served by any authorized representative of
the town manager, his or her designee, the code enforcement officer, or by any
police officer of the town. If service cannot otherwise be made on a property
owner, the property shall be posted with the notice. Notice shall be served in
the same manner upon any other responsible person of whom the code enforcement
officer is actually aware.
   (C)    Opportunity for owner or other responsible person to abate the
nuisance. Except as provided at division (D) of this section, the town
ordinarily shall allow 15 calendar days from the receipt of such written notice
for abatement of the nuisance. However, for good cause expressed in the written
notice to abate, the code enforcement officer may provide a shorter or longer
time for the abatement.
   (D)   Summary abatement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions or any
other provision of this Chapter, if, in the opinion of the Town Manager, his or
her designee, or the code enforcement officer, an unlawful condition is such
that it poses imminent danger or peril to public, the town may, with or without
prior notice, proceed to abate the same, and the cost thereof shall be charged
against the property owner.
   (E)   Any defect in the method of giving the notice required by this
section, or in the form thereof, or the giving of such notice to an improper
person, shall not prevent the town, in any case where the work of abating an
unlawful condition upon any property is borne by the town, from collecting the
cost thereof from the owner, nor shall it affect the validity of the lien on
the property for such cost, nor shall it subject the town to any liability.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 80.08 APPEAL OF DETERMINATION OF NUISANCE; ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Within the period for abatement specified on the notice of violation,
the property owner or other responsible person may request in writing a review
of the nuisance determination by the Town Manager. Unless the unlawful
condition is dangerous so as to require summary abatement per the preceding
section, such written request shall stay the abatement of the nuisance by the
town until the completion of the review by the Town Manager or his or her
designee. In the event no appeal is taken, the town may proceed to abate the
nuisance.
   (B)   Within ten days of receiving a request for review, the Town Manager
shall hold a hearing to review the nuisance determination. At this hearing, all
interested persons shall be heard and may offer evidence and be represented by
an attorney. The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner to determine
whether there is a sufficient legal and factual basis to affirm the nuisance
determination, and the rules of evidence shall not apply; provided, that the
decision of the Town Manager shall be based upon substantial and reliable
evidence. If, following the hearing, the Town Manager upholds the findings, and
declares the condition existing on the property to be a danger and hazard to
the health, safety, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the town and a
public nuisance, the Town Manager shall issue a written order directing the
property owner or other responsible person to abate the nuisance within 15 days
and/or, if the nuisance is not abated by the property owner, directing the town
to abate the condition constituting a nuisance.
   (C)   Rather than reviewing an appeal, the Town Manager, in his or her sole
discretion, may for good cause refer the review of any notice of violation to
the Town Council.
   (D)   If a nuisance is found to exist, the responsibility for abatement
shall rest with the property owner and any other responsible person,
notwithstanding that the nuisance is found to exist, wholly or in part, within
a town easement which crosses private property.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the property owner or other
responsible party from abating the nuisance in question in accordance with the
notice of violation prior to any requested review pursuant to this section.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 80.09 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES BY TOWN.
   (A)   If any person, after having been ordered to abate a public nuisance
described in this chapter, fails, neglects or refuses to abate or remove the
condition constituting the nuisance by the date specified in the notice of
violation, the town may cause the condition to be removed or otherwise remedied
by having employees of the town or a private contractor hired by the town to go
upon such premises and remove or otherwise abate such nuisance under the
supervision of an officer or employee designated by the Town Manager or his
designee. The cost of abatement shall be paid by the property owner.
   (B)   Any person who has been ordered to abate a public nuisance may, within
the time allowed by this article, request in writing that the town remove such
condition causing the nuisance. If the town abates the nuisance, the costs of
abatement shall be paid by the person making the request.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 80.10 COST OF NUISANCE ABATEMENT TO BE CHARGED TO PROPERTY OWNER.
   Upon the completion of abatement by the town, the Town Manager, his or her
designee, or the code enforcement officer shall deliver to the finance director
a statement showing the actual cost of the abatement of the unlawful condition
plus any additional charges, in accordance with the schedule of fees and
charges established by the town Council. The finance director shall thereupon
mail to the owner of the subject property a bill covering the cost, if with
reasonable diligence the name and address of such owner can be ascertained,
with instruction that such charges are due and payable within 30 days from the
receipt thereof. In the event the costs for abatement are not paid within 30
days after receipt of the statement of charges, such charges may be recovered
by the town in a civil action in the nature of debt.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 80.11 LIEN CREATED UPON FAILURE TO PAY NUISANCE ABATEMENT COSTS.
   In the event charges for the removal or abatement of the public nuisance are
not paid within 30 days after receipt of the statement of charges, such charges
shall become a lien against the real property upon which such costs are
incurred. The amount of such lien shall be added to the tax roll and collected
as unpaid ad valorem taxes.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 80.12 NOTICE TO CHRONIC VIOLATORS.
   (A)   For purposes of this section, a chronic violator is a person who owns
property with respect to which, in the previous calendar year, the town gave
notice of violation for a public nuisance violation at least three times under
any provision of this chapter.
   (B)   At the beginning of each calendar year, the code enforcement officer
shall notify each person who was a chronic violator that, if the violator's
property is found to be in violation of this chapter in this calendar year, the
town shall, without further notice, take action to remedy the violation, and
the expense of the action shall become a lien upon the property and shall be
collected as unpaid taxes. The notice shall be sent by registered or certified
mail. When service is attempted by registered or certified mail, a copy of the
notice may also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if
the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail
is not returned by the post office within ten days after the mailing. If
service by regular mail is used, a copy of the notice shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises affected.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 80.13 ADMINISTRATIVE FEE.
   (A)   Fee assessed for second and subsequent violations. Any person who is
issued a second notice of violation under this chapter within 12 months of the
first notice of violation issued hereunder shall be subject to an
administrative fee of $100 in addition to any other charge. For each additional
nuisance notice of violation occurring prior to the expiration of a 12-month
period following issuance of the first nuisance notice of violation, the person
shall be subject to an administrative fee of $100. The person may also be
assessed any costs incurred in obtaining service of the public nuisance notice
including legal publication.
   (B)   Appeal of administrative fee. An appeal of an administrative fee
demand for payment must be filed in writing with the Town Manager within ten
days after service of the written demand for payment. The written appeal shall
provide the reasons the petitioner contends that the administrative fee was
wrongly applied and any supporting documentation.
      (1)   Within ten days of receiving a request for review, the Town Manager
shall hold a hearing to review the civil penalty. At this hearing, all
interested persons shall be heard and may offer evidence and be represented by
an attorney. The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner and the rules
of evidence shall not apply; provided, that the decision of the Town Manager
shall be based upon substantial and reliable evidence. The Town Manager may
reduce the penalty if the Town Manager determines that:
         (a)   The appellant has acted in good faith; and
         (b)   The failure of the appellant to avoid a second or subsequent
violation is the result of circumstances beyond the appellant's control; or
         (c)   There are other circumstances which make the assessment of the
administrative fee unfair in that particular case.
      (2)   Rather than reviewing an appeal, the Town Manager, in his or her
sole discretion, may for good cause refer the review of an administrative fee
to the Town Council.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 80.14 PROCEDURES IN CHAPTER NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   The procedures set forth in this article shall be in addition to any other
remedies that may now or hereafter exist under law for the abatement of public
nuisances.
   (A)   Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the town from
proceeding in a criminal action against any person violating the provisions of
this article as provided in G.S. § 14-4.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to limit the town's authority
to summarily remove, abate, or remedy any condition within the town limits or
within 1 mile thereof that is dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or
public safety as provided in G.S. § 160A-193.
   (C)   In addition to or in lieu of proceeding under any other provision(s)
of this chapter, the town may file a legal action to abate a nuisance as
provided at G.S. § 160A-175.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 80.99 PENALTIES.
   (A)   Penalty for failure to comply with abatement order.  Any person
failing to comply with an order of abatement issued pursuant to this article,
where no appeal is taken within the prescribed time, or after ratification of
the order on appeal, shall be subject to a civil penalty in the amount of $50
per day for so many days as the person remains in violation until such date as
the nuisance is abated, up to a maximum of ten days.
   (B)   Penalty for second and subsequent violations. Upon second and
subsequent violations of the same provision of this chapter by a person within
12 months of that person receiving a notice of violation under this chapter, a
civil penalty of $100 shall be assessed upon the issuance of the notice of
violation. If the nuisance is not abated within the prescribed time period, the
person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of up to $500. In
addition, the offender shall be subject to a civil penalty in the amount of
$100 per day for so many days as the person remains in violation until such
date as the nuisance is abated, up to a maximum of ten days. For purposes of
this division, the “same provision” of this chapter means any one of §§
80.05(A) through (O) of this chapter; and a violation of any of the subparts of
§
80.05(F) shall be considered a violation of the same provision (that is, §
80.05(F)) of this chapter.
   (C)   Appeal of civil penalty. An appeal of a civil penalty must be filed in
writing with the Town Manager within ten days after service of a written demand
for payment. The written appeal shall provide the reasons the petitioner
contends that the civil penalty was wrongly applied and any supporting
documentation.
      (1)   Within ten days of receiving a request for review, the Town Manager
shall hold a hearing to review the civil penalty. At this hearing, all
interested persons shall be heard and may offer evidence and be represented by
an attorney. The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner and the rules
of evidence shall not apply; provided, that the decision of the Town Manager
shall be based upon substantial and reliable evidence. The Town Manager may
reduce the penalty if the Town Manager determines that:
         (a)   The appellant has acted in good faith; and
         (b)   The failure of the appellant to correct a violation is the
result of circumstances beyond the appellant's control; or
         (c)   There are other circumstances which make the amount of the
presumptive civil penalty unfair in that particular case.
      (2)   Rather than reviewing an appeal, the Town Manager, in his or her
sole discretion, may for good cause refer the review of a civil penalty to the
Town Council.

   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the registered owner or person entitled to
possession of a vehicle, or for the owner, lessee or occupant of the real
property upon which the vehicle is located to leave or allow the vehicle to

(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 81.05 REMOVAL OF ABANDONED OR NUISANCE VEHICLES; PRE-TOWING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Except as set forth in §
81.06, an abandoned or nuisance vehicle that is to be removed shall be towed at
the direction of the town only after notice to the registered owner or person
entitled to possession of the vehicle. In the case of a nuisance vehicle, if
the names and mailing addresses of the registered owner or person entitled to
the possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee or occupant of the real
property upon which the vehicle is located, can be ascertained in the exercise
of reasonable diligence, notice to remove the vehicle within 15 days from
receipt of the notice shall be given by certified mail or by hand delivery by
the appropriate authorizing official. The person who mails or hand delivers the
notice shall retain a written record to show the names and addresses to which
the notice was mailed or delivered and the date of such mail or delivery.
   (B)   If such names and addresses cannot be ascertained or if the vehicle to
be removed is an abandoned vehicle, or if notice attempted in accordance with
division (A) above is refused by addressee, notice shall be given by affixing
on the windshield or some other conspicuous place on the vehicle a notice
indicating that the vehicle will be removed by the town no sooner than 15 days
for a nuisance vehicle, or seven days for an abandoned vehicle, after the
notice is affixed or mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by the owner or legal
possessor prior to that time. Notice may be given in such a manner concurrently
with notice given in accordance with subdivision (A) above, even where such
notice is properly given and accepted by the addressee.
   (C)   With respect to abandoned or nuisance vehicles for which notice is
required to be given, if the registered owner or person entitled to possession
does not remove the vehicle but chooses to appeal the determination that the
vehicle is an abandoned or nuisance vehicle, such appeal shall be made in
writing and delivered to the Town Manager within seven days of the owner's
receipt of notice of removal. The appeal shall be heard by the Town Manager
within ten days of receipt of the appeal. Further proceedings to remove the
vehicle shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and decided. In the event the
owner or person entitled to possession fails to reasonably pursue the appeal,
the appeal shall be deemed abandoned and the vehicle ordered removed.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 81.06 EXCEPTIONS TO PRIOR NOTICE REQUIREMENT.
   The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an abandoned or
nuisance vehicle may, as determined by the authorizing official, be omitted in
those circumstances where there is special need for prompt action to eliminate
a traffic obstruction or otherwise maintain and protect the public safety and
welfare. Such findings shall be entered by the authorizing official in the
appropriate daily records. Circumstances justifying the removal of a vehicle
without prior notice include:
   (A)   Vehicles abandoned on the streets. For a vehicle left on the public
streets and highways, a law enforcement officer may determine that immediate
removal of such vehicle is warranted if the vehicle is:
      (1)   Obstructing traffic;
      (2)   Parked in violation of an ordinance prohibiting or restricting
parking;
      (3)   Parked in a no stopping or standing zone;
      (4)   Parked in a loading zone;
      (5)   Parked in a bus zone; or
      (6)   Parked in violation of temporary parking restrictions imposed under
any state or local law.
   (B)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles. With respect to an abandoned or
nuisance vehicle left on property other than the streets and highways, such a
vehicle may be removed without giving prior notice only in circumstances where
the authorizing official finds a special need for prompt action to protect and
maintain the public health, safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not
of limitation, such circumstances include those in which a vehicle is blocking
or obstructing ingress or egress to a businesses or residence, poses a traffic
hazard, or is causing damage to public property or to the private property of
another.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 81.07 RESPONSIBILITY FOR COSTS OF REMOVAL.
   (A)   Owner responsible for removal costs. Except as provided at division
(B), if an abandoned vehicle or nuisance vehicle is removed by or at the
direction of the town, the vehicle owner shall pay all reasonable costs
incidental to the removal and storage of such vehicle and incidental to
locating the owner thereof.
   (B)   Town to pay costs of removing nuisance vehicles in certain cases. If a
vehicle is declared to be a nuisance vehicle, the property owner may, upon
written request and waiver of any claim for damages, request that the town
remove the vehicle at no expense. In order to have a vehicle removed at no
expense to the property owner, a signed consent form and vehicle title of
ownership must be given to the town and the towing company. If the above-stated
requirements are not provided to the town, civil penalties shall be issued for
a maximum of 10 days for each day the vehicle remains in violation. If the
vehicle remains on the property in excess of 10 days, the violation and civil
penalties may be handled as a civil action in small claims court and the
vehicle may be ordered to be removed from the property.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 81.08 REMOVAL OF VEHICLES; POST-TOWING NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Any abandoned or nuisance vehicle which has been ordered to be removed
may, as directed by the town, be removed to a storage garage or area by the tow
truck operator or towing business contracting to perform such services for the
town. In accordance with G.S. § 20-219.11, whenever such a vehicle is removed,
the authorizing official shall immediately notify the last known registered
owner of the vehicle, such notice shall include the following:
      (1)   The description of the removed vehicle;
      (2)   The location where the vehicle is stored;
      (3)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;
      (4)   The procedure the owner must follow to redeem the vehicle; and
      (5)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable cause
hearing on the removal.
   (B)   If the vehicle has a North Carolina registration plate or
registration, notice shall be given to the owner within 24 hours; if the
vehicle is not registered in this state, notice shall be given to the owner
within 72 hours from the removal of the vehicle. This notice shall, if
feasible, be given by telephone. Whether or not the owner is reached by
telephone, notice shall be mailed to his last known address unless he or his
agent waives this notice in writing.
   (C)   Whenever an abandoned or nuisance vehicle is removed, and such vehicle
has no valid registration or registration plates, the authorizing official
shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the vehicle identification
number, to determine the last known registered owner of the vehicle and to
notify him or her of the information set forth in divisions (A)(1) through (A)
(5) of this section.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 81.09 RIGHT TO PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING BEFORE SALE OR FINAL DISPOSITION OF THE
VEHICLE.
   (A)   After the removal of an abandoned vehicle or nuisance vehicle, the
owner or any person entitled to possession is entitled to a hearing for the
purpose of determining if probable cause existed for removing the vehicle as
provided at G.S. § 20-219.11. A request for hearing must be filed in writing
with the county magistrate designated by the chief district court judge to
receive such hearing requests. The magistrate will set the hearing within 72
hours of receipt of the request, and the hearing will be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of G.S. § 20-219.11.
   (B)   The only issue at this hearing is whether or not probable cause
existed for the towing. If the magistrate finds that probable cause did exist,
the tower's lien continues. If the magistrate finds that probable cause did not
exist, the tower's lien is extinguished.
   (C)   Any aggrieved party may appeal the magistrate's decision to district
court.
   (D)   The town shall pay the towing and storage charges if the court's final
decision is that no probable cause existed for the tow.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 81.10 REDEMPTION OF VEHICLE DURING PROCEEDINGS.
   Unless such vehicle is being detained by police as evidence, in accordance
with G.S. § 20-219.12 the vehicle owner may obtain possession of a removed
vehicle by paying the towing fee, including any storage charges, or by posting
a bond for double the amount of such fees and charges to the tow truck operator
or towing business having custody of the removed vehicle.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 81.11 SALE AND DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED VEHICLE.

or tow truck operator may dispose of any vehicle without holding it for any
prescribed period of time.

period of at least 30 days, during which time the owner may claim it by
exhibiting proof of ownership to the town or towing business having custody of
the vehicle and by paying the costs incidental to its towing and storage. After
being held for 30 days, a vehicle may be sold in accordance with the provisions
of G.S. §§ 44A-4, 44A-5, and 44A-6, provided that, if the town is responsible
for collecting towing or removal fees, no hearing in addition to the probable
cause hearing described in §
81.09 shall be required. If no one purchases the vehicle at the sale, and if
the value of the vehicle is less than the amount of the lien, the town may
destroy the vehicle.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 81.12 CONDITIONS ON REMOVAL OF VEHICLES FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   As a general policy, the town will not remove a vehicle from private
property if the owner, occupant or lessee of such property could have the
vehicle removed under applicable law. In no case will a vehicle be removed by
the town from private property without a written request of the owner, occupant
or lessee, except in those cases where a vehicle is a nuisance vehicle which
has been ordered removed by the code enforcement officer. The town may require
any person requesting the removal of an abandoned or nuisance vehicle from
private property to indemnify the town against any loss, expense or liability
incurred because of its removal, storage or sale.

82.99   Enforcement; penalties
§ 82.01 STATEMENT OF POLICY; INTERPRETATIONS.
   (A)   Statement of policy. It is the policy of the Town of Boone to maintain
a peaceful community while recognizing that certain noises are generated by the
acceptable economic and recreational activity of a vibrant community. The goal
of the town is to encourage such activity while ensuring that time periods
during which many residents are customarily at rest or have an expectation of
peaceful enjoyment of their residences are not disturbed by unacceptable levels
or types of noise.
   (B)   Interpretations and Definitions.  For purposes of this chapter, the
following interpretations and definitions shall apply.
      (1)   When the word REASONABLE is used herein, it shall be evaluated with
reference to the normal expectations for sound during normal waking hours
versus the normal expectations for sound during normal sleeping hours, with a
higher level of sound acceptable during the day and a lower level of sound
acceptable during the night. It shall also be evaluated with reference to the
location involved, with a higher level of noise expected and tolerated if
generated within a business or university district within the town and a lower
level of noise expected and tolerated if generated within a residential
district within the town.
      (2)   A REASONABLE PERSON is one who is moderate, fair and sensible.
Although enforcement of this chapter shall often be the result of a complaint
received by the Town, in each instance where a complaint is received and the
standard of "reasonableness" invoked, a Boone police officer answering the
complaint shall separately determine, based upon his or her investigation and
in light of the circumstances of the situation, whether the noise in question
is at an "unreasonable" level.
      (3)   A person's TEMPORARY OR USUAL PLACE OF ABODE OR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT
shall not include locations on the campus of Appalachian State University and
located in the U-1 zoning district, as they relate to noises which originate
from areas on campus located in the U-1 zoning district.
      (4)   Whether a sound is AUDIBLE WITHIN A PERSON'S TEMPORARY OR USUAL
PLACE OF ABODE shall be determined with one or more windows of the complaining
party open, assuming weather conditions during which it is reasonable and
customary for one or more windows to be open.
      (5)   Noise is DISTURBING if it is perceived by a person of ordinary
sensibilities as interrupting the normal peace and calm of an area.
      (6)   UNREASONABLY LOUD NOISE shall mean noise which is substantially
incompatible with the time and location where created or heard to the extent
that it brings about an actual or imminent interference with peace, rest, or
good order.
(Ord. passed 12-16-2019)
§ 82.02 GENERAL PROHIBITION.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to make, allow, continue or assist
to be made, allowed or continued:
      (1)   Any unreasonably loud noise; or
      (2)   Any noise which unreasonably disturbs, injures, or endangers the
comfort, repose, health, peace, or safety of reasonable persons of ordinary
sensibilities, within the jurisdictional limits of the town; or
      (3)   Any noise which is so harsh, prolonged, unnatural, or unusual in
time or place as to occasion unreasonable discomfort to any persons residing,
visiting or working in the area from which said noises emanate, or as to
unreasonably interfere with the peace and comfort of such residents or their
guests, or operators or customers in places of business, or as to detrimentally
or adversely affect such residences or places of business.
   (B)   Factors for determining whether noise is unreasonably loud or
disturbing include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The proximity of the sound to sleeping facilities, whether
residential or commercial;
      (2)   The proximity of the sound to the noise sensitive areas;
      (3)   The land use, nature, and zoning of the area(s) from which the
sound emanates and the area where it is received or perceived;
      (4)   The time of day or night the sound occurs;
      (5)   The duration of the sound; and
      (6)   Whether the sound is recurrent, intermittent, or constant.
   (C)   Non-applicability within ASU campus areas. This chapter shall not be
enforced with respect to violations alleged to disturb persons located on the
campus of Appalachian State University and in the U-1 zoning district as a
result of noises that originate from areas on campus located in the U-1 zoning
district.

§ 82.05 NOISES THAT GENERALLY DO NOT VIOLATE THIS CHAPTER.
   The following noises and activities are exempt from the provisions of this
chapter unless they produce a risk of serious or unnecessary bodily harm:
   (A)   Town work. The sounds produced by town vehicles, employees and
contractors engaged in:
      (1)   Critical and/or emergency town duties such as removing snow,
repairing damaged water or sewer lines, responding to fires, responding to
vehicle accidents, and the like; or
      (2)   The normal day-to-day operations of the town; provided, that such
activities are exempt only if conducted between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:
00 p.m., unless explicitly authorized by the Town Council following general
notice to the public and a public hearing.
   (B)   Community events.
      (1)   The normal and customary sounds emanating from a non-recurring
community event conducted by a governmental entity, school, church, or similar
non-commercial entity, so long as the event with which the noise is associated
begins no earlier than 6:00 a.m. and ends no later than 10:00 p.m. For purposes
of this paragraph, "non-recurring" shall refer to an event which occurs no more
than four times during any calendar year. However, an event can lose its status
as a community event under this division if multiple complaints from different
sources are received about the noise level emanating from the event, and upon
investigation, the police determine that the noise levels ten feet or more from
the property boundaries of the property upon which the event is conducted, or
with respect to events such as parades which utilize the public streets, ten
feet or more from the curb or edge of the street pavement when no curb exists,
violate the standards set out in §
82.06. If an event loses its status as a "community event" it shall no longer
enjoy the presumption under this section that it does not violate the chapter.
      (2)   Any event or series of events specifically authorized in advance by
the Boone Town Council following general notice to the public and a public
hearing may be allowed as a community event, including one for which noise
exceeding the limits of §
82.06 is predicted, upon a finding that such event provides a benefit to the
citizens of Boone and the public at large which exceeds the potential
detrimental effects of the noise it may generate. Before approving such event
or series of events, the Town Council shall confirm that notice of the public
hearing was posted at least seven days prior to the hearing on the town's
website and in every other place at which the town has posted notice of the
meeting during which the public hearing is to take place. The applicant for
designation as a community event shall provide a schedule of the starting and
ending time of the event, a description of the noise-generating activities
which are expected from the event, a summary of all steps which will be taken
to mitigate any negative noise impacts of the event, and the applicant shall
describe the expected benefits to the citizens of Boone and the public at large
which will be derived from the event.
   (C)   Sporting events associated with Watauga High School or Appalachian
State University. The normal and customary sounds emanating from a sporting
event held on the campus and associated with Watauga High School or Appalachian
State University will not be considered noises or activities which violate this
chapter, so long as the event with which the noise is associated does not begin
prior to 6:00 a.m. and has been scheduled to end by 11:00 p.m., and any crowd
associated with the event is expected to disperse by 11:30 p.m., even if due to
unexpected delays, overtime periods and the like, the event extends past 11:00
p.m. and the crowd does not disperse until after 11:30 p.m. This exemption,
however, does not relieve people leaving such an event from minimizing any loud
talking, shouting, and the like, which may be heard in places of abode in the
vicinity of the event, and should any person fail to heed a request by a Boone
police officer to lower the volume of such noise, that person may be cited and
fined pursuant to §
82.02.
   (D)   Remote vehicle entry or key. The use of a remote vehicle entry or key

(whichever is later) or on weekends between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. or dusk
(whichever is later), so long as the tool is being used for a legitimate
maintenance or construction purpose associated with the property upon which it
is utilized and the person using such tool takes all practical steps to
minimize its disturbing noise impacts on others.
   (F)   Emergency work. Emergency work performed for the purpose of preventing
or alleviating physical trauma or property damage threatened or caused by an
existing or imminent peril. This emergency exception includes maintenance,
backup or upkeep strictly necessary to keep emergency equipment, such as
generators, in operating order. In addition, this exception only applies for
the shortest duration of time reasonably required to address the emergency.
   (G)   Public demonstrations. Noise resulting from parades, lawful picketing
or other public demonstrations protected by the U.S. Constitution or federal
law or for which a permit has been granted by the town, provided that such
demonstrations are held between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. or dusk
(whichever is later) on weekdays, or between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. or dusk
(whichever is later) on weekends.
   (H)   Safety signals. Noise of safety signals, warning devices, and
emergency pressure relief valves, provided such signals are used in a manner

   (B)   Rules for measurement. For purposes of this section, sound shall be
measured using the following rules:
      (1)   Devices used for measurement.  Measurements of decibel levels shall
be made with a sound level meter designated at least as “Type II” meeting ANSI
S1.4-1971 requirements (referring to “American National Standard Specification
for Sound Level Meters,” Acoustical Society of America, New York, NY)
(hereinafter referred to as "decibel meter").
      (2)   Settings of decibel meter when sound measured.  The sound
measurement shall be made with the decibel meter using the A-weighted scale,
set on “slow” response.
      (3)   Location of measurement. Measurements taken to determine compliance
with this section shall be made at or within ten feet outside any property line
for the property upon which the measured activity is taking place.
      (4)   Duration of measurement to establish violation. In order to
establish a violation of this section, the duration of measurement(s) which
must be registered by the decibel meter must equal or exceed a level
continuously exceeding the established limits for 15 continuous seconds, or for
two or more periods within a 60-second period, each exceeding the established
limits for five continuous seconds.
      (5)   Time of measurement. Except for sounds created or broadcast outside
the commercial establishment or live music venue, and unless the door of a
commercial establishment or live music venue is open for periods exceeding
times needed for normal ingress and egress, such as when a door is propped
open, measurements shall be taken with the door closed.
   (C)   Associated sounds authorized by this section.  So long as the live,
recorded or amplified music does not exceed the limits of this section for
establishing a violation, associated sounds of a commercial establishment or
live music venue, including amplified speech from performers and disc jockeys,
and the customary and expected crowd noises related to a performance, such as
applause, cheering for the performer, conversations among spectators, and
similar sounds, shall not be a basis for finding a violation under this
section.
   (D)   Sounds not authorized by this section.  This section does not excuse
people who have left the premises of a commercial establishment or live music
venue, temporarily or otherwise, from compliance with this chapter. PREMISES
for purposes of this section refers, when such activities are conducted
outdoors, to the borders of the property upon which the live, recorded or
amplified music is created or broadcast. A person, for example, who has left an
indoor music venue to smoke a cigarette on the public sidewalk outside the
venue is subject to the full enforcement of this chapter. Similarly, otherwise
prohibited noise created by an employee of the establishment or live music
venue, such as that caused by depositing empty bottles or cans in recycling
containers in the middle of the night, is not excused by this section, and such
noise production shall subject the offending individual to enforcement in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Responsibility for violation.  The owner of the commercial business
establishment or live music venue shall be responsible for a violation of this
section, or if none can be determined, the owner of the property shall be
responsible. Before the owner of the property is cited, however, the town shall
determine whether there is any current lease of record registered in the
Watauga County Registry, and if so, the lessee or tenant shall stand in the
place of the owner and shall be responsible. An entity such as a limited
liability company or corporation may not evade responsibility for repeat
violations by altering its structure, and if there is any identity or overlap
between the ownership, membership, or shareholders of a cited sole
proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, or other
entity, and the ownership, membership or shareholders of a subsequently cited
sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, or
other entity operating in the same location, or in the case of the outdoor
emission of live, recorded or amplified music, in any location within the
corporate limits, the entities shall be considered one and the same.
   (F)   Written notice of warning or violation.  A person or entity
responsible for a violation under this section shall be issued a written
warning or notice of the violation stating the amount of the civil penalty, as
appropriate. Such written notice may be delivered to the person in charge of
the commercial establishment or live music venue at the time of the violation,
or, if none is present, to any employee of the commercial establishment or live
music venue present at the time of the violation. Alternatively or in addition,
in the case of an entity which has an agent for service of process registered
with the North Carolina Secretary of State, a written warning or notice of the
violation may be mailed to such agent at the registered address by regular mail
or certified mail, return receipt requested.

§ 83.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Findings. The town seeks to protect the health and well-being of its
employees and the general public. Secondhand smoke has been proven to cause
cancer, heart disease and asthma attacks in both smokers and non-smokers. In
2006, a report issued by the United States Surgeon General concluded that,
based upon the scientific evidence, there is no risk-free level of exposure to
secondhand smoke. In addition, there is scientific consensus that e-cigarettes
pose substantial risks to both users and other persons exposed to secondhand
vapor and to e-cigarette products, including but not limited to risks
associated with exposure to airborne particulates and toxins, exposure to toxic
e-liquids, and explosion of e-cigarettes. Further, the 2016 Surgeon General’s
Report on E-Cigarette Use on Youth and Young Adults has stated that e-
cigarettes use has become a public health concern and has recommended that e-
cigarettes be included in smoke-free policies.
   (B)   Intent. The town seeks to protect the health and well-being of
children by banning, to the extent possible, smoking in their presence. It is
further the intent of the town to protect the health of all individuals in
public places, places of employment and working in or visiting town buildings
from the risks related to secondhand smoke and vaping. It is further the intent
of the town to protect the health of individuals driving or riding in town-
controlled passenger vehicles assigned permanently or temporarily to town
employees for official town business.
   (C)   Authority. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority provided
in G.S §§ 130A-491 et seq. and § 160A-174(a).

(Ord. passed 4-16-2015)
§ 90.04 PENALTIES; ENFORCEMENT; APPEAL.
   (A)   An alarm user shall be subject to warnings, fines and verified
response status depending on the number of false alarms emitted from an alarm
system within any rolling 180 days period based upon the following schedule:
      (1)   First and second false alarms, warning citation issued with no
fine.
      (2)   Third false alarm, civil citation, $50 fine.
      (3)   Fourth false alarm, civil citation, $100 fine, alarm system placed
on “verified response” status.
      (4)   Fifth and subsequent alarms must be verified before police
notification, $100 fine if false.
   (B)   If cancellation occurs prior to law enforcement arriving at the scene,
that is not a false alarm for the purpose of warnings or fines and no fines
will be assessed.
   (C)   Notifications of warnings and fines will be made via Town of Boone
civil citation and left with an alarm user, responding key holder, posted on
the alarm site, or delivered in a similar manner at a later date. Fines, when
applicable, are payable 30 days from the date of issuance.
   (D)   Notifications that an alarm system has been placed on “verified
response” status will be delivered in the form of the citation as well as a
notification letter delivered electronically, by regular mail, or in person, to
the alarm user or a key holder. The associated fine is payable 30 days from the
date of citation issuance. An alarm user who receives notification that their
alarm system is in verified response status must notify their alarm company of
this condition in order to prevent the alarm company form contacting law
enforcement unless the validity of the alarm is independently verified.
   (E)   A alarm system placed on “verified response” will remain in that
status until all outstanding fines are paid and the alarm user delivers to the
Chief of Police documentation of correction of any problem condition.
Documentation may take the form of a letter from the alarm user and/or a letter
from an alarm company that provided service in response to false alarms. The
Chief of Police will review the provided documentation and notify the alarm
user of additional steps necessary or of removal from verified response status.
   (F)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to the civil penalties set forth. Any violation of this chapter shall
be deemed a non-criminal violation and shall not be a misdemeanor or infraction
pursuant to G.S. § 14-4 or §
10.99 of the Town of Boone Code of Ordinances.
   (G)   If payment is not received or equitable settlement reached within 180
days after demand for payment is made, the matter shall be referred to the Town
Attorney for initiation of a civil action in the name of the town in the
appropriate division of the general court of justice of Watauga County for
recovery of the penalty. In the event it is necessary for the town to institute
a civil action to collect a civil penalty for the violation of any provision of
any town ordinance, the offender shall pay all court costs, including filing
fees, fees for service of process, and other expenses incurred in the
litigation, such as costs of depositions, copying expenses and charges, and
reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the town.
   (H)   An alarm user may appeal the assessment of a fine or verified response
status to the Chief of Police. The filing of an appeal with the Chief of Police
stays the assessment of the fine or suspension until a final decision is made.
The alarm user shall file a written appeal to the Chief of Police by setting
forth the reasons for the appeal within ten days after receipt of notification
of a false alarm. The Chief of Police will deliver a decision to the alarm user
in writing.
   (I)   Businesses, such as financial institutions and other establishments,
which utilize robbery or panic alarms, will not be placed on “verified
response” status. Established robbery alarm response protocol will be followed.
However, the civil fine schedule listed above will apply to false robbery,
panic, and/or hold-up alarms.

from the State Department of Insurance (I.S.O.); and practices of the town's
Public Works Department. The primary goals of the policy are to attain adequate
fire protection of life and property, set forth an orderly development of a
fire hydrant protection system and set forth the guidelines and rules for the
fire hydrant protection system. This policy will be made available to all
persons by the Fire Department upon request. It is recommended that all persons
who wish to locate business or residential properties in the jurisdiction of
the town request a copy of this policy prior to application for building
permits.
   (B)   New development; building renovations, additions and changes of use.
      (1)   The following guidelines shall apply to new buildings for which a
building permit is required, new subdivisions, or any new commercial,
industrial or residential construction project.
         (a)   The Fire Department shall review all new development building
plans to determine fire hydrant protection requirements for the proposed
development. Sufficient information as required by the Fire Department shall be
submitted to determine the criteria for water flow quantity and hydrant number,
location and spacing.
         (b)   Hydrants shall be installed in accordance with this Chapter and
Chapter 50 of this code and shall be available for service prior to the
beginning of building construction except as specifically provided in this
section.
         (c)   For new subdivisions where a performance guarantee is accepted
for completion of water utilities in lieu of actual completion of the utility
work prior to acceptance of the final plat, single-family dwelling construction
may begin without hydrants and water mains being ready for service.
Construction sites shall be limited so as not to cause an undue fire hazard,
with the Fire Department being notified prior to the beginning of each
construction. No dwelling shall be occupied until all fire protection
requirements have been met and are ready for service. For those new
subdivisions where water mains are not available, the Fire Department may
approve alternative fire protection measures, which may include but are not
limited to draft points, proper road construction to allow for tanker
operations, water fill points and the like.
         (d)   Hydrants shall be installed at the expense of the owner or
developer of the development served by the hydrant, including, but not limited
the expense of:
            1.   Extension of town-owned water lines in order to provide
service for the new development as required by this policy;
            2.   Addition of fire hydrants to existing water lines;
            3.   Private fire lines; and
            4.   Upgrading of existing lines to provide the necessary water
flow capacity for the building or project.
      (2)   In the case of building additions, renovations, changes of use and
the like, the existing water system may be deemed adequate for the existing
building if there are hydrants with flow certified as adequate by the Fire
Department. If changes to the building require additional water flow
requirements to meet Fire Code requirements, the owner or developer shall
provide and bear the expense of such additional capacity.
   (C)   Existing development. The following guidelines shall apply to existing
industrial, commercial and multi-family residential buildings and subdivisions.
      (1)   The Fire Department shall determine areas in public rights of way
that are deficient in fire hydrant protection. A plan of correction shall be
developed in accordance with monies available.
      (2)   Where existing development poses a danger to life and property due
to fire hydrant deficiencies existing on private property, the Fire Department
may require the deficiency to be corrected in such fashion and time as it may
direct. Any associated expense shall be borne by the owner of the development.
   (D)   Required fire flow.
      (1)   The water flow available for fire protection (“fire flow”) required
to provide adequate fire protection in the town will be determined in
accordance with Chapter 50 of this code. The required fire flow must assure
sufficient water flow for fire protection while also maintaining normal usage
for other water users in the area without interruption or damage to other
users' systems.
      (2)   Fire flow requirements may be increased by the Fire Department to
account for any condition that may warrant an increase in fire flow to provide
adequate fire protection, including but not limited to factors such as the
siting of adjacent buildings, storage of hazardous materials, occupancy
classification, etc.
      (3)   Four-hour fire separation walls may be considered as dividing a
building into separate fire areas for the purpose of determining fire flow. For
purposes of this section, a “fire area” is the total floor area in square feet
for all floor levels within the exterior walls or under the horizontal
projection of the roof of a building.
      (4)   The minimum fire-flow requirements for one- and two-family
dwellings shall be 1,000 GPM, except that this requirement may be reduced by
50% if the building is equipped with an approved sprinkler system.
      (5)   The minimum fire flow requirement for buildings other than one- or
two-family dwellings may be reduced by 50% if the building is equipped with an
approved sprinkler system. However, the flow requirement shall not be reduced
below the requirements of the sprinkler system as determined per NFPA 13.
      (6)   Hydrants installed to meet the provisions of the fire flow
requirements shall be calculated at providing 1,500 GPM each. If the required
fire flow does not exceed the hydrant flow calculation by 500 GPM or more, then
an additional hydrant shall not be required.
      (7)   A hydrant is required within 100 feet of each connection to an
approved sprinkler system requiring Fire Department hose connection.
      (8)   Additional hydrants may be required as necessary for adequate fire
protection of a building due to accessibility limitations or other
circumstances.
   (E)   Fire hydrant installation. The following guidelines shall apply to the
installations of all new hydrants and replacements of existing hydrants.
      (1)   Hydrants shall be installed in accordance with
Chapter 50 of this code.
      (2)   Upon completion of installation, each hydrant shall be flushed of
all sediment or debris that may hinder its operation. The caps will then be
greased and the hydrant set ready for service. The Fire Department will then be
notified of the completion of the installation and that the hydrant is in
service and ready for an inspection.
      (3)   All completed hydrant installations must be inspected by the Fire
Department for compliance with all applicable requirements.
      (4)   All hydrants shall be painted to match the existing hydrants in the
town. Unless otherwise specified, this color shall be Top #7216 white
reflective or equivalent and an oil-based red paint for barrel and caps.
   (F)   Hydrant spacing.
      (1)   Hydrants shall be located as close as possible to street
intersections or areas of direct vehicular access. Hydrant spacing may not
exceed 500 feet, and commercial and multi-family developments may require
additional hydrants to compensate for long hose lays and/or greater water
demand.
      (2)   Where possible, hydrants shall be located no closer than 50 feet
from a building, except that if the probable collapse zone of a building
exceeds 50 feet, then hydrants shall be located out of this zone when possible.
      (3)   Hydrants should be located close to street access so as to
facilitate easy hook-up.
      (4)   Hydrants located in areas designated for parking shall be afforded
some type of protection from collision of vehicular traffic. Where a curb
protects the hydrant from normal parking and is marked for no parking, no other
type of protection is needed.
      (5)   Where a hydrant is located on a street with side-street parking, at
least one parking space shall be marked at the hydrant to provide for no
parking. In shopping centers and similar parking areas, at least one parking
space in front of or behind the hydrant (whichever provides access), shall be
designated as no-parking and for Fire Department access only. The area around
the hydrant shall be marked in yellow and designated in letters “No Parking.”
      (6)   A clear space of three feet shall be maintained around the
circumference of fire hydrants, except as otherwise approved by the Fire
Department. Unobstructed access to hire hydrants must be maintained at all
times.
   (G)   Water supply lines for hydrants. Installation of piping for supply of
water to a hydrant or protection system shall be in accordance with Chapter 50
of this code.
      (1)   Hydrants installed on existing water lines will be tested by the
Fire Department to ensure that the existing line can supply an adequate flow of
water as needed per I.S.O. fire flow requirements.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the developer, property owner or
person in charge of the development project to submit plans of construction of
the water lines or hydrant location and spacing to the Fire Department and
Public Works Department for approval prior to installation. All new supply
lines shall be inspected prior to being covered to ensure compliance with the
submitted plans.
      (3)   Once the system is completed, a final inspection will be conducted.
This inspection will also include a flow test to ensure proper fire flow
adequacy.

   (A)   The public ways are valuable public resources that have required, and
will continue to require, substantial investment by the town; and
   (B)   The town desires to structure and implement a fair and orderly process
for the application for, and granting of, authorization for private parties to
occupy and use public ways, consistent with applicable law, and which
appropriately accounts for the varied reasons that private parties seek such
authorization.

public, provide for the orderly and efficient use of the public ways now and in
the future, and preserve adequate capacity for existing and future uses of the

ENCROACHMENTS.
   (A)   Except for minor encroachments, which do not require written
authorization, it shall be a violation of this article for any person to
encroach upon any public way or town property without first receiving written

   (B)   All persons that operate utilities that the town may franchise under
the authority of G.S. 160A-319 shall apply for a franchise to be approved by
the Town Council in accordance with the Town Charter. Authorization to encroach
upon a public way may be granted through the terms of an appropriate franchise
agreement.

encroach shall be granted in appropriate cases through the terms of a non-
exclusive, revocable encroachment permit or encroachment agreement, signed by
the applicant and the Town Manager, using whatever form the town devises and is
approved by the Town Attorney for that purpose.
   (D)   The Administrator shall develop standards and requirements for
authorizations, including but not limited to franchises, licenses, permits, and

Administrator may also develop standards and requirements for doing work in the
public way when an authorization is not required.
   (E)   The Administrator shall charge such fees as are authorized by the Town
Council for applications for authorizations; review of information and plans;
issuance of authorizations; inspections and re-inspections; maintenance of
facilities in the public way; and for any other town review, oversight, or
administration of proposed, ongoing, or completed activities within the purview
of this chapter. The Administrator may allow persons to establish and fund

a public way shall be exercised by the Administrator. In the Administrator's
discretion, however, any application for authorization to encroach may be
submitted to the Town Council for review and decision, with or without a

§ 96.029 FACTORS FOR REVIEW OF APPLICATION TO ENCROACH.
   (A)   In deciding whether to grant any application for authorization to
encroach upon any public way, the Administrator may consider such factors as it
deems appropriate and in the public interest, provided such factors are
consistent with applicable law, including without limitation:
      (1)   The willingness and ability of the applicant to meet construction
and physical requirements and to abide by all lawful conditions, limitations,
requirements and policies with respect to the encroachment;
      (2)   The ability of the applicant to maintain the property of the town
in good condition throughout the term of the relevant franchise or encroachment
agreement;
      (3)   Any services or uses of the public ways that may be precluded by
the grant of the requested authorization to encroach, and the adverse impact of
the proposed encroachment on the efficient use of the public streets and street
rights-of-way at present and in the future;
      (4)   The adequacy of the terms and conditions of the proposed
encroachment or franchise agreement to protect the public interest, consistent
with applicable law; and
      (5)   Any other factors or considerations that are deemed pertinent.
   (B)   Consistent with applicable law, the Administrator may develop and
implement policies and requirements to ensure that the public ways have
sufficient capacity reasonably to accommodate existing and future uses in a
rational and efficient manner. In evaluating an applicant for the right to
encroach upon a public way, the Administrator may consider an applicant's
proposals for addressing capacity needs and compliance with town policies and
requirements in that regard.
(Ord. passed 9-17-2019)
§ 96.030 INSURANCE AND BONDING REQUIREMENTS, OTHER CONDITIONS.
   Depending upon the extent of an applicant's proposed excavation,
construction or other activities in any public way, the Administrator may
require the applicant to secure and provide documentation of an appropriate
performance bond or letter of credit, and/or insurance covering such activities
pursuant to terms acceptable to the Administrator.
(Ord. passed 9-17-2019)
§ 96.031 RESPONSIBILITIES OF PERSONS GRANTED AUTHORIZATION TO ENCROACH.
   It shall be the responsibility of each person granted authorization to
encroach upon a public way to:
   (A)   Ensure that any excavation, construction or other work done by them or
on their behalf in the relevant public way is performed consistent with the
town's specifications and other requirements for construction activities,
including those relating to restoration.
   (B)   Restore land, utility lines, other improvements, ground cover, and
landscaping disturbed by excavation and construction in the public way to the
standards specified by the town.
      (1)   Where permanent restoration is temporarily impractical because of
weather or other circumstances, temporary restoration may be required.
      (2)   Restoration shall be accomplished within the time approved by the
Administrator.
      (3)   If restoration work proves to be inadequate over time, as
determined in the sole, reasonable discretion of the Administrator, the
encroacher shall perform such additional restoration work as the Administrator
may direct.
      (4)   Inspection and approval by the Administrator immediately after
installation does not constitute a waiver of the town's rights to determine
that the restoration work is not adequate over time and must be remedied.
   (C)   If requested due to a need for the town or its contractors to complete
any work in a public way, temporarily or permanently remove or relocate their
items located below or above the public way.
   (D)   Otherwise comply with the terms of their encroachment permit or
agreement or the encroachment provisions in their franchise agreement, and all
applicable laws, ordinances, resolutions, rules, regulations and other
directives of the town and any federal, state or local governmental authority
having jurisdiction over the person's activities in or near such public way.

§ 96.032 AUTHORITY TO ENCROACH IS NONEXCLUSIVE.
   Any grant of authorization to encroach upon a public way given by the
Administrator pursuant to this article shall be nonexclusive. The town
specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional rights
of access to the public way that it deems appropriate.
(Ord. passed 9-17-2019)
§ 96.033 REMEDIES.
   (A)   In the event that any person encroaches upon a public way without
prior authorization by the Administrator, or violates the conditions by which
authority to do so was granted, or otherwise violates any provision of this
article, the Administrator may, in addition to any other remedies provided by
any other applicable law:
      (1)   Issue an order to the person commanding them to immediately cease
and desist their unpermitted or otherwise wrongful activities in the public
way, and to restore the affected area;
      (2)   Revoke any authorization previously granted for the encroachment;
      (3)   Issue a civil penalty of $500 to each responsible person or $1,000
to each repeat violator; or
      (4)   Any combination of the above-referenced remedies and any other
remedy authorized under G.S. 160A-175.
   (B)   Civil penalties authorized by this section shall be assessed against
each responsible person, including the owner on whose behalf work is being
performed and the contractor who is performing such work. In situations where
evidence is submitted to the Administrator's satisfaction that the work
performed constitutes emergency work, however, the Administrator may waive the
civil penalties. In such emergency situations, the entity performing the
emergency work must apply for the required permit as soon as reasonably
possible and pay the applicable permit fee.
(Ord. passed 9-17-2019)
§ 96.034 RIGHTS OF APPEAL.
   (A)   In cases where the Administrator denies a person's application to
encroach upon a public way, or is willing to grant that request but subject to
conditions or terms the applicant deems to be unsatisfactory, resulting in an
inability to finalize the requisite written authorization, the applicant may
seek review of the Administrator's decision before the Town Council. The
applicant must request a hearing before the Town Council in writing to the
Administrator within ten days of the applicant's notice of the decision at
issue. In such submission, the applicant must identify the issues or
disagreements the applicant has with the relevant decision. In such cases, the
Town Council shall make the final decision, through adoption of an appropriate
resolution.
   (B)   Any person subject to an enforcement action pursuant to §
96.033 above may appeal the enforcement action per §
10.98 of the Town Code.
(Ord. passed 9-17-2019)
§ 96.035 GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF THE PUBLIC WAY.
   The right to perform work or maintain facilities in the public way is
allowed subject to the conditions below, as supplemented by those set forth in
other sections of this chapter, standards adopted by the Administrator, and
requirements contained in an encroachment agreement or other written
authorization.
   (A)   The town does not warrant its legal interest in the public way.
Persons doing work in the public way and users may need to obtain approvals
from persons with property interests in the public way.
   (B)   An authorization does not convey any legal right, title, or interest
in the public way, and may be revoked or amended at will by the town.
   (C)   The town and its officials, officers, and employees are not liable for
any direct, indirect, or consequential damages that may result to private
facilities located in a public way as a result of the town's construction,
installation, inspection, maintenance, or repair of the public way or of public
improvements in the public way.
   (D)   Persons responsible for work in the public way or for items located in
the public way shall pay for all damage that results, directly or indirectly,
from such work or items.
   (E)   Non-enforcement of one or more provisions of an authorization does not
waive the town's right to enforce the provisions of the authorization.
   (F)   An authorization creates no third-party rights against the town.
   (G)   An authorization does not limit the town's exercise of its regulatory,
police, governmental, legislative, or contracting authority, including its
authority to enact and enforce against an authorized encroacher more strict
requirements then were previously applicable to the authorized encroachment. If
the terms of an authorization conflict with the terms of another authorization
or with an ordinance or other regulation adopted by the town, the stricter of
the applicable provisions shall control.
(Ord. passed 9-17-2019)
§ 96.036 EXEMPTIONS.
   The Administrator may exempt the town's contractors or the North Carolina
Department of Transportation (NCDOT) from particular requirements of this
chapter when substantial compliance has been assured or, in the case of NC DOT,
where the need for state infrastructure on town roads, or a joint undertaking
by the town and NC DOT, or the use of state-controlled areas of the public way
makes the application of such requirements unreasonable.
(Ord. passed 9-17-2019)
§ 96.037 COLLOCATION OF SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES IN PUBLIC WAYS.
   (A)   Collocation of small wireless facilities meeting the height
requirements of G.S. 160A-400.55(b) are subject to all requirements of the
town's Uniform Development Ordinance. In addition, small wireless collocations
require written authorization in a form approved by the town and are subject to
all the foregoing provisions of this chapter except where clarified or altered
by the terms of this section. For other small wireless facilities, see division
(B) below.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   Wireless providers may occupy and use the public way to
collocate small wireless facilities to provide wireless services upon, along,
over and under the public way in the town such that such collocations do not
inhibit other utility installations within the public way.
         (b)   The town retains its right to impose fees and charges to the
extent not prohibited by federal and state law.
         (c)   Wireless services providers shall pay taxes for
telecommunications services that are subject to taxation.
         (d)   Small wireless providers shall obtain approvals legally
necessary to use the public way from owners, other than the town, of property
interests in the public way or adjacent to the roadway system located within
the town.
         (e)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed or construed to stop or
limit the town from exercising any regulatory, police, governmental, or
legislative function pursuant to applicable law, which powers include, but are
not limited to, the authority to enact regulations, ordinances, rules, and
orders not prohibited by state or federal law that affect the public way or a
wireless provider's use of the public way.
         (f)   The terms of this section do not permit the wireless services
provider to operate a cable system or to provide cable service, as those terms
are defined by Section 602 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as
amended (47 U.S.C. Section 522), and the wireless services provider agrees that
it will not operate a cable system or provide cable service in the town unless
it obtains authorization from the town.
         (g)   This section only permits the wireless provider, upon obtaining
required approvals and permits, to place small wireless facilities in those
portions of the public way specifically approved by the Administrator.
         (h)   Collocation of small wireless facilities shall commence within
six months of permit issuance and shall be activated for use no later than one
year from the permit issuance date. Failure to commence collocation within six
months of permit issuance shall void said permit. A small wireless facility not
activated within one year of permit issuance shall be considered abandoned and
shall be removed from the public way at the wireless provider's sole expense.
         (i)   No more than 25 small wireless facilities may be included in a
single permit application.
         (j)   For general public safety and design purposes, documentation of
compliance with the structural, operational, and insurance requirements for
wireless communication facilities as found in the Unified Development Ordinance
shall be required for all small wireless facility installations, unless
superseded by this section.
         (k)   Historic preservation requirements of the Unified Development
Ordinance shall apply to all permit applications, as applicable.
      (2)   Requirements for new poles.
         (a)   If possible, poles shall be designed to accommodate small
wireless facilities for multiple wireless services providers.
         (b)   Poles shall be located a minimum of 15 feet from any tree,
measured to the tree-trunk center. Additionally, 80% of the root protection
zone shall remain undisturbed. The root protection zone shall either be a six-
foot radius around the tree or a one-foot radius for every inch of tree
diameter at breast height, whichever is greater. This minimum separation shall
not apply for a new pole that replaces an existing pole, where the new pole is
installed in the same place as, or immediate vicinity of, the existing pole.
         (c)   Poles shall be designed and installed with materials and
appearance consistent with existing poles in the adjacent public way, unless
materials and appearance are prescribed by other ordinance, law, or town
requirements.
         (d)   To the extent practicable, all accessory cables and equipment
shall be installed within the pole and/or placed underground per Town Code and
Unified Development Ordinance undergrounding requirements. If any equipment
cannot be installed underground, then it shall be installed on or at the base
of the pole and concealed with skirting compatible with, and integrated into,
the design of the pole.
      (3)   Pedestrian and vehicular movement requirements.
         (a)   No small wireless facility, structure, or associated equipment
shall impede or interfere with pedestrian or vehicular movement, circulation,
or visibility. Specifically, no small wireless facility, structure, or
associated equipment shall:
            1.   Extend into an existing or proposed sidewalk or walkway,
trail, bicycle parking area unless such extension provides at least eight feet
vertical clearance;
            2.   Extend into an existing or proposed driveway, or vehicular
parking area unless such extension provides at least 15 feet vertical
clearance.
            3.   Extend into any motor vehicle travel lane.
         (b)   No new installation shall be installed within sight distance
triangles pursuant to the requirements of this chapter and the Unified
Development Ordinance.
         (c)   Installations that replace existing poles or collocate onto
existing facilities already located within sight distance triangles shall not
locate or install equipment that diminishes visibility relative to existing
conditions. This requirement can be waived pursuant to Unified Development
Ordinance standards for alternative dimensions.
      (4)    Information required. Prior to applying for authorization to
install any portion of its small wireless facilities, a wireless provider shall
provide the following information to the Administrator in addition to what is
normally required for approval of an encroachment:
         (a)   The identity and corporate form of the wireless provider and
affiliates who will perform work in the town's public way;
         (b)   The name and contact information for the officer, agent, or
employee of the wireless provider responsible for communications with the town;
         (c)   A statement as to whether the services provided are
telecommunications services taxed under G.S. 105-164.4(a)(4c) or are video
programming taxed under G.S. 105-164.4(a)(6); and
         (d)   Attestation that small wireless facilities will be collocated on
the utility pole, town utility pole, or wireless support structure, and that
the small wireless facilities shall be activated for use by a wireless provider
to provide service no later than one year from the permit issuance date.
      (5)   Relocation of facilities.
         (a)   Wireless providers shall, at no cost to the town, relocate or
remove portions of its small wireless facilities located in the public way in
the event the public way is closed, or if the Administrator, in the
Administrator's sole discretion, determines that the location of a small
wireless facility interferes with the efficient provision of utility services
to town residents, or interferes with public safety and welfare, or conflicts
with any highway, sidewalk, trail, or utility project, or that the public way
can be better or more efficiently utilized by the removal and relocation or
consolidation of certain existing facilities. The Administrator shall provide
the wireless provider 180 days' written notice prior to the required relocation
or removal of small wireless facilities.
         (b)   Except in the case of emergency repairs, before the wireless
provider constructs, installs, upgrades, repairs or removes small wireless
facilities along a portion of the public way, wireless providers shall provide
notice to the Administrator per §
96.028.
      (6)   Construction, inspection, restoration, and removal. 
         (a)   At the Administrator's request, as built maps in such further
detail as the Administrator may require shall be provided no more than 60 days
following the conclusion of construction.
         (b)   Wireless providers will advise the Administrator of any
significant discrepancy between construction plans and actual construction.
         (c)   Wireless providers shall advise the Administrator if, during
construction of small wireless facilities, such construction is within six feet
of any water or sewer facilities.
         (d)   Engineering, construction and as-built documents shall be
provided in hard copy (paper) and/or electronic copy as requested by the
Administrator.
         (e)   In addition to design maps and as-built maps, wireless providers
shall provide such other information regarding existing facilities in the
public way, in such detail, as the Administrator may require.
         (f)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable federal,
state and local regulations, such as the National Electrical Code, National
Electrical Safety Code, fiber optic cable installation specifications, 1987
telecommunication industry committee standards, traffic safety/lane closure
rules and construction requirements promulgated by the town and the North
Carolina Department of Transportation as amended.
         (g)   The Administrator may inspect the small wireless facilities and
restoration work performed by the wireless provider.
         (h)   The wireless provider shall notify the Administrator when it has
completed each permitted portion of its small wireless facilities; or at such
other time the Administrator requests. Following inspection, the wireless
provider shall make any corrections necessary to bring the permitted
installation into conformance with town requirements.
         (i)   The Administrator may approve the performance of repair or
emergency work without issuance of a permit. When it is impossible for wireless
provider to give the Administrator notice of repair work because of the
unexpected, emergency nature of such work, wireless provider may perform such
work provided notice is given to the Administrator as promptly as possible
after the commencement of such work and a permit request is submitted
retroactively or within two working days.
      (7)   Processing of applications.
         (a)   A small wireless permit application shall be deemed complete
unless the Administrator provides notice otherwise in writing to the applicant
within 30 days of submission or within some other mutually agreed upon time
frame. The notice shall identify the deficiencies in the application which, if
cured, would make the application complete. The application shall be deemed
complete on resubmission if the additional materials cure the deficiencies
identified.
         (b)   The application shall be deemed approved if the Administrator
fails to approve or deny the application within 45 days from the time the
application is deemed complete or within some other mutually agreed upon time
frame between the Administrator and the applicant.
         (c)   1.   The Administrator may deny an application only on the basis
that it does not meet one or more of the following:
               A.   The town's applicable codes;
               B.   Local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety, objective design standards for decorative utility poles, city utility
poles, or reasonable and nondiscriminatory stealth and concealment
requirements, including screening or landscaping for ground-mounted equipment;
               C.   Public safety and reasonable spacing requirements
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment in a right-of-way; or
               D.   Historic preservation requirements.
            2.   The Administrator must document the basis for a denial and
send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the Administrator
denies an application. The applicant may seek to cure the deficiencies
identified by the Administrator and resubmit the application within 30 days of
the denial without paying an additional application fee. The Administrator
shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days of the date on
which the application was resubmitted. Any subsequent review shall be limited
to the deficiencies cited in the prior denial.
         (d)   In the event of a consolidated application for multiple facility
collocations, the Administrator may remove and treat separately any facility
collocations:
            1.   For which incomplete information has been provided; or
            2.   That are denied.
      (8)   Collocation of small wireless facilities on town utility poles.
         (a)   Request to collocate on town utility pole. The Administrator
shall grant non-exclusive authorizations for collocations of small wireless
facilities on town utility poles consistent with such terms, fees and
conditions as Town Council may adopt consistent with G.S. § 160A-400.56. A
request to collocate on a town utility pole may be denied if there is
insufficient capacity or for reasons of safety, reliability, and generally
applicable engineering principles, and those limitations cannot be remedied by
rearranging, expanding, or otherwise reengineering the facilities at the
reasonable and actual cost of the town to be reimbursed by the wireless
provider. An applicant permitted to collocate on a town utility pole under this
section must demonstrate compliance with applicable safety requirements,
including the National Electrical Safety Code and the applicable rules and
regulations issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
         (b)   Make-ready work. The Administrator shall provide a good-faith
estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable a town utility pole to
support a requested collocation, including pole replacement if necessary,
within 60 days after receipt of a complete application. Make-ready work,
including any pole replacement, shall be completed within 60 days of written
agreement on the cost of the work.
      (9)   Abandonment. Wireless providers shall remove all abandoned small
wireless facilities within 180 days of abandonment. Should the wireless
provider fail to timely remove the abandoned wireless facility, the
Administrator may cause such small wireless facility to be removed and the town
may recover the actual cost of such removal, including legal fees, if any, from
the wireless provider. A small wireless facility shall be deemed abandoned at
the earlier of the date that the wireless provider indicates that it is
abandoning such facility or the date that is 180 days after the date that such
small wireless facility ceases to transmit a signal, unless the wireless
provider gives the Administrator reasonable evidence that it is diligently
working to place such small wireless facility back in service.
      (10)   Exceptions to application and permitting requirements. No
application or written authorization is required for:
         (a)   Routine maintenance;
         (b)   The replacement of small wireless facilities with small wireless
facilities that are the same size or smaller; or
         (c)   Installation, placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro
wireless facilities that are suspended on cables strung between existing
utility poles or city utility poles in compliance with applicable codes by or
for a communications service provider authorized to occupy the city rights-of-
way and who is remitting taxes under G.S. 105-164.4(a)(4c) or G.S. 105-164.4(a)
(6); provided, however, that written authorization is required for excavations
or other work otherwise required to be permitted under this chapter.
   (B)   All other small wireless facilities shall be subject to all applicable
provisions of this chapter and the Unified Development Ordinance.

Administrator shall consult with the Town Council with respect to the name to
be given to the street. In its discretion, the Town Council may refer the
matter to the Historic Preservation Commission for its recommendation.
(Ord. passed 9-17-2019; Ord. passed - -; Ord. passed 7-13-2021)
§ 96.047 PREREQUISITES TO ACCEPTANCE.
   Streets and the sidewalks, water, sanitary sewer, or storm drainage systems
located within or adjoining them shall be considered for acceptance for
maintenance by the town when the proper width street is dedicated for public
use and a map is recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county,
and the infrastructure is improved in accordance with all applicable town
requirements.
(Ord. passed 9-17-2019)
§ 96.048 STREET CLOSINGS AND RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATIONS.
   (A)    Any persons petitioning the Town Council for permanent closing of a
public street or alley pursuant to G.S. § 160A-299 must pay a non-refundable
fee of $500 upon the filing of the petition. In addition, the petitioner(s)
must pay all costs incurred with respect to a petition submitted under this
section, including but not limited to costs incurred for: (i) the preparation
of required plats, easements, or other legal documents; (ii) publication of
legal notice, the mailing of notices to adjoining property owners, and posting
as required per division (B) below; and (iii) any and all recording fees
associated with a street or alley closure approved pursuant to this section.
The town may require that such costs be paid directly by the petitioner, or the
town may pay the costs and then seek reimbursement from the petitioner.
   (B)   If Town Council determines to consider the proposed street or alley
closure, it shall first adopt a resolution declaring its intent to close the
street or alley and calling a public hearing on the question. The resolution
shall be published once a week for four successive weeks prior to the hearing,
a copy thereof shall be sent by registered or certified mail to all owners of
property adjoining the street or alley as shown on the county tax records, and
a notice of the closing and public hearing shall be prominently posted in at
least two places along the street or alley. If the street or alley is under the
authority and control of the Department of Transportation, a copy of the
resolution shall be mailed to the Department of Transportation.
   (C)   At the public hearing, any person may be heard on the possible street
or alley closure. If it appears to the satisfaction of Town Council after the
hearing that closing the street or alley is not contrary to the public
interest, and that no person owning property in the vicinity of the street or
alley or in the subdivision in which it is located would thereby be deprived of
reasonable means of ingress and egress to that person's property, the Council
may adopt an order closing the street or alley. A certified copy of the order
shall be filed in the office of the Watauga County Register of Deeds.
   (D)    Upon the closing of a street or alley in accordance with this
section, subject to the provisions of divisions (G) and (H) of this section,
all right, title, and interest in the right-of-way shall be conclusively
presumed to be vested in those persons owning lots or parcels of land adjacent
to the street or alley, and the title of such adjoining landowners, for the
width of the abutting land owned by them, shall extend to the centerline of the
street or alley. However, the provisions of this division may be altered as to
a particular street or alley closing by the assent of all such adjoining
landowners taking title to a closed street or alley by the filing of a plat
which shows the street or alley closing and the portion of the closed street or
alley to be taken by each owner. The plat shall be signed by all adjoining
landowners who, under the first sentence of this division, has an ownership
right in the closed street or alley.
   (E)   This section shall apply to any street or public alley within the town
that has been irrevocably dedicated to the public, without regard to whether it
has actually been opened. This section also applies to unopened streets or
public alleys that are shown on plats but that have not been accepted or
maintained by the town, provided that this section shall not abrogate the
rights of a dedicator, or those claiming under a dedicator, pursuant to G.S.
136-96.
   (F)   No street or alley under the control of the Department of
Transportation may be closed unless the Department of Transportation consents
thereto.
   (G)   The town may reserve a right, title, and interest in any improvements
or easements within a street closed pursuant to this section. An easement under
this division shall include utility, drainage, pedestrian, landscaping,
conservation, or other easements considered by the town to be in the public
interest. The reservation of an easement under this division shall be stated in
the order of closing. The reservation also extends to utility improvements or
easements owned by private utilities which at the time of the street closing
have a utility agreement or franchise with the town.
   (H)   The town may retain utility easements, both public and private, in
cases of streets withdrawn under G.S. 136-96. To retain such easements, the
Town Council shall, after public hearing, approve a “declaration of retention
of utility easements” specifically describing such easements. Notice by
certified or registered mail shall be provided to the party withdrawing the
street from dedication under G.S. 136-96 at least five days prior to the
hearing. The declaration must be passed prior to filing of any plat or map or
declaration of withdrawal with the register of deeds. Any property owner filing
such plats, maps, or declarations shall include the town's declaration with the
declaration of withdrawal and shall show the utilities retained on any map or
plat showing the withdrawal.

property and town-maintained public rights-of-way in the downtown area,
including all streets and sidewalks maintained by the town (and regardless of
whether or not such public rights of way are within the boundaries of private
parcels). This chapter is not intended to regulate private property that is not
subject to public rights-of-ways, such as private parking lots.
   (C)   When special events are held in the downtown area, the Town Manager
(or designee) may, in the town manager's discretion, determine that street
vending shall not be allowed under this chapter but instead will be prohibited
or will be allowed only as permitted by the sponsor(s) of the special event.
SPECIAL EVENTS for purposes of this provision shall include all town-sponsored
parades, Boone Boo, Boonerang, and any other event determined by the Town
Manager to constitute a special event for purposes of this section.

   Street vendors may not sell the following:

vendor must keep upon the vendor's person (to display if requested) evidence
demonstrating that the items are vintage.
   (B)   Vendors may not cook food using a heat source (e.g., boil, roast,

   (B)   The Town Manager (or designee) shall, in the Town Manager's
discretion, determine the specific vending stand locations and dimensions that
will be allowed and any other appropriate rules or limitations that shall
govern the usage of such vending sites. In exercising this discretion, the Town
Manager shall see to it that the sidewalks are kept clear for pedestrian use as
provided at
Ch. 96 of this code, shall protect the planting areas of the Post Office, shall
require that vendors provide waste receptacles as necessary for wastes
generated by their operations, protect the sightliness of the area, and
otherwise exercise the Town Manager's (or designee's) discretion to protect the
public's use and enjoyment of the area. Such rules may include a system for
assignment of vending sites (e.g., sign-up and/or lottery) if circumstances
(such as excessive competition for sites) warrant. Sites at the Post Office may
be changed or removed from availability in the Town Manager's discretion, and
applicable rules otherwise modified, without advance notice to any permitted
vendor.

§ 151.46 INSPECTIONS OF MULTI-FAMILY DWELLINGS; PERIODIC INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, the Housing
Inspector may make periodic inspections only when there is reasonable cause to
believe that unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise hazardous or unlawful conditions
may exist in a residential building or structure. However, when the Housing
Inspector determines that a safety hazard exists in one of the dwelling units
within a multi-family building, which in the opinion of the Housing Inspector
poses an immediate threat to the occupant, the Housing Inspector may inspect,
in the absence of a specific complaint and actual knowledge of the unsafe
condition, additional dwelling units in the multi-family building to determine
if that same safety hazard exists. In conducting inspections authorized under
this section, the Housing Inspector shall not discriminate between single-
family and multi-family buildings or between owner-occupied and tenant-occupied
buildings. In exercising this power, the Housing Inspector shall have a right
to enter on any premises within its jurisdiction at all reasonable hours for
the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action, upon presentation of
proper credentials. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit

evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in
administrative hearings before the Housing Inspector.

§ 151.48 SERVICE OF ORDER, CONTENTS.
    If, after the notice and an administrative hearing, the Housing Inspector
determines that the structure under consideration is unfit for human habitation
and/or an unsafe abandoned structure in accordance with the standards herein
set forth, the Housing Inspector shall state in writing his or her findings of
fact in support of the determination, and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner thereof one of the following orders, as appropriate:
   (A)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling or unsafe
abandoned structure (sometimes referenced herein collectively as "structure"),
bringing it up to the standards described herein, can be made at a cost less
than 50% of the present value of the building, the order shall require the
owner, within a specified period of time, to repair, alter or improve the
structure so as to render it fit for human habitation, or it shall require the
owner within the specified time therein, to repair, alter or improve the
structure so as to render it safe. The order may require that the structure be
vacated and closed only if continued occupancy during the time allowed for
repair will present a significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account
the nature of the necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current
state of the structure; and any additional risks due to the presence and
capacity of minors under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental
disabilities. The order shall state that the failure to make timely repairs as
directed in the order shall make the structure subject to the issuance of an
order under §
151.49 below.
   (B)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the structure, bringing it
up to the standards described herein cannot be made at a cost of less than 50%
of the present value of the structure, the order shall require the owner,
within a specified period of time, to either repair, alter or improve the
structure so as to bring it into compliance with the standard described herein,
or to demolish and remove the structure. The order may require that the
structure be vacated and closed only if continued occupancy during the time
allowed for repair will present a significant threat of bodily harm, taking
into account the nature of the necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements;
the current state of the structure; and any additional risks due to the
presence and capacity of minors under the age of 18 or occupants with physical
or mental disabilities. The order shall state that the failure to make timely
repairs as directed in the order shall make the structure subject to the
issuance of an order under §
151.49 below. If the structure is a designated local landmark or located in a
historic district of the town, the Housing Inspector shall notify the Historic
District Commission, and the Historic District Commission shall, after
providing proper notice, hold an administrative hearing to determine if the
structure is of particular significance or value toward maintaining the
character of the district and if the structure is determined to be of
particular significance or value, the order may require that the structure be
vacated and closed consistent with G.S. § 160D-949.
   (C)   The Housing Inspector shall ensure that any order issued under this
section that concerns a designated landmark or a structure within a designated
historic district is consistent with and follows the procedures and standards
applicable to such designated landmark and/or within the designated historic
district under the town's unified development ordinance.
(Ord. passed 7-21-2016; Ord. PL05268-110121, passed 12-8-2021)
§ 151.49 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   Repair, closing, and posting. If the owner fails to comply with an
order to repair, alter or improve, or to vacate and close a dwelling or unsafe
abandoned structure, the Housing Inspector may cause the structure to be
repaired, altered or improved, or to be vacated and closed, and the Housing
Inspector may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling so closed
a placard with the following words: "This building [or structure] is unfit for
human habitation [and/or unsafe]; the use or occupation of this building [or
structure] for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful." Occupation of a
structure so posted shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor. The duties of the
Housing Inspector set forth in this division shall not be exercised until the
Town Council shall have by ordinance ordered the Housing Inspector to proceed
to effectuate the purpose of this chapter with respect to the particular
property or properties that the Housing Inspector shall have found to be unfit
for human habitation or an unsafe abandoned structure, and which property or
properties shall be described in the ordinance. This ordinance shall be
recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds in the county where the
property or properties are located and shall be indexed in the name of the
property owner in the grantor index.
   (B)   Demolition. If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or
demolish a dwelling or an unsafe abandoned structure, the Housing Inspector may
cause such structure to be removed or demolished. The duties of the Housing
Inspector set forth in this division shall not be exercised until the Town
Council shall have by ordinance ordered the Housing Inspector to proceed to
effectuate the purpose of this chapter with respect to the particular property
or properties that the Housing Inspector shall have found to be unfit for human
habitation or an unsafe abandoned structure, and which property or properties
shall be described in the ordinance. No such ordinance shall be adopted to
require demolition of a structure until the owner has first been given a
reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with this chapter and any
other applicable codes. This ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the
Register of Deeds in the county where the property or properties are located
and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index.
   (C)   Abandonment of intent to repair.
      (1)   If a structure has been vacated and closed for a period of one year
pursuant to an ordinance adopted pursuant to division (A) of this section, or
after the Housing Inspector issues an order or proceedings have commenced
regarding a structure to be repaired or vacated and closed as provided in this
section, then the Town Council may find that the owner has abandoned the intent
and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the structure in order to render it
fit for human habitation and/or safe and that the continuation of the structure
in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, and
welfare of the local government in that the structure would continue to
deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to
children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities,
would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in
the area, and would render unavailable property and a structure that might
otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent
and affordable housing in this state, then in such circumstances, the Town
Council may, after the expiration of such one-year period, enact an ordinance
and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
         (a)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
         (b)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
      (2)   This ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of
deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor
index. If the owner fails to comply with this ordinance, the housing inspector
shall effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.
   (D)   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling,
the Housing Inspector may file a civil action in the name of the town to remove
the occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of
summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as
parties- defendant any person occupying the dwelling. The Clerk of Superior
Court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a
magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten days from the
issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint
shall be served as provided in G.S. § 42-29. The summons shall be returned
according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly
served and if, at the hearing, the Housing Inspector produces a certified copy
of an ordinance adopted by the governing body pursuant to division (C) above,
authorizing the officer to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the
magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated and that
all persons be removed. The judgement ordering that the dwelling be vacated
shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgement for summary ejectment
entered under G.S. § 42-30. An appeal from any judgement entered hereunder by
the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. § 7A-228, and the execution of
the judgement may be stayed as provided in G.S. § 7A-227. An action to remove
an occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature
of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this division (D), unless the
occupant was served with notice at least 30 days before the filing of the
summary ejectment proceeding that the governing body has ordered the Housing
Inspector to proceed to exercise his or her duties under division (C) of this
section to vacate and close or remove and demolish the dwelling.
   (E)   Whenever a determination is made pursuant to §
151.48 that a dwelling must be vacated and closed, or removed or demolished,
under the provisions of this section, notice of the order shall be given by
first-class mail to any organization involved in providing or restoring
dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for the
notices. A minimum period of 45 days from the mailing of the notice shall be
given before removal or demolition by action of the Housing Inspector, to allow
the opportunity of any organization to negotiate with the owner to make
repairs, lease or purchase the property for the purpose of providing affordable
housing. The Housing Inspector or clerk shall certify the mailing of the
notices, and the certification shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud.
Only an organization that has filed a written request for the notices may raise
the issue of failure to mail the notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order
requiring the Housing Inspector to wait 45 days before causing removal or
demolition. Authority: G.S. § 160D-1203.
   (F)   The Town Council shall ensure that any ordinance issued under this
section that concerns a designated landmark or a structure located within a
designated historic district is consistent with, and follows the procedures and
standards applicable to such designated landmark and/or within the designated
historic district under the town's unified development ordinance.
(Ord. passed 7-21-2016; Ord. PL05268-110121, passed 12-8-2021)
§ 151.50 SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)    Complaints or orders issued by the Housing Inspector shall be served
upon persons either personally or bycertified mail. When service is made by
certified mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also be sent by regular
mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the certified mail is unclaimed or
refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten
days after the mailing. If regular mail is used, a notice of the pending
proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected.
   (B)   If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Housing Inspector in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, or, if the owners are known but have refused to accept
service by registered or certified mail, and the Housing Inspector makes an
affidavit to that effect, then the serving of the complaint or order upon the
owners or other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having
general circulation in the town at least once no later than the time at which
personal service would be required under the provisions of this chapter. When
service is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be
posted in a conspicuous place on the premises thereby affected.
(Ord. passed 7-21-2016; Ord. PL05268-110121, passed 12-8-2021)
§ 151.51 RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   (A)    Any owner or person who is aggrieved with a decision or order issued
by the Housing Inspector pursuant to §
151.48 may appeal from that decision or order to the Town’s Zoning Board of
Adjustment (hereinafter, "Board").
   (B)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Housing Inspector may be
taken by any person aggrieved thereby or by any officer, board or commission of
the town. Any appeal from the Housing Inspector shall be taken within ten days
from the rendering of the decision or service of the order, whichever is later,
and shall be taken by filing with the Housing Inspector and with the Board a
written notice of appeal on forms supplied by the Housing Inspector, which
shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of
any notice of appeal, the Housing Inspector shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed
from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the Housing Inspector
refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his or her
decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is
from a decision of the Housing Inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do
any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until
the hearing by the Board, unless the Housing Inspector certifies to the Board,
after the notice of appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason of the
facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the
appellant), a suspension of his or her requirement would cause imminent peril
to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended
except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon
not less than one days written notice to the Housing Inspector, by the Board,
or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to division (E) of this
section.
   (C)   The Board shall fix reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals,
shall give due notice to all the parties and shall render its decision within a
reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The
Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or
order appealed from, and may make the decision and order as in its opinion
ought to be made in the matter. The concurring vote of four members of the
majority of the Board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or
order of the Housing Inspector. In any case where there are practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships in carrying out the strict letter of the
ordinance, the Board shall have the power to adapt the application of the
ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the
ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial
justice done.
   (D)   Every decision of the Board shall be subject to review by proceedings
in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the decision of the
Board, but not otherwise.
   (E)   Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the Housing Inspector or a
decision rendered by the Board may petition the Superior Court for an
injunction restraining the Housing Inspector from carrying out the order or
decision, and the Court may, upon the petition, issue a temporary injunction
restraining the Housing Inspector pending a final disposition of the order;
provided, however, that the petition shall be filed within 30 days after
issuance of the order or rendering of the decision. Hearings shall be held by
the Court on any petition within 20 days, and shall be given preference over
other matters on the Court’s calendar. The court shall hear and determine the
issues raised and shall enter the final order or decree as law and justice may
require; provided, however, that it shall not be necessary to file bond in any
amount before obtaining a temporary injunction under this division (E).
   (F)   In case any dwelling is erected, constructed, altered, repaired
converted, maintained or used in violation of this chapter or any valid order
or decision of the Housing Inspector or Board may institute any appropriate
action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration or use, to restrain, correct or abate the violation,
to prevent the occupancy of the dwelling or to prevent any illegal act, conduct
or use in or about the premises of the dwelling.

§ 151.52 LIEN ON PREMISES.
   (A)    The amount of the cost of the repairs, alterations or improvements,
or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the Housing Inspector
shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred,
which lien shall be filed, have the same priority and be collected as a lien
for special assessment provided in Article 10 of Chapter 160A of the General
Statutes. The amount of such cost is also a lien on any other real property of
the owner located within the town limits except for the owner's primary
residence. The additional lien provided in this division is inferior to all
prior liens and shall be collected as a money judgment.
   (B)   If the structure is removed or demolished by the Housing Inspector, he
or she shall sell the materials of the structure and any personal property,
fixtures, or appurtenances found in or attached to the structure and shall
credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition
and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the Superior Court by the
Housing Inspector, shall be secured in a manner as may be directed by the
court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled
thereto by final order of decree of the court. Repairs, alterations,
improvements or demolitions may be made under the supervision of the Housing
Inspector, or he or she may let the same to contract on competitive bids or by
private contract if no bids are received.
   (C)   Vacating and closing structures shall be done under the supervision of
the Housing Inspector.

of any structure to fail, neglect or refuse to repair, alter or improve the
same, or to vacate and close and demolish and remove the same, upon order of
the Housing Inspector duly made and served as herein provided, within the time
specified in the order, and each day that any failure, neglect, or refusal to
comply with the order continues shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   When the Housing Inspector finds that a building is unfit for human
habitation or unsafe within the meaning of this chapter and has notified the
owner to this effect and the time limit set by the Housing Inspector for the
correction of defects or vacating same has expired, no person shall receive
rentals, offer for rent or occupy the structure, and each day the offense
continues shall be deemed a separate offense.

living or sleeping by one or more human occupants.
   DWELLING UNIT. A room or group of rooms within a dwelling forming a single

§ 152.21 PURPOSE.
   The town seeks to protect the health, safety and welfare of citizens
residing within the town who may be subject to unexpected flooding. Individuals
and families who rent may be unaware that their dwelling unit is located within
an area subject to flooding. It is the purpose of this subchapter to require
landlords to notify prospective tenants when a rental dwelling unit is located
within a flood zone.
(Ord. passed 7-16-2020)
§ 152.22 NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   All landlords who lease dwelling units located within a flood zone
shall disclose to all prospective tenants, by means of a written notice in at
least 16-point type that is separate from other lease or application materials
and provided before the lease is signed, a notice that contains all of the
following:
      (1)   The specific flood zone in which the dwelling unit is located;
      (2)   That the specific flood zone may not accurately reflect the
frequency of flooding;
      (3)   That the landlord will not accept responsibility for damage to or
destruction of the tenant's property by flooding (unless the landlord accepts
responsibility);
      (4)   That renter's flood insurance is available through the National
Flood Insurance Program, and that the tenant may visit www.floodsmart.gov for
more information on the National Flood Insurance Program;
      (5)   To the extent the landlord has actual knowledge, the years in which
flooding of the dwelling unit has occurred; and
      (6)   This notice shall be signed and dated by the tenant.
   (B)   Sample notice.
 
   Notice of Possible Flooding
   The dwelling unit at (insert address) is located within the (insert flood zone) flood zone. Consequently, there is the possibility in any given
year that this dwelling unit may be flooded.
   Previously, flood zones were known as (1) the floodway, (2) the 100-year flood plain or (3) the 500-year flood plain. FEMA now uses the following
terminology:
      (1)   Floodway = AE Floodway
      (2)   100-Year Floodplain = AE Zone
      (3)   500-Year Floodplain = Zone X
   It is important for tenants to note that the category of flood zone may not accurately reflect actual frequency of flooding.
   Landlord is aware that the dwelling unit at (insert address) has been flooded (insert number of times) in the past (number of years).
   The landlord (choose one) does or does not accept responsibility for damage to or destruction of the tenant's property resulting from flooding.
   The tenant is hereby notified that renter's flood insurance policies are available through your insurance agent.
   The renter is encouraged to visit www.floodsmart.gov for more information on the National Flood Insurance Program.

§ 154.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   (A)   The Town Council finds that there exists within the town a large
number of real properties containing vacant buildings that are poorly
maintained.
   (B)   It is further found that these poorly maintained vacant buildings are
a major cause and source of blight in residential and non-residential areas.
   (C)   It is further found that the existence of vacant and blighted
buildings adversely affects the economic well-being of the town, and is
inimical to the health, safety and welfare of town citizens, thereby
constituting a nuisance dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or public
safety.
   (D)   It is further found that many of the vacant and blighted buildings can
be rehabilitated and used to provide decent, safe facilities for the use(s) in
which the buildings were originally constructed, and the rehabilitation, and
reuse would eliminate, remedy and prevent the adverse conditions described.
   (E)   It is further found that the abatement of vacant and blighted
buildings is a benefit to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
town.
(Ord. passed 8-17-2006)
