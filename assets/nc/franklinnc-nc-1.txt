specifying the portions in which the land was divided and the purchaser or
purchasers thereof, and the prices paid by each, which shall be entered on the
book of proceedings of the Council, and if there shall be a surplus after

macadamizing or paving streets against the lands fronting on each side of the
street, each property being liable only for the share of the cost of paving or
macadamizing that part of the street or sidewalk upon which the property
fronts; and for the purpose the Town Council shall cause to be kept an accurate
account of the cost of the pavement or macadam upon which each property fronts;
and the person appointed or directed to keep the account shall report the same
to the Council under oath, and when found by the Council to be correct, it
shall be entered in the minutes as a charge against the frontage, and the sums
so charged shall be a lien on the property from the time, which lien shall
relate back to the time the improvements were begun under an order of the
Council for the purpose. The Council shall cause notice to be served personally
or through the mails upon the owner of the lands charged of the amount of the
charge and of the time herein provided for the payment of the same, and unless
the same shall be paid within 30 days thereafter the Clerk of the Council shall
issue execution against the property charged, directed to the Chief of Police,
who shall sell the same after due advertisement, by descending bids, to the
person who will pay the charges and costs of sale for the least number of front
feet running back at right angles with the street to the back of the lot. Any
landowner may pay amount so charged against his land under protest and file a
statement with the Town Council, under oath, that the amount charged is in
excess of the share of costs for which the property is made liable by this act;
in which case the Council shall cause the issue to be transferred to the
Superior Court, to be tried as other civil issues, and the Town shall return
any excess found to the owner with costs, if the issue is found against it.

aforesaid shall not be redeemed within the time specified, the corporation
shall convey to the purchaser or his assigns the same in fee; and the recitals
in the conveyance, or in any other conveyance of land sold for taxes due the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the Town
of Franklin, hereafter referred to as the town, and enables the town to comply
with all applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33
United States Code § 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40
CFR, Part 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges
into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of
the system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges
into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system,
inadequately treated, into any waters of the State or otherwise be incompatible
with the system;
      (3)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludges
from the municipal system;
      (4)   To protect both municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage,
sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting
the general public;
      (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and
      (6)   To ensure that the municipality complies with its NPDES or non-
discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other
federal or state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the issuance of
permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the municipal wastewater
system, as authorized by G.S. § 160A-312 and/or G.S. § 153A-275. The town shall
designate an administrator of the POTW and pretreatment program hereafter
referred to as the POTW Director. Except as otherwise provided herein, the POTW
Director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this
chapter. Any powers granted to or imposed upon the POTW Director may be
delegated by the POTW Director to other town personnel. By discharging
wastewater into the municipal wastewater system, industrial users located
outside the town limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions
established in this chapter, as well as any permits, enforcement actions, or
orders issued hereunder.

§ 51.058 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   The town prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without
notification and approval of the POTW Director.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving
written approval from the town. Any notification under this division need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under §
51.054 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
51.050,
51.052 and 51.052 of this chapter.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms
of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a
one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW
Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 51.059 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
by a laboratory certified by the state to perform the wastewater analysis in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard or unless
otherwise performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA or town. If
40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA and town.

§ 51.060 GRAB AND COMPOSITE SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (B)   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as
required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary
to be representative of the user’s discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for
additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90-day compliance
reports. Additionally, the POTW Director may allow collection of multiple grabs
during a 24-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under
40 CFR 136.
   (C)   Composite samples: All wastewater composite samples shall be collected
with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a
discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow
proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Director. When
authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be
representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 51.070 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The town requires the user to provide and operate at the user’s own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of
the town and all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification
by the town.
(Ord. passed 12-4-06; Am. Ord. passed 5-4-09; Am. Ord. passed 2-4-13)
§ 51.071 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The town will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the town, approval authority and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The town, approval
authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user’s property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town,
approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the town’s,
approval authority’s, or EPA’s access to the user’s premises shall be a
violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access.
(Ord. passed 12-4-06; Am. Ord. passed 5-4-09; Am. Ord. passed 2-4-13)
§ 51.072 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the town, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the town, approval
authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the General Court
with jurisdiction of the town.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 51.090 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW Director finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, wastewater permit,
or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other
pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the
date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the town by the user.
Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders.  The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to division (D), below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.  
      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this chapter or is in
noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW Director
determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be
made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §
51.091 nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director/ Superintendent
under this section subject to an administrative appeal under §
51.105.
   (D)   Administrative orders. When the POTW Director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter, permits or orders
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may
issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons
in noncompliance to do any of the following:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
the order;
      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation;
      (4)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions.  
      (1)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/
or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the POTW Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW Director
shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon
proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user
shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the
POTW Director prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit or permission to discharge.
      (1)   The POTW Director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or
permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the
following reasons:
         (a)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his discharge;
         (b)   Failure to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
         (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
         (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to
discharge, conditions of this chapter, or any applicable state and federal
regulations.
      (2)   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to
show cause under §
51.090 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken.

§ 51.092 OTHER AVAILABLE REMEDIES.
   Remedies, in addition to those previously mentioned in this chapter, are
available to the POTW Director who may use any single one or combination
against a noncompliant user. Additional available remedies include, but are not
limited to:
   (A)   Criminal violations. The District Attorney for Judicial District 30
may, at the request of the town, prosecute noncompliant users who violate the
provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B.
Note: Under North Carolina law, it is a crime to negligently violate any term,
condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or negligently fail to
apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B
(f)), to knowingly and willfully violate any term, condition, or requirement of
a pretreatment permit, or knowingly and willfully fail to apply for a
pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B(g)), to
knowingly violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit
issued by local governments, or knowingly fail to apply for a pretreatment
permit, knowing at the time that a person is placed in imminent danger of death
or serious bodily injury, (G.S. § 143-215.6B(h)), and to falsify information
required under G.S. § 143-215.6B(i).
   (B)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user is in violation of the provisions
of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, the POTW Director,
through the City Attorney, may petition the Superior Court of Justice for the
issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent injunction which
restrains or compels the activities in question.
   (C)   Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user is in violation of
the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, water
service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence,
at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated ability to
comply .
   (D)   Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent
limitations of this chapter or of a permit or order issued hereunder, is hereby
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the
POTW Director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions of the appropriate ordinances of the town governing such nuisances,
including reimbursing the POTW for any costs incurred in removing, abating or

or orders within 90 days of the receipt of the written demand for a hearing.
      (3)   The POTW Director shall transmit a copy of the hearing officer’s
decision by registered or certified mail as described in division (B) below.
The decision is a final decision for the purposes of seeking judicial review.
The terms and conditions of a permit under appeal shall be as follows:
         (a)   New permits. Upon appeal, including judicial review in the
General Courts of Justice, of the terms or conditions of a newly issued permit,
the terms and conditions of the entire permit are stayed and the permit is not
in effect until either the conclusion of judicial review or until the parties
reach a mutual resolution.
         (b)   Renewed permits. Upon appeal, including judicial review in the
General Courts of Justice, of the terms or conditions of a renewed permit, the
terms and conditions of the existing permit remain in effect until either the
conclusion of judicial review or until the parties reach a mutual resolution.
         (c)   Terminated permits. Upon appeal, including judicial review in

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 51.110 UPSET.
   (A)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (B), below, are met.
   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW
Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (C)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (D)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. passed 12-4-06; Am. Ord. passed 5-4-09; Am. Ord. passed 2-4-13)
§ 51.111 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS DEFENSE.
   (A)   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
51.010(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §
51.010(B)(2), (B)(3), (B)(5) - (B)(7), and (B)(9) - (B)(23) of this chapter if
it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass
through or interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (B)   Pursuant to 40 CFR Section 403.5(a)(2), the affirmative defense
outlined in this section cannot apply to the specific prohibitions in §
51.010(B)(1) and (B)(4), and (B)(8).
(Ord. passed 12-4-06; Am. Ord. passed 5-4-09; Am. Ord. passed 2-4-13)
§ 51.112 BYPASS.
   (A)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provisions of divisions (B) and (C) of this section.
   (B)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW Director/Superintendent, at least ten days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director/
Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of this time the
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW Director
may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has
been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director/Superintendent may
take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) of
this section.
      (2)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Director determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(1) of this section.
   Note: The affirmative defense for bypass from the federal regulations has
not been incorporated into state pretreatment regulations either verbatim or by
reference. It will be incorporated when the state pretreatment regulations are
modified in 1993 to incorporate changes to the federal regulations that have
occurred since 1987 when the state regulations were last modified. The state
regulations governing NPDES permits do, however, incorporate the bypass
provision. DWQ is of the opinion that local governments may incorporate the
bypass provision into their ordinances since such authority is provided by the
federal regulations and since state regulations do not specifically prohibit
the bypass provision, even though state pretreatment regulations do not as yet
specify the bypass provision. Incorporation of this provision within the
ordinance prior to change in the state pretreatment regulations will prevent
the necessity of changing the ordinance at a later date when the state
pretreatment regulations are modified.

possession of the vehicle. In the case of a nuisance vehicle or a junked motor
vehicle, if the names and mailing addresses of the registered owner or person
entitled to the possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee or occupant of
the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be ascertained in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given by first class
mail. The person who mails the notice shall retain a written record to show the
names and addresses to which it was mailed, and the date mailed. If the names
and addresses cannot be ascertained or if the vehicle to be removed is an
abandoned motor vehicle, notice shall be given by affixing on the windshield or
some other conspicuous place on the vehicle a notice indicating that the
vehicle will be removed by the town on a specified date, but no sooner than
seven days after the notice is affixed. Whether notice is by first class mail
or by posting as provided above, the notice shall state that the vehicle will
be removed by the town on a specified date, not sooner than seven days after
the notice is affixed or mailed, unless the vehicle is removed by the owner or
legal possessor prior to that time.
   (B)   With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property, nuisance
vehicles and junked motor vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if
the registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the
vehicle but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is abandoned
or is a nuisance vehicle, or in the case of a junked motor vehicle that the
aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, the appeal
shall be made to the Town Manager in writing, who shall set a time for the
appeal and hear it within a reasonable amount of time, not less than ten nor
more than 30 days after receiving the request for the appeal. Further
proceedings to remove the vehicle shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and
decided. The decision of the Town Manager shall be appealable to District
Court.
   (C)   Any abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle which has been ordered
removed may, as directed by the Town, be removed to a storage garage or area by
the tow truck operator or towing business contracting to perform the services
for the town. Whenever a vehicle is removed, the authorizing town official
shall immediately notify the last known registered owner of the vehicle, and
the notice shall include the following:
      (1)   The description of the removed vehicle;
      (2)   The location where the vehicle is stored;
      (3)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;

      (5)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable cause
hearing on the removal.
   (D)   The town shall attempt to give notice to the vehicle owner by
telephone. However, whether or not the owner is reached by telephone, written
notice, including the information set forth in divisions (C)(1) through (C)(5)
above, shall also be mailed to the registered owner's last known address,
unless this notice is waived in writing by the vehicle owner or the owner's
agent.
   (E)   If the vehicle is registered in the state of North Carolina, notice
shall be given within 24 hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the state
of North Carolina, notice shall be given to the registered owner within 72
hours form the removal of the vehicle.
   (F)   Whenever an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle is removed,
and the vehicle has no valid registration or registration plates, the
authorizing town official shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the
vehicle identification number, to determine the last known registered owner of
the vehicle and to notify the owner of the information set forth in divisions
(C)(1) through (C) (5) above.
(Ord. passed 12-3-12)
§ 90.08 EXCEPTIONS TO PRIOR NOTICE REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an
abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle may, as determined by the
authorizing official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a
special need for prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to
otherwise maintain and protect the public safety and welfare.
   (B)   The findings shall, in all cases, be entered by the authorizing
official in the appropriate daily records. Circumstances justifying removal of
vehicles without prior notice include:
      (1)   Vehicles abandoned on the public streets and highways, for which
the Board hereby determines that immediate removal of the same may be warranted
when they are:
         (a)   Obstructing traffic;
         (b)   Parked in violation of an ordinance prohibiting or restricting
parking;
         (c)   Parked in a no stopping or standing zone;

under
Chapter 73 of this Code.
      (2)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles, and with respect to abandoned
or nuisance vehicles left on town-owned property other than the streets and
highways, and on private property, the vehicles may be removed without giving
prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing town official
finds a special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public
health, safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation, the
circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to
businesses and residences, vehicles parked in a location or manner so as to
pose a traffic hazard, and vehicles causing damage to public or private
property.

hearing for the purpose of determining if probable cause existed for removing
the vehicle. A request for hearing must be filed in writing with the County
Magistrate designated by the Chief District Court Judge to receive the hearing
requests. The Magistrate will set the hearing within 72 hours of receipt of the
request, and the hearing will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of
G.S. § 20-219.11.
(Ord. passed 12-3-12)
§ 90.10 REDEMPTION OF VEHICLE DURING PROCEEDINGS.
   At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause
hearing, the owner may obtain possession of the removed vehicle by paying the
towing fee, including any storage charges, or by posting a bond for double the
amount of the fees and charges to the tow truck operator or towing business
having custody of the removed vehicle. Upon regaining possession of a vehicle,
the owner or person entitled to the possession of the vehicle shall not allow
or engage in further violations of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 12-3-12)
§ 90.11 SALE AND DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED VEHICLE.
   Any abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle which is not claimed by the

truck operator or towing business having custody of the vehicle. Disposition of
the vehicle shall be carried out in coordination with the town and in
accordance with G.S. §§ 44A-1 et seq.

§ 90.12 CONDITIONS ON REMOVAL OF VEHICLES FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   As a general policy, the town will not remove a vehicle from private
property if the owner, occupant or lessee of the property could have the
vehicle removed under applicable state law procedures. In no case will a
vehicle be removed by the town from private property without a written request
of the owner, occupant or lessee, except in those cases where a vehicle is a
nuisance vehicle or is a junked motor vehicle which has been ordered removed by
the Code Enforcement Officer. The town may require any person requesting the
removal of an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle from private property
to indemnify the town against any loss, expense or liability incurred because
of the removal, storage or sale thereof. The town will not remove or dispose of
any motor vehicle that is used on a regular basis for business or personal use.
(Ord. passed 12-3-12)

this chapter.
(Ord. passed 12-3-12)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article
21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article
8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local
governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Therefore, the Town Council of the Town of Franklin, North Carolina,
does ordain as set forth in this chapter.
('76 Code, § 9-6001) (Ord. passed 12-6-71; Am. Ord. passed 5-2-16)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Franklin
are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 5-2-16)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
('76 Code, § 9-6002) (Ord. passed 12-6-71; Am. Ord. passed 5-2-16)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges)
that are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.

rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
during any one-year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant
to §
151.21.

§ 151.12 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration. Larger floods can and will occur. Actual flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land
outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability
on the part of the Town of Franklin or by any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. passed 5-2-16)
§ 151.13 RECOGNITION/EVALUATION OF FLOOD OR FLOOD-RELATED EROSION HAZARDS IN
OFFICIAL LAND USE/BUILDING ACTIONS.
   (A)   The Town Council assures the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
that upon approval of a flood control ordinance, it will enact as necessary and
maintain in force in those areas having flood or flood-related erosion hazards
adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions
consistent with the criteria set forth in Parts 59, 60 and 65 of the National
Flood Insurance Program Regulations (44 CFR); and
   (B)   Upon approval of a flood control ordinance, the Town Council will vest
the Town Land Use Administrator with the responsibility, and the means to:
      (1)   Assist the FIA Administrator, as requested, in delineation of the
limits of the area having special flood or flood-related erosion hazards.
      (2)   Provide such information as the FIA Administrator may request
concerning present uses and occupancy of the floodplain or flood-related
erosion areas.
      (3)   Cooperate with federal, state and local agencies and private firms
which undertake to study, survey, map, and identify floodplain or flood-
related erosion areas, and cooperate with neighboring communities with respect
to management of adjoining floodplain and/or flood- related erosion areas in
order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards.
      (4)   Upon occurrence, notify the FIA Administrator in writing whenever
the boundaries of the community have been modified by annexation or the
community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that all
Flood Hazard Boundary maps (FHBMs) and Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
accurately represent the community’s boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the community suitable for reproduction,
clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for which the
community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.
   (C)   Upon approval of a flood control ordinance, the Town Council will
appoint the Town Land Use Administrator to maintain for public inspection and
to furnish upon request, for the determination of applicable flood insurance
risk premium rates within all areas having special flood hazards identified on
a FHBM or FIRMs, any certificates of floodproofing, and information on the
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the level of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and
include whether or not such structures contain a basement, and if the structure

corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (2)   Floodproofing certificate. If non-residential floodproofing is used
to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a floodproofing
certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-34 (7/12)), with supporting data, an operational
plan, and an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual
start of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the fioodproofed
design elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in
relation to mean sea level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and
certified by same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate
data, the operational plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan.
Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant prior
to permit approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make

   (I)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this
chapter and located totally or partially within the floodway, non-encroachment
area, or stream setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the
regulatory flood protection elevation in the floodway, non-encroachment area,
or stream setback, and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or
replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter.
   (J)   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in §
151.24(J). A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an
allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater
treatment facility may be located in a special flood hazard area only if the
structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least the regulatory
flood protection elevation and certified in accordance with the provisions of §
151.21(C).
   (K)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   (L)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have

(Ord. passed 5-2-16) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.36 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in §§
151.21 or
151.37, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
151.35, are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05. Structures located in A, AE, AO, and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall certify that the floodproofing standards of this subsection are
satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator
as set forth in §
151.21(C), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is
above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of §
151.36(D).
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
Macon County Emergency Management Department and approved prior to the issuance
of a floodplain development permit.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage. Access to
the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of
vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard
exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The
interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned
into separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures that are a substantial
improvement with no modifications to the existing structure other than a
standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with
the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a three-year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with
the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the three-
year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this chapter. If the
structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered
substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
requirement does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions.
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Temporary placement.
         (a)   B on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no
permanently attached additions).
      (2)   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
   (G)   Recreational vehicle parks or subdivisions.
      (1)   Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for a
recreational vehicle park:
         (a)   Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for a
recreational vehicle park:
            1.   RV park developers, owners, and operators shall prepare and
maintain current a comprehensive emergency evacuation plan defining how, when
and where all vehicles are to be removed to a safe location during approaching
storm, flood, or hazard events. This plan shall be filed with and approved by
the Floodplain Administrator and the Macon County Emergency Management
Department prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit.
            2.   All RV park emergency evacuation plans must be updated
annually and submitted to the Macon County Emergency Management Department for
approval.
            3.   The emergency evacuation plan for each RV park having property
in the special flood hazard area shall be implemented and supported by a
written set of park regulations. The park regulations shall be submitted for
review and approval along with the emergency evacuation plan prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit.
            4.   Approval of the emergency evacuation plan and the park
regulations do not relieve the RV park owner or land owner of any
responsibility or liability for providing the maximum practical extent of
protection against downstream loss of life or property when RVs are resident on
the site. Neither does approval of the emergency evacuation plan and the park
regulations create or transfer any liability to the County of Macon, the Town
of Franklin, or any of their respective employees or agents.
      (2)   The park regulations shall include at a minimum the following
requirements:
         (a)   The emergency evacuation plan for each RV park having property
in the special flood hazard area shall be implemented and supported by a
written set of park regulations. The park regulations shall be submitted for
review and approval along with the emergency evacuation plan prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit.
         (b)   The owner of the RV must sign a release of liability available
from the RV park owner giving the RV park owner or operator the right to
evacuate the owner’s RV(s) to a safe location or to anchor/tether the RV(s) in
case of a flood warning and the owner is away from the site. The release form
shall notify the RV owner that under flooding conditions, the RV may be damaged
or destroyed.
      (3)   Known hazards disclosure. The RV park owner is responsible for
posting a sign at the utility connection station on each RV parking site
advising the RV owner that the site is located within a FEMA-designated special
flood hazard area and is subject to damage or loss to property and life during
a flood event. Further, the sign on each site shall advise the RV owner of the
potential water depth at the site during a base flood event (base flood
elevation minus the local grade elevation where the RV is parked). If the RV
park owner elects to state a single water depth to standardize the signs, the
maximum water depth on the entire RV park shall be listed.
      (4)   Inspections.
         (a)   The Town of Franklin, and the County of Macon shall have the
right to access all RV parks and all RV parking sites at any time for the
purpose of a compliance inspection. A compliance inspection will determine if
the requirements of the emergency evacuation plan and the park regulations are
current and are being enforced by the RV park owner or operator.
         (b)   Non-conforming items or a finding of non-compliance shall result
in a written notice of violation (NOV). The RV park owner shall have a maximum
of 30 calendar days to correct the deficiencies and to bring the RV park back
into full compliance.
         (c)   Failure to correct an NOV in the proscribed time limit shall
result in a fine not to exceed $5,000 per day for every calendar day that the
RV park is found to be out of compliance with the approved plans and
regulations.
         (d)   Nothing herein shall prevent the Town of Franklin from seeking
other enforcement remedies as provided in §
151.99.
      (5)   Existing RV parks and subdivisions for which any part of the
property is located in the special flood hazard area. The owner of an existing
RV park or subdivision shall prepare an emergency evacuation plan and file it
with the Floodplain Administrator and Macon County Emergency Management
Coordinator for review and approval no later than 12 months after the effective
date of this chapter. The known hazards disclosure requirements of subsection
(G)(4) above shall be met no later than 12 after the effective date of this
chapter. After receiving approval of the emergency evacuation plan, the owner
(or manager/operator) of the facility shall have seven years to bring the
existing RV park or subdivision into compliance with all the requirements of
this chapter. Failure to file an emergency evacuation plan for approval shall
be a violation and subject to the penalties defined in §
151.99.
   (H)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (E)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (I)   Accessory structures.
      (1)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be
placed within a special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met:
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
         (b)   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
         (c)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
         (d)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
         (e)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
the provisions of §
151.35(A);
         (f)   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of §
151.35(D); and
         (g)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation in conformance with the provisions of §
151.36(D)(3).
      (2)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet
or that is a minimal investment of $3,000 or less and satisfies the criteria
outlined above is not required to meet the elevation or floodproofing standards
of §
151.36(B). Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other
accessory structures in accordance with §
151.21(C).
   (J)   Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within a
special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met:
      (1)   Underground tanks. Underground tanks in flood hazard areas shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads during conditions of the design flood,
including the effects of buoyancy assuming the tank is empty;
      (2)   Above-ground tanks, elevated. Above-ground tanks in flood hazard
areas shall be attached to and elevated to or above the design flood elevation
on a supporting structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement during conditions of the design flood. Tank-supporting
structures shall meet the foundation requirements of the applicable flood
hazard area;
      (3)   Above-ground tanks, not elevated. Above-ground tanks that do not
meet the elevation requirements of §
151.36(B) shall be permitted in flood hazard areas provided the tanks are
anchored or otherwise designed and constructed to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads during
conditions of the design flood, including the effects of buoyancy assuming the
tank is empty and the effects of flood-borne debris.
      (4)   Tank inlets and vents. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and
vents shall be:
         (a)   At or above the design flood elevation or fitted with covers
designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the contents of the
tanks during conditions of the design flood; and
         (b)   Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of
the design flood.
   (K)   Other development. Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development
permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must submit to the Floodplain
Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a
hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning notification. The
following information shall be submitted in writing to the Floodplain
Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)    Fences in regulated floodways and NEAs that have the potential to
block the passage of floodwaters, such as stockade fences and wire mesh fences,
shall meet the limitations of §
151.39 of this chapter.
      (2)   Retaining walls, sidewalks and driveways in regulated floodways and
NEAs. Retaining walls and sidewalks and driveways that involve the placement of
fill in regulated floodways shall meet the limitations of §
151.39 of this chapter.
      (3)   Roads and watercourse crossings in regulated floodways and NEAs.
Roads and watercourse crossings, including roads, bridges, culverts, low-water
crossings and similar means for vehicles or pedestrians to travel from one side
of a watercourse to the other side, that encroach into regulated floodways
shall meet the limitations of §
151.39 of this chapter.

151.99
§ 151.37 STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS.
   Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Approximate Zone A and
established in §
151.07, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the
following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
151.35, shall apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet
each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is
greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined based on the following criteria:
      (1)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in §§
151.35 and
151.36.
      (2)   When floodway or non-encroachment data is available from a federal,
state, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements
within floodway and non-encroachment areas shall also comply with the
requirements of §§
151.36 and
151.39.
      (3)   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such
base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance
with §
151.07 and utilized in implementing this chapter.
      (4)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be
elevated or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05. All other applicable provisions of §
151.36 shall also apply.
(Ord. passed 5-2-16) Penalty, see §

§ 151.38 STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS WITH BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS BUT
WITHOUT ESTABLISHED FLOODWAYS OR NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   Along rivers and streams where base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided
by FEMA or is available from another source but neither floodway nor non-
encroachment areas are identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM
or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development
within such areas:
   (A)   Standards of §§
151.35 and
151.36; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.
(Ord. passed 5-2-16) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.39 FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within
the special flood hazard areas established in §
151.07. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards
outlined in §§
151.35 and
151.36, shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
      (1)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result
in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood,
based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit, or
      (2)   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by
FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six months
of completion of the proposed encroachment.

To assure that a proposed boundary line adjustment conforms to the provisions
of this chapter, including, but not limited to, lot sizes, lot frontages, and
building setbacks, the proposed adjustment shall be submitted to the Land Use
Administrator for review and approval prior to execution. The plan, plat, or

notations, references and other information shown thereon are hereby declared
to be a part of this chapter and shall have the same force and effect as if the
Zoning Map and all notations, references and other information shown thereon
were fully set forth and described herein. This map has been rendered
digitally, and this digitally-rendered map shall constitute the Official Zoning
Map of the Town of Franklin. It shall be the duty of the Land Use Administrator
to maintain the digitally-rendered map and to faithfully modify it in
accordance with map amendments which may be adopted by the Town Council from
time to time. In maintaining the digitally-rendered zoning map, the Land Use
Administrator is authorized to make minor adjustments to the map where to do so
would cause zoning boundaries to match property lines, streets, streams, or
other zoning boundaries, or where circumstances otherwise make it clear that
such adjustment fulfills the intent of previous zoning map amendments.

interpretation of district boundaries on the zoning map:
      (1)   Boundaries shown appearing to follow the centerlines of streets,
highways, streams, or alleys shall follow such centerlines.

easements shall follow the actual surveyed lot lines, rights-of-way or
easements.
      (3)   Boundaries shown appearing to follow the corporate limits shall
follow such corporate limits.
      (4)   Boundaries shown appearing to follow the extraterritorial
jurisdiction boundaries of the town shall follow such boundaries.
      (5)   Boundaries shown appearing to follow railroad lines shall be midway
between the main tracks or the centerline of a single track.
      (6)   Boundaries shown parallel to or as extensions of features indicated
in this section shall be construed as such. Distances not specifically
indicated on the zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
      (7)   Boundaries shown at the intersection of streets shall be at the
intersection of the street centerlines.
      (8)   Where the actual locations of existing physical or natural features
very from those shown on the zoning map, or in the event of other circumstances
not covered by this section, the Land Use Administrator shall have the
authority to interpret district boundaries.
   (B)   Zoning of streets, private streets, and alleys. All streets, private
streets, public ways and alleys, if not otherwise specifically designated,
shall be zoned the same as the adjacent land is zoned to the centerline. In
addition, they may be used for customary and incidental transportation
purposes.

   (D)   Streetscape design. The relationship between a building and areas for
pedestrian or vehicular circulation shall be carefully planned in order to
avoid negative impacts of one upon the other. All buildings and uses developed
in this zoning district classification shall meet the following minimum
standards; provided, however, buildings undergoing renovation and
rehabilitation, in which the footprint of existing structures is not being
increased or altered, may be exempted from regulations regarding street walls
and urban open spaces if site conditions make compliance therewith impractical.
      (1)   Street walls. 
         (a)   The first floors of all buildings, including structured parking,
shall be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale interest and
activity. To the extent practicable, in consideration of the nature of the uses
proposed, this is to be accomplished in part by the use of transparent windows
and doors arranged so that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the
street on the first floor street frontage. In addition a combination of design
elements shall be used on the building facade and/or in relationship to the
building at street level to animate and enliven the streetscape. These design
elements may include, but are not limited to, the following: ornamentation,
molding, changes in material or color, architectural lighting, works of art,
fountains and pools, street furniture, landscaping and garden areas, and
display areas.
         (b)   Any design elements which extend into the public right-of-way on
city or state maintained streets require an encroachment agreement with the
Town of Franklin or the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), as
appropriate. Where expanses of blank wall are necessary, they may not exceed 20
feet in length. A blank wall is a facade which does not add to the character of
the streetscape and does not contain transparent windows or doors or sufficient
ornamentation, decoration or articulation as listed in the above paragraph. The
first floor and street level shall be designed with attention to adjacent
public or private open spaces and existing streetscape improvements. The
provision of multiple entrances from the public sidewalk or open spaces is
encouraged.
         (c)   All new structures must not be built further than 20 feet from
street right-of-way to help encourage pedestrian activity. All new structures
must be at least two or more stories high to help to insure new structures
blend with the historic look of the C-1 Downtown District.
      (2)   Structured parking facilities. In addition to the above
requirements, in the event that any openings for ventilation, service, or
emergency access are located at the first floor level in the building facade,
then they shall be an integral part of the overall building design. These
openings as well as pedestrian and vehicular entrances shall be designed to
minimize visibility of parked cars. The remainder of the street level frontage
shall be either commercial space or an architecturally articulated facade
designed to minimize the visibility of parked cars. All levels of a structured
parking facility shall be designed and screened in such a way as to minimize
visibility of parked cars. In no instance will rails or cabling alone be
sufficient to meet this screening requirement. The design requirements of this
section apply to all building facades which are visible from any public right-
of-way.
      (3)   Screening. All structures and facilities for trash, loading,
outdoor equipment, and storage, including the storage of inventory, shall be
screened so as not to be visible from the street and pedestrian circulation
areas. Solid walls shall be faced with brick, stone or other decorative finish
with the decorative side adjacent to the public right-of-way. Fences shall be
opaque and either painted or stained with the decorative side adjacent to the
public right-of-way. In no instance will a chain link or barbed wire fence be
acceptable. Trees used to fulfill this requirement shall be located on private
property in planters, a planting strip, berm or tree lawn, any of which shall
be at least eight feet wide and at least two feet deep. The trees shall be of a
small maturing evergreen variety and be at least ten feet tall at the time of
planting. All shrubs shall be between 24 inches and 36 inches tall at time of
planting. All plant material shall conform with the American Standard for
Nursery Stock published by the American Association of Nurserymen. Trees
employed to meet the screening requirement may not be counted toward the street
tree planting or urban open space tree requirements. Any lot which becomes
vacant through the removal of a structure for any reason shall be screened from
all abutting public street rights-of-way in accordance with the provisions of
this section or cleared of rubbish and debris and seeded with grass. However,
if the lot is to be used for parking either as a transitional or permanent use,
it shall meet all the minimum requirements for that use as established by this
chapter. Maintenance of screening required under these provisions shall conform
to the requirements of §§
152.170 -
152.179, including the requirement to promptly replace dead vegetation with
healthy, living plantings.
      (4)   Street trees. In addition to all other requirements of this
section, at least one tree width three to three and one-half inches caliper,
minimum, measured 6 inches above ground, shall be planted for each 25 feet for
small maturing trees and for each 35 feet for large maturing trees of the
entire building lot which abuts any public street right-of-way with a minimum
of one tree required for any distance up to 35 feet. Trees shall not be planted
closer than two feet, nor more than ten feet, from the back of thecurb. For the
purposes of this section, all specifications for measurement and quality of
trees shall be in accordance with the American Standard for Nursery Stock
published by the American Association of Nurserymen. All trees planted to meet
this requirement shall be well-matched specimen grade and shall be limbed up
six feet. Trees used to fulfill this requirement may be located on public or
private property. Maintenance of street trees required under these provisions
shall conform to the requirements of §§
152.170 -
152.179 , including the requirement to promptly replace dead vegetation with
healthy, living plantings.
      (5)   Reflective surfaces.  No development subject to these provisions
may have exterior walls with a reflectivity value in excess of 36%, as measured
under the applicable provisions of ASTM-C-1036. No reflective surfaces may be
used on street level exterior facades.
      (6)   Urban open spaces.  On parcels of ten acres or more, open spaces
for public congregation and recreational opportunities are required for non-
residential developments and shall be equipped or designed to allow pedestrian
seating and to be easily observed from the street or pedestrian circulation
areas. All urban open spaces shall comply with the minimum required design
standards of this subchapter.
         (a)   Urban open space size.  Buildings shall be provided with public
open space behind the required setback and on private property on the basis of
five square feet of urban open space per 100 square feet of gross floor area. A
maximum of 30% of this required urban open space may be provided on an enclosed
ground floor level provided the enclosed space meets all other requirements of
these provisions.
         (b)   Accessibility to the street. Urban open space shall be designed
so that it is accessible to and visible from the street.
         (c)   Trees. Within the open space area(s), one tree shall be planted
for each 500 square feet. Trees shall have a minimum caliper of three to three
and one-half inches measured six inches above ground at the time of planting.
         (d)   Amenities. The following amenities are permitted within an urban
open space area: ornamental fountains, stairways, seating, waterfalls,
sculptures, arbors, trellises, plant beds, drinking fountains, clock pedestals,
public telephones, awnings, canopies, and similar structures.
         (e)   Maintenance. The building owner, lessee, management entity or
authorized agent are jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of
the urban open space area including litter control and care and the replacement
of trees and shrubs, as required herein.
         (f)   Utilities. All utilities service lines and connections shall be
underground.
         (g)   Exceptions for single-family and two-family residences. Single-
family and two-family residential dwellings shall not be required to comply
with the streetscape design regulations contained herein.

§ 152.028 EC ENTRY CORRIDOR OVERLAY.
   This zoning district classification is established to provide development
standards for particular roadway corridor areas which are in addition to those
provided by the other zoning districts established by this chapter. The purpose
for establishing this entry corridor overlay district is first, to recognize
the importance that different roadway corridors play in defining the town’s
character as entryways and, second, to protect and preserve both the aesthetics
of these important roadways and their traffic-handling capabilities, thereby
contributing to the general welfare of the Town of Franklin.
   (A)   Dimensional requirements.  Same as for the underlying district(s).
   (B)   Permitted uses.  Same as for the underlying district(s).
   (C)   Special uses.  Same as for the underlying district(s).
   (D)   Prohibited uses. Same as for the underlying district(s).
   (E)   Development standards. Dimensional requirements and all other
development standards shall be the same as for underlying zoning district(s)
except as modified herein.
      (1)   Setbacks. Setbacks shall be the same as for the underlying zoning
district; provided, however, one or more principal structures may be authorized
within the setback under the following circumstances:
         (a)   Such principal structure(s) is not situated within 10 feet of
the projected right-of-way line of an entry corridor roadway;
         (b)   Parking for the site is placed to the side or rear of such
structure(s) so that it is screened from view from the entry corridor by means
of such structure(s) and landscaping, as necessary.
         (c)   When siting principal structures within the setback, the
developer is encouraged to design the site, including any proposed structures,
in such a way as to protect and preserve the aesthetics of the entry corridor,
thereby furthering the purpose of this section.
      (2)   Thoroughfare protection. No improvements other than driveways,
sidewalks, parking and landscaping shall be permitted within the limits of
projected rights-of-way as specified in the Official Thoroughfare Plan.
      (3)   Driveways.  Driveways serving a development parcel shall be
permitted in accordance with the standards of the NCDOT; provided, however, a
development parcel shall be limited to no more than two driveways on any road
and no more than three driveways total. Additional driveways may be permitted
when they are necessary to improve traffic movement, increase sight distances
or for other safety reasons. Developers are encouraged to share parking areas
and driveways with adjoining developments. No landscaping or structures of any
kind shall be required or allowed to be placed near the intersections of
driveways and streets that would impede safe vision of traffic.
      (4)   Outdoor storage. Outdoor storage shall be screened from view so
that it is not visible from a roadway or adjacent properties. Provided,
however, this section shall not apply to the outdoor display of goods for sale.
      (5)   Lighting. Lighting for the site shall be designed and installed so
that it is directed away from the roadway and any adjacent properties and does
not interfere with the safe use of public rights-of-way.
      (6)   Signs.  Signs shall be governed by the regulations contained in the
sign regulations of the town except as modified below:
         (a)   Outdoor advertising signs.  Outdoor advertising signs, commonly
known as billboards, are prohibited.
         (b)   Freestanding signs. Each development parcel may include no more
than one freestanding sign, which shall not exceed 70 square feet in size and
18 feet in height, measured from street grade, for each thoroughfare on which
the site has driveway access. For purposes of this subsection, a development
parcel shall include all out parcels associated with shopping centers and other
multiple-business development sites.
         (c)   Business identification signs. Each business on a development
parcel shall be entitled to install one or more business identification signs
on the premises where the business is located so long as the total amount of
such signage does not exceed one square foot for each linear foot of the front
facade for that business, or 250 square feet, whichever is less. Such signs may
be placed on the front wall of the business or on awnings, canopies or marquees
attached to or closely associated with such facade. Any additional facade which
has a door designed and used for public access may contain a business
identification sign so long as the total amount of such signage does not exceed
one square foot for each three linear feet of such facade frontage for that
business, or 250 square feet, whichever is less. Also, in shopping centers, one
suspended sign may be incorporated per business, which sign shall not exceed
three square feet per face per sign.
      (7)   Parking.  In consideration of the goals of this section and the
increased landscaping requirements contained herein, the off-street parking
requirements contained in §
152.093(E) may be reduced, at the discretion of the developer, by up to 20%.
      (8)   Street trees.  
         (a)   Street trees shall be required at the rate of one large-maturing
tree (35 feet in height) for every 50 linear feet of property abutting a
street, or one small-maturing tree (25 feet in height) for every 40 linear feet
of property abutting a street if overhead utility lines are present. Trees do
not need to be spaced evenly. They may be clustered with a minimum spacing of
15 feet and a maximum spacing of 75 feet. Street trees shall be placed in a
planting strip on private property and not within the street right-of-way.
         (b)   No street tree can be planted farther than 35 feet from the edge
of the right-of-way to count as a street tree. The width of the planting strip
may vary, but the minimum width cannot be less than seven feet and the average
width shall be at least ten feet. The planting area must be covered with living
material, including ground cover and/or shrubs, except for mulched areas
directly around trees and shrubs, so that no soil is exposed. When a sidewalk
is proposed to be constructed on a development site and right-of-way
configuration requires that it be constructed on the developer’s property, the
width of the planting strip may be reduced to an average of seven feet. During
the development review process, the approving authority for the town may permit
minor deviations in the placement of trees in order to avoid conflict with
utility structures and utility lines.
         (c)   Existing vegetation on a development parcel may count toward
meeting the requirements of this section when such is in good condition and
helps to further the purpose of the district.
      (9)   Exceptions.
         (a)   Single-family and two-family residential dwellings shall be
required to comply with the provisions of (E)(1) through (E)(4), above, but
they shall not be required to comply with the remaining regulations of the EC
Entry Corridor Overlay Zoning Classification.
         (b)   Small lots, defined as lots with less than 100 feet of frontage
on an entry corridor roadway or with less than 100 feet of depth, may have site
constraints which make strict compliance with the regulations contained in this
section a hardship. In such cases, the approving authority for the town may
approve deviations from such regulations so long as the plans of development
are consistent with the goals and objectives stated herein.

§ 152.029 UV URBAN VILLAGE.
   The UV Urban Village Zoning District Classification is intended to create
mixed use development that is economically vital, pedestrian-oriented and
contributes to the place-making character of the built environment. This
classification offers the unique opportunity to provide quality and long-
lasting retail, office and residential uses in an organized layout that
encourages the full range of access by patrons and users, and offers innovative
high-quality design of structures, public amenities and pedestrian facilities.
The development and design standards set forth in this section are intended to
accomplish the following purposes:
   (A)   Provide safe and convenient access to shopping and other essential
services to pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, motorists, and persons
with disabilities.
   (B)   Provide effective traffic flow through access management and improved
internal and external connectivity.
   (C)   Create a built environment that serves to enhance gateway corridors,
preserve historic heritage, promote economic development and an improved tax
base for the city, and celebrate Franklin’s distinction from other towns and
cities.
   (D)   Promote sustainable use of limited land and investment resources
through the following means:
      (1)   Encouraging higher building densities;
      (2)   Allowing efficient shared parking areas, making cost effective use
of existing infrastructure;
      (3)   Showcasing innovative high-quality development;
      (4)   Providing adaptive reuse of under-performing retail properties;
      (5)   Ensuring multi-modal transportation access;
      (6)   Ensuring internal and external connectedness;
      (7)   Developing a durable framework of infrastructure and built
structures that can accommodate future renovations; and
      (8)   Re-establishing the public realm, civic pride, and sense of
community ownership in new developments.
   (E)   Procedure. The reclassification of property to UV Urban Village shall
constitute an amendment of the zoning map which may be initiated only by the
owner(s) of a legal interest in the affected property, any person(s) having an
interest in the property by reason of a contract with the owner(s), or an agent
authorized in writing to act on behalf of the owner(s).
      (1)   Pre-application conference. Every person proposing to apply for
creation of a UV Urban Village District is required to meet with the Planning
Director prior to the submittal of such application. This conference is
intended to provide the applicant with an opportunity to discuss requirements,
standards and procedures and to identify and solve potential problems for the
proposed application. The applicant shall bring a sketch plan for the project
showing, at a minimum, the location, the existing and proposed transportation
network, phasing, general development plans and a written synopsis of the
development proposal. The pre-application conference shall take place at least
one week prior to submitting of an application to create an Urban Village
District.
      (2)   Application.  Creation of an urban village district shall be
initiated by means of an application for rezoning to a UV Urban Village
District.
      (3)   Master plan.  
         (a)   Applicants for creation of an urban village district project are
required to submit a master plan for the entire development that indicates the
following:
            1.   The general street network;
            2.   The proposed land use configuration within that network;
            3.   Phasing boundaries if phasing is proposed;
            4.   The ultimate proposed development intensity (including the
number of residential units and gross square footage of all nonresidential
uses) for the entire development and for each phase;
            5.   A conceptual landscape plan;
            6.   Proposed setback, height, signage, architectural and other
design standards for the overall project and for proposed uses;
            7.   Building elevations or perspective drawings to demonstrate
proposed building character; and
            8.   A conceptual stormwater plan for the development.
         (b)   For initiation of this zoning classification, properties may
fall under more than one ownership so long as there exist covenants or other
legally binding agreements that address cross-access, cross-parking and other
similar issues affecting joint operation of the projects.
         (c)   Traffic impact analysis. A traffic impact analysis is required
for all urban village projects and shall be submitted with the application to
create the urban village.
         (d)   Subsequent review. After the establishment of the urban village
district, individual development projects within the district shall be subject
to development plan review in accordance with §§
152.050 -
152.062. In addition to the development plan requirements contained in §§
152.050 -
152.062, applicants shall comply with the design submittal requirements
contained herein.
         (e)   Modifications. Revisions to approved urban village district
master plans may be approved by Town Council or by the Town Manager, or his or
her designee, depending on the type of revisions being requested. The Town
Council shall review any revisions to a master plan that increase the overall
development intensity, change the proposed mix of uses by increasing or
reducing any use category by 10% or more, or increases maximum building heights
from that shown on the approved master plan. Additionally, the Town Council
shall review any revision to a master plan that results in a decrease in the
amount of perimeter open space or perimeter parking lot buffering, or in a 25%
or greater reduction in the number of proposed blocks from that shown on the
approved master plan. For the purpose of determining overall development
intensity, one residential unit shall be regarded as the equivalent of 500
square feet of office floor area; one residential unit shall be regarded as the
equivalent of 200 square feet of commercial floor area; and 1,000 square feet
of office space shall be regarded as the equivalent of 350 square feet of
commercial. For other uses, the Planning Director shall determine the
equivalency factor.
   (F)   Permitted uses. Unlike other planned development districts, the
application for a special use permit for an urban village district is not
required to specify intended uses other than the amount of retail or office
space and the number of residential dwelling units. The applicant may, however,
choose to limit such uses, to impose restrictions on those which are allowed,
and to have such limitations and restrictions incorporated into the special use
permit issued for the development. Unless limited as noted above, the following
uses are permitted by right in the UV Urban Village Zoning District
Classification, provided they meet all requirements of this section and all
other relevant requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   Accessory dwelling units (SR).

      (46)   Tasting rooms.
      (47)   Theaters, indoors or outdoors but not including drive-in theaters.
   (G)   Development standards. Some development standards for the UV Urban
Village District are specified in this chapter. Where no standard is specified,
it is incumbent upon the applicant to propose development standards which, if
the Town Council concurs, will be incorporated into the project. The following
standards shall apply to development within the UV Urban Village Zoning
District Classification.
      (1)   Density. Residential density for an urban village district shall be
established by the Town Council in consideration of surrounding land uses and
the existence of adequate public facilities. The maximum density which may be
approved shall not be otherwise limited except by other standards such as
building height, parking, landscaping and buffering, open space, and traffic
impact.
      (2)   Structure size. The maximum size of any structure shall be
established by the Town Council in the special use permit for the project.
      (3)   Area.  The minimum area required to establish an urban village
district is three acres.
      (4)   Lot size. There is no minimum lot size required for an urban
village district; although, the applicant may specify minimum standards in its
development document.
      (5)   Lot width.  There is no minimum lot width required.
      (6)   Setbacks. There are no minimum setback requirements within the
Urban Village Zoning District Classification; provided, however, setbacks shall
be established around the perimeter of the district sufficient to protect
adjoining properties from the impacts of proposed development within the
district.
      (7)   Height. There are no maximum height restrictions. The applicant
shall propose minimum and maximum height restrictions for all building types
and locations.
      (8)   Design considerations.  Design is critical to the creation of an
Urban Village District and to achieving the goals of this classification. The
design considerations set forth in this section are intended in some instances
to guide project design and in others to provide specific design requirements,
and the text is intended to make this distinction clear. In general, the use of
the term “shall” indicates a specific design requirement, whereas the term
“should” indicates design guidance. In order to obtain a special use permit to
develop an Urban Village, an applicant must demonstrate, among other things,
that the design of the proposed development (1) meets the specific standards
contained herein, (2) is generally in harmony with the design guidelines
contained herein, and (3) will result in a development which is consistent with
the purposes set forth herein.
         (a)   General site arrangement. Structures shall be placed and
arranged so as not to adversely affect adjacent property. Adverse effects shall
include, but are not limited to, the removal of lateral support on adjacent
property, the creation of hazard, nuisance, danger, or inconvenience, or
unreasonable loss of privacy. Development shall be arranged so as to be
visually harmonious within the district. Insofar as is practicable,
developments should be arranged so as to preserve or enhance vistas. Urban
villages shall be oriented around one or more significant public spaces, such
as parks or plazas.
         (b)   Physical integration of uses. All urban villages shall be
designed and developed to provide an appropriate interrelationship between the
various uses and structures within the development. Residential and commercial
uses may be located within the same or adjoining structures.
         (c)   Preservation of natural features and open space. Permitted
flexibility in lot sizes, setbacks, street alignments and widths, and
landscaping shall be utilized to preserve natural features and drainage
patterns and to provide open space.
         (d)   Architectural character.  The rich architectural vocabulary of
the Town of Franklin presents a wide variety of development opportunities using
traditional forms while avoiding any perception of monotony. Each building
proposed for an urban village district shall have a well-proportioned form
consistent with the building use, and its construction materials. Materials
shall be durable, attractive and compatible with the architectural vernacular
of the region. Massing of the building(s) shall create a building envelope that
reflects simple, clearly articulated building volumes.
         (e)   Building orientation. It is preferred that primary facades face
the adjacent street or significant public space. Apartment buildings and
buildings containing commercial or institutional uses shall have a main
entrance facing a connecting walkway with a direct, safe, pedestrian connection
to the street. Where the main entrance does not face the adjacent street,
buildings shall nonetheless be designed to provide an attractive streetside
facade.
         (f)   Building placement. Buildings shall be situated with regard to
pedestrian and vehicular connectivity. Apartment buildings and buildings
containing commercial or institutional uses should be located close to the
pedestrian street with off-street parking behind and/or beside the building.
Important mountain vistas and/or views of significant historic sites should be
protected and accentuated.
         (g)   Privacy considerations.  Elements of the development plan should
be arranged to maximize the opportunity for privacy by the residents of the
project and minimize infringement on the privacy of adjoining land uses.
         (h)   Architectural details. Architectural elements like openings,
details, bulkheads, posts, and other architectural features shall be used to
establish human scale at the street level. On corner lots, the applicant is
encouraged to provide a building entry, additional building mass, and
distinctive architectural elements at the corner of buildings. Windows, doors,
columns, eaves, parapets, and other building components shall be proportional
to the overall scale of the building. Windows shall be vertically aligned
wherever practical. The appearance of all exposed facades (not just the
streetside facade) is important and shall be addressed in development design.
         (i)   Building walls.  Buildings shall avoid long, monotonous,
uninterrupted walls or roof planes on their visible facades. It is preferred
that this design goal be achieved by means of building wall offsets, including
projections, recesses, and changes in floor level, and roofline offsets. Such
offsets add architectural interest and variety and can assist in creating human
size proportions. Parapets shall be designed as integral to the mass of the
building. When multiple wall materials are combined on one facade, the designer
is encouraged to place the heavier material(s) below.
         (j)   Building entrances.  All buildings should include well-defined
entrances facing the street at regular intervals. An operable entrance on each
primary facade should be provided to encourage access by pedestrians. For
buildings on corner lots, an entrance may be placed at the corner, thereby
eliminating the need for side entrances.
         (k)   Internal access and connectivity. The site shall be traversed by
a network of internal streets built according to city standards. Internal
streets should seek to avoid cul-de-sacs and dead end roads and other features
that hamper connectivity. However, roads may terminate at a monumental
structure or green space. In such cases a sidewalk or other connection must be
provided to ensure the goals of connectivity. In addition, internal streets are
also required to have sidewalks and street trees. If a bus line serves, or is
expected to serve, the district, a bus shelter is required. Larger projects may
require more shelters as determined by traffic impact analysis. Connectivity is
a goal of the internal street system and external connections to areas outside
and adjacent to the urban village should be created where possible. Only one
driveway per block face is allowed. Detached single-family housing and duplex
housing are exempt from the driveway restriction. Parking access from
alleyways, however, is encouraged.
         (l)   Block length. Block length may vary but shall not exceed 500
feet in length. For blocks on local streets that are 350 feet or longer, a mid-
block pedestrian street crossing is required which may also include a parking
lot driveway and/or pedestrian passageway between two or more buildings, and
shall have curb extensions (bulb-outs) for ease and safety of pedestrian street
crossing. Collector streets may also require mid-block pedestrian crossings as
noted above.
         (m)   Pedestrian zone and sidewalks. The pedestrian zone is the area
between the street curb and the building edge or, for access roads, the street
curb and the right-of-way area. The pedestrian zone includes sidewalks, street
trees and other pedestrian amenities. The pedestrian zone will generally be 15
feet wide but may be wider depending on the setback pattern. Sidewalks in urban
village districts shall be required along one side of access streets and both
sides of internal streets throughout the development. If appropriate to the
design of the village, greenway paths may be substituted for sidewalks in
residential areas to provide connections. The sidewalk shall be a minimum of
seven feet wide in the Urban Village Zoning District Classification. In solely
residential areas containing less than eight units per acres, sidewalks are
only required to be five feet wide. With institutional and public uses that
have an increased setback, a sidewalk shall connect the building facade
entrance with the street. The sidewalk may be as wide as the entire pedestrian
area. Arcades, awnings, outdoor dining, shelters, seating areas, fountains,
street trees, additional landscaped areas and other pedestrian amenities may be
a part of this pedestrian area so long as seven feet of clear walking space is
maintained. The pedestrian area may also be used to create an area for waiting,
pick-up and drop-off. At locations such as intersections and other crosswalks,
curb extensions (bulb-outs) are required to create safer pedestrian crossings.
         (n)   Parking/loading standards. Parking and loading facilities shall
be reviewed at the master plan level. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
amount of parking proposed is adequate to serve the needs of the district and
is located and designed in such a fashion that it does not detract from the
overall appearance of the district or unreasonably interfere with pedestrian
activity.
            1.   Amount of parking.  Owing to the possibilities for shared use
of parking, the number of parking spaces in the urban village district should
not exceed the minimum parking requirements for the district computed by means
of the formulas contained in (D)(8)(n)3.
            2.   On-street parking.  On-street parking is required for all
local streets and for collector streets and shall count toward meeting parking
needs for the district. On-street parking may take the form of parallel or
angle parking and shall be built according to city standards.
            3.   Off-street parking. Applicants for rezoning to the UV Urban
Village Zoning District Classification shall propose a master parking plan
which shall provide sufficient parking for the entire project consistent with
requirements of this section. Off-street parking lots are encouraged to be
provided at the side or rear of buildings or the interior of a block of
buildings and not closer to the street than the edge profile of the structures.
No more than 20% of parking that is provided in an urban village district may
be in the form of stand-alone surface lots not located to the side or rear of
buildings. Off-street parking shall not be adjacent to street intersections. No
parking is permitted in any setback area. Individual uses in the urban village
district are not required to provide off-street parking or loading.
            4.   Loading standards. Urban village districts may share off-
street loading facilities and are therefore allowed to provide these facilities
at half the rate listed for the applicable uses. On-street loading spaces may
be counted towards the project loading requirements.
         (o)   Street trees. Street trees are required in the pedestrian zone
and along access roads at an average of one tree every 30 feet for mid-story
and under-story trees, and one tree for every 40 feet for canopy trees. In
selecting street trees, priority should be given to long-lived species proven
to function well in urban settings with a form and branching pattern compatible
with the space and type of adjacent traffic. Trees may be planted in minimum
six-foot by six-foot pits. Tree frames and grates are not required but are
recommended especially near store entrances, other sidewalk constraints, points
of ingress, egress or public gathering areas. If tree grates are not used, an
organic surfacing material shall be used to level the surface of the tree pit
with the sidewalk. This material shall receive regular maintenance. To offer
flexibility in the tree planting requirement, trees may be planted in planting
strips adjacent to the curb edge of the sidewalk. Planting strips shall be no
narrower than six feet wide. Planting strips may include grass, flowers and
other plant material where appropriate. Planting strips may not be appropriate
in pedestrian gathering areas.
         (p)   Landscape/buffering standards. Landscaping and buffering shall
be in accordance with §§
152.170 -
152.179 except as noted herein. Parking lots shall include interior and
perimeter tree plantings made up of deciduous trees at a rate of one tree for
every 1,500 square feet of vehicular use area. No parking space may be farther
than 45 feet from a tree. No shrubs are required for interior plantings for
parking lots that are behind, to the side or located at the interior of the
block of buildings. Parking areas adjacent to roadways require buffering from
the street as specified in §§
152.170 -
152.179 with the exception that the planting area will be eight feet wide.
Stand-alone parking lots shall comply with all applicable landscape and
buffering standards except that trees shall be provided at a rate of one tree
for every 1,500 square feet of parking and parking spaces shall be no further
than 45 feet from a tree. Shrubs are also required as per the regular schedule.
Landscaped islands within parking lots should be a minimum of 162 square feet
in area with a minimum width of eight feet if they are to include tree
plantings. Residential structures within an urban village may have up to a 100%
reduction in buffering requirements from the rest of the urban village.
Buffering for urban village district projects is measured and reviewed from the
parcel lot lines used to establish the district and not on an internal lot by
lot basis.
         (q)   Open space standards. Functional open space enhances circulation
within a site and contributes to the site’s aesthetic qualities. All open space
should be designed to be accessible and usable for occupants and invitees of
the development. An urban village district shall have an open space ratio of
not less than 0.30. Open space includes any portion of the site not covered by
a building or vehicular use area and any common space meeting the standards
listed in the subsection below.
         (r)   Common space standards. Common space is intended to shape the
design and character of a project through a connecting system of pedestrian
areas that create a relationship among the various components of the built
environment. It shall be designed to create areas where workers, residents and
shoppers, as the case may be, are directly or indirectly invited to gather,
browse, sit, interact or congregate. It shall be arranged as community space
with open areas, landscaping, seating facilities and lighting fixtures which
provide for safety and visual effects. Common spaces are intended to be places
for social interaction and, thus, may include impervious surfaces. Unless
interior common space is approved by the reviewing authority, common space
shall be out-of-doors. Common space design shall comply with the following:
            1.   Size. At least 10% of the acreage of a site shall be devoted
to common space. Common space shall count toward meeting open space
requirements for a project.
            2.   Trees.  One tree shall be planted for each 500 square feet of
common space. Trees shall have a minimum caliper of three to three and one-half
inches measured six inches above ground at the time of planting.
            3.   Utilities.  All utilities service lines and connections shall
be underground.
            4.   Seating.  Seating shall be provided to accommodate workers,
residents, and/or shoppers. Seating may be accomplished in whole or in part
using planters or other similar structures.
            5.   Amenities.  Common space for a development shall include two
or more of the following amenities: ornamental fountains, stairways,
waterfalls, public art, arbors, trellises, planted beds, drinking fountains,
clock pedestals, public telephones, awnings, canopies, informational kiosks,
and similar structures.
         (s)   Stormwater treatment.  Applicants shall propose, install and
maintain a stormwater treatment system for the district which, at a minimum,
meets the requirements contained in §§
152.190 -
152.199. Applicants are encouraged to utilize best management practices, such
as green roofs, stormwater gardens, and the like, to develop a system which
treats stormwater efficiently and effectively, and which does not detract from
the appearance of the district.

§ 152.030 TN TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD OVERLAY.
   (A)   (1)   The Traditional Neighborhood Overlay Zoning District
Classification is primarily intended to allow the development of residentially
zoned areas as traditional neighborhood developments (“TNDs”) exhibiting the
characteristics of TNDs appropriate to their urban context. Thus, the
application of this overlay should result in a development utilizing elements
appropriate for its relationship to the surrounding and nearby uses and
oriented to pedestrians. Pedestrian orientation should be achieved using, among
other techniques, the following:
         (a)   By providing safe walking conditions which can be achieved
through: the reduction of street widths and turning ratios from those
conventionally utilized, encouraging parking along streets in order to slow
traffic and protect pedestrians, providing mostly alley access to uses to
reduce vehicular/pedestrian conflicts and bringing dwellings closer to the
street;
         (b)   By providing walking destinations within the typical range of
pedestrians in the form of civic buildings and spaces such as parks and limited
commercial areas meeting residents’ daily needs; and
         (c)   By providing enjoyable walking environments, by reducing the
amount of parking in the fronts of sites and providing for a streetscape
appropriate in scale and design for pedestrian use.
      (2)   The types of uses allowed and the standards established for
development in this zoning classification should be compatible with the
residential character of the area, and the uses should not cause traffic
congestion, obnoxious noise, dust, odors, fire hazards or lighting
objectionable to surrounding residences, nor visually detract from the overall
appearance of the neighborhood.
   (B)    Application of overlay zone.
      (1)   Area. In order to achieve the desired intent of the overlay, it
shall not be applied to any area less than seven acres in size unless the
applicant can show that the area surrounding the proposed area of application,
when taken into account with the proposed area of application, meets the intent
of these overlay regulations.
      (2)   Density bonus.  When an area qualifies for designation as a
Traditional Neighborhood Overlay Zone, then it shall be entitled to residential
density equal to the density of the underlying zone plus 75% if it is within
one-half mile walking distance of a business district or 25% if it is not.
Commercial uses, including their required on-site parking, shall not exceed 20%
of the project area.
      (3)   Densities. The specific residential and commercial densities of the
TN zoning district shall be set forth in the regulating plan and neighborhood
code submitted as part of the application for the approval of application of
the Overlay Zone. The regulating plan shall be a conceptual plan providing for
the general location of civic, commercial and residential uses, as well as
throughways, alleys and any other significant features of the proposed project.
The neighborhood code shall set forth the design and architectural regulations
of the project, including without limitation:
         (a)   The amount of residential and commercial use allowed in the
project;
         (b)   The types of residential, commercial, mixed-use and civic
buildings and uses permitted;
         (c)   The types and dimensions of streets and thoroughfares, together
with their turning ratios, sight triangles, parking, street tree and lighting
configurations;
         (d)   The dimensions of permitted buildings, their lot sizes,
setbacks, building lines and heights;
         (e)   Any intrusions permitted in required yards;
         (f)   The location of required parking areas according to building
types as well as landscape and signage elements of the project; and
         (g)   The architectural standards to be applied within the project.
      (4)   Controls. Subject to any specific standards and limitations set
forth in these Traditional Neighborhood Overlay regulations, the approved
provisions of the regulating plan and the neighborhood code (to the extent they
address the criteria described in this section shall control the project in
lieu of the regulations set forth in this chapter).
      (5)   Approval. The provisions of this Overlay Zone shall apply only when
specifically approved for a specific property by the Town Council.
   (C)   Use regulations.
      (1)   In areas subject to the Traditional Neighborhood Overlay
Regulations, no building or land shall be used and no building shall be
hereafter erected or structurally altered unless otherwise provided in this
chapter except for the following uses and only when complying with all sections
of this chapter, including definitions:

      (2)   Commercial establishments within this Overlay Zone shall not open
to the public before 7:00 a.m. nor remain open to the public after 10:00 p.m.
daily. Any establishment operating in this Overlay Zone shall maintain and/or
store all equipment or goods related to the business within the principal
building except for displays in the front yard or sidewalk that do not
interfere with the flow of sidewalk traffic nor endanger the public.
   (D)   Dimensional requirements.
      (1)   Minimum front yard requirement - 0 feet. The minimum front yard
setback from any street shall be measured from the nearest edge of the right-
of-way.
      (2)   Minimum rear yard requirement - 0 feet.
      (3)   Minimum side yard requirements - two side yards totaling at least
ten feet with one side not less than five feet and no buildings closer than ten
feet. On all corner lots, the side yard adjacent to the street shall be
adequately sized to allow for appropriate traffic sight triangles.
      (4)   Maximum building height - the greater of three stories (not to
exceed 14 feet each, with space within one story able to intrude through other
stories) together with a roof of reasonable proportions and an elevation of not
more than four feet before the first floor or 35 feet.
      (5)   Minimum lot size - none.
      (6)   Setbacks for commercial use properties adjoining residential uses
not subject to this Overlay Zone shall provide for a minimum of a ten-foot
setback along any side abutting a Residential District in which is located a
buffer strip as defined in §
152.175.
   (E)   Design and appearance standards. All development subject to the
Overlay Zone shall conform to the following design and appearance standards.
      (1)   Outdoor lighting. Outdoor lighting fixtures other than street
lights shall be designed and located so as to prevent material quantities of
light from shining directly on vehicular traffic or adjoining property.
Lighting shall generally be downward directed or shielded to help protect the
night sky.
      (2)   Landscaping. A minimum of 20% of the lot area, excluding paved or

landscaping, plaza, courtyard patio or similar uses. The landscaping may
include existing vegetation. The property owner shall be responsible for the
maintenance of the landscaping and the replacement of all dead plant material.
Street trees shall be incorporated in the landscaping for property abutting
public rights-of-way. The trees shall be deciduous and be maintained, and all
dead materials shall be replaced by the next growing season.
      (3)   Design. All new construction and renovation within this Overlay
Zone is encouraged to conform to the following standards: where possible, the
project should use indigenous materials of the region, including stone and
wood. Buildings, structures and grounds shall be designed using materials,
finishes and proportions in a manner that will produce a coordinated appearance
with adjacent properties.

determining whether a use meets the parking requirements set forth herein, any
parking space located along the street and contiguous to the lot of such use
may be counted toward the satisfaction of such use’s parking requirements up to
one half of such requirements. Spaces that straddle property lines shall count
toward the lot fronting the majority of the space unless this would render the
other lot without street parking.
      (5)   Signage. Signs shall be in compliance with the Town of Franklin
Sign Regulations (
Chapter 155) except that commercial uses with their parking behind their
building shall be allowed twice the area of signage normally allowed provided
not more than one-half of the signage is located at the rear of the building
and designed and positioned only to be seen from such parking area. Commercial
uses shall be allowed to use the signage permitted for non-residential uses in
residential developments, provided that the dimensions of the free-standing
sign permitted herein shall be added to those permitted in attached signs and
may be utilized in attached signs (perpendicular or parallel to the building)
or awning signs. Free-standing, detached signs are not allowed in the Overlay
Zone. Temporary sandwich board signs advertising restaurant menus are permitted
in the Overlay Zone immediately in front of the restaurant served thereby,
provided that they do not interfere with use of the sidewalk nor endanger the
public.
   (F)   Additional standards.

§ 152.034 CONDITIONAL ZONING DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. For each general use zoning district, this section authorizes
the creation of parallel conditional zoning districts that have the same
requirements as the general use district, as modified by one or more site-
specific conditions. The conditional zoning district classification allows the
Town Council to consider proposed uses and tailor the zoning to accommodate
those uses while addressing anticipated problems that may arise from the
establishment of the proposed uses. This section sets forth the types of
conditional zoning districts and explains their relationship to the general use
districts.
      (1)   District. Each general use district shall have a corresponding
conditional zoning district and shall be indicated on the official zoning map
by the initials “CZ” behind the associated base zoning district designation.
District  Classification
District                                                   Classification
R-1 (CZ)  Conditional Zoning Residential District           Residential
R-2 (CZ)  Conditional Zoning Residential District           Residential
NMU (CZ)  Conditional Zoning Neighborhood Mix Use District  Mixed Use
MICR (CZ) Conditional Zoning Medical Institutional Cultural Mixed Use
          Residential District
UV (CZ)   Conditional Zoning Urban Village                  Mixed Use
C-1 (CZ)  Conditional Zoning Central Commercial             Commercial
C-2 (CZ)  Conditional Zoning Secondary Commercial District  Commercial
C-3 (CZ)  Conditional Zoning Highway Commercial District    Commercial
I-1 (CZ)  Conditional Zoning Industrial District            Industrial
 
      (2)   Applicability. Due to their size and level of activity, major
developments are expected to have a significant impact on public services and
infrastructure and need to be managed for the benefit of the neighborhood or
town as a whole. Approval of any major development within the town's planning
jurisdiction requires rezoning to one of the conditional districts below. For
purposes of this section, MAJOR DEVELOPMENT is defined as a residential
development or common plan of development containing 20 or more dwelling units,
or a commercial or industrial development, or common plan of development,
containing more than 15,000 square feet of interior floor space. The
conditional zoning review process established by this section shall be required
prior to permitting any major development within the town's planning
jurisdiction, regardless of present zoning district.
   (B)   Fee. A fee shall be paid to the town for a conditional rezoning to
cover the costs of advertising and other administrative expenses. The fee shall
be set by a resolution of the Town Council.
   (C)   Pre-application conference. It is recommended that any person desiring
to use or develop land pursuant to a conditional rezoning schedule a pre-
application conference with the Land Use Administrator to become familiar with
the conditional rezoning process and to identify and correct, if possible,
potential problem areas with a development concept. Submittals for a pre-
application meeting include a location map and a sketch plan of the project,
including property boundaries, building footprints, parking, driveways,
entrance locations, and such other information which may be requested by the
Land Use Administrator.
   (D)   Application. Applications for a conditional rezoning shall be made to
the Land Use Administrator on forms prescribed by the Land Use Administrator.
The application must be signed by all owners of the property to be included.
      (1)   Contents. Applications shall include the name and address of the
applicant, the name and address of the owner of each zoning lot involved, and
the relationship of the applicant and property owner(s) in connection with the
application. If the applicant is other than the record owner of the property,
the consent of the record owner to the application shall be noted on the
application or in some other fashion acceptable to the Land Use Administrator.
The application shall also designate an agent for the project to whom notice
may be given by the town. The Land Use Administrator shall prescribe any other
material that may reasonably be required to determine compliance with this
subchapter, with sufficient copies for necessary referrals and records.
      (2)   Conceptual plan. To facilitate the discussion during the
neighborhood compatibility meeting required by division (E), the applicant
shall submit to the Land Use Administrator, as a part of the application for a
conditional rezoning, a conceptual plan showing how development is proposed for
the site. The conceptual plan shall show the location and boundaries of the
property and how individual buildings are to be situated on the site, including
distances from these buildings to property lines, as well as proposed drives
and parking. The locations of signs and outdoor lighting shall also be shown
where appropriate. Proposed restrictive covenants, if available, shall also be
presented. The conceptual plan need not be exactly to scale; although, all
distances and dimensions shall be shown.
   (E)   Neighborhood compatibility meeting. This subchapter provides a process
whereby affected property owners, residents and developers have an opportunity
to participate in a dialogue as to how development is to be integrated into
their neighborhoods. This is accomplished by a neighborhood compatibility
meeting to be facilitated by the Land Use Administrator or his or her designee
within 21 days of receipt of a complete application, including the required fee
and conceptual plan.
      (1)   Notification of participants. At least ten calendar days prior to
the meeting, notice of the meeting shall be given in the following fashion.
         (a)   The developer shall be informed of the meeting by mail. Failure
of the developer, or his or her authorized agent, to attend this meeting shall
lead to an automatic annulment of the application.
         (b)   Property owners within 400 feet of any property line of the
proposed sites shall be informed of the meeting by mail.
         (c)   All other persons shall be informed of the meeting by a
conspicuously placed standardized on-site sign.
      (2)   The developer's presentation. During the neighborhood compatibility
meeting the developer shall explain to the affected property owners the
proposed use for the site. The presentation shall include the developer's
position on the compatibility of the project. It is always the developer's
responsibility to propose a compatible project.
      (3)   Relevant topics to be discussed. Following the developer's
presentation, affected property owners and residents shall be permitted time to
question the developer about points which remain unclear. Questioning shall
center on the proposal's compatibility as presented, not the question of
whether the site should be developed or its use changed.
      (4)   Result of neighborhood compatibility meeting. Following the
exchange of views between the developer and affected property owners/residents,
the Land Use Administrator shall review orally the points voiced during the
informal compatibility meeting. Included in the review shall be proposals or
counter-proposals to which both parties have agreed in an effort to make the
project compatible, as well as those points where disagreement still exists.
Upon conclusion of the review, the Land Use Administrator shall ask those
assembled if the positions presented represent an accurate consensus of the
opinions expressed by the developer and affected property owners/residents.
When they do, the meeting shall be concluded and the Land Use Administrator
shall record the opinions in the Land Use Administrator's report. The Land Use
Administrator's report shall become a part of the application file.
   (F)   Preliminary development plan and completeness review.
      (1)   Upon completion of the neighborhood compatibility meeting, it shall
be the responsibility of the applicant to submit a preliminary development plan
meeting the requirements of division (F)(3), below. The Land Use Administrator
shall cause the application to be reviewed for completeness and shall notify
the developer in writing if the application is incomplete, specifying what
additional information is needed in order for the application to be deemed
complete.
      (2)   It shall then be incumbent upon the applicant either to provide the
additional information requested by the Land Use Administrator or, if he or she
believes providing the requested information is unreasonably burdensome, to
notify the Land Use Administrator in writing that he or she declines to provide
the information requested. Upon receipt of all requested information or, in the
alternative, written notice from the applicant that no further information will
be provided, the Land Use Administrator shall refer copies of the proposal to
such other representatives of the town and to such other agencies or officials
as may be appropriate to determine if it conforms to the provisions of this
chapter and to such other regulations applicable in the case. Alternatively,
the Land Use Administrator may determine that the incompletion of the
application renders it out of compliance with the requirements of this chapter
and that therefore it will not receive further consideration by the town. The
Land Use Administrator shall notify the applicant of this decision in writing.
The Land Use Administrator's determination that an application is incomplete
may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment pursuant to §
152.075.
      (3)   Contents of preliminary development plan.
         (a)   The preliminary development plan for projects undergoing special
use review shall show the following:
            1.   The date of the development plan or submittal, including any

to wetlands, major rock outcrops and lakes or streams.
            10.   The proposed transportation network for the project
including, but not limited to, the following.
               a.   All proposed streets, clearly identified as public or
private, with proposed names, pavement widths and rights-of-way;
               b.   Sight distances for all entrances and exits and their
relationship to street and driveway intersections within a 200-foot radius of
the intersection of such entrance and exit with any public right-of-way;
               c.   All alleys, driveways, and curb cuts for public streets
(provided further that, whenever any alley, driveway or curb cut will intersect
with a public sidewalk and/or street maintained by the town, the development

               b.   All utility or other pipes, wiring, conduits, cables, and
fixtures, including but not limited to electrical, gas, telephone and
telecommunications lines, fiberoptic cables and the like. All such lines shall
be installed underground, except for transmission lines with a voltage of 11SkV
or greater or in situations where such placement is prohibited by law, or where
such requirement is relieved by a variance.
               c.    Easements to be provided to the town for utility
activities which shall include but not be limited to improving, upgrading,

such pipelines, laterals, interceptors, mains, manholes, conduits, facilities,
and related appurtenances as may be necessary or convenient for the receipt,
conveyance, transmission, and distribution of water, reclaimed water, and/or
wastewater and for access thereto. Where necessary, easements shall be centered
along or adjacent to lot lines to the greatest extent practicable. Easements
shall be sized in accordance with the town's Standard Specifications and
Details Manual. No structures or other improvements shall be placed within any
town utility easement. Ground covers or grasses may be planted within an
easement. No trees or shrubbery of any size shall be placed within any town
utility easement because of the need for access by utility maintenance
personnel and line damage that tree and shrub roots can cause. Any improvements
installed within the easement area are subject to disturbance or damage, and
may be removed by the town. All permitted and special uses shall be connected
to and served by public water and sanitary sewer services.
               d.    Where connection to public water and sanitary sewer
systems is required, such systems shall be constructed to town standards,
sizes, and specifications and dedicated to the town for operation and
maintenance, thus allowing for the orderly expansion of the town, its water and
sanitary sewer systems, and fire protection services, which protect the health
of the town's citizens and environment.
               e.    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring
the town to maintain individual service lines for water and sanitary sewer
beyond their point of connection to the town's systems, which shall be and
remain the responsibility of the property owner pursuant to town policy.
               f.   The requirements of this division may be relaxed, provided
that the application is for one or more land use activities for which relaxed
submittal requirements may be permitted by the Land Use Administrator pursuant
to §
152.052(A).
            12.   Location and size of all existing and proposed entrances and
exits to the site.
            13.   Proposed reservations or dedications for parks, playgrounds,

152.105, below.
            22.   Elevations of all facades, including existing structures to
remain, drawn to a reasonable scale which shall be not less than 1/8-inch
equals one foot. Plans shall designate proposed materials and colors of
architectural features.
         (b)   The Land Use Administrator has the authority to waive any
application requirement where the type of use or the scale of the project makes
providing that information unnecessary or impractical. The Land Use
Administrator or Town Council may request additional information from the
applicant where such is necessary to enable a fully-informed decision on the
matter.
      (4)   Completeness review. Upon receipt of a preliminary development
plan, the Land Use Administrator shall cause the application to be reviewed for
completeness and shall notify the applicant in writing if the application is
incomplete, specifying what additional information is needed in order for the
application to be deemed complete. It shall then be incumbent upon the
applicant either to provide the additional information requested by the Land
Use Administrator or, if he or she believes providing the requested information
is unreasonably burdensome, to notify the Land Use Administrator in writing
that he or she declines to provide the information requested. Upon receipt of
all requested information or, in the alternative, written notice from the
applicant that no further information will be provided, the Land Use
Administrator shall refer copies of the proposal to such other representatives
as may be appropriate to determine if it conforms to the provisions of this
chapter and to such other regulations applicable in the matter. Alternatively,
the Land Use Administrator may determine that the incompletion of the
application renders it out of compliance with the requirements of this chapter
and that therefore it will not receive further consideration by the town. The
Land Use Administrator shall notify the applicant of this decision in writing.
The Land Use Administrator's determination that an application is incomplete
may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment pursuant to §
152.075.
   (G)   Processing of application. On the completion date the application will
then be scheduled for the next Planning Board meeting that is at least 24 days
in the future. Substantial modification of the application subsequent to the
complete date may result in the application being deferred to a subsequent
meeting of the Planning Board. Any material modification of the application
within seven days prior to the Planning Board meeting shall result in deferral
of the application to the next available meeting. For purposes of this section,
the application shall include the preliminary or conceptual development plan,
as the case may be.
   (H)   Review and approval. Conditional zoning applications are intended for
development proposals that are ready to proceed from plan approval to
construction in a timely manner. As a result, each project must include a site
plan that meets the requirements listed in this section, as modified by any
site-specific conditions, as well as any other plans, drawings, renderings,
elevations, maps, and documents specifically included as development documents
for approval.
      (1)   Formal staff review. Town staff shall review the development plan
to identify issues with the proposed development and determine compliance with
the requirements of this chapter. Town staff will provide detailed comments to
the applicable reviewing board regarding issues identified and recommend any
needed changes to the development plan to bring it into compliance with the
requirements of this chapter and/or other legal requirements.
      (2)   Public hearing. The conditional zoning district rezoning approval
decision is a legislative process subject to judicial review using the same
procedures and standard of review as apply to general use district rezoning
decisions. The conditional zoning application shall be considered and treated
as a zoning map amendment. In considering any petition for a conditional zoning
district rezoning, the town shall follow all of the procedures set forth in §
152.63, governing zoning map amendments.
   (I)   Final action. Upon completion of the hearing required in division (K),
the Town Council shall act on the application based on the findings of fact
contained herein. Action on the application shall be one of the following: (1)
approval; (2) approval subject to conditions; or (3) denial. The Land Use
Administrator shall notify the applicant of the Council's decision in writing.
If the application is approved with agreed upon conditions, the Land Use
Administrator shall issue the necessary conditional rezoning in accordance with
the action of Council. The conditional rezoning, including all conditions
attached thereto, shall run with the land and shall be binding on the original
applicant as well as all successors.
   (J)   Effect of approval.
      (1)   If a petition is approved under this section, the conditional
district that is established, the approved petition, and all conditions which
may have been attached to the approval, are binding on the property as an
amendment to this chapter and to the zoning map. All subsequent development and
use of the property shall be in accordance with the standards for the approved
conditional rezoning, including the conceptual or preliminary development plan,
and all conditions attached to the approval, unless such approval shall lapse
or the property is rezoned.
      (2)   If a petition is approved, the petitioner shall comply with all
requirements established for obtaining a land development permit, a building
permit and certificate of occupancy. Only those uses and structures indicated
in the approved petition and development plan shall be allowed on the subject
property. Any development in the district shall comply with all provisions of
and conditions to the approved petition and development plan.
   (K)   Final development plans. Final development plans shall be reviewed by
the Land Use Administrator to ensure conformance with the requirements set
forth in §
152.052(E). Final development plans shall include any modifications agreed to
as conditions of issuance of the conditional rezoning as well as a list of any
conditions and a list of any uses as stipulated in the conditional rezoning.
   (L)   Issuance of land development permit. A conditional rezoning does not
authorize development; rather, it approves a development concept for a
particular property. In order to develop the property in accordance with the
conditional rezoning, a land development permit is required. A land development
permit shall be issued upon certification by the Land Use Administrator that he
or she has received a final development plan demonstrating compliance with the
preliminary or conceptual development plan, as well as all terms and conditions
of the conditional rezoning.

DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
§ 152.050 PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE.
   It is the intent of this subchapter to provide the process by which proposed
development is reviewed and the standards by which it is to be evaluated. All
development shall require prior authorization from the appropriate person or
entity. This subchapter establishes two levels of review: (1) development plan
review, which applies to most development, subdivisions, and land use
activities, is set forth in §
152.052; and (2) special use review, which is designed for development expected
to have the greatest impacts, is set forth in §
152.053. The remaining sections of this subchapter contain requirements which
apply to one or more of the levels of review.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.051 LAND DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REQUIRED.
   A land development permit, in conformance with the provisions of this
subchapter, is required prior to the commencement of any development,
subdivision, or land use activity. A land development permit shall not be
issued until development plans and necessary additional information demonstrate
full compliance with this subchapter. When a building permit or sign permit is
required, such permit shall not be issued prior to issuance of the land
development permit required for the development, and such building or sign
permit shall comply with the approved land development permit, including all
conditions of approval attached thereto. No building or structure for which a
land development permit has been issued shall be used or occupied until, after
final inspection, a certificate of occupancy has been issued indicating
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter and all other state and local
laws, including conditions of the land development permit. Review and issuance
of land development permits is a function of the Land Use Administrator or his
or her designee.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.052 DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW.
   (A)   Development plan review and approval in accordance with this section
is required prior to issuance of a land development permit for any development,
subdivision or land use activity except for projects required by this
subchapter to undergo special use review pursuant to §
152.053, below. The Land Use Administrator is authorized to relax the submittal
requirements for certain development activities described below so long as the
purposes and goals of this subchapter are not compromised and so long as such
requirements are contained in an administrative order and made readily
available to the public. The land use activities for which relaxed submittal
requirements are permissible are as follows:
      (1)   Development of a single- or two-family dwelling on a zoning lot, or
any uses accessory thereto;
      (2)   Any commercial, industrial, or institutional development consisting
of less than 5,000 square feet of floor area;
      (3)   Addition of not more than 15% of previously existing parking
spaces, or ten parking spaces, whichever is greater;
      (4)   Any sign;
      (5)   Any subdivision of a tract of land of five acres or less into five
or fewer lots and involving no new public or private streets or roads, right-
of-way dedication, easements, or utility extensions.
   (B)   Applications. There are two types of development plan review,
preliminary and final, as described below. All applications for development
plan approval shall be made to the Land Use Administrator on such forms as he
or she may prescribe. Applications shall include, without limitation, the name
and address of the applicant, the name and address of the owner of all the
property involved, the relationship of the applicant and property owner(s) in
connection with the application, and a development plan conforming to the
specifications of division (D). If the applicant is other than the record owner
of the property, the consent of the record owner to the application shall be
noted on the application or in some other fashion acceptable to the Land Use
Administrator. The application shall also designate an agent for the project to
whom notice may be given by the town. The Land Use Administrator shall
prescribe any other material that may reasonably be required to determine
compliance with this subchapter and shall require sufficient copies for
necessary referrals and records.
   (C)   Fees. A fee shall be paid to the Town of Franklin for each application
for development plan approval to cover the costs of advertising and other
administrative expenses. Such fee shall be set by a resolution of the Town
Council.
   (D)   Review of preliminary development plans. Preliminary development plan
approval is not required under this subchapter. It is recommended for large or
complicated projects where the costs of developing detailed final plans can be
substantial. It is designed to provide the applicant an opportunity to obtain
at a reasonable cost binding authorization to develop property in a certain
fashion. Review of preliminary plans is a function of the Land Use
Administrator.
      (1)   Processing of applications for preliminary development plan
approval. The Land Use Administrator shall conduct a preliminary review of an
application to determine if it is complete, which is to say, all information
requested on the application has been provided and the development plan
contains all items required by division (D)(2)(a). If the Land Use
Administrator determines that an application is incomplete, he or she shall
notify the applicant in writing of all deficiencies. Once the Land Use
Administrator determines the application to be complete, he or she may request
an analysis to be made by qualified representatives of the town and such other
agencies or officials as appear appropriate in the circumstances of the case,
to determine compliance with applicable provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Contents of preliminary development plan.  
         (a)   Applicants for developments opting to undergo preliminary
development plan review shall, as a part of the application for such
development, submit a preliminary development plan which shall show the
following:

revisions thereto.
            2.   The proposed title of the project and the name of the
engineer, architect, landscape architect, planner and/or licensed surveyor;
developer; and owner of record.
            3.   The north arrow point, scale at not greater than one inch
equals 40 feet and such information as the names of adjacent roads, streams,
railroads, subdivisions or other landmarks sufficient to clearly identify the
location of the property.
            4.   Location of site by an insert vicinity map at a scale no less
than one inch equals 2,000 feet.
            5.   Existing project zoning and zoning of adjacent property, to
include properties abutting either side of a public right-of-way.
            6.   Town limits line, and/or extraterritorial jurisdiction
boundary, or a note indicating that the project site and any adjoining parcels
are totally within or without the town limits.
            7.   Names of adjacent property owners.
            8.   Boundary survey of site and the location of all existing
easements, buildings, rights-of-way or other encroachments.
            9.   Location of 100-year floodplain and floodway, if applicable.

providing that information unnecessary or impractical. The Land Use
Administrator may require additional information from the applicant where such
is necessary to enable a fully informed decision on the matter.
      (3)   Standards for review. An application for preliminary development
plan approval shall not be approved unless the Land Use Administrator
determines that the application and preliminary development plan demonstrate
compliance with this chapter, including the provisions of §
152.060, below, and other applicable regulations. The Land Use Administrator
may impose such reasonable conditions on an approval as will ensure such
compliance with this subchapter.
      (4)   Review by Town Council.  Within 15 days of the date of the
rendition of a decision of the Land Use Administrator, the applicant may file a
notice with the Town Clerk requesting the Town Council to review such decision.

be granted until such time as the time to seek review as provided herein has
passed or, if review is requested, until such time as the Town Council has
taken final action on such application.
      (5)   Effect of preliminary development plan approval. Approval of a
preliminary development plan entitles the applicant to the issuance of a land
development permit upon payment of the applicable fee and submittal of an
application and final development plans meeting the requirements of division
(E), below. The applicant shall have two years from the date of such approval
to obtain final development plan approval. An applicant who has been granted
preliminary development plan approval shall be divested of the right to develop
in accordance with such preliminary development plan approval if the applicant
fails to obtain final development plan approval in accordance with this
section.
   (E)   Review of final development plans.  All development for which
development plan approval is required shall undergo final development plan
review, including development which has received preliminary development plan
approval pursuant to division (D)(3), above, and development which has received
a special use permit pursuant to §
152.053, below. Final development plan review is a final step prior to issuance
of a land development permit. The process is intended to provide a means for
town staff to review detailed plans to ensure the project meets development
standards in this chapter as well as any other applicable regulations and any
conditions which may have been imposed as a part of any preliminary or
conceptual approval.
      (1)   Processing of applications for final development plan approval.
         (a)   The Land Use Administrator shall conduct a preliminary review of
an application to determine if it is complete, which is to say, all information
requested on the application has been provided and the development plan
contains all items required by division (E)(3). If the Land Use Administrator
determines that an application is incomplete, he or she shall notify the
applicant in writing of all deficiencies.
         (b)   Once the Land Use Administrator determines the application to be
complete, he or she may cause an analysis to be made by qualified
representatives of the town and such other agencies or officials as appear
appropriate in the circumstances of the case, to determine compliance with
applicable provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Standards for review.  The Land Use Administrator shall render a
decision in writing either approving or denying the application. An application
for final development plan approval shall not be approved unless the Land Use
Administrator determines that the application and final development plan (1)
conform with preliminary development plan approval, if applicable, (2) conform
with a special use permit, if applicable, and (3) demonstrate compliance with
this chapter and other applicable regulations. If the decision is to deny the
application, the Land Use Administrator shall recite with specificity the
reasons for such denial.

§ 152.053 SPECIAL USE REVIEW.
   (A)   Special use review provides an alternative to traditional zoning by
coupling an application for rezoning with an application for a special use
permit specifying the intended use(s) along with a conceptual development plan
and any proposed conditions to be placed upon the property. Development or uses
required to undergo special use review pursuant to this subchapter shall occur
only after issuance and recordation of a special use permit. The following
developments or uses are required to undergo special use:
      (1)   Any uses in exceeding the max building size as described in §§
152.020 -
152.033; and
      (2)   Any uses designated as special uses in §§
152.020 -
152.033.
   (B)   Fee.  A fee shall be paid to the Town of Franklin for each application
for a special use permit to cover the costs of advertising and other
administrative expenses. The fee shall be set by a resolution of the Town
Council.
   (C)   Pre-application conference. It is recommended that any person desiring
to use or develop land pursuant to a special use permit schedule a pre-
application conference with the Land Use Administrator to become familiar with
the special use permit process and to identify and correct, if possible,
potential problem areas with a development concept. Submittals for a pre-
application meeting include a location map and a sketch plan of the project,
including property boundaries, building footprints, parking, driveways,
entrance locations, and such other information which may be requested by the
Land Use Administrator.
   (D)   Application. Applications for a special use permit shall be made to
the Land Use Administrator on forms prescribed by the Land Use Administrator.
      (1)   Contents. Applications shall include the name and address of the
applicant, the name and address of the owner of each zoning lot involved, and
the relationship of the applicant and property owner(s) in connection with the
application. If the applicant is other than the record owner of the property,
the consent of the record owner to the application shall be noted on the
application or in some other fashion acceptable to the Land Use Administrator.
The application shall also designate an agent for the project to whom notice
may be given by the town. The Land Use Administrator shall prescribe any other
material that may reasonably be required to determine compliance with this
subchapter, with sufficient copies for necessary referrals and records.
      (2)   Conceptual plan.  To facilitate the discussion during the
neighborhood compatibility meeting required by division (G), the applicant
shall submit to the Land Use Administrator, as a part of the application for a
special use permit, a conceptual plan showing how development is proposed for
the site. The conceptual plan shall show the location and boundaries of the
property and how individual buildings are to be situated on the site, including
distances from these buildings to property lines, as well as proposed drives
and parking. The locations of signs and outdoor lighting shall also be shown
where appropriate. Proposed restrictive covenants, if available, shall also be
presented. The conceptual plan need not be exactly to scale; although, all
distances and dimensions shall be shown.
   (E)   Neighborhood compatibility meeting.  This subchapter provides a
process whereby affected property owners, residents and developers have an
opportunity to participate in a dialog as to how development is to be
integrated into their neighborhoods. This is accomplished by a neighborhood
compatibility meeting to be facilitated by the Land Use Administrator or his or
her designee within 21 days of receipt of a complete application, including the
required fee and conceptual plan.
      (1)   Notification of participants. At least seven calendar days prior to
the meeting, notice of the meeting shall be given in the following fashion:
         (a)   The developer shall be informed of the meeting by mail. Failure
of the developer, or his or her authorized agent, to attend this meeting shall
lead to an automatic annulment of the application.
         (b)   Property owners within 400 feet of any property line of the
proposed sites shall be informed of the meeting by mail.
         (c)   All other persons shall be informed of the meeting by a
conspicuously placed standardized on-site sign.
      (2)   The developer’s presentation. During the neighborhood compatibility
meeting the developer shall explain to the affected property owners the
proposed use for the site. The presentation shall include the developer’s
position on the compatibility of the project. It is always the developer’s
responsibility to propose a compatible project.
      (3)   Relevant topics to be discussed. Following the developer’s
presentation, affected property owners and residents shall be permitted time to
question the developer about points which remain unclear. Questioning shall
center on the proposal’s compatibility as presented, not the question of
whether the site should be developed or its use changed.
      (4)   Result of neighborhood compatibility meeting. Following the
exchange of views between the developer and affected property owners/residents,
the Land Use Administrator shall review orally the points voiced during the
informal compatibility meeting. Included in the review shall be proposals or
counter-proposals to which both parties have agreed in an effort to make the
project compatible, as well as those points where disagreement still exists.
Upon conclusion of the review, the Land Use Administrator shall ask those
assembled if the positions presented represent an accurate consensus of the
opinions expressed by the developer and affected property owners/residents.
When they do, the meeting shall be concluded and the Land Use Administrator
shall record the opinions in the Land Use Administrator’s report. The Land Use
Administrator’s report shall become a part of the application file.
   (F)   Preliminary development plan and completeness review.  
      (1)   Upon completion of the neighborhood compatibility meeting, it shall
be the responsibility of the applicant to submit a preliminary development plan
meeting the requirements of division (H)(3), below. The Land Use Administrator
shall cause the application to be reviewed for completeness and shall notify
the developer in writing if the application is incomplete, specifying what
additional information is needed in order for the application to be deemed
complete.
      (2)   It shall then be incumbent upon the applicant either to provide the
additional information requested by the Land Use Administrator or, if he
believes providing the requested information is unreasonably burdensome, to
notify the Land Use Administrator in writing that he declines to provide the
information requested. Upon receipt of all requested information or, in the
alternative, written notice from the applicant that no further information will
be provided, the Land Use Administrator shall refer copies of the proposal to
such other representatives of the town and to such other agencies or officials
as may be appropriate to determine if it conforms to the provisions of this
zoning ordinance and to such other regulations applicable in the case.
Alternatively, the Land Use Administrator may determine that the incompletion
of the application renders it out of compliance with the requirements of this
chapter and that therefore it will not receive further consideration by the
town. The Land Use Administrator shall notify the applicant of this decision in
writing. The Land Use Administrator’s determination that an application is
incomplete may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment pursuant to §
152.075.
      (3)   Contents of preliminary development plan.

including, but not limited to, the following:
               a.   All proposed streets, clearly identified as public or
private, with proposed names, pavement widths and rights-of-way;
               b.   Sight distances for all entrances and exits and their
relationship to street and driveway intersections within a 200-foot radius of
the intersection of such entrance and exit with any public right-of-way;
               c.   All alleys, driveways, and curb cuts for public streets
(provided further that, whenever any alley, driveway or curb cut will intersect
with a public sidewalk and/or street maintained by the town, the development
plan submitted shall include a form approved by the town's Public Works
Director, demonstrating compliance with applicable regulations, including
without limitation the North Carolina Department of Transportation Driveway
Manual);
               d.   All handicap ramps;
               e.    Off-street loading and unloading areas;
               f.    Provisions for off-street parking spaces including
calculations indicating the number of parking spaces required and the number
provided;
               g.    Typical cross-sections of public or private streets; and
               h.    Pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
            11.   Preliminary utility layout, including design plans for
location of the following:
               a.   Water mains, sanitary sewers, and functional fire
protection systems to be installed prior to final plan approval, in accordance
with adopted town policies and the town's Standard Specifications and Details
Manual.
               b.   All utility or other pipes, wiring, conduits, cables, and
fixtures, including but not limited to electrical, gas, telephone and
telecommunications lines, fiberoptic cables and the like. All such lines shall
be installed underground, except for transmission lines with a voltage of 115kV
or greater or in situations where such placement is prohibited by law, or where
such requirement is relieved by a variance.
               c.    Easements to be provided to the town for utility
activities which shall include but not be limited to improving, upgrading,
removing, inspecting, replacing, repairing, maintaining, using, and operating
such pipelines, laterals, interceptors, mains, manholes, conduits, facilities,
and related appurtenances as may be necessary or convenient for the receipt,
conveyance, transmission, and distribution of water, reclaimed water, and/or
wastewater and for access thereto. Where necessary, easements shall be centered
along or adjacent to lot lines to the greatest extent practicable. Easements
shall be sized in accordance with the town's Standard Specifications and
Details Manual No structures or other improvements shall be placed within any
town utility easement. Ground covers or grasses may be planted within an
easement. No trees or shrubbery of any size shall be placed within any town
utility easement because of the need for access by utility maintenance
personnel and line damage that tree and shrub roots can cause. Any improvements
installed within the easement area are subject to disturbance or damage, and
may be removed by the town. All permitted and special uses shall be connected
to and served by public water and sanitary sewer services.
               d.    Where connection to public water and sanitary sewer
systems is required, such systems shall be constructed to town standards,
sizes, and specifications and dedicated to the town for operation and
maintenance, thus allowing for the orderly expansion of the town, its water and
sanitary sewer systems, and fire protection services, which protect the health
of the town's citizens and environment.
               e.    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring
the town to maintain individual service lines for water and sanitary sewer
beyond their point of connection to the town's systems, which shall be and
remain the responsibility of the property owner pursuant to town policy.
               f.   The requirements of this division may be relaxed, provided
that the application is for one or more land use activities for which relaxed
submittal requirements may be permitted by the Land Use Administrator pursuant
to §
152.052(A).
            12.   Location and size of all existing and proposed entrances and
exits to the site.
            13.   Proposed reservations or dedications for parks, playgrounds,

            17.   General location and intended use of all buildings with their
dimensions, the number of floors, total floor area and maximum height above
lowest ground point of each building. If several models of units are being
offered for sale and the type of unit at each building location is not known,
then a general outline of the unit to be constructed may be shown at the
building location.
            18.   Notations to include the total project area, proposed lot
areas (or individual areas to be owned by a homeowners association), the amount
and percentage of the site to be covered by buildings, open space, streets and
parking and other facilities.
            19.   General location, size, height, orientation and appearance of
proposed signs.
            20.   General location of proposed project phasing lines and
notation including special conditions pertinent to establishing sales or model
units, if applicable.
            21.   A traffic impact analysis, if one is required by the terms of
this chapter demonstrating the project will comply with the requirements of §
152.060, below.
            22.   Elevations of all facades, including existing structures to
remain, drawn to a reasonable scale which shall be not less than 1/8-inch
equals one foot. Plans shall designate proposed materials and colors of
architectural features.
         (b)   The Land Use Administrator has the authority to waive any
application requirement where the type of use or the scale of the project makes
providing that information unnecessary or impractical. The Land Use
Administrator or Board of Adjustment may request additional information from
the applicant where such is necessary to enable a fully-informed decision on
the matter.
      (4)   Completeness review. Upon receipt of a preliminary development
plan, the Land Use Administrator shall cause the application to be reviewed for
completeness and shall notify the applicant in writing if the application is
incomplete, specifying what additional information is needed in order for the
application to be deemed complete. It shall then be incumbent upon the
applicant either to provide the additional information requested by the Land
Use Administrator or, if he or she believes providing the requested information
is unreasonably burdensome, to notify the Land Use Administrator in writing
that he or she declines to provide the information requested. Upon receipt of
all requested information or, in the alternative, written notice from the
applicant that no further information will be provided, the Land Use
Administrator shall refer copies of the proposal to such other representatives
as may be appropriate to determine if it conforms to the provisions of this
chapter and to such other regulations applicable in the matter. Alternatively,
the Land Use Administrator may determine that the incompletion of the
application renders it out of compliance with the requirements of this chapter
and that therefore it will not receive further consideration by the town. The
Land Use Administrator shall notify the applicant of this decision in writing.
The Land Use Administrator’s determination that an application is incomplete
may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment pursuant to §
152.075.
   (G)   Processing of application. The completion date for the application
shall be the date of receipt of either (1) all information requested by the
Land Use Administrator pursuant to division (H) or (2) written notice from the
applicant that no further information shall be provided. The application will
then be scheduled for the next Planning Board meeting that is at least 24 days
in the future. Substantial modification of the application subsequent to the
complete date may result in the application being deferred to a subsequent
meeting of the Planning Board. Any material modification of the application
within seven days prior to the Planning Board meeting shall result in deferral
of the application to the next available meeting. For purposes of this section,
the application shall include the preliminary or conceptual development plan,
as the case may be.
   (H)   Public hearing.  Within 45 days of receiving the application from the
Board of Adjustment shall conduct a quasi-judicial public hearing on the
application. Notice of the date, time and place of the public hearing shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for two successive
weeks with the first notice to be published not less than ten nor more than 25
days prior to the date of the hearing. Similar notice shall also be mailed to
the owner of the property which is the subject of the application and the
owners of all parcels of land situated within 400 feet of any of the boundaries
of the subject parcel. Ownership shall be determined by reference to the Macon
County tax listing.
   (I)   Final action.  Upon completion of the hearing required in division
(K), the Board of Adjustment shall act on the application based on the findings
of fact contained herein. Action on the application shall be one of the
following: (1) approval; (2) approval subject to conditions; or (3) denial. The
Land Use Administrator shall notify the applicant of the Board’s decision in
writing. If the application is approved or approved with conditions, the Land
Use Administrator shall issue the necessary special use permit in accordance
with the action of Board. The special use permit, including all conditions
attached thereto, shall run with the land and shall be binding on the original
applicant as well as all successors.
   (J)   Findings of fact.  
      (1)   No special use permit shall be approved by the Board of Adjustment
unless each of the following findings is made.
         (a)   The use or development is located, designed, and proposed to be
operated so as to maintain or promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
         (b)   There are, or will be at the time they are required, adequate
public facilities to serve the use or development as specified in §
152.060, below.
         (c)   The use or development complies with all required regulations
and standards
of this chapter or with variances thereto, if any, granted pursuant to division
(S), below, and with all other applicable regulations.
         (d)   The use or development is located, designed, and proposed to be
operated so as to be compatible with the particular neighborhood in which it is
to be located.
         (e)   The use or development conforms with the general plans for the
physical development of the town as embodied in this chapter, the Comprehensive
Land Use Plan and any other duly adopted plans of the town.
      (2)   The burden of establishing these findings of fact shall lie upon
the applicant. In addressing the issue of compatibility, as required in
division (M)(1)(d), above, the applicant must demonstrate compatibility with
the particular neighborhood in which the development or use is to be located.
The fact that a use is authorized as a special use within a zoning district
classification shall not give rise to a presumption that such special use is
compatible with other uses authorized in the zoning district classification.
   (K)   Conditions to approval of the special use permit. In approving a
petition for the reclassification of property to a planned development district
or a special use district, the Board of Adjustment may request, that reasonable
and appropriate conditions be attached to approval of the petition. Any such
conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding
property, proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways,
pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the
timing of development, street and right-of-way improvements, water and sewer
improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision of open space, and other
matters that the Board of Aldermen may find appropriate or the petitioner may
propose. Such conditions to approval of the petition may include dedication to
the town, county or state, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or easements
for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the
proposed development. The petitioner shall have a reasonable opportunity to
consider and respond to any such conditions prior to final action by Board of
Adjustment.
   (L)   Effect of approval.  
      (1)   If a petition is approved under this section, the district that is
established, the approved petition, and all conditions which may have been
attached to the approval, are binding on the property as an amendment to this
chapter and to the Zoning Map. All subsequent development and use of the
property shall be in accordance with the standards for the approved planned
development or special use district, the approved petition, including the
conceptual or preliminary development plan, and all conditions attached to the
approval, unless such approval shall lapse or the property is rezoned.
      (2)   If a petition is approved, the petitioner shall comply with all
requirements established for obtaining a land development permit, a building
permit and certificate of occupancy. Only those uses and structures indicated
in the approved petition and development plan shall be allowed on the subject
property. Any development in the district shall comply with all provisions of
and conditions to the approved petition and development plan.
   (M)   Final development plans.  Final development plans shall be reviewed by
the Land Use Administrator to ensure conformance with the requirements set
forth in §
152.052(E). Final development plans shall include any modifications agreed to
as conditions of issuance of the special use permit as well as a list of any
conditions and a list of any uses as stipulated in the special use permit.
   (N)   Issuance of land development permit.  A special use permit does not
authorize development; rather, it approves a development concept for a
particular property. In order to develop the property in accordance with the
special use permit, a land development permit is required. A land development
permit shall be issued upon certification by the Land Use Administrator that he
has received a final development plan demonstrating compliance with the
preliminary or conceptual development plan, as well as all terms and conditions
of the special use permit.
   (O)   Expiration and revocation of special use permits.  A special use
permit or modification of a special use permit shall run with the land covered
by the permit or modification. Once construction authorized by a special use
permit or modification of special use permit is started, no development other
than that authorized by the permit or modification shall be approved on that
land unless the permit or modification is first modified in accordance with §
152.055(E) or voided or revoked in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
      (1)   Commencement. If the use, construction, or activity authorized by
the Board of Adjustment approval of an application for a special use permit (or
modification thereof) is not commenced within two years of the date of approval
or within such further time stipulated in the approval, or modification
includes time (whichever is later), the approval shall expire and any town
permit issued pursuant to the approval shall be void. The Town Council may,
upon application prior to the expiration of a special use permit, or any
extensions thereof, extend such special use permit for an additional period not
to exceed 24 months. In order for such an extension to be granted, the
application must show that the plans and any additional conditions to the
special use permit will be complied with; changes in circumstances making
compliance impossible or burdensome will require a new special use permit
application in conformity with this section.
      (2)   Completion.  Unless a different period of time is authorized by the
Board of Adjustment, the right to construct improvements or otherwise develop
land pursuant to a special use permit shall expire three years after issuance
of the special use permit. If all of the construction and actions authorized or
required by a special use permit are not completed within the time established
for completion, or any authorized extensions thereof, the permit holder may
request an extension of the completion time limit from the Board of Adjustment,
which Board may grant one or more extensions upon making the following
determinations:
         (a)   The permit holder requested the extension prior to the
expiration of the special use permit, as it may have been previously extended;
         (b)   The permit holder has proceeded with due diligence and good
faith; and
         (c)   Conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant the
Board of Adjustment to reconsider the approved special use.
      (3)   Abandonment.
         (a)   On request by the holder of a special use permit, the Board of
Adjustment shall approve the abandonment of such permit upon making one of the
following determinations:
            1.   No construction or activity authorized by the permit has been
started and the starting time limit has not yet expired; or
            2.   The development or use authorized by the permit no longer
requires a special use permit, and all conditions of the special use permit
have been satisfied.
         (b)   In addition, The Board must determine that the permit holder has
submitted a signed affidavit clearly stating the holder’s intent to abandon the
permit.
      (4)   Revocation. If any conditions of a special use permit, including
completion time limits, or requirements of this chapter applicable to the
permit are violated, the Board of Adjustment may revoke the permit. The Board
may reinstate a revoked special use permit when the holder of the revoked
permit submits a request for reinstatement to the Land Use Administrator within
90 days of the date of revocation demonstrating (1) that the violations which
were the cause of the revocation have been corrected and (2) the development
fully complies with all conditions of the permit and all applicable
requirements of this chapter.
      (5)   Voluntary revocation. On request by the holder of a special use
permit, the Board may revoke such permit if it determines all of the following:
         (a)   Construction authorized by the permit has been started and the
completion time limit has not yet expired;
         (b)   The request is made in conjunction with an application for
approval of a development other than that authorized the permit; and
         (c)   The proposed development as approved by the Board incorporates
adequate consideration for the site’s already disturbed land area in its design
and any previous commitments made under the special use permit process.
   (P)   Variances. For applications undergoing special use review, the Board
of Adjustment may authorize variances in specific cases from the dimensional
and improvements standards of this chapter upon finding that a literal
enforcement of such standards will result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship and so long as the granting of such variance or variances
will not result in a use or development which would violate the findings of
fact required by division (M), above. Variances may not be granted with regard
to uses or to density.

§ 152.054 PROJECT PHASING.
    If a project is to be developed in phases, the plan for the entire
development will be used to determine the nature of review it will receive.
Before development may commence, the entity with power to issue development
authorization, that is, the Land Use Administrator or the Board of Adjustment,
as the case may be, must approve a master plan for the entire development site.
Final plans for the development may be submitted in stages and may be approved
by the Land Use Administrator provided the following requirements are met:
   (A)   All stages shall be shown with precise boundaries on the master plan
and shall be numbered in the expected order of development.
   (B)   Each phase must be able to function independently of subsequent
phases.
   (C)   All the data required for the project as a whole shall be given for
each stage shown on the plan.
   (D)   A proportionate share of open space shall be included in each stage of
the development.
   (E)   The phasing shall be consistent with the traffic circulation,
drainage, and utilities plan for the entire development.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07; Am. Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.055 MODIFICATION OF DEVELOPMENT AUTHORIZATIONS.
   (A)   Development may only take place in accordance with approvals granted
hereunder. Any deviation from approved development requires review and approval
pursuant to this section. In general, the entity which approved the development
for which modification is sought will be responsible for deciding whether to
approve modifications to such development. There are two exceptions to this
rule. First, in some circumstances, as defined herein, the Land Use
Administrator may authorize modifications which are deemed minor. Second, if
the density of the entire development, taking into consideration the proposed
modification and any previous modifications, would exceed the threshold for a
higher level of review and if such modifications, viewed cumulatively, do not
qualify as de minimis, as defined herein, the entire development will be
required to undergo the higher level of review.
   (B)   Proposed modifications shall qualify as de minimis if the cumulative
effect of such modifications would not increase the established density of the
development by more than 10%. Density shall be measured in terms of dwellings
per acre for residential developments and in terms of gross floor area for non-
residential developments. The established density shall be the density approved
in the initial land development permit for the development. By way of
illustration, if the owner of a commercial development with an established
density of 25,000 square feet of floor area proposed a 6,000-square-foot
addition, the entire development, including that which is existing or
previously approved, will be required to undergo special use review in
accordance with §
152.123. If the owner of such development proposed a 2,000-square-foot
addition, the modification would qualify as de minimis and would be processed
under development plan review.
   (C)   Modifications of developments authorized under land development
review. The Zoning Administrator shall approve modifications to developments
authorized under land development review so long as the total development,
including all modifications, complies with applicable provisions of this
chapter and so long as the total development does not exceed the thresholds for
development plan review.
   (D)   Modifications of developments authorized under development plan
review.  The Land Use Administrator may approve a modification of a land
development permit for changes to plans approved under development plan review
as long as such changes continue to comply with all applicable requirements and
so long as the total development, including all modifications, does not exceed
the threshold for special use review.
   (E)   Modifications of developments authorized under special use review.
The Land Use Administrator is authorized to approve minor modifications to the
approved final plans of developments authorized under special use review, but
major modifications may only be authorized by the Board of Adjustment in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein. A modification shall be deemed
minor if it is not a major modification. A modification shall be deemed major
if it proposes a substantial departure from the approving action of the Board
of Adjustment with regard to the original application or any subsequent
modifications. Substantial departure from such approving action shall exist
whenever the proposed modification would result in one or more of the
following:
      (1)   A substantial change in the boundaries of the site approved by the
Board;
      (2)   A substantial change from the use(s) approved by the Board;
      (3)   A substantial increase in the floor area approved by the Board;
      (4)   A substantial increase in the number of residential dwelling units;
      (5)   A substantial increase in the density of nursing homes, rest homes,
congregate care facilities or progressive care facilities;
      (6)   A substantial change in the location of one or more principal and/
or accessory structures approved by the Board;
      (7)   Structural alterations significantly affecting the basic size,
form, style, ornamentation, and appearance of principal and/or accessory
structures as shown on the plans approved by the Board;
      (8)   A substantial change in pedestrian or vehicular access or
circulation approved by the Board; and
      (9)   A substantial change in the amount or location of open space,
landscaping or buffer screens approved by the Board.
   (F)   If the proposed action is determined to be a major modification, the
Land Use Administrator shall require the filing of an application for approval
of the modification. The Land Use Administrator shall prescribe the form(s) of
application as well as any other material reasonably required to determine
compliance with this subchapter. An application for major modification of a
development authorized under special use review shall be reviewed in accordance
with the procedures established for special use review.
   (G)    No modification shall be allowed to a special use permit issued in a
special use zoning district or a planned development district unless the
applicant accepts all of the requirements and conditions the Board of
Adjustment proposes to impose on the modification. Acceptance of conditions by
the applicant may be indicated at the Board hearing on the special use permit
modification or by affidavit submitted prior to the Board taking action on the
modification application.

§ 152.056 EXPIRATION AND REVOCATION OF LAND DEVELOPMENT PERMITS.
   This section governs the expiration and revocation of land development
permits issued subsequent to land development review or development plan
review. The expiration and revocation of land development permits issued
subsequent to special use review are governed by the provisions of §
152.053.
   (A)   Commencement. If a building permit for the use, construction, or
activity authorized by approval of an application for a land development permit
or modification of a land development permit is not obtained within six months
of the date of approval, or within such further time stipulated in the
approval, the approval shall expire and any town permit issued pursuant to the
approval shall be void. The Land Use Administrator may grant a single extension
of the starting time limit for up to 12 months unless he or she determines that
paramount considerations of health, the general welfare, or public safety
require reconsideration by the entity which granted development authorization.
The Land Use Administrator shall determine whether the use, construction, or
activity has started.
   (B)   Completion. If all construction and actions authorized or required by
a land development permit or modification thereof are not completed within 18
months or such other completion date stipulated in the permit or modification,
the permit holder may request an extension of the completion time limit from
the Land Use Administrator. The Land Use Administrator may grant extensions of
the time limit for periods of up to 12 months if he or she determines the
following:
      (1)   The permit holder requested the extension prior to the expiration
of the completion time limit;
      (2)   The permit holder has proceeded with due diligence and good faith;
and
      (3)   Conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant
reconsideration of the approved development. The Land Use Administrator shall
determine whether or not all construction and actions authorized or required
have been completed.
   (C)   Revocation. If any conditions of a land development permit or
modification, including completion time limits, or requirements of this
ordinance applicable to the permit or modification are violated, the Land Use
Administrator may revoke the permit or modification. The Land Use Administrator
may reinstate a revoked land development permit or modification of land
development permit if he or she determines the following: (1) the holder of the
revoked permit or modification submitted a request for reinstatement within 90
days of revocation; (2) the violations that were the cause of the revocation
have been corrected; and (3) the development fully complies with all conditions
of the permit or modification and all applicable requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.057 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   This section applies to all planned developments regardless of use
district or classification and regardless of the development review process
required. A planned development consists of land that is under unified control
and planned and developed as a whole and which includes principal and accessory
structures and uses substantially related to the character and purposes of the
planned development. A planned development shall be constructed according to
comprehensive and detailed plans which include not only streets, utilities,
lots or building sites, and the like, but also development plans and floor
plans for all buildings as intended to be located, constructed, used, and
related to each other, and detailed plans for other uses and improvements on
the land as related to the buildings. A planned development shall include a
program for the provision, operation, and maintenance of such areas,
facilities, and improvements as will be for common use by some or all of the
occupants of the planned development district, but which will not be provided,
operated, or maintained at general public expense.
   (B)   Statement of purpose.  The purpose of this section is to promote the
efficient and well planned use of land through unified development of sites
while providing the town with open space, compatible uses, optimum service of
community facilities and adequate vehicular access and circulation. A planned
development is situated, designed, landscaped and buffered in such a manner
that it will be compatible with environmentally sensitive areas, such as flood
plains or steep slopes, and with existing or proposed land uses in adjoining
neighborhoods.
   (C)   Ownership control. The land in a planned development shall be under
single ownership or management at the time of construction or proper assurances
shall be provided that the project can be successfully completed.
   (D)   Establishment of planned developments. Except for minor planned
residential developments, which may be developed in certain use districts as
specified herein, major planned residential developments may be established in
the PRD, C-2SU or C-3SU zoning district classifications. Other planned
developments may only be established in the appropriate planned development
zoning district classifications, that is PCD or PMH. Planned developments shall
be appropriately located with respect to intended functions, to the pattern and
timing of development indicated in the principles of growth and to public and
private facilities existing or clearly to be available by the time the
development reaches the stage where they will be needed.
   (E)   Development standards for planned residential developments.
      (1)   Unless noted otherwise, the following development standards shall
apply to all planned residential developments, whether major or minor.
         (a)   Open space requirements.  Planned residential developments shall
have, as a minimum, the percentages of the site as open space in accordance
with the following table;
Zoning District Classification % Open Space Required
Zoning District Classification % Open Space Required
R-1                            40
R-2                            40
C-1                            10
C-2                            40
C-3                            40
1-1                            40
NMU                            20
MICR                           20
 
         (b)   Common space requirements. Planned residential developments
shall provide common space which shall be at least 10% of the site or 1% of the
site for each dwelling unit per acre, whichever is greater.
         (c)   Setbacks.  All dwellings and their accessory structures shall be
set back not less than 30 feet from the nearest right-of-way line for any
street or railroad adjoining the site; provided, however, such setback may be
reduced to ten feet when parking is situated to the side or rear of the lot and
screened from view from public rights-of-way. Furthermore, such buildings and
structures shall be set back not less than 30 feet from any exterior property
line which is not a right-of-way.
      (2)    The Land Use Administrator or Town Council,  as the case may be,
shall require reservations of rights-of-way, as well as increased setbacks, for
roads identified on the thoroughfare plan, including existing roads to be
widened as well as corridors of new roads.
      (3)   All dwellings and their accessory structures shall be located at
least ten feet from the edge of the paving for any street or drive and at least
five feet from the edge of the paving for any area devoted principally to
parking. Carports shall be situated at least ten feet from the edge of the
paving for any street or drive and may be physically connected to the principal
structure which they serve. In addition, dwellings and accessory structures
abutting a street intended to serve more than 32 dwelling units or intended to
be dedicated as a public street must be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the
center line of such street. The approved setback lines shall be shown on the
plan of development and on any recorded subdivision plat. In addition to the
foregoing setback requirements, minimum spacing between buildings shall be
provided as per the N.C. State Building Code Volume V-Fire Prevention.
         (a)   Subdivision of planned residential developments. Planned
residential development projects may be subdivided provided that arrangements
for such subdivision are made at the time of the planned residential
development application. Zero lot lines may be permitted on one or more lot
lines of each lot in accordance with these standards:
            1.   Any wall constructed on the lot line shall be a solid,
windowless wall. If there is an offset of the wall from the lot line, the
offset must be at least six feet.
            2.   A five-foot maintenance easement and a maximum eave
encroachment of 32 inches within the maintenance easement shall be established
in the deed restrictions and covenants of the adjoining lot. This will provide
ready access to the lot line wall at reasonable periods of the day for normal
maintenance.
         (b)   Circulation and access.  Internal streets, drives and parking
areas shall provide safe and convenient access to dwelling units and recreation
facilities, and for service and emergency vehicles. Streets shall not be
designed to encourage outside traffic to traverse the planned residential
development on local streets. Sidewalks shall be required along streets
adjacent to the planned residential development. Sidewalks shall form a
logical, safe, and convenient system for pedestrian access to all dwelling
units and appropriate project facilities and shall be required along such
streets, drives and parking areas within the planned residential development as
is necessary to accomplish this. Pedestrian/bicycle pathways may be substituted
for sidewalks, if appropriate.
         (c)   Streets.
            1.   Streets intended to serve more than 32 dwelling units as well
as those intended to be dedicated as public streets shall meet the design and
construction standards of the NCDOT. All other streets and drives need not
comply with NCDOT’s pavement width and road right-of-way standards, but they
shall comply with its pavement structure requirements. All dead-end streets and
drives shall terminate in a cul-de-sac or other adequate means of reversing
vehicular direction. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to submit
to the Director of Public Works core samples taken by a licensed testing firm
demonstrating that completed streets or drives meet such pavement structure
requirements.
            2.   Internal streets with minimum setbacks measuring less than 50
feet from center line shall be private streets and are not acceptable for
dedication to, or maintenance by, the town. Developments containing such
private internal streets with setbacks measuring less than 50 feet from center
line shall have the following disclaimer in large type placed in a prominent
position on the following applicable documents for the development: the
development plan, the plat, the restrictive covenants, the condominium
documents, and any contracts used in the sale of properties.
               Some or all of the streets and/or drives in this development
               do not meet minimum right-of-way requirements for the Town
               of Franklin. You are notified that these are proposed as private

               streets and that the Town of Franklin will not accept them for
maintenance.
         (d)   Buffering, screening and landscaping.  The applicant shall
propose and plant, construct and make satisfactory arrangements for the
preservation of a buffer and/or setbacks adequate to protect adjoining
properties from the impacts of the proposed development. Parking and service
areas and dumpsters shall be screened from view by adjacent single-family
residences. Existing vegetation shall be preserved whenever possible. In
addition, the developer shall provide an appropriate landscaping plan within
the project. Use of native species is highly encouraged.
         (e)   Off-street parking.
            1.   Off-Street parking requirements for planned residential
developments shall be as follows:
               a.   A minimum of one- and-one-half spaces per residential unit
containing one or two bedrooms.
               b.   A minimum of two spaces per residential unit containing
three or more bedrooms.
            2.   Enclosed garages and carports count towards meeting the
parking requirement. All parking spaces shall be located within 75 feet of the
residential unit they serve.
         (f)   Maintenance of common facilities. The developer, project owner,
or a properly established homeowners association shall provide for the
continuing maintenance of common open space, recreational facilities,
sidewalks, parking, private streets, and other privately owned common
facilities serving the project.
   (F)   Minor planned residential developments. An applicant may elect to have
a development processed as a minor planned residential development so long as
the proposed development, including all phases, does not exceed 30 dwelling
units and so long as no accessory commercial development is requested for the
project. A minor planned residential development may be located in one or more
of the following zoning district classifications: R1, R-2, C-1, C-2, C-3, NMU,
and MICR.
      (1)   Density. The maximum number of dwelling units which may be
constructed in a minor planned residential development shall be 30 dwelling
units or a number computed on the basis of the following table, whichever is
less:
Zoning District Classification Dwelling Units Per Acre
Zoning District Classification Dwelling Units Per Acre
R-1                            6
R-2                            8
C-1                            18
C-2                            10
C-3                            10

MICR                           10
 
      (2)   Development standards for minor planned residential developments.
Except as otherwise noted herein, minor planned residential developments shall
be governed by the development standards for planned residential developments
contained in division (E), above. Unlike major planned residential
developments, there is no minimum site requirement for a minor planned
residential development, nor is there a requirement that access be by means of
a designated thoroughfare.
      (3)   Procedures for reviewing.  Unlike other planned developments which
undergo special use review, minor planned residential developments undergo
development plan review pursuant to §
152.052, above.

§ 152.058 “AS-BUILT” OR RECORD DRAWINGS.
   This section applies only to development which has undergone development
plan or special use review. “As built” or record drawings shall be submitted
prior to the issuance of the last Certificate of Occupancy for the project.
These drawings shall be submitted in two parts. The first, at a scale not
greater than one inch equals 40 feet, shall show all features on the
development plan. The second, at a scale not greater than one inch equals 200
feet, may show only all underground facilities on the site and the depth of
bury. Plans and verifications shall be signed and sealed by an architect,
engineer or surveyor licensed to practice in the State of North Carolina.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.059 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE.
   Project infrastructure refers to the improvements, such as water and
wastewater lines, streets and roads, stormwater management facilities,
sidewalks and street lighting, which are necessary to sustain the intended use
of a project.
   (A)   Construction of project infrastructure. Upon approval of the final
development plan by the Board, the applicant shall proceed with the
construction of project infrastructure, including but not limited to, streets,
water and sewer facilities, drainage, sedimentation and erosion control
facilities, and lighting. Except as provided in division (B) below, and prior
to issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall complete, install and
provide for the dedication of all project infrastructure as specified on the
approved final development plan. The applicant shall certify the dedication of
said improvements in a form acceptable to the town. All construction undertaken
pursuant to the final development plan shall be inspected and approved by the
Town of Franklin and/or appropriate local, state, and federal agencies prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development.
   (B)   Guarantee in lieu of construction of Project infrastructure.  
      (1)   In lieu of requiring the completion, installation and dedication of
all project infrastructure prior to the issuance of a building permit, the town
may accept a bond with approved surety or a letter of credit payable to the
Town of Franklin in an amount equal to 125% of the estimated cost of the
installation of the required improvements, whereby the improvements may be
constructed and utilities installed without cost to the town in the event of
default of the developer.
      (2)   The letter of credit or bond shall remain in full force and effect
until such time as the construction of project infrastructure is completed and
accepted by the town. No bond or letter of credit may be called without 60-days
prior written notice to the town. Failure to maintain in effect a town-approved
financial guarantee of any incomplete improvement shall suspend the approval of
the plan and any permits issued as a result of the plan approval.
      (3)   All financial guarantees must contain language requiring the
completion of all project infrastructure as shown on the approved final
development plan and the guarantee of these improvements for an 18-month
warranty after they have been accepted by the town. All financial guarantees
must either be issued from a financial institution incorporated in the State of
North Carolina or be redeemable at a financial institution incorporated in the
State of North Carolina.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.060 ADEQUATE FACILITIES REVIEW.
   (A)    Certain developments, due to their type, size and/or location, tend
to have greater impacts on public services and facilities than does development
generally. In order to ensure that such development is undertaken only when
there are adequate public facilities to serve it, no development undergoing
special use review shall be approved unless the Town Council first determines
that adequate facilities and services will be available to such development
before it is occupied. Specifically, no development undergoing special use
review shall be approved unless the Town Council finds that all of the
following conditions exist or will exist on or before the date that buildings
or land in the proposed development will be occupied.
      (1)   Water supply. There will be an adequate potable water supply
available for the proposed occupancy. An adequate public water supply shall
include adequate potable water for consumption and other inside and outside
uses, and adequate water pressure and fire flow to meet established standards
of the town for fire protection.
      (2)   Wastewater. There will be adequate connections to public wastewater
disposal systems with adequate capacity to handle the type and volume of flow
from the proposed occupancy.
      (3)   Streets.  The street system in the development will connect to
segments of the public street system with adequate capacity to handle the
projected traffic flow, both on an average basis and at peak hours.
Furthermore, the development shall be so located with respect to major street,
bicycle and pedestrian networks, or public transportation facilities, and shall
be so designed, as to provide direct access to the development without creating
substantial additional traffic in residential neighborhoods outside the
development.
   (B)   Developments failing to meet these criteria may be approved if the
applicant (1) provides private facilities, utilities, and services approved by
appropriate public agencies as substituting on an equivalent basis, and assures
their satisfactory continuing operation, permanently or until similar public
utilities, facilities, or services are available and used, or (2) makes
provision acceptable to the town for offsetting any added net public cost of
early commitment of public funds made necessary by such development. In
determining net public costs, the difference in anticipated public
installation, operation, and maintenance costs and the difference in
anticipated public revenue shall be considered. Expenses involved in making
such determinations shall be paid by the applicant. Determinations shall be
made by the town or by experts acceptable to the town.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07; Am. Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.061 AGGREGATION.
   Two or more developments shall be aggregated and treated as a single
development under this chapter when they are determined to be part of a unified
plan of development and are physically proximate to one another. Each of the
criteria listed below is indicative of a unified plan of development. Whenever
one or more are found to exist, the reviewing authority may, but is not
required to, determine that two or more projects are part of a unified plan of
development.
   (A)   The same person has control of the developments;
   (B)   The same person has ownership or a significant legal or equitable
interest in the developments;
   (C)   There is common management controlling the form of physical
development or disposition of parcels of the development;
   (D)   There is a reasonable closeness in time between the completion of some
or all of one development and the submission of an application for
authorization of other development which is indicative of a common
developmental effort;
   (E)   A master plan or series of plans or drawings exists covering the
developments sought to be aggregated;
   (F)   There is a voluntary sharing of infrastructure that is indicative of a
common development effort or is designated specifically to accommodate the
developments sought to be aggregated;
   (G)   There is a common advertising scheme or promotional plan in effect for
the developments sought to be aggregated.

§ 152.062 APPEALS OF DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS.
   Development decisions rendered pursuant to this article are subject to
review in the manner set forth herein.
   (A)   Administrative remedies.  There are two separate bodies charged with
responsibility for administrative review of development decisions: the Board of
Adjustment and the Town Council. In no case will decisions of either of those
bodies be subject to review by the other. Judicial review from the decisions of
those boards may be available in accordance with division (B), below. The
following development decisions are subject to administrative review in the
manner indicated
      (1)   Land development permits.  Decisions regarding applications for
issuance of land development permits are subject to review by the Board of
Adjustment upon the timely filing of an appeal pursuant to §
152.075, below.
      (2)   Preliminary development plans and preliminary plats.  Decisions of
the Land Use Administrator regarding applications for preliminary development
plan approval or for preliminary plat approval are subject to review by the
Town Council upon the timely filing of a notice of review pursuant to §
152.052, above.
      (3)   Final development plans and final plat approval. Decisions of the
Land Use Administrator regarding applications for final development plan
approval and final plat approval are subject to review by the Town Council upon
the timely filing of a notice of review pursuant to §
152.052(E)(4), above.
   (B)   Judicial review. Judicial review of development decisions rendered
pursuant to this article shall be in accordance with this section and with the
North Carolina General Statutes. In no event shall a party be entitled to
judicial review until such time as all administrative remedies have been
exhausted.
      (1)   Land development permits.  Decisions of the Town Council regarding
appeals from development decisions concerning applications for land development
permits may be appealed to the Superior Court in accordance with §
152.078, below. Such appeals shall be in the nature of certiorari.
      (2)   Preliminary development plans and preliminary plats. Decisions of
the Town Council regarding appeals from development decisions concerning
applications for preliminary development plan approval or preliminary plat
approval may be appealed to the Superior Court by any aggrieved party. Such
appeals shall be in the nature of certiorari and must be filed within 30 days
after the filing of the decision in the office of the Town Clerk or after a
written copy thereof is delivered to every aggrieved party who has filed a
written request for such copy with the Clerk at the time of the hearing,
whichever is later. The copy of the decision of the Town Council may be
delivered to aggrieved parties either by personal service for by registered
mail or certified mail return receipt requested.
      (3)   Final development plans and final plats.  Decisions of the Town
Council regarding appeals from development decisions concerning applications
for final development plan approval or final plat approval may be appealed to
the Superior Court by any aggrieved party in the same manner as decisions
regarding preliminary development plans set forth in the preceding section.
      (4)   Special use review.  Judicial review of decisions regarding
applications processed under the provisions of special use review, established
in §
152.053, above, require special treatment due to the fact that they involve two
separate applications which, though processed simultaneously, require the Town
Council to make two separate decisions exercising two different types of
decision-making authority. One application requests enactment of an ordinance
amending the Official Zoning Map, and the other requests issuance of a special
use permit. The first application involves a legislative decision on the part
of the Council and the second a quasi-judicial decision. The quasi-judicial
decision, that is, the one concerning the application for a special use permit,
may be appealed to the Superior Court by any aggrieved party in the manner
prescribed in division (B)(2), above. Such appeal shall be in the nature of
certiorari. The legislative decision, which is the one concerning the request
for rezoning, may be contested, in accordance with G.S. § 160A-364.1, by a
cause of action commenced within two months of the date of the decision.

§ 152.075 APPEALS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from and review any
order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative
official charged with the enforcement of this chapter. An appeal may be taken
by any person having standing pursuant to G.S. § 160A-393(d), or by an officer,
department or board of the town. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days of
the rendition of such decision by filing with the administrative official a
written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The administrative
official shall forthwith transmit to the Board, as well as the appellant and
property owner (if property owner is not appellant) all the papers constituting
the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all
legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the
Administrative Officer certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice
of appeal has been filed with him or her, that because of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life
or property or that because the violation charged is transitory in nature, a
stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of this chapter. In such case
proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, as provided for in
the North Carolina General Statutes. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed,
the appellant may file with the Administrative Official a request for an
expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear
the appeal within 15 days.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07; Am. Ord. passed 2-3-14)
§ 152.076 VARIANCES.
   (A)   A variance is a means whereby the town may grant relief from the
effect of this chapter in cases of hardship. A variance constitutes permission
to depart from the literal requirements of this chapter. A variance from the
dimensional requirements of this chapter may be granted by the Board of
Adjustment if it finds the following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardship resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with the knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self created hardship.
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose and
intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.
   (B)   The Board of Adjustment shall not have authority to grant a variance
when to do so would (1) result in the extension of a nonconformity regulated
pursuant to §§
152.150 -
152.154, herein, or ( 2) permit a use of land, building or structure which is
not permitted within the applicable zoning district classification. Appropriate
conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are
reasonably related to the variance.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07; Am. Ord. passed 2-3-14)
§ 152.077 PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS BEFORE THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.

appeal from an administrative determination, must be received by the Land Use
Administrator at least 30 days prior to the date of a Board of Adjustment
meeting in order to be scheduled for such meeting.
   (B)   Notice of hearing. Notice of hearings shall be mailed to the person or

of the Land Use Administrator or after a written a copy thereof is delivered to
every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such copy with the
chairman of the Board at the time of its hearing of the case, whichever is

§ 152.091 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   The regulations for the various zoning district classifications shall be
enforced and interpreted according to the rules specified herein.
   (A)   Uses. Uses not designated as permitted, or special, shall be
prohibited. Permitted uses subject to special requirements, and special uses
shall be permitted only according to the additional regulations imposed.
Permits for a special use shall be approved or disapproved by the Town Council.
   (B)   Minimum regulations.  Regulations set forth by this subchapter shall
be general requirements applicable to all uses in all district classifications,
unless other regulations are more restrictive or establish a higher standard.
   (C)   Land covenants. Unless restrictions established by covenants with the
land are prohibited by or are contrary to the provisions of this chapter,
nothing herein contained shall be construed to render such covenants
inoperative.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07; Am. Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.092 VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS.
   On a corner lot nothing shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow
in such a manner as materially to impede vision between a height of two and
one-half feet and ten feet in a triangular area formed by a diagonal line
between two points on the right-of-way lines, 20 feet from where they
intersect. This regulation does not apply in the C-1 Central Business District.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.093 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   All developments, except for those situated within the C-1 Central
Commercial Zoning District, shall provide a sufficient number of parking spaces
to accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be
attracted to the development in question. No certificate of occupancy will be
issued upon completion of the building unless all off-street parking and
loading requirements, shown upon the plans or made part of the building permit,
are in place and ready for use and conforming to requirements.
   (A)   Presumptions.  The presumptions established by this section are that
(1) a development must comply with the parking standards set forth in division
(E) to satisfy the standard stated in §
152.094 and (2) any development that does meet these standards is in
compliance. However, the parking space requirements contained in division (E)
are only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly
administered in accordance with division (F).
   (B)   Separate uses.  The required parking for separate uses may be combined
in one lot, but spaces assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use
at the same time; provided, however, one-half of the parking spaces required
for churches, theaters or assembly halls, whose peak attendance will be at
night or on Sundays, may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or
on Sundays.
   (C)   Remote parking.  If the required number of parking spaces cannot
reasonably be provided on the same lot as the use being served, required
parking spaces may be provided on any lot a substantial portion of which is
within 200 feet of such uses.
   (D)   Parking space design. Each automobile parking space shall not be less
than nine feet by 18 feet in area exclusive of adequate access drives and
maneuvering space. Such space shall be provided with vehicular access to a
street or alley. Parking spaces shall not thereafter be encroached upon or
altered without prior development authorization as per §§
152.050 -
152.062, above.
   (E)   Use classifications and parking space requirements. The number of
parking spaces provided for any use or development shall equal or exceed the
number determined for the use or development by the standards contained herein.
It is recognized that the list of parking requirements contained in this
section cannot and does not cover every possible situation that may arise.
Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the permit issuing authority is
authorized to determine the parking requirements using this table as a guide.

   (F)   Flexible administration.  It is recognized that, due to the
particularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the
parking standards set forth in division (E) may result in a development either
with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The
former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in
adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The
latter situation results in a waste of money as well as a waste of space that
could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful
open space. Therefore the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from
the presumptive requirements of division (E) and may require more parking or
allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to
satisfy the standard set forth in division (A).
      (1)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-
issuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth
in division (E) when it finds the following:
         (a)   A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the
elderly.
         (b)   A business is primarily oriented toward walk-in trade or trade
expected to arrive by means other than an automobile.
      (2)   Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a
deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in division (E)
it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it
imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.

§ 152.094 OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING.
   Development and redevelopment projects in all districts except the C-
1 Central Commercial District shall provide space as indicated herein for the
loading and unloading of vehicles off the street or public alley. Such space
shall have access to an alley or, if there is no alley, to a street. For the
purposes of this section an off-street loading space shall have a minimum
dimension adequate to accommodate the largest vehicles expected to be served
and, in any event, no less than 12 feet by 40 feet and an overhead clearance of
14 feet in height above the alley or street grade.
   (A)   Retail operations: One loading space for each 20,000 square feet of
gross floor area or fraction thereof.

§ 152.095 ACCESSORY STRUCTURES.
   Accessory structures shall not be located in any required front yard or any
required front or side yard of a corner lot. In all other cases, the accessory
structure shall meet the setback requirements for the zoning district
classification in which it is located.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.096 CALCULATION OF LOT AREAS.
   No part of a road right-of-way lying within lot lines may be used in
calculating minimum lot sizes requirements.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.097 STORAGE CONTAINERS.
   (A)   For purposes of administering this section, the term “storage
containers” shall include “storage trailers”. Storage containers shall require
permits from the Administrator; they shall be removed from the premises upon
which they are located upon the expiration of the time period designed in the
permit. One storage container per lot shall be permitted for a period not
exceeding 90 consecutive days in a 12- month period. Storage containers shall
meet all setback requirements for the zoning district in which they are located
and shall be placed in the rear yard wherever possible. No storage container
shall be permitted on a vacant lot. No storage container shall contain
facilities for utility service. No storage container shall display any signs,
lettering or advertising device, with the exception of a required owner
identification sign with letters not to exceed three inches in height. This
sign shall contain the name, address and phone number of the owner and may also
contain a storage container identification number. These regulations shall not
apply to the following:
      (1)   Construction service trailers used for offices or for storage of
tools or materials on job sites for the duration of construction;
      (2)   Storage trailers used as construction service facilities which are
a portion of the inventory of the equipment used by the business to transport
materials from one job to another, and not used for purposes of storage.
      (3)   Storage trailers, on the lot of a storage trailer sales or rental
business, that constitute part of the inventory of such business and that are
not currently used for purposes of storage.
   (B)   Storage containers shall be permitted only in the C-3 Highway
Commercial and I-1 Industrial zoning district classifications.
   (C)   Converted. The use of portable storage units as building materials to
create commercial structures for habitable purposes (which could include
storage). Habitable includes commercial restaurants, retail, and any other
building constructed out of multiple storage containers. The use of the storage
container as a building material must meet the NC building code. The below
matrix “Non-Residential Converted Storage Container Use Matrix” is where the
use is permitted in the zoning Districts. The designation “P” means permitted.
Shipping containers are not allowed in residential zoning districts. Containers
must either be screened or painted to neutral earth tone color or a color
consistent with the principal building.

§ 152.098 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   Street Classification. In all new subdivisions, streets that are
dedicated to public use shall be classified as provided in herein. The
classification shall be based upon the projected volume of traffic to be
carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day. The
number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a useful
indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive. Whenever a subdivision
street continues an existing street that formerly terminated outside the
subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street will be continued
beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the street
will be based upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the
subdivision. The classification of streets shall be as follows.
      (1)   Minor.  A street whose sole function is to provide access to
abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve not more than nine
dwelling units and is expected to or does handle up to 75 trips per day.
      (2)   Local.  A street whose sole function is to provide access to
abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve at least ten but not
more than 25 dwelling units and is expected to or does handle between 75 and
200 trips per day.
      (3)   Cul-de-sac.  A street that terminates in a vehicular turn-around.
      (4)   Subcollector.  A street whose sole principal function is to provide
access to abutting properties but is also designed to be used or is used to
connect minor and local streets with collector or arterial streets. Including
residences indirectly served through connecting streets, it serves or is
designed to serve at least 26 but not more than 100 dwelling units and is
expected to or does handle between 200 and 800 trips per day.
      (5)   Collector.  A street whose principal function is to carry traffic
between minor, local, and subcollector streets and arterial streets but that
may also provide direct access to abutting properties. It serves or is designed
to serve, directly or indirectly, more than 100 dwelling units and is designed
to be used or is used to carry more than 800 trips per day.
      (6)   Arterial. A major street in the town’s street system that serves as
an avenue for the circulation of traffic into, out, or around the town and
carries high volumes of traffic.
      (7)   Marginal access street.  A street that is parallel to and adjacent
to an arterial street and that is designed to provide access to abutting
properties so that these properties are somewhat sheltered from the effects of
the through traffic on the arterial street and so that the flow of traffic on
the arterial street is not impeded by direct driveway access from a large
number of abutting properties.
   (B)   Access to public streets in general.  Every lot shall have either
direct or indirect access to a public street. A lot has direct access to a
public street if a sufficient portion of a boundary of the lot abuts the public
street right-of-way so that an access way meeting the criteria set forth herein
can be established. A lot has indirect access if it connects to a public street
by means of one or more private roads that are of sufficient size to meet the
criteria set forth herein.
      (1)   Standard for access.  The access provided must be adequate to
afford a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well
as for all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its
intended use.
      (2)   Access to arterial streets. Whenever a major subdivision that
involves the creation of one or more new streets borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, no direct driveway access may be provided
from the lots within this subdivision onto this street.
   (C)   Entrances to streets.  All driveway entrances and other openings onto
streets within the town’s planning jurisdiction shall be constructed so that
(a) vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any
substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles traveling in
abutting streets, and (b) interference with the free and convenient flow of
traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized.
   (D)   Coordination with surrounding streets. The street system of a
subdivision or planned development shall be coordinated with existing, proposed
and anticipated streets outside the development or outside the portion of a
single tract that is being divided into lots (hereinafter, “surrounding
streets”) as provided in this section.
      (1)   Collector streets shall intersect with surrounding collector or
arterial streets at safe and convenient locations.
      (2)   Subcollector, local, and minor residential streets shall connect
with surrounding streets where necessary to permit the convenient movement of
traffic between residential neighborhoods or to facilitate access to
neighborhoods by emergency service vehicles or for other sufficient reasons,
but connections shall not be permitted where the effect would be to encourage
the use of such streets by substantial through-traffic.
      (3)   Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets
are required by this section, the street right-of-way shall be extended and the
street developed to the property line of the subdivided property (or to the
edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract) at the point where
the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. In addition,
the permit issuing authority may require temporary turn-arounds to be
constructed at the end of such streets pending their extension when such
turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate
emergency vehicles. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no
temporary dead-end street in excess of 1,000 feet may be created unless no
other practicable alternative is available.
   (E)   Street width and drainage requirements in subdivisions and planned
developments. Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several
functions: (1) to carry motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-
street parking; (2) to provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian
traffic; and (3) to serve as an important link in the town’s drainage system.
All streets shall be constructed with curb and gutter and shall conform to the
other requirements of this section. Any style of curb and gutter design, if
designed as approved by the North Carolina Department of Transportation for use
on residential streets, may be used, subject to the prior approval of the Land
Use Administrator. Street pavement width shall be measured from the outer edge
of each curb.
 
Type Street  Minimum Right-of-Way Minimum Pavement Width
Minor        30'                  18'
Local        40'                  22'
Subcollector 50'                  34'
Collector    50'                  34'
 
   (F)   General layout of streets.
      (1)   Subcollector, local, and minor residential streets shall be curved
whenever practicable to the extent necessary to avoid conformity of lot
appearance.
      (2)   To the extent practicable, driveway access to collector streets
shall be minimized to facilitate the free flow of traffic and avoid traffic
hazards.
      (3)   All permanent dead-end streets shall be developed as cul-de-sacs in
accordance with the standards set forth in division (F)(4). Except where no
other practicable alternative is available, such streets may not extend more
than 550 feet (measured to the center of the turn-around).
      (4)   The right-of-way of a cul-de-sac shall have a radius of 30 feet.
The radius of the paved portion of the turn-around (measured to the outer edge
of the pavement) shall be 30 feet. The entire cul-de-sac shall be paved. No
parking shall be permitted on the cul-de-sac.
      (5)   Half streets (i.e., streets of less than the full required right-
of-way and pavement width) shall not be permitted except where such streets,
when combined with a similar street (developed previously or simultaneously) on
property adjacent to the subdivision, creates or comprises a street that meets
the right-of-way and pavement requirements of this chapter.
      (6)   Streets shall be laid out so that residential blocks do not exceed
1,000 feet, unless no other practicable alternative is available.
   (G)   Street intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and
no two streets may intersect at less than 60 degrees. No more than two streets
shall intersect at any one point, unless the public works director certifies to
the permit issuing authority that such an intersection can be constructed with
no extraordinary danger to public safety.
      (2)   Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a
street shall coincide with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite
side of such street. In any event, where a center line offset (jog) occurs at
an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets
shall be not less than 150 feet.
      (3)   No two streets may intersect with any other street on the same side
at a distance of less than 400 feet measured from centerline to centerline of
the intersecting street. When the intersected street is an arterial, the
distance between intersecting streets shall be at least 1,000 feet.
   (H)   Construction standards and specifications. Except as modified herein,
streets shall be designed to comply with the design and construction standards
of the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
   (I)   Road and sidewalk requirements in unsubdivided developments. Within
unsubdivided developments, all private roads and access ways shall be designed
and constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor vehicle
and pedestrian traffic. Width of roads, use of curb and gutter, and paving
specifications shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter dealing
with parking and drainage. To the extent not otherwise covered in the foregoing
subchapters, and to the extent that the requirements set forth in this
subchapter for subdivision streets may be relevant to the roads in unsubdivided
developments, the requirements of this subchapter may be applied to satisfy the
standard set forth in the first sentence of this subsection.
      (1)   Whenever a road in an unsubdivided development connects two or more
subcollector, collector, or arterial streets in such a manner that any
substantial volume of through traffic is likely to make use of this road, such
road shall be constructed in accordance with the standards applicable to
subdivision streets and shall be dedicated. In other cases when roads in
unsubdivided developments within the town are constructed in accordance with
the specifications for subdivision streets, the town may accept an offer of
dedication of such streets.
      (2)   In all unsubdivided multi-family residential developments,
sidewalks shall be provided linking dwelling units with other dwelling units,
the public street, and on-site activity centers such as parking areas, laundry
facilities, and recreational areas and facilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, sidewalks shall not be required where pedestrians have access to a
road that serves not more than nine dwelling units.
      (3)   Whenever the permit issuing authority finds that a means of
pedestrian access is necessary from an unsubdivided development to schools,
parks, playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that such access is not
conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the developer may be
required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet to provide
such access.
      (4)   In unsubdivided nonresidential developments that abut a public
street, sidewalks shall be constructed adjacent to such street if a sidewalk in
that location is necessary to continue a pre-existing sidewalk. Whenever
possible, such sidewalk shall be constructed within the public right-of-way.
      (5)   The sidewalks required by this section shall be five feet wide, or
at the width currently required by the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990
as amended, whichever is wider, and otherwise constructed according to the
specifications of the town, except that the permit issuing authority may permit
the installation of walkways constructed with other suitable materials when it
concludes that (a) such walkways would serve the residents of the development
as adequately as concrete sidewalks and (b) such walkways could be more
environmentally desirable or more in keeping with the overall design of the
development. Variances of the width requirement in this section shall be
considered pursuant to applicable law, based on geographical obstacles or
structural obstacles. In the event that the sidewalk is permitted to be
constructed less than five feet width requirement, then a 60-inch passing space
must be located at least every 200 feet. Bus transit stops, driveways and
building entrances may be counted as passing spaces. The Land Use Administrator
may approve an alternate plan that proposes different pedestrian amenities
provided that the intent of this section is fulfilled.
      (6)   Attention to handicapped in street and sidewalk construction.
Whenever curb and gutter construction is used on public streets, wheelchair
ramps for the handicapped shall be provided at intersections and other major
points of pedestrian flow. Wheelchair ramps and depressed curbs shall be
constructed in accordance with published standards of the North Carolina
Department of Transportation, Division of Highways. In unsubdivided
developments, sidewalk construction for the handicapped shall conform to the
requirements of the North Carolina State Building Code.
      (7)   Street names and house numbers. 
         (a)   Street names shall be assigned by the developer subject to the
approval of the permit issuing authority. Proposed streets that are obviously
in alignment with existing streets shall be given the same name. Newly created
streets shall be given names that neither duplicate nor are phonetically
similar to existing streets within the town’s planning jurisdiction, regardless
of the use of different suffixes (such as those set forth in herein). Street
names shall include a suffix such as the following:
            1.   Circle: A short street that returns to itself.
            2.   Court or place: A cul-de-sac or dead-end street.
            3.   Loop: A street that begins at the intersection with one street
and circles back to end at another intersection with the same street.
            4.   Street: All public streets not designated by another suffix.
         (b)   Building numbers shall be assigned by the town in coordination
with the Macon County street-addressing program.
   (J)   Bridges.  All bridges in subdivided and unsubdivided developments
shall be constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications of the
North Carolina Department of Transportation, except that bridges on roads not
intended for public dedication in unsubdivided developments may be approved if
designed by a licensed architect or engineer.
   (K)   Sidewalk requirements.  All new development or redevelopment shall
have sidewalks, with curb and gutter and necessary storm sewer, along each
public street abutting the development in accordance with the standards of the
town, including without limitation the standards for sidewalks contained in
division (I) above.
      (1)   All costs associated with the sidewalk, curb and gutter, and storm
sewer shall be borne by the developer.
      (2)   All sidewalk, curb and gutter, and storm sewer shall be dedicated
to the town for perpetual maintenance. All such dedicated improvements shall be
guaranteed for one year following the date of acceptance by the town. Any
defects in material and/or workmanship during the one-year period shall be
immediately corrected by the developer.
      (3)   Payment of fee in lieu of construction of sidewalks. When site
characteristics and/or traffic patterns are such that the construction of
sidewalks in accordance with this section would be a hardship and would not
result in useful pedestrian walkways, the Town Administrator may allow the
applicant to pay the cost of constructing such sidewalks into the Town Sidewalk
Fund in lieu of requiring construction of the sidewalks.

§ 152.099 NUISANCES.
   It shall be a violation of this chapter to operate any use in such a fashion
as to constitute a nuisance as specified in this section.
   (A)   Noise.  Other than ordinary construction activities, no use shall be
operated so as to generate recurring noises that are unreasonably loud, cause
injury, or create a nuisance to any person of ordinary sensitivities. No
nonresidential use shall be operated so as to generate any noise in an adjacent
district, as detected in that district without instruments, that is louder than
the noise which could be generally expected from uses permitted in that
district.
   (B)   Fumes and odors. No use shall emit fumes, gases, or odors in
concentrations or amounts that cause injury or create a nuisance to any person
of ordinary sensitivities on another property.
   (C)   Vibration.  Other than ordinary construction activities, no use shall
be operated so as to generate inherent or recurring ground vibrations
detectable at the property line which create a nuisance to any person of
ordinary sensitivities on another property.
   (D)   Lighting.  Lighting facilities, if provided, shall be aimed, directed,
shielded or arranged so the light sources for such facilities do not cause
undue glare on neighboring properties or interfere with the safe use of public
rights-of-way.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.100 BURDEN OF PROOF.
   The burden of proof shall rest with the applicant in all proceedings
required or authorized by this chapter.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.101 RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR ROADS AND STREETS.
   (A)   Reservation of right-of-way.  The orderly development of land is
dependent upon the protection of existing and proposed major roadways in the
town. The provisions of this section are intended to provide for the
reservation of right-of-way for such roadways under appropriate conditions.
      (1)   Reservation under the roadway corridor official map act.  Pursuant
to authority granted by G.S. Ch.136, Art. 2E, the town or the NCDOT may from
time to time adopt, amend, supplement or change a roadway corridor official map
for any streets or roadways identified on the town’s thoroughfare plan.
         (a)   After a roadway corridor official map is filed with the Register
of Deeds, no building permit shall be issued for any building or structure or
part thereof located within the roadway corridor, nor shall approval of a
subdivision be granted with respect to property within the roadway corridor.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to valid building permits issued
prior to the effective date of this section or to building permits for
buildings and structures which existed prior to the filing of the roadway
corridor, provided the size of the building or structure is not increased and
the type of building code occupancy is not changed.
         (b)   No application for building permit issuance or subdivision plan
approval shall be delayed by the provisions of this section for more than three
years from the date of the original building permit or subdivision plan
submittal.
      (2)   Setbacks for existing roadways. Applicants for development
authorization for parcels adjoining existing roadways identified on the town’s
thoroughfare plan shall propose locations for structures and other improvements
which do not encroach upon the proposed rights-of-way listed in such plan.
      (3)   Variances.  A variance from the provisions of this section may be
granted by the Board of Adjustment or by Town Council, as appropriate, upon
demonstration (a) that the requirements of this section result in practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships and (b) that no reasonable return may be
earned from the land. For purposes of determining whether any reasonable use
may be earned, the entire parcel will be considered, not just that portion
lying within the bounds of the existing or proposed roadway.
   (B)   Dedication of right-of-way with density transfer. Whenever a tract of
land located within the planning jurisdiction of the town is proposed for a use
requiring development authorization under §§
152.050 -
152.062 herein and a portion of it is embraced within a corridor for a street
or highway on a plan established and adopted pursuant to G.S. § 136-66.2, the
town may require the applicant to dedicate for street or highway purposes the
right-of-way within such corridor. If the town elects to require such
dedication it shall allow the applicant to transfer density credits
attributable to the dedicated right-of-way to contiguous land owned by the
applicant. No dedication of right-of-way shall be required pursuant to this
section unless the entity granting development authorization shall find, prior
to the grant, that the dedication does not result in the deprivation of a
reasonable use of the original tract and that the dedication is either
reasonably related to the traffic generated by the proposed subdivision or use
of the remaining land or the impact of the dedication is mitigated by measures
provided elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.102 OPEN SPACE STANDARDS.
   Open space is intended to provide recreational opportunities, to conserve
and protect significant natural areas and environmentally sensitive areas, to
conserve important historic resources, and/or to conserve productive farming
and forestry uses. Functional open space enhances circulation within a site and
contributes to the site’s aesthetic qualities. Open space may include any out-
of-doors common space and any portion of the site not covered by a building or
vehicular use area. Where required, open space shall meet or exceed the
standards contained in this section.
   (A)   Extent of open space. Open space requirements are expressed as a
percentage of the area of a development in the standards for some zoning
classifications contained in §§
152.020 -
152.033. Open space shall meet or exceed this stated percentage. The following
standards shall be used in determining which portions of a development site are
to be designated as open space.
      (1)   Primary conservation areas. The following areas are considered
primary conservation areas and shall be designated as open space on development
plans when open space is required.
         (a)   Designated floodways and floodway fringes identified as part of
a flood insurance study prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
         (b)   Natural watercourses and any adjoining stream buffers required
to be maintained in a natural vegetated and unaltered state pursuant to
§§
152.190 -
152.199 hereof. All primary conservation areas shall be designated as open
space even if doing so results in open space which exceeds the amount required
by the open space standard contained in §§
152.020 -
152.033.
      (2)   Secondary conservation areas.  The following areas are considered
secondary conservation areas. When open space is required for a development,
some or all the secondary conservation areas on the development site shall be
designated as open space to the extent it is necessary to meet the applicable
open space standard.
         (a)   Any identified significant natural areas (e.g., rare plant
communities, important wildlife habitat) or other environmentally sensitive
areas where development might threaten water quality or ecosystems (e.g.,
watershed buffers, groundwater recharge areas).
         (b)   Any identified important historic resources (e.g., homesteads,
mills, barns, archeological sites) identified from a local archeological or
architectural survey or an individual site survey.
         (c)   Productive farmland or forest land intended for continued
agricultural and/or forestry use.
      (3)   Additional open space. When primary and/or secondary conservation
areas do not equal or exceed the open space standard for a development site,
additional lands shall be designated as open space in order to meet such
standard.
   (B)   Open space design.  Provided such use is not inconsistent with §§
152.190 -
152.199 and with other applicable regulations, open space may be used to
provide active and/or passive outdoor recreation opportunities (e.g.,
ballfields, playgrounds, tennis courts, swimming pools, basketball courts, golf
courses, bikeways, walking trails, nature trails, and picnic areas), either for
the general public or for the subdivision’s residents or employees and their
guests.
      (1)   Open space may contain only such buildings, structures, access
ways, and parking facilities as are necessary and accessory to its principal
uses, e.g., pedestrian path, recreational clubhouse, utility lines, driveway,
small parking area, barns and other farm storage and processing facilities.
      (2)   The location, size, character, and shape of required open space
shall be appropriate to its intended use (e.g., open space proposed to be used
for recreation, particularly active recreation, shall be located and designed
so as to be conveniently and safely reached and used by those persons it is
intended to serve, and open space proposed to be used for ballfields, playing
fields, or other extensive active recreational facilities should be located on
land that is relatively flat and dry).
      (3)   Ownership and maintenance of open space. Arrangements for the
perpetual maintenance of open space must be approved in writing by the Land Use
Administrator. Any conveyance to a homeowners association shall be subject to
restrictive covenants and easements reviewed and approved by the Land Use
Administrator which shall prohibit future development of any open space for
other than open space or recreation purposes and shall provide for continued
maintenance of any open space and recreational facilities.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.103 COMMON SPACE STANDARDS.
   Certain developments are required to develop a specified portion of the
development site as common space. Where required, common space shall meet or
exceed the standards contained in this section.
   (A)   General design standards.  Common space is intended to shape the
design and character of a project through a connecting system of pedestrian
areas that create a relationship among the various components of the built
environment. It shall be designed to create areas where workers, residents and
shoppers, as the case may be, are directly or indirectly invited to gather,
browse, sit, interact or congregate. It shall be arranged as community space
with open areas, landscaping, seating facilities and lighting fixtures which
provide for safety and visual effects. Common spaces are intended to be places
for social interaction and, thus, may include impervious surfaces. Unless
interior common space is approved by the reviewing authority, common space
shall be out-of-doors.
   (B)   Specific design standards.  In addition to the general design
standards contained in §
152.105(A), common space design shall comply with the following.
      (1)   Trees.  One tree shall be planted for each 500 square feet of
common space. Trees shall have a minimum caliper of three to three and one-half
inches measured six inches above ground at the time of planting.
      (2)   Utilities.  All utilities service lines and connections shall be
underground.
      (3)   Seating. Seating shall be provided to accommodate workers,
residents and/or shoppers. Seating may be accomplished in whole or in part
using planters or other similar structures.
      (4)   Amenities. Common space for a development shall contain adequate
amenities to animate and enliven the environment and to make it conducive for
social interaction. Following is a list of such amenities: ornamental
fountains, stairways, waterfalls, public art, arbors, trellises, planted beds,
drinking fountains, clock pedestals, awnings, canopies, informational kiosks,
and similar structures. This list is not intended to be exhaustive.
   (C)   Lands which may be designated as common space. The following standards
control what lands in a development may be designated as common space.
      (1)   Primary conservation areas shall not be designated as common space
absent authorization from the town in those circumstances where, due to careful
design, the land in question can fulfill the function of common space without
compromising the purposes served by primary conservation areas.
      (2)   Land that is burdened with easements may be used provided that the
easements do not interfere with the use of the land for common space and do not
permit future development.
   (D)   Ownership and maintenance of common space.  Arrangements for the
perpetual maintenance of common space must be approved in writing by the Land
Use Administrator. Any conveyance to a homeowners association shall be subject
to restrictive covenants and easements reviewed by the Land Use Administrator
and recorded and filed in accordance with the times specified in this section.
The covenants and easements shall prohibit future development of any common
space for other than the purposes specified herein and shall provide for
continued maintenance of any such common space.
   (E)   Completion of common space.  All common space shall be set aside and
improved no later than the following applicable date:
      (1)   For subdivisions: prior to the sale of any lot;
      (2)   For planned developments: no later than the date on which
certificates of occupancy are issued for the first 75% of the total number of
dwelling units to be constructed in the project area.

§ 152.104 SEPARABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of this chapter be declared invalid by any
court, such declaration shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a
whole or any part thereof which is not specifically declared to be invalid.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.105 TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS.
   The purpose of a transportation impact analysis (TIA) is to assess the
impact of a proposed development on the existing transportation system. A TIA
will (1) ensure that the transportation network has adequate capacity to handle
projected transportation demand associated with the project, (2) identify
problems with the transportation system, (3) delineate solutions to identified
problems, and (4) identify improvements to be incorporated into the proposed
development.
   (A)   Required. Applicants for development authorization in which the
proposed development, redevelopment, or change of use is expected to generate
100 or more peak-hour trips (a.m. or p.m.) or 1,000 or more trips daily shall
have prepared by a qualified professional a TIA meeting the guidelines
established in this section. In addition to the foregoing, the Planning
Director shall have the discretion to require a TIA when there are localized
safety or capacity deficiencies.
   (B)   Presubmittal conference.  An applicant for development authorization
for any project expected to meet or exceed one or both of the TIA thresholds
specified in division (A), above, shall schedule a presubmittal conference with
the town. The engineering firm selected to prepare the TIA shall attend this
meeting the purpose of which is to establish the study area, the trip
distribution, the traffic counts to be utilized, approved developments in the
area, pass-by and internal capture percentages, additional hours of analysis,
if required (other than a.m. or p.m. peak), and resolve any other questions
specific to the site.
   (C)   TIA submission. Three copies of the TIA, if required, shall accompany
the application for development authorization. The TIA shall be prepared by a
licensed engineer registered to practice in the State of North Carolina who
shall have traffic assessment and transportation management experience. At a
minimum, the TIA shall include the following:
      (1)   Study purpose and objectives.
      (2)   Description of the site and study area boundaries including
appropriate mapping and rationale for selection of the study area boundaries.
      (3)   A summary of existing conditions including, but not limited to,
surrounding street and key intersection traffic volumes (daily and peak-hour),
turning movements, capacities, safety deficiencies, and funded transportation
improvements.
      (4)   Anticipated or approved development in the area.
      (5)   Trip generation, trip distribution, and discussion of the
following:
         (a)   Trip generation rates shall be based on trip generation rates
contained in the latest edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute
of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The applicant shall also provide the ITE
code used to identify the development trip generation rate and assumptions used
or data collected for any variations from generally accepted ITE rates or
equations.
         (b)   Pass-by trip factors and assumptions.
         (c)   Internal trip assumptions for mixed use developments.
         (d)   Trip distribution assumptions.
      (6)   Projection of future traffic volumes and assessment of future
roadway and intersection operating conditions for the year of the ultimate
completion of the project. All projections should specifically document
projected background traffic as well as the traffic generated by the proposed
development. If the project is to be phased; projections for each phase of the
development is required. If the unphased build-out period of the project is
greater than nine years, then a minimum of one intermediate and one full build-
out projection is required. All projections and assessments should include the
following three scenarios:
         (a)   No build.
         (b)   Maximum possible development under existing use or zoning.
Applicant shall conduct assessment of project phasing. The impact of the
development of a particular phase is not to be compared with the total possible
build-out of the entire project location.
         (c)   The development as proposed.
      (7)   Analysis of the key elements of the development and evaluation of
the impacts of the development on the following:
         (a)   Generalized peak hour and/or daily Link Level of Service (LOS)
analysis.  Using the peak hour directional volumes and daily traffic volumes
forecast and service thresholds, a general evaluation shall be made of the
street system for the short term and long-term horizon years. If the project is
to be phased; then an assessment of conditions after the completion of each
phase of the development is required. Incremental differences attributable to
the land use action shall be identified. A map showing generalized levels of
service shall be presented for each design year.
         (b)   Access analysis. The deign, number, and location of access
points to collector and arterial roadways must be fully analyzed. The number of
access points shall be kept to a minimum and be designed to be consistent with
the type of roadway facility. Access analysis shall include a strip accident,
intersection accident analysis and bicycle/ pedestrian analysis.
         (c)   Intersection analysis (signal warrant analysis, phasing
analysis, intersection crash analysis and progression analysis).  The
appropriateness of the development’s access locations and type must be

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN USES
§ 152.120 PURPOSE.
   This subchapter provides for the regulation of certain land uses which,
because of their nature or locational requirements, demand additional unique
standards in order to be compatible with other permitted or permissible uses
within the relevant zoning district.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.121 APPLICABILITY.
    These standards apply to a particular use only when it is designated as a
special use, or a “permitted use subject to special requirements” in any
particular zoning classification. They do not apply when a use is a permitted
use, that is, permitted by right. In such a situation, the development and
dimensional standards for the zoning classification and other applicable
standards will guide development and use. It is important to note this
distinction because the same use may be a special use or a permitted use
subject to special requirements in one zoning classification, in which case the
standards contained in this subchapter would apply, and a permitted use in
another classification, in which case they would not. The standards contained
in this subchapter also serve as minimum requirements for developments
undergoing special use review; provided, however, nothing herein shall be
construed to limit applicants from proposing, and the Town Council from
approving, plans which exceed these standards.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07; Am. Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.122 PROCEDURES FOR APPLYING STANDARDS.
   This subchapter does not distinguish between standards on the basis of
procedural review. Please refer to the appropriate zoning classification to
determine if the proposed use is a special use or a permitted use subject to
special requirements. If the proposed use is a special use or a permitted use
subject to special requirements, the standards will be applied during the
applicable development review procedure in accordance with §§
152.050 -
152.062, above.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.123 STANDARDS.
   As stated herein, the following standards apply to the indicated use when
such use is either a special use or a permitted use subject to special
requirements. These standards are in addition to other applicable development
standards contained in this chapter.
   (A)   Accessory dwelling units.
      (1)   Accessory dwelling units may only be situated on a lot on which a
principal residential dwelling unit is also situated and shall be clearly
incidental or accessory to such principal residential structure.
      (2)   No more than one accessory dwelling unit may be situated on any
lot.
      (3)   Accessory dwelling units may not exceed 800 square feet of floor
area.
      (4)   The lot shall comply with the minimum lot size requirement for the
zoning classification in which it is situated.
      (5)   The structure containing the accessory dwelling unit shall comply
with the set back requirements for the zoning classification in which it is
situated.
   (B)   Adaptive reuses.
      (1)   This section is intended to allow a means for the development of
new uses for a building originally designed for a different use. It is intended
to have application in two particular areas. The first is for the reuse of a
structure which has been used historically for a use permitted in the zoning
district classification but for which there is no longer any reasonable demand
for such previous use. Example of this first class include church buildings and
schools. The second class involves situations in which structures have been
devoted historically to a nonconforming use, the owner of the property no
longer desires to devote the property to that use or the use has ceased, and
there is no reasonable likelihood that the property will revert to a use
permitted in the zoning district classification.
      (2)   Adaptive reuses may only be authorized by means of special use
permits processed through the special use review requirements of §§
152.050 -
152.062, above. In addition to the standards set forth therein, adaptive reuses
must also meet the following special requirements.
         (a)   The developer proposes the reuse of a structure or structures
used historically for a use permitted in the zoning district classification but
for which there is no longer any reasonable demand for such previous use, or
the developer proposes the reuse of a structure or structures used historically
as nonconforming use and there is no reasonable likelihood that the property
will revert to a use permitted in the zoning district classification.
         (b)   The developer shall state the precise nature of the proposed
adaptive reuse, which shall be compatible with neighboring residential uses. If
a special use permit is granted for the adaptive reuse, future use of the
property shall be limited to the specified use unless (1) the use is changed to
another use permitted in the zoning classification or (2) a new adaptive reuse
is approved.
         (c)   The adaptive reuse shall be housed in an existing structure or
structures.
         (d)   Such structures may be modified or expanded so long as the gross
floor area is not increased by more than 10%, so long as the development
complies with the open space requirement in division (B)(2)(h), below, and so
long as the appearance of the modification is in harmony with the neighboring
residential uses.
         (e)   Off-street parking meeting the requirements of §
152.093, herein, shall be provided. Such off-street parking shall be screened
so that it is not readily visible from the street or from adjoining residential
uses.
         (f)   The adaptive reuse may have one sign not to exceed six square
feet in area or conforming to the sign requirements for the zoning district
where adaptive reuse is located.
         (g)   The developer shall propose, install and maintain landscaping
which will assist in giving it a residential appearance.
         (h)   The adaptive reuse shall provide open space which shall be not
less than the existing open space on the property or 60% of the total area of
the development parcel, whichever is less.
         (i)   Lighting for the adaptive reuse shall be no more than is
necessary for safe use of the facility, and shall be designed and installed so
that it is directed away from the roadway and any adjacent properties.
         (j)   Traffic generated by the adaptive reuse shall not be expected to
cause an inconvenience to residents of the neighborhood.
         (k)   The developer shall propose hours of operation for the adaptive
reuse which are designed to be compatible with neighboring residential uses.
Such hours of operation shall become a condition of the special use permit,
violation of which shall be grounds for revocation of the permit.
   (C)   Animal boarding facilities.  The standards in this section apply to
facilities, such as animal kennels and animal shelters, where the primary
purpose is the boarding of household pets. It shall not apply to boarding
facilities incidental to the operation of an animal hospital or clinic or to
pet stores.
      (1)   No animal boarding facility shall be operated without all necessary
licensure, certification or other form of permission from the state and any
other governmental agency with jurisdiction over its operation. Loss of such
permission shall be grounds for revocation of any conditional or special use
permit authorizing an animal boarding facility.
      (2)   No animal boarding facility shall be located within 500 feet of the
nearest lot line of a residential use or a residential zoning district.

for animal caretakers.
      (9)   Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated to provide
for the health of animals contained therein and to assist in the removal of
foul and obnoxious odors. Provision shall be made so that the volume of air
within any enclosed indoor facility shall be changed three times or more each
hour. This may be accomplished through the location and periodic opening of
doors and windows. If fans or ventilating equipment are used, they shall be
constructed in conformance with current standards of good engineering practice
with respect to noise and minimization of drafts.
      (10)   Indoor housing facilities for animals shall have sufficient
natural or artificial lighting to permit routine inspection and cleaning at any
time of day. In addition, sufficient natural or artificial lighting shall be
supplied in the area of sinks and toilets to provide for the hygiene of animal
caretakers.
      (11)   Interior wall, ceiling and floor surfaces of indoor housing
facilities shall be constructed of materials which are resistant to the
absorption of moisture and odors, or such surfaces shall be treated with a

adopted pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act, G.S. §§ 19A-20, et seq., as it may
be amended from time to time.
      (18)   No animal boarding facility shall be operated at any time after it
has been designated by a public health official pursuant to town, state or
federal statues or regulations concerning health, as being infested with
insects, rodents or disease which may endanger the public health, until the
health officer having jurisdiction shall have certified that the condition has
been corrected and the premises then comply with applicable health standards
and regulations.

less than three acres.
      (2)   A minimum of 65% of the project tract shall be designated as open
space.
      (3)    Maximum density for rest homes shall be 26 people per acre in all
zoning district classifications. In determining the number of people per acre,
it is assumed that each room where ambulatory assistance or skilled nursing
care is given contains one person per bed in the room. The Town Council shall
have the right to determine a lower density applying as criteria the following:
site constraints including but not limited to slopes over 20%, poor soils,
presence of floodplain, or other factors such as the traffic-bearing capability
of existing roads that would pose a threat to public health, safety or welfare,
or violate any of the review standards contained in this subchapter.

NONCONFORMITIES
§ 152.150 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this section is to regulate and limit the continued existence
of uses and structures lawfully established prior to the effective date of this
chapter, or any amendment thereto, that do not conform to this chapter, as
amended. Any nonconformity created by a change in the classification of
property or the text of these regulations shall be regulated by the provisions
of this subchapter. As used in this subchapter the term, “effective date of
this chapter, or any amendment thereto,” refers to the date of the chapter
which first rendered a use, structure or land nonconforming.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.151 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A nonconforming use is a use of land, buildings, or structures that was
lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter, or any
amendment thereto, but which does not conform to the regulations for the zoning
classification in which it is located. Nonconforming uses may be continued
subject to the limitations noted herein.
   (A)   No nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged, or moved
to occupy a different or greater area of land, buildings or structures than was
occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming; provided, however, a
nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were
specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time it became
nonconforming.
   (B)   No building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be
enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless such
building or structure is thereafter devoted to a conforming use; provided,
however, such building or structure may be enlarged or extended upon prior
authorization from the Board of Adjustment, which authorization shall not be
granted unless the Board of Adjustment makes each of the following findings of
fact:
      (1)   The proposed enlargement or extension shall be de minimis in
relation to the existing building or structure;
      (2)   The proposed enlargement or extension shall not increase the
intensity of the nonconforming use, which is to say, it will not result in an
increase in dwelling units for a residential use nor in gross floor area for a
nonresidential use;
      (3)   The proposed enlargement or extension is designed so that it will
not render the use of the property any less compatible than it is in its
existing circumstances;
      (4)   The authorization of such proposed enlargement or extension is not
otherwise contrary to the public health, safety or welfare.
   (C)   (1)   A nonconforming use of a structure may not be changed to another
nonconforming use unless such change is authorized by the Board of Adjustment.
In order to authorize a change in nonconforming use, the Board of Adjustment
shall consider the relative impacts of the existing nonconforming use and the
proposed nonconforming use with regard to traffic, noise, pollution, visual
appearance and compatibility with the neighborhood, and shall make each of the
following findings:
         (a)   The proposed use is expected to result in impacts which are less
than those associated with the existing use;
         (b)   The proposed use will be more compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood than is the existing use;
         (c)   Approval of the change in nonconforming use serves the public
health, safety and general welfare;
         (d)   Failure to approve the change in nonconforming use would result
in a hardship to the owner of the property on which the nonconforming use is
situated.
      (2)   An existing nonconforming use shall be discontinued within 60 days
of the date of approval of a change in nonconforming use. Subsequent to that
time, such existing use shall become unlawful.
   (D)   Where a nonconforming use ceases for 180 consecutive days, then the
use shall not be re-established or resumed, and any subsequent use of the land
or structure shall conform to the requirements of this chapter. Vacancy and
non-use of the building or structure, regardless of the intent of the owner,
shall constitute discontinuance under this provision.
   (E)   Where a building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use is
damaged to the extent of 50% or more of its current value, such building or
structure, if restored, shall thereafter be devoted to conforming uses.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.152 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming structure is a building or other structure which lawfully
existed prior to the effective date of this chapter, or an amendment thereto,
and which no longer could be built under the terms of this chapter, as amended,
by reason of restrictions on area, footprint, open space, building height,
setbacks, lot width, or other requirements concerning the structure.
   (A)   A nonconforming structure devoted to a use permitted in the zoning
classification in which it is located may continue to be used only in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the
continuation of nonconforming structures.
   (C)   Except as provided in divisions (D) and (E), below, a nonconforming
structure shall not undergo a change of use, renovation or expansion.
   (D)   A nonconforming structure may undergo a change of use or renovation
without having to bring the structure into conformity with the requirements of
these regulations, provided that:
      (1)   The change in use or renovation does not increase the floor area of
the structure;
      (2)   The change in use is to a permitted use within the district; and
      (3)   The number of parking spaces provided for the use is in conformity
with the requirements of these regulations.
   (E)   A nonconforming structure may be expanded, without bringing the
nonconforming structure into conformity with these regulations, only if the
part of the structure to be expanded and the area of the lot into which the
expansion is taking place are both brought into conformity with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (F)   A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless it thereafter
conforms to the standards of the zoning classification in which it is located.
   (G)   Where a nonconforming structure is damaged by fire, flood, wind, or
other act of God, and such damage does not exceed 50% of the current assessed
taxable value of the structure, it may be restored to its original dimensions
and conditions as long as a building permit for the restoration is issued
within twelve months of the date of the damage.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.153 NONCONFORMING VACANT LOTS.
   A nonconforming vacant lot is a lot that was lawfully created prior to the
effective date of this chapter, or any amendment thereto, but which does not
conform to the minimum gross land area or minimum lot requirements for the
zoning classification in which it is located.
   (A)   Except as provided herein, a nonconforming vacant lot may be used for
any of the uses permitted by this chapter in the zoning classification in which
it is located, provided that the use meets all limitations and minimum
requirements for setback and yards, height, open space, buffers, screening,
parking, density and floor area required in this ordinance for the zoning
classification in which the lot is located.
   (B)   If compliance of the structure(s) intended on the nonconforming lot
with applicable setback requirements is not reasonably possible, the
nonconforming lot may be used as a building site subject to the granting of a
variance from such setback requirements by the Board of Adjustment in
accordance with the provisions of §§
152.070 -
152.078.
   (C)   With regard to residential dwellings, variances authorized pursuant to
division (B), above, shall be limited to single-family dwellings. Two-family or
multi-family residential dwellings shall not be entitled to such a variance.
   (D)   Where a nonconforming lot abuts another lot of record (whether
conforming or nonconforming) held in the same ownership at or subsequent to
enactment of this section, such lots shall be combined or recombined as
necessary to form a conforming lot or lots and shall not thereafter be
subdivided except in compliance with all of the requirements of this chapter.
Where a nonconforming lot was created by public taking action or as a result of
a court order, the above combination or recombination of lots shall not be
required.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.154 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of land, buildings, structures, or
other development of land devoted to a nonconforming use or having
nonconforming structures are permitted, provided the cost of such repairs and
maintenance within any 12-month period does not exceed 10% of the current
assessed taxable value of the land, buildings, structure, or other development
of land. Any structure or other development of land devoted to a nonconforming
use that is declared unsafe by the Land Use Administrator because of lack of
repairs and maintenance shall not be restored, repaired, reconstructed, or used
except in conformity with the provisions of this section. Any structure or
other development of land devoted to a nonconforming use that is declared
unsafe by the Land Use Administrator, but not because of lack of repairs and
maintenance, may be repaired and restored subject to the requirements of this
section.

(Ord. passed 10-1-07; Am. Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.163 PROCESSING OF APPLICATION.
    An application for amendment shall be processed in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
   (A)   Action by the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall consider and
make recommendations to the Town Council concerning each proposed zoning map
amendment/rezoning, and/or amendment to the text of this chapter, in conformity
with this section.
      (1)   Plan consistency statement. The Planning Board shall by majority
vote make a recommendation to the Town Council whether it should adopt or
reject any zoning map amendment/rezoning and/or text amendment. The
recommendation shall be made in reference to the town's comprehensive land use
plan, and shall specify whether and in what way the proposed amendment is
either a) consistent with the comprehensive plan, b) inconsistent with the
comprehensive plan and should be rejected, or c) inconsistent with the
comprehensive plan but nevertheless be adopted, thereby amending the future
land use map contained within the comprehensive plan accordingly. The proposal
will place all property similarly situated in the area in the same category, or
in appropriate complementary categories.
      (2)   Reasonableness statements for map amendments/rezonings. If the
matter under consideration is a zoning map amendment/rezoning, the Planning
Board shall also specify whether the zoning map amendment/rezoning is
reasonable. The Planning Board may, but is not required, to propose a statement
of reasonableness concerning a text amendment. This statement may consider,
among other factors:
         a.   The size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the area
proposed to be rezoned;
         b.    The benefits and detriments to the landowners, neighbors, and
surrounding community;
         c.   The relationship between current and actual permissible
development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be
permissible under the proposed amendment;
         d.   Why the zoning map amendment/rezoning is in the public interest;
and
         e.   Any changed conditions warranting the amendment.
      (3)   Large-scale rezonings. If a zoning map amendment meets the
statutory definition of a “large-scale rezoning,” when a) the plan consistency
statement may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and
policies in the comprehensive plan were considered; and b) the reasonableness
statement may address the overall rezoning.
   (B)   Notice of public hearing.  No amendment shall be adopted by the Town
Council until after a public notice and hearing. Notice of the date, time and
place of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation once a week for two successive weeks, with the first notice to be
published not less than ten nor more than 25 days prior to the date of the
hearing.
      (1)   When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the owner of that parcel
of land as shown on the county tax listing, and the owners of all parcels of
land abutting that parcel of land as shown on the county tax listing, shall be
mailed a notice of a public hearing on the proposed amendment by first class
mail at the last addresses listed for such owners on the county tax abstracts.
This notice must be deposited in the mail not less than ten nor more than 25
days prior to the date of the public hearing. The person or persons mailing
such notices shall certify to the Town Council that fact, and such certificate
shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.
      (2)   When a proposed zoning map amendment directly affects more than 50
properties, owned by a total of at least 50 different property owners, the town
may elect to use the expanded published notice provided for in this section
rather than the notice stipulated in division (B)(1), above. In this
circumstance, the town may provide notice of the hearing by means of an
advertisement not less than one-half newspaper page in size published in a
newspaper of general circulation once a week for two successive weeks, with the
first notice to be published not less than ten nor more than 25 days prior to
the date of the hearing.
      (3)   When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the town shall prominently
post a notice of the public hearing on the site proposed for rezoning or on an
adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. The notice shall be a minimum
of 18 inches by 24 inches in size. When multiple parcels are included within a
proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not
required, but the town shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable
notice to interested persons.
   (C)   Nature of proceedings.  It is the intent of this ordinance that
applicants for rezoning to any district other than a special use district or a
planned development district shall be prohibited from offering any testimony or
evidence concerning the specific manner in which they intend to use or develop
the property.
   (D)   Citizen comments. If any resident or property owner in the town
submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or
repeal to a zoning ordinance to the Town Clerk at least two business days prior
to the proposed vote on such change, the Town Clerk shall deliver such written
statement to the Town Council. If the proposed change is the subject of a
quasi-judicial proceeding under G.S. § 160-338, the Town Clerk shall provide
only the names and addresses of the individuals providing written comment, and
the provision of such names and addresses to all members of the Town Council
shall not disqualify any member of the Council from voting.
   (E)   Statements of consistency, reasonableness; voting. The Town Council
shall adopt a statement of consistency of each amendment considered pursuat to
this section; it shall also adopt a statement of reasonableness for each zoning
map amendment/rezoning. In adopting such statement(s) as required by law, the
Town Council may adopt by reference the statement(s) proposed by the Planning
Board, may modify such proposed statement(s), or may specify entirely separate
grounds for such statement(s). Pursuant to G.S. § 160A-75, as amended, a
failure to vote by any member of the Town Council physically present in the
Council Room, or who has withdrawn without being excused by a majority vote of
the remaining Council members present, shall not be recorded as an affirmative
vote.

BUFFERING, SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING
§ 152.170 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Town of Franklin has an abundant and diverse tree and vegetative cover
that contributes to the aesthetic value of the town and provides numerous
ecological and economic benefits. The landscaping, buffering, and screening
standards set forth below require landscaping in certain circumstances and
locations in order to achieve the following:
   (A)   Encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation and
replenish removed vegetation;
   (B)   Improve the visual quality of the town and minimize potential negative
impacts of development such as noise, dust, glare of lights, parking lots,
traffic, heat, overcrowding, and odor;
   (C)   Provide environmental benefits such as climate modification, decreased
energy consumption, reduced stormwater runoff, decreased erosion, improved
water and air quality, and protection of wildlife habitat;
   (D)   Provide a transition between dissimilar land uses to protect abutting
properties from potential negative impacts of neighboring development and
preserve the character and value of a property and provide a sense of privacy;
   (E)   Improve standards for quantity, location, size, spacing, protection,
and maintenance of plants and other screening materials to assure a high level
of quality in the appearance of Franklin while allowing flexibility to promote
well designed and creative landscape plantings;
   (F)   Require the maintenance of landscaping installed to meet the
requirements of these standards to ensure that the landscaping continues to
thrive and enhance the visual quality of the Town of Franklin.

§ 152.171 LANDSCAPING, BUFFERING AND SCREENING REQUIRED.
   Landscaping, buffering and screening shall be required for developments
within the planning jurisdiction of the Town of Franklin, including its
extraterritorial jurisdiction, as set forth herein.
   (A)   The following developments must bring the entire site into full
compliance with the requirements of this subchapter:
      (1)   Any new public or private development with the exception of single
or two-family homes.
      (2)   A change of use to a higher impact. For purposes of this section,
the following list ranks differing uses from lowest to highest impact:
residential, mobile home park, institutional and cultural, commercial,
industrial.
      (3)   Renovations with a total cost exceeding 50% of the assessed value
of the building according to Macon County tax records or an appraisal by a
state licensed appraiser.
      (4)   Expansions exceeding 50% of the pre-expansion floor area or paved
surface.
      (5)   Existing unpaved parking lots which are paved over.
   (B)   Expansions or additions that are less than 50% of the pre-expansion
floor area and/or pavement surface must meet the landscaping requirements only
in the area around the addition, which is parallel to any edge of the expansion
area and extending to the property line or street pavement edge.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.172 ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE.
   The landscape requirements are intended to set minimum standards for quality
development and environmental protection and are not intended to be arbitrary
or inhibit creative solutions. Site conditions or other reasons may justify the
need to request an alternate method of compliance with the landscape
requirements. The reviewing authority, as specified in §§
152.050 -
152.062, above, may alter the requirements of this section as long as existing
or added landscape features of the development site comply with the intent of
this subchapter. Requests for alternative compliance shall be accepted if one
or more of the following conditions are met.
   (A)   Topography, geologic features, drainage channels or streams, existing
natural vegetation, overhead or underground utilities, or other conditions make
it unreasonable or meaningless to plant a buffer or meet other landscape
requirements.
   (B)   Space limitations, unusually shaped lots, unique relationships to
other properties, and/or prevailing practices in the surrounding neighborhood
(such as use of a specific type of vegetation) may justify alternative
compliance when changing the use type of an existing building in an established
mature neighborhood or when developing in an historic district.
   (C)   An alternative compliance proposal is equal or better than normal
compliance in its ability to fulfill the intent of this article and exhibits
superior design quality.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.173 EXISTING VEGETATION.
   (A)   This section seeks to provide incentives to developers to utilize
existing vegetation on a development site in meeting the requirements of this
subchapter.
      (1)   Preservation of existing vegetation. Preserving trees can improve
the aesthetic quality of the site and improve property values, provide
environmental benefits, mitigate the impacts of development on the community,
and help minimize opposition to a proposed development. It is recommended that
groups of trees be preserved, as well as individual trees. Existing preserved
trees and shrubs may be credited towards required buffer trees, street trees,
and parking lot trees, in accordance with division (A)(2), below.
      (2)   Credits and other incentives to preserve vegetation. Preserved
trees may be credited at the following rate:
         2 - 6 inch caliper tree = 1 tree
         7 - 12 inch caliper tree = 2 trees
         13 - 18 inch caliper tree = 3 trees
         19 - 24 inch caliper tree = 4 trees
         25+ inch caliper tree = 5 trees
   (B)   If the developer chooses to receive credit, preserved vegetation must
be in good health and condition. Trees designated to be preserved must be
indicated on the site plan and on landscape and grading plans. Protective
barriers, if utilized in accordance with division (C), below, must also be
shown on the landscape and grading plans. A preserved tree shall be replaced
with the total number of trees which were credited to the existing tree if the
preserved tree dies within one year of preservation.
   (C)   Protection of existing trees during construction. The regulations
contained in this section shall apply in those circumstances when a developer
has elected to protect trees during construction and, thus, after the passage
of five years, be excused from the requirement to replace preserved trees.
      (1)   No grading or other land-disturbing activity can occur on a site
with existing trees which are designated to be preserved in order to meet
landscaping requirements until protective barriers are installed by the
developer and approved by the Land Use Administrator or his or her designee.
Trees designated for preservation which are counted toward the landscape
requirements must be protected by barriers, while trees designated for
preservation which do not count toward the landscape requirements are
encouraged to be protected by barriers. The diameter of the preserved trees and
the location of protective barriers must be shown on landscape and grading
plans with the dimension between the tree trunk and barrier indicated.
      (2)   (a)   Protective barriers shall be placed around the critical root
zone of preserved trees that are within 50 feet of any grading or construction
activity. The critical root zone is a circle extending around the tree with a
one-foot radius for every one-inch of tree diameter. For example, a ten-inch
diameter tree would have a barricade surrounding it, erected ten feet away from
the trunk. All protective barriers must be maintained throughout the building
construction process. Protective barriers shall consist of one or more of the
following:
            1.   A fence which is at least three feet high and constructed in a
post and rail configuration, using two-by-four posts and one-by-four rails; or
            2.   A fence with posts placed no farther than ten feet apart
covered with four-foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing.
         (b)   The Land Use Administrator may authorize other protective
barriers which meet or exceed the protection offered by the above.
      (3)   (a)   All contractors must be made aware of the areas designated
for protection. No disturbance can occur within the tree protection areas
including the following:
            1.   Grading;
            2.   Filling, unless an aeration system, certified by a registered
landscape architect, certified arborist, or North Carolina Agricultural
Extension Specialist, is installed to protect the tree from suffocation;
            3.   Parking;
            4.   Storage of debris or materials, including topsoil;
            5.   Disposal of hazardous wastes or concrete washout; and
            6.   Attaching of nails, ropes, cables, signs, or fencing to any
tree designated for preservation.
         (b)   If any area within the critical root zone will be disturbed for
any reason, a registered landscape architect, certified arborist, or North
Carolina Agricultural Extension Specialist must recommend measures to minimize
any potential impact and certify that the activity will not damage the tree
under normal circumstances.
      (4)   The developer should coordinate with utility providers early in the
design process to resolve potential conflicts about the placement of utilities
and landscape requirements. Utilities must either be placed outside of the tree
protection area or, with Planning Department approval, tunneled at least two
feet directly below the tree roots, to minimize root damage.
      (5)   If silt fencing is required to control sedimentation, the fencing
must be placed along the uphill edge of a tree protection zone in order to
prevent sediment from accumulating in the critical root zone area.
   (D)   Trees in public rights-of-way.  Trees located in any municipal right-
of-way cannot be pruned or removed without permission from the Public Works
Department.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.174 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   The following general standards shall apply to all landscaping requirements
in this subchapter.
   (A)   Design.  Unless otherwise specified, the exact placement of required
plants and structures shall be the decision of the developer. The type of
plants used shall be limited to those on the approved “species list” which
shall be published and revised from time to time by the Land Use Administrator.
Required landscaping shall be designed in such a manner as to impart its
aesthetic character when viewed from any area accessible to the public or from
adjacent properties.
   (B)   Plant material.  Plant materials used for installation shall conform
to the standards established by the American Association of Nurserymen in the
“American Standard for Nursery Stock,” for each type (i.e., canopy tree, shrub,
etc.) with minimum size as appropriate for the minimum caliper size designated
in the approved species list. Grass sod, when made a part of a buffer, must be
healthy, clean, and reasonably free of weeds, noxious pests, or diseases.
   (C)   Installation.  All landscaping/screening shall be installed in a
sound, workmanlike manner and according to accepted good planting procedures
with the quantity and quality of plant materials as described. All elements of
landscaping shall be installed so as to meet all other applicable ordinances
and code requirements.
   (D)   Maintenance.  The owner, occupant, tenant, and the respective agent of
each, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of
all buffers and landscaping. Buffers and landscaping shall be maintained in a
good condition to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance at least
equal to the original installation and shall be kept free from refuse and
debris. Dead vegetation and landscaping material shall be promptly replaced
with healthy, living plantings. Evergreen hedges shall be trimmed annually or
as needed to provide a full visual screen and, in any event, shall not be
allowed to exceed eight feet in height without written approval of the Land Use
Administrator.
   (E)   Walls and fences. Any walls used for screening or as part of a buffer
shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, or other masonry
materials. When concrete block is utilized, it shall be finished with stucco on
both sides. Wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically
designed as fencing materials may be approved by the Land Use Administrator for
use in a Type C Buffer. Other materials may also be considered through the
alternative buffer and screening process described in §
152.172. No more than 10% of the surface of a fence or wall shall be left open,
and the finished side of the fence or wall shall face the abutting property. A
chain link fence may not be used to satisfy the requirements of this
subchapter.
   (F)   Overhead utilities.  Landscaping plans, including plant spacing and
species selection shall be such that landscaping required under this subchapter
does not conflict with overhead utilities.
   (G)   Species diversity.  When the total number of trees required under the
provisions of this subchapter equals 20 or more, then no single tree species
shall comprise more than 25% of the trees planted on the development site.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.175 BUFFERYARDS AND BUFFERS.
   Certain land uses may create an adverse impact when developed adjacent to
other less intensive land uses. A bufferyard is a permanent unit of land
together with plantings and structure(s), if any, which is designed to
ameliorate such adverse impacts. Bufferyards, as required in this section,
shall be depicted on any site plans reviewed under this ordinance and shall be
depicted and described on drawings submitted for the purpose of development
plan review. Unless deferred pursuant to a letter of compliance issued under §
152.177, below, buffers shall be emplaced and approved prior to issuance of any
certificate of occupancy for the development.
   (A)   Location of buffers. Buffers shall be located on lot or parcel
boundary lines. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of an existing
public or private street or right-of-way, whether opened or unopened.
   (B)   Determination of buffer requirements.  To determine a buffer required
between two adjacent parcels or between a parcel and a street, the following
procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   Identify the proposed land use.
      (2)   Identify the use or, if vacant, the zoning district classification,
of land adjacent to the proposed use.
      (3)   Determine the buffer required on each boundary (or segment thereof)
of the subject parcel by referring to the following Table of Buffer
Requirements. This specifies the buffer required between proposed land uses and
existing adjacent land uses or zoning districts.
   TABLE OF BUFFER REQUIREMENTS

   Notes for table of buffer requirements: Indicated buffering is required if
adjacent parcel of land is used or zoned for the category noted regardless
whether adjacent parcel is located in the town, the town’s extraterritorial
jurisdiction (ETJ), or the planning jurisdiction of another governmental
entity. Existing adjacent land use takes precedence over zoning district.
Buffer requirement for the district will be used if adjacent land is vacant.
   Institutional and cultural category includes religious, recreational, child
care and educational uses and the MICR zoning classification.
   (C)   Buffer specifications. The following schedule sets forth the
specifications of each of the buffers included in the Table of Buffer
Requirements. Unless noted differently, the column entitled planting
requirements refers to number of individual plants required per 100 linear feet
of the buffer. The column entitled size requirements refers to the minimum size
of individual plants at the time of planting. Unless otherwise noted,
dimensions refer to height.
 
Type of Buffer Planting Requirement/100 Linear Feet Size Requirements
               3 Broadleaf canopy trees             5 - 6 feet
A              20 Evergreen shrubs                  18 - 24 inches
               (4-foot centers)

B              25 Evergreen shrubs                  18 - 24 inches
               (4-foot centers)                      
               33 Flowering shrubs                  18 - 24 inches
               4 Broadleaf canopy trees             1 3/4 - 2 inch caliper
               10 Understory trees                  5 - 6 feet
C              33 Flowering shrubs                  18 - 24 inches

               Fence or wall on top of berm         8 feet
X              No buffer required                   Not applicable
 
   For type A and B buffers, the developer may, at his or her option,
substitute a masonry wall for the evergreen shrubs. A wooden fence may be
incorporated into a buffer but shall not be allowed to substitute for evergreen
shrubs.
   (D)   Use of buffer. If approved by the Land Use Administrator, a buffer may
be used for passive recreation; however, no plant material may be removed and
such use shall not be a nuisance.
   (E)   Buffers part of required yards. Where front, side and rear yards are
required by this chapter, buffers may be established within such required
yards.
   (F)   Buffer requirements when a street separates incompatible uses.  If a
street with right-of-way of more than 30 feet lies between two land uses which
would require a bufferyard between them, a buffer shall be required along the
affected side or rear property lines of the developing use. No bufferyard is
required along the front property line.
   (G)   Bufferyards in the central commercial district.  In order to preserve
and promote existing development patterns within the C-1 Central Commercial
District, the bufferyard requirements of this subchapter shall not apply
therein.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07; Am. Ord. passed 10-20-08)
§ 152.176 SCREENING.
   (A)   These screening requirements shall apply to any development or use
other than single-family or two-family residences. A buffer as specified in
this subchapter may be used to meet the requirements of this section. Where
practicable, the following uses must be screened from abutting property and
from public view from a public right-of-way or a parking lot:
      (1)   Dumpsters or trash handling areas;
      (2)   Utility structures associated with a building;
      (3)   Loading docks or spaces;
      (4)   Outdoor storage of materials, stock and equipment, which shall not
include the display of goods for sale; and
      (5)   Any other uses for which screening is required under this chapter.
   (B)   As far as practicable, any screening used to comply with the
provisions of this section shall consist of a planting area which is at least
five feet wide. This area may contain any type screening materials sufficient
to separate visually the land uses, provided such materials meet the
requirements of this subchapter. If only a wall or fence is used, then the area
devoted to the screen need only be wide enough to accommodate the wall or fence
and allow for its maintenance. Where practicable, screening shall be designed
and maintained in such a manner as to conceal the use from view from the
street, from vehicular use areas, and from adjoining properties.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.177 LETTER OF COMPLIANCE.
   It is recognized that land development occurs continuously and that
vegetation used in buffers should be planted at certain times of the year to
ensure the best chance of survival. In order to ensure compliance with this
subchapter and to reduce the potential expense of replacing buffering,
landscaping, or screening materials which were installed in an untimely or
improper fashion, a letter of compliance must be filed with the Land Use
Administrator at the time of development plan review. A letter of compliance
will allow the issuance of a conditional certificate of occupancy. This letter
will acknowledge that the applicant for a certificate of development plan is
aware of any buffer, landscaping or screening requirements which may apply to
his or her property and that he or she will comply with those requirements by a
specific date, generally to be within the next planting season, but in no case
more than one year after the completion of construction of that portion of the
project or building for which the certificate was issued. In no event shall a
final certificate of occupancy be issued prior to emplacement and approval of
the required buffer, landscaping, or screening. Failure to comply with the
provisions of this section within the time noted in the letter of compliance
will be a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.178 LANDSCAPING FOR VEHICULAR USE AREAS.
   Trees and shrubs are required in and around vehicular use areas with more
than six spaces to provide attractive views from roads and adjacent properties,
provide shade to reduce the heat generated by impervious surfaces, reduce glare
from vehicular use areas, and to help filter exhaust from vehicles.
   (A)   Perimeter and interior plantings. Vehicular use areas must be planted
with at least one tree and two shrubs for every 4,000 square feet of vehicular
use area, which includes parking spaces, aisles, driveways, and loading areas.
Trees shall be spaced so that no parking space is more than 63 feet from a
tree. At least 75% of the required parking lot trees must be broadleaf canopy
trees. Trees and shrubs must be planted within 20 feet of the vehicular use
area to count as parking lot landscaping; provided, however, all street trees
required by other provisions of this chapter shall count as parking lot
landscaping.
      (1)   When a development contains 20 or more parking spaces, 50% of the
trees and shrubs must be planted in islands or medians located within the
parking lot. Tree islands shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking
lot in order to provide an even tree canopy throughout the lot. At a minimum,
such tree islands shall consist of an area at least equal in size to two
parking places side-by-side (360 square feet). Parking bays shall be broken up
with landscaped islands or medians to avoid long monotonous rows of parking.
Planting trees in groups is encouraged to increase the total amount of planting
area for roots to grow.
      (2)   At the time of planting, trees and shrubs required in this section
shall meet the following minimum size requirements:
         (a)   Broadleaf canopy trees: one and one-half to two-inch caliper;
         (b)   All other trees: five to six feet in height;
         (c)   All shrubs: height or spread of 18 to 24 inches.
   (B)   Planting strips. When a vehicular use area lot is located within 100
feet of an abutting property and no bufferyard is required, a planting strip
which is a minimum of five feet wide shall be planted between the vehicular use
area and the abutting property, except along approved driveway openings which
run perpendicular to the planting strip. One large evergreen or deciduous tree
and five evergreen or deciduous shrubs shall be planted for every 40 linear
feet of property line that parallels the vehicular use area. Fifty percent of
these trees and shrubs may be counted toward the parking lot trees and shrubs
required in division (A) if the planting strip is located within 20 feet of the
vehicular use area. Adjacent businesses on separate lots which share parking or
driveways shall be exempt from this requirement provided that the required
planting strip would interfere with the reasonable use of the shared parking or
driveway. Vehicular use areas located behind buildings and screened from view
from public rights-of-way shall be exempt from this requirement.
   (C)   Buffering from street. Vehicular use areas greater than 4,000 square
feet any portion of which is located within 50 feet of the right-of-way of a
street must be buffered from the street. The buffer shall be at least three
feet high at maturity and can consist of plant material alone, or berms,
fences, walls, or grade changed combined with plant material. A vegetative
buffer shall consist of at least one evergreen or deciduous shrub planted for
every five linear feet of buffer required. If a fence or wall is used, it must
be constructed of wood, brick, stone or other masonry and be architecturally
compatible with the proposed structure. Seventy-five percent of the fence or
wall must be opaque with any spaces evenly distributed. The finished side of
the fence or wall shall face the street. At least one shrub shall be planted on
the street side for each eight linear feet of fence or wall. Berms and grade
changes must be completely covered with vegetation. All shrubs planted can
count toward the parking lot landscaping requirements.
   (D)   Structured parking facilities. Structured parking facilities, or
parking decks, shall be excused from the parking lot landscaping requirements
contained in this section but shall comply with the provisions of this
paragraph. In the event that any openings for ventilation, service, or
emergency access are located at the first floor level in the building facade,
then they shall be an integral part of the overall building design. These
openings as well as pedestrian and vehicular entrances shall be designed to
minimize visibility of parked cars. The remainder of street level frontage
shall be either commercial space or an architecturally articulated facade
designed to minimize the visibility of parked cars. All levels of a structured
parking facility shall be designed and screened in such a way as to minimize
visibility of parked cars. In no instance will rails or cabling alone be
sufficient to meet this screening requirement. The design elements of this
paragraph shall only apply to building facades which are visible from a public
right-of-way.
   (E)   Automobile sales facilities. Automobile sales facilities, due to the
fact that inventory is typically stored and displayed for sale on vehicular use
areas, require separate analysis with regard to the parking lot landscaping
requirements in this section. Automobile sales facilities are, accordingly,
exempted from the need to comply with interior parking lot landscaping
requirements for that portion of an automobile sales facility utilized
exclusively for the display of goods for sale. Automobile sales facilities are
required to comply with the perimeter and planting strip requirements of this
section; provided, however, such facilities shall be permitted one display
area, which shall not be required to be screened, for each 100 feet of roadway
frontage. Each display area shall extend no more than 50 feet in length.
   (F)   Effect on other regulations.  Areas devoted to meeting the landscaping
requirements of this section may count toward the common open space
requirements contained in §§
152.090 -
152.105, hereof. Where site characteristics and development considerations make
it prudent and feasible, landscaping proposed to meet the requirements of this
section may also contribute toward meeting the buffering and screening
requirements contained in this subchapter.
   (G)   Small lots. Small lots, defined as lots with less than 75 feet of
frontage on a roadway or with less than 75 feet of depth, may have site
constraints which make strict compliance with the regulations contained in this
section a hardship. In such cases, the approving authority for the town may
approve deviations from such regulations so long as the plans of development
are consistent with the goals and objectives stated herein.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.179 BUFFER REQUIREMENTS WHEN A STREET SEPARATES INCOMPATIBLE USES.
   If a street with right-of-way of less than 30 feet lies between two land
uses which would require a bufferyard between them, a buffer shall be required
along the affected side or rear property lines of the developing use. No
bufferyard is required along the front property line.

NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
§ 152.190 STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS OF FACT.
    The General Assembly of the State of North Carolina has delegated to local
governmental the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Pursuant thereto,
the Town Council of the Town of Franklin, North Carolina, makes the following
legislative findings of fact.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the Town of Franklin and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results
in loss of life, property, health hazards, safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   The development activities listed herein contribute, individually and
cumulatively, to the flood losses addressed above: (1) obstructions in flood
plains causing increases in flood heights and velocities; (2) the occupancy in
flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards; (3) the loss
of wetlands, streamside riparian areas, and other lands that slow, absorb,
retain, and cleanse storm and flood waters; and (4) the expansion of impervious
surfaces both within and outside of flood prone areas that cause increases in
the velocity and rate of the discharge of storm water into bodies of water.
   (C)   The discharge of urban pollutants and sedimentation into bodies of
water results in health and safety hazards and the impairment of
environmentally and economically significant aquatic wildlife habitat,
adversely affecting the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (D)   Development activities cause sedimentation pollution through untreated
and uncontrolled storm water from impervious areas, improper land disturbance,
and the loss of wetlands, streamside riparian areas, and other lands that
absorb and cleanse storm and floodwaters.
   (E)    The steeply sloping areas within the Town of Franklin and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction are particularly susceptible to erosion and
landslides, and pose particular difficulties in the construction and
maintenance of public infrastructure and the provision of public services.
Development activities in such areas are likely to result in the loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.

§ 152.191 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this subchapter to protect and promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare by preventing the loss of life and/or
public and private economic loss due to landslides, floods, erosion, and
sedimentation pollution. It is further the purpose of this subchapter to
protect our existing environmental resources, including steep slopes, flood
plains, stream corridors, wetlands, watershed and groundwater recharge areas,
soils, forest stands, specimen trees, and other significant vegetation and
wildlife, which are of economic value to the town and its citizens and make
Franklin a desirable place to live and visit. In furtherance of this purpose,
the regulations contained herein are designed to accomplish the following:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are or may be dangerous to health,
safety, and property or that may result in damaging increases in erosion, flood

§ 152.194 SEDIMENTATION AND EROSION PREVENTION.
   In order to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation pollution of streams,
springs, flat water bodies, drainage networks, or other surface waters, the
property owner shall at all times comply with all requirements of
Chapter 153: Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance of Macon County.
(Ord. passed 10-1-07)
§ 152.195 STORMWATER RUNOFF PROVISIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to (1) protect life and property and minimize
nuisances by limiting destructive runoff and flooding generated by impervious
surface areas and (2) to protect water quality and natural ecosystems by
filtering sediments and pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, trace metals,
and hydrocarbons.
   (A)   Affected property. The requirements of this Section shall apply to the
following activities:
      (1)   Any new non-residential or mixed-use development, or any existing
non-residential or mixed-use development undergoing significant improvement, or
any existing nonresidential or mixed-use development undergoing an expansion of
impervious surface area of 25% or more.
      (2)   Any new residential development or subdivision of four or more
dwelling units, any existing multi-family residential structure of four or more
dwelling units undergoing significant improvement, and any expansion of or
additions to an existing residential structure or development that would result
in four or more dwelling units within the same parcel of land or structure or
grouping of joined structures.
      (3)   All new major subdivisions and any new phase or expansion of
existing major subdivisions.
      (4)   All new non-residential or mixed-use minor subdivisions and any new
phase or expansion of an existing non-residential or mixed-use minor
subdivision.
      (5)   Any new development project permitted by means of a special use
permit.
      (6)   New structures; significant improvements to existing non-
residential or mixed use structures; significant improvements to existing
residential structures containing four or more dwelling units; and any
expansion of impervious surface area of 25% or more within any development
except expansions to residential structures containing fewer than four dwelling
units, unless otherwise subject to these requirements.
      (7)    Any project for which stormwater management is required as a
condition of approval by the Land Use Administrator or the Town Council.
   (B)   Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from the
stormwater management provisions of this section:
      (1)   Bona fide agricultural structures used exclusively for agricultural
purposes; and
      (2)   Except as provided elsewhere in this chapter, the placement of
small accessory buildings or structures or small amounts of other built-upon
area; provided, however, that the total additional built-upon area shall be no
greater than 400 square feet and the additional built-upon area shall not be
placed within a special flood hazard area or surface water protection area.
   (C)   Stormwater management requirements. Development activities tend to
increase the volume of stormwater runoff due to the elimination of pervious
surfaces through paving and the construction of buildings and other structures.
Stormwater runoff impacts the public health, safety, and welfare by flooding
private and public property, by discharging pollutants, such as oils and
greases, into receiving water bodies, and by making public streets and roads
unsafe. Therefore, applicants for development authorization shall not be
entitled to a land development permit until the applicant has demonstrated
compliance with this section.
      (1)   The developer of all affected property shall be required to install
a stormwater management system designed to control the peak runoff from a ten-
year, 24-hour storm in accordance with the standards contained herein.
         (a)   The post-development rate of runoff shall not exceed the pre-
development rate of runoff.
         (b)   The system shall be designed to remove 85% of the Total
Suspended Solids (TSS) from the first inch of rainfall of any rain event.
         (c)   Stormwater measures shall have a drawdown of at least 48 hours,
but not more than 120 hours.
      (2)   Stormwater measures shall be designed by an appropriately qualified
engineer, landscape architect or other appropriately qualified professional,
and shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with commonly accepted
best practices. Innovative designs that utilize “low impact” and non-structural
control and treatment measures are encouraged.
      (3)   Stormwater measures may be located off-site provided such measures
are located within a parcel of land under the same ownership as the affected
property or within a common area under the management of a property owners’
association or similar entity. When stormwater measures are located off-site,
deeds of both the affected property and the property containing the stormwater
measure shall be provided and shall clearly reference an access easement and
the right and responsibility of the owner of the affected property to access
and maintain such measure.
      (4)   In all instances stormwater measures shall be designed to
compliment a development and surrounding community and to minimize any threat
to public health. If ponds or lakes are used, such areas shall be landscaped as
amenities or hidden from view. This provision applies regardless whether the
pond or lake typically contains water or may be dry for periods of time.
   (D)   Permit requirements. The Land Use Administrator shall review all
stormwater plans required by this chapter to ensure compliance therewith. In
making this determination, the Land Use Administrator shall use the Stormwater
Best Management Practices Design Manual published by the North Carolina
Department of Environment and Natural Resources or other commonly accepted
information and engineering data.
      (1)   Stormwater management system concept plan. When required as part of
any project, a written or graphic concept plan of the proposed post-development
storm water management system shall be submitted along with other application
materials and shall include the following: preliminary selection and location
of proposed structural stormwater controls; low impact design elements;
location of existing and proposed conveyance systems such as grass channels,
swales, and storm drains; flow paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits;
relationship of site to upstream and downstream properties and drainages; and
preliminary location of proposed stream channel modifications, such as bridge
or culvert crossings.
      (2)   As-built plans and final approval. Upon completion of a project,
and before final development approval or a certificate of occupancy may be
granted, the applicant shall certify that the completed project has been built
in accordance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs. The
applicant shall submit actual “as built” plans for all stormwater management
facilities or practices after final construction is completed.
         (a)   The plans shall show the final design specifications for all
stormwater management facilities and practices and the field location, size,
depth, and planted vegetation of all measures, controls, and devices, as
installed. The designer of the storm water management measures and plans shall
certify, under seal, that the as-built stormwater measures, controls, and
devices are in compliance with the approved stormwater management plans and
designs and with the requirements of this chapter.
         (b)   A final inspection and approval by the Land Use Administrator is
necessary prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy, release of
improvement guarantee, or other final approval.
   (E)   Inspections.  The Land Use Administrator may, from time to time,
inspect approved storm water measures for compliance with this section and
approved plans. Inspections may include, but are not limited to, reviewing
maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in storm water measures; and evaluating the
condition of storm water measures. No person shall obstruct, hamper, or
interfere with the Land Use Administrator while carrying out his or her
official duties. If the owner or occupant of any affected property refuses to
allow such inspection, the Land Use Administrator shall proceed to obtain an
administrative search warrant pursuant to G.S. § 15-27.2 or its successor.
   (F)   Maintenance of stormwater measures.  The owner of any stormwater
measure installed pursuant to this section shall maintain and operate such
measure to preserve and continue its function in controlling stormwater quality
and quantity at the degree or amount of function for which the storm water
measure was designed. Furthermore, stormwater measures installed prior to the
enactment of this chapter as a requirement of the issuance of any permit shall
be subject to the maintenance requirements contained herein. The owner of each
stormwater measure, whether structural or non-structural in design, shall
maintain it so as not to create or permit a nuisance condition.
   (G)   Illicit discharges.  Except as provided herein, no person shall cause
or allow the discharge, emission, disposal, pouring, or pumping, whether
directly or indirectly, of any liquid, solid, gas, or other substance, other
than stormwater, into any surface water, ground water, or stormwater
conveyance. This prohibition applies to any substance deposited upon the land
in manner and amount that the substance is likely to reach a stormwater
conveyance, surface or ground water.
      (1)   The following discharges shall not be deemed illicit and shall be
permitted under the terms stated:
         (a)   Water line flushing, except any anti-freezing agent;
         (b)   Landscape irrigation;
         (c)   Diverted stream flows;

   (H)   Illicit connections.  Other than those exceptions listed in division
(B), above, it shall be unlawful to cause or permit any connection to a surface
water or stormwater conveyance or stormwater conveyance system that allows the
discharge of anything other than stormwater.
      (1)   Prohibited connections include, but are not limited to the
following: floor drains, wastewater from washing machines or sanitary sewers,
wash water from commercial vehicle washing or steam cleaning, and wastewater
from septic systems.
      (2)   Where such connections exist in violation of this section and said
connections were made prior to the adoption of this provision or any other
ordinance prohibiting such connections, the property owner or the person using
said connection shall remove the connection within one year following the
effective date of this chapter. Provided, however, the one-year grace period
shall not apply to connections which may result in the discharge of hazardous
materials or other discharges which pose an immediate threat to health and
safety, or are likely to result in immediate injury and harm to real or
personal property, natural resources, wildlife, or habitat.
      (3)   Upon determining that an illicit connection may result in the
discharge of hazardous materials or may pose an immediate threat to health and
safety, or is likely to result in immediate injury and harm to real or personal
property, natural resources, wildlife, or habitat or that a connection was made
in violation of any applicable regulation or ordinance, other than this section
the Land Use Administrator shall designate the time limit within which the
connection shall be removed. In setting the time limit for compliance, the Land
Use Administrator shall take these matters into consideration:
         (a)   The quantity and complexity of the work;
         (b)   The consequences of delay;
         (c)   The potential harm to the environment, to the public health, and
to public and private property; and
         (d)   The cost of remedying the damage.
   (I)   Fee-in-lieu of stormwater compliance. On-site compliance with the
requirements of this section may be impractical or impossible in certain
watersheds of the town. The owner and/or developer of affected properties may,
pursuant to the provisions set forth herein, opt to pay a fee-in-lieu of
compliance with the stormwater management requirements of this section.
      (1)   Payment may be made in the form of contribution of funds,
contribution of land, contribution of engineered stormwater control
construction work, or a combination of these, the total value of which shall be
in accordance with the stormwater fee-in-lieu schedule which shall be
established by the Land Use Administrator and periodically revised to account
for changes in construction and maintenance costs.
      (2)   Fees shall be based upon actual cost of construction of a
structural storm water measure to control and treat storm water runoff from the
total impervious surface area of the affected property.
      (3)   The  Town Council  shall adopt a map of watersheds within which a
fee-in-lieu of stormwater compliance may be permitted.
      (4)   Fee-in-lieu contributions shall be set aside in a dedicated,
watershed-specific special fund, and applied to stormwater management and other
water quality improvement projects within the same watershed as the affected
property. Purposes eligible for fee-in-lieu contributions include the
following:
         (a)   The acquisition, design, or construction of storm water control
and treatment measures.
         (b)   Stream bank, wetland, or other surface water protection and
restoration projects that enhance stormwater management goals, reduce erosion,
and enhance water quality.
         (c)   The elimination of illicit or inappropriate connections to storm
water conveyances.
         (d)   Other activities identified by the Land Use Administrator,
provided that such activities are for the sole purpose of improving water

§ 152.196 SURFACE WATER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS.
   The purpose of this section is to provide a network of protected stream
corridors thereby helping to maintain water quality, provide wildlife habitats,
filter pollutants, store floodgates, and contribute to the “green
infrastructure” of the Town of Franklin and lands within its jurisdiction.
Stream systems are comprised of each stream and its respective drainage basin.
Streams have the primary natural functions of conveying storm, ground, and
surface waters, storing floodwaters, and supporting aquatic life. Vegetated
lands adjacent to the stream channel serve to protect the stream’s ability to
fulfill its natural functions. Surface water protection areas have the primary
natural functions of protecting water quality by (1) filtering sediments and
pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, trace metals, and hydrocarbons, (2)
providing intermittent storage for flood waters, (3) allowing channels to
meander naturally, and (4) providing suitable habitat for wildlife.
   (A)   Applicability. This section shall apply to all surface waters (as
defined by this chapter), and all nonencroachment areas and regulatory
floodways (as delineated upon the most recently published Flood Boundary and
Floodway Map (FBFM) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), within the planning
jurisdiction of the Town of Franklin.
   (B)   Relationship to previously approved development plans, structures, and
uses. Uses and structures approved and constructed in a protection area prior
to the enactment of this chapter may remain as nonconformities, subject to any
legal requirements attributed to that status. All development plans,
development projects, and uses permitted subsequent to the enactment of this
chapter, including expansions to previously approved and constructed uses and
structures, shall comply with the surface water protection requirements of this
chapter.
   (C)   Surface water protection area delineation. Surface water protection
area requirements apply to the regulatory floodway and non-encroachment areas,
as well as lands within 30 feet from the top of each bank of a stream or other
surface water body.
      (1)   For streams and other surface waters with defined channels,
protection area widths are measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the
surface water, landward from the top of the bank on each side of the channel.
      (2)   “Top of bank” shall be determined by the Land Use Administrator by
considering factors such as the break in slope for a watercourse and the
presence of streamside vegetation.
      (3)   For wetlands, as defined in this chapter, protection area widths
are measured horizontally, landward from the outermost point at which wetland
conditions can be identified.
      (4)   For ponds, lakes, and other impounded surface waters, protection
areas widths are measured horizontally, landward from the ordinary high water
line. Protection areas requirements do not apply to wet ponds used as
structural stormwater control and treatment measures for stormwater.
      (5)   For other surface waters, the protection area shall be determined
by the Land Use Administrator in consideration of the purposes of this section.
      (6)   When a combination of floodway/non-encroachment area and/or surface
water types exist, the most restrictive measurement of surface water protection
area shall apply.
   (D)   Surface water protection area requirements. The following requirements
shall apply to surface water protection areas as defined herein.
      (1)   Protection areas shall be left in a naturally vegetated state,
unless reforestation of disturbed protection areas is required as part of any
site plan approval. When reforestation of a disturbed protection area is
required, it shall be done in accordance with a planting plan approved by the
Land Use Administrator.
      (2)   Concentrated runoff from ditches or other manmade conveyances shall
be diverted to diffuse flow before the runoff enters the protection area.
      (3)   Periodic corrective action to restore diffuse flow shall be taken
by the property owner as necessary to avoid the formation of erosion gullies.
      (4)   Diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the protection area
by dispersing concentrated flow and reestablishing vegetation.
      (5)   Surface water protection areas shall be delineated upon any
development plan and shall be noted as protection areas within which no
disturbance or development shall be permitted.
      (6)   The following impacts are expressly forbidden in surface water
protection areas (including floodways, non-encroachment areas) and associated
water bodies:
         (a)   The placement of fill or the deposition of any natural or
manmade material or substance.
         (b)   New development, substantial improvements, new construction, new
impervious surfaces, the placement of structures or any other form of
development or encroachment, except those associated with public utilities.
         (c)   Grading, excavation, the removal of vegetation, or any
disturbance of any kind except excavation and fill required to plant any new
trees or vegetation.
         (d)   The ditching, dredging, channelization, straightening,
relocation, diking, levying, or any other alteration or modification of any
kind, to surface waters, except dredging necessary to maintain pre-existing,
human-made water impoundments such as ponds and lakes.
         (e)   The routing underground (by culvert or other means) of any
surface water, except to facilitate crossings by approved roads, streets,
driveways, greenways, sidewalks, and other transportation facilities.
         (f)   The impoundment of water bodies (this shall not prohibit the
maintenance of existing ponds, lakes, and other impoundments).
         (g)   Any other type of encroachment, disturbance, or modification to
floodways, nonencroachment areas, or other surface water protection areas or
associated surface waters.
      (7)   The following protection area impacts are permitted provided that
design and construction shall comply with applicable town standards for
stabilization of disturbed areas to minimize negative effects on the quality of
surface waters.
         (a)   Road crossings for connectivity or transportation links and
required utilities including public and private streets, driveways, and
bridges, where the town has granted site plan approval.
         (b)   Parallel water and sewer utility installation as approved by the
town.
         (c)   Approved public or common area open space, paths and trails.
Pathways should use existing and proposed utility alignments or previously
cleared areas and minimize tree cutting to the maximum extent practicable. To
the extent possible, pathways shall be “on-grade” and shall preserve existing
drainage patterns and avoid drainage structures that concentrate stormwater.
         (d)   Incidental drainage improvements/repairs for maintenance
provided that such maintenance does not result in channelization,
straightening, or modification of the natural course of a stream channel or the
deforestation of the regulatory floodway or protection areas.
         (e)   Mitigation approved by a local, state, or federal agency acting
pursuant to Sections 401 or 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
         (f)   Stream bank or stream channel restoration or soil stabilization
activities of the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service, Macon County
Soil and Water Conservation Service, USDA Natural Resources Conservation
Service, Macon County, the Town of Franklin, the North Carolina Forest Service,
or a cooperating organization or entity. This exception does not include the
straightening or channelization any watercourse.
         (g)   The removal of invasive exotic plant and tree species or trees
posing a hazard to life or property.
      (8)   Uses permitted in the protection area shall be coordinated to
ensure minimal disturbance of the protection area system. For example, if it is
necessary to install utilities within the protection area and if greenway
trails are then to be built, they should follow these cleared areas instead of
necessitating additional clearing.
      (9)   The approving authority may reduce the required setbacks by up to
20% of the required distance in order to facilitate compliance with this
section. Additional setback deviations shall be considered as variances by the
Board of Adjustment in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
chapter.

§ 152.198 VARYING REQUIREMENTS WHEN THERE IS AN INCREASE IN FUNCTIONALITY.
   Occasionally, development sites will contain steep slopes, surface water
areas, and/or flood plain, which, due to previous clearing or development,
diking, erosion, or other reasons, are of limited functionality. This chapter
seeks to encourage landowners and developers to find creative means to improve
these existing conditions. Accordingly, the entity with the authority to grant
development authorization pursuant to §§
152.050 -
152.062, above, may vary the requirements of this subchapter when the applicant
for development authorization demonstrates the proposed development, along with
any management practices, will result in an increase of functionality of any
regulated natural resources on the development site. Any mitigation proposed to
offset loss of a natural resource regulated herein must take place on the
development site itself or on neighboring properties pursuant to a recorded
easement authorizing such activities.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and cited as the Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities Siting Ordinance for the Town of Franklin.
(Ord. 2018-002, passed 4-2-18)
§ 154.02 PURPOSE.
    The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the town's authority concerning
the placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications
facilities. The town finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose
significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and
environment of the town and its inhabitants. The town also recognizes that
facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic
development asset to the town and of significant benefit to the town and its
residents. In order to ensure that the placement, construction or modification
of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with the town's land
use policies, the town is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless
telecommunications facilities application and permit process. The intent of
this chapter is to minimize the negative impact of wireless telecommunications
facilities, establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of

modification, and/or operation of the proposed facility under federal, state,
or local law, rules, or regulations, including but not limited to encroachment
agreements and FCC approvals. An approval issued under this subsection is not
in lieu of any other permit required under the UDO or Town Code of Ordinances,
nor is it a franchise, license, or other authorization to occupy the public
right-of-way, or a license, lease, or agreement authorizing occupancy of any
public or private property. It does not create a vested right in occupying any
particular location, and an applicant may be required to move and remove
facilities at its expense consistent with other provisions of applicable law.
An approval issued in error, based on incomplete or false information submitted
by an applicant or that conflicts with the provisions of the UDO, is not valid.
No person may maintain a small wireless facility in place unless required state
or federal authorization remain in force.

facility, and the associated utility pole, town utility pole, or wireless
support structure on which it is collocated, located in the public right-of-
way, as necessary for maintenance or reconfiguration of the right-of-way or for
other public projects, or take any other action or combination of actions
necessary to protect the health and welfare of the town.
      (7)   Collocation or modification of small wireless facilities on an
existing nonconforming wireless support structure or base station shall not be
construed as an expansion, enlargement, or increase in intensity of a non-
conforming structure and/or use, provided that the collocation or modification
constitute an eligible facilities request.

subject to separate fines pursuant to this subsection. The citation shall be
served upon the person(s) described in division (A) of this section by the
means set forth therein. In the event the offender does not pay the penalty
within ten days of service of the citation, the civil penalty shall be
collected by the town in a civil action in the nature of debt, which shall not

         (c)   In addition to or in lieu of the other remedies set forth in
this section, the Land Use Administrator may seek injunctive relief in the
appropriate court.
      (5)   Removal and recovery expense. If a sign owner or property owner
fails to comply with the requirements of a remove order, the Land Use
Administrator may cause such sign to be removed. The sign owner and property
owner shall be jointly and severally liable for the expense of removal. Notice

(D)(4)(a) by the means set forth therein. If the sum is not paid within 30 days
thereafter, the sum shall be collected by the town in a civil action in the

of G.S. § 14.4.
      (6)   Removal of dangerous signs. Pursuant to G.S. § 160A-193, the Land
Use Administrator shall have the authority to summarily remove, abate, or
remedy a sign, which is dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or
safety. The expense of the action shall be paid by the sign owner, or if the

§ 156.01 PURPOSE; EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The Board of Aldermen is committed to protecting the general welfare
of the town through the enforcement of laws prohibiting obscenity, indecency
and sexual offenses. It seeks to reduce and eliminate the deleterious effects
of sexually oriented businesses while preserving constitutionally protected
forms of expression.
   (B)   The Town Board finds that sexually oriented businesses in certain
locations contribute to neighborhood deterioration and blight through an
increase in crime and diminution of property values, among other adverse
consequences, and finds that such effects are contrary to the general welfare
of the town.
   (C)   The Town Board recognizes that important and substantial government
interests provide a constitutional basis for reasonable regulation of the time,
place and manner under which sexually oriented businesses operate; and that,
therefore, the town has determined that persons seeking to operate sexually
oriented businesses shall be required to observe specific locational
requirements before they commence business, as provided for in this chapter.
   (D)   The Town Board finds that the licensing of sexually oriented
businesses is necessary to ensure compliance with the locational and zoning
requirements of such businesses.
   (E)   The Town Board finds that sexually oriented businesses in other
communities have been used for unlawful sexual activities, including
prostitution, and sexual encounters of a casual nature. The concern over
sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the town.
   (F)   The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as permitting
any use, activity or structure that is otherwise prohibited, illegal or made
punishable by law, nor shall it be construed so as to prohibit conduct or
expression that is subject to constitutional protection.

§ 156.08 LOCATION.
   (A)   Overconcentration. No more than one sexually oriented business shall
be located within any 1,000 foot radius, as determined by a straight line and
not street distance. Sexually oriented businesses, because of their very
nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics upon adjacent neighborhoods, particularly when they are
concentrated. Special regulation of these establishments is necessary to insure
that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading
of the surrounding neighborhood. To prevent an overconcentration of sexually
oriented businesses and the creation of a de facto downgrading or blighting of
surrounding neighborhoods, this radius requirement is necessary.
   (B)   Prohibited. No sexually oriented business shall be located in a
residential district nor a neighborhood mixed used district as defined by the
town’s zoning ordinance and zoning map.
   (C)   Residential proximity. No sexually oriented business shall be located
within a 250-foot radius (determined by a straight line and not street
distance) of any place of worship, school (public or private), specialty
school, day-care facility or any residential zoning districts or residential
properties. Sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, are
recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics,
primarily when they are located near a residential zoning district or certain
other districts which permit residential uses. Special regulation of these
establishments is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not
contribute to a downgrading or blighting of surrounding residential districts
or certain other districts which permit residential uses.
(Ord. passed 4-4-05; Am. Ord. 2017-011, passed 7-3-17) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.09 HOURS OF OPERATION.
   No sexually oriented business, except for an adult motel, may remain open at
any time between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on weekdays and
Saturdays, and 1:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on Sundays, except to the extent
allowed by state law and regulations pertaining to the sale of alcoholic
beverages by the business if the sexually oriented business has a state ABC
permit.
(Ord. passed 4-4-05) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.10 INSPECTION.
   (A)   A business license applicant or licensee shall permit representatives
of the police department or any other town, city, county, state or federal
department, division or agency that enforces codes, regulations of statutes
relating to human health, safety or welfare or structural safety to inspect the
premises of a sexually oriented business for the purpose of ensuring compliance
with the law at any time it is occupied or open for business.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter do not apply to areas of an adult motel
which are currently being rented by the customer for use as a permanent or
temporary habitation.
(Ord. passed 4-4-05) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.11 EXPIRATION OF LICENSE.

renewed only by making application as provided in this chapter. Application for
renewal should be made at least 30 days before the expiration date, and when
made less than 30 days before the expiration date, the expiration of the
license will not be affected.

156.99
§ 156.12 SUSPENSION.
   The Town Planner is authorized to, and will, suspend a sexually oriented
business license for a period not to exceed 30 days if the police department
and/or inspections department determines that a business licensee has:
   (A)   Violated or is not in compliance with this chapter or with any other
requirements of this code, including those relating to buildings, electricity,
plumbing, fire safety and mechanical equipment;
   (B)   Refused to allow an inspection of the sexually oriented business
premises as authorized by this chapter;
   (C)   Permitted illegal gambling by any person on the sexually oriented
business premises; or
   (D)   Demonstrated an inability to operate or manage a sexually oriented
business in a peaceful and law-abiding manner thus necessitating action by law
enforcement officers.
(Ord. passed 4-4-05) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.13 REVOCATION.
   (A)   The Town Planner is authorized to, and will, revoke a license if a
cause for suspension in §
156.12 occurs and the license has been suspended within the preceding 12
months.
   (B)   The Town Planner is authorized to, and will, revoke a sexually
oriented business license if the police department determines that a business
licensee;
      (1)   Gave false or misleading information in the material submitted to
the town during the application process, including, but not limited to, the use
of a name other than a legal name to procure a license;
      (2)   Has allowed the possession, use or sale of controlled substances on
the premises; or
      (3)   Has allowed prostitution on the premises;
      (4)   Has operated or worked in the sexually oriented business during a
period of time when the licensee’s license was suspended;
      (5)   Has been convicted of an offense named in §
156.04 for which the time period required has not lapsed;
      (6)   On two or more occasions within a 12-month period, a person or
persons committed an offense occurring in or on the licensed premises of a
crime named in §
156.99 for which a conviction has been obtained, and the person or persons were
employees of the sexually oriented business at the time the offenses were
committed;
      (7)   Has allowed any act of sexual intercourse, masturbation, oral
copulation or sodomy to occur in or on the licensed premises;
      (8)   Is delinquent in payment to the town of ad valorem taxes, sales
taxes, or the annual business license fee, or any other fee or tax related to
the sexually oriented business or other business of the licensee.
      (9)   The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect
on the revocation of the license.
   (C)   When the Town Planner revokes a license, the revocation shall continue
for one year and the licensee shall not be issued a sexually oriented business
license for one year from the date revocation became effective. If, subsequent
to revocation, the Town Planner finds that the basis for the revocation has
been corrected or abated, the licensee may be granted a license if at least 90
days have elapsed since the date the revocation became effective. If the
license was revoked, an applicant may not be granted another license until the
appropriate number of years required under this chapter have elapsed.
(Ord. passed 4-4-05) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.14 DENIAL.
   If the Town Planner denies the issuance of a license, or suspends or revokes

   (A)    Pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1201, it is found and declared that there
exist in the town dwellings which are unfit for human habitation due to
dilapidation; defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents and other
calamities; lack of ventilation, light and sanitary facilities; and other
conditions rendering dwellings unsafe or unsanitary, dangerous and detrimental
to the health, safety and morals, and otherwise inimical to the welfare of the
residents of the town.

the town as authorized by G.S. Ch. 160D, Art. 12, it is the purpose of this

(Ord. passed 6-6-11; Am. Ord. passed 3-15-21)
§ 157.038 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing.  Whenever a petition is
filed with the Town Planner by a public authority or by at least five residents
of the town, charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human
habitation, or whenever it appears to the Town Planner, upon inspection, that
any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, he shall, if his
preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause
to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or
dwelling unit a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a
hearing will be held before the Town Planner at a place fixed in the notice,
not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint. The
owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the
complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the
place and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of the hearing shall also be
given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating to the
dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend the hearing and give
evidence. Evidence relevant in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling
in hearings before the Town Planner, and the normal rules of evidence will not
apply to such hearings.
   (B)   Procedure after hearing. After the notice and hearing prescribed in
division (A) of this section, the Town Planner shall state in writing his
determination whether the dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human
habitation, and if so, whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated.
      (1)   Deteriorated dwelling, dwelling unit. If the Town Planner
determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he or she shall
state in writing his or her findings of fact in support of that determination,
and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner an order directing and
requiring the owner to repair, alter or improve the dwelling or dwelling unit
to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this chapter
within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days. The order may also
direct and require the owner to vacate and close the dwelling or dwelling unit
until the repairs, alterations and improvements have been made.
      (2)   Dilapidated dwelling. If the Town Planner determines that the
dwelling is dilapidated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings
of fact to support that determination, and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner an order directing and requiring the owner either to repair,
alter or improve the dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum
standards of fitness established by this chapter, or else to vacate and remove
or demolish them within a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days.
      (3)   Vacated and closed dwellings.    
         (a)    If the Town Council shall have adopted an ordinance as
described in division (C) below, ordering a dwelling to be repaired, altered or
improved pursuant to the findings of the Town Planner pursuant to (B)(1) or (2)
or division (C), and if the owner has vacated and closed such dwelling and kept
such dwelling vacated and closed for a period of one year pursuant to the
ordinance or order, if the Town Council shall then find that the owner has
abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in
order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the
dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health,
safety, morals and welfare of the city in that the dwelling would continue to
deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to
children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities,
would cause and contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values
in the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might
otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent
and affordable housing in this state, in such circumstances, the Town Council,
may, after the expiration of such one-year period, enact an ordinance and serve
such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
            1.   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render
it fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish the dwelling within 90 days; or
            2.   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render
it fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the
then current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
         (b)   An ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall be recorded
in the office of the County Register of Deeds and shall be indexed in the name
of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with
this section, the Town Planner shall effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.
The cost to repair or demolish and remove the dwelling shall be a lien against
the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall be filed,
have priority and be collected in the same manner as the lien for special
assessments established by G.S. § 160A-216 et seq.
         (c)   For the purpose of this section, the "current value" of a
dwelling or structure shall be defined as the fair market value as determined
by a certified appraiser or the current tax value on record with the county tax
office, whichever is less.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or
dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the Town Planner to repair,
alter or improve, or to vacate and close the dwelling or dwelling unit within
the time specified, or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit
shall fail to comply with an order of the Town Planner to repair, alter or
improve, or to vacate and close and remove or demolish the dwelling or dwelling
unit within the time specified, the Town Planner shall submit to the Town
Council at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney to
petition the Superior Court for an order directing that owner comply with the
order of the Town Planner, as authorized by G.S. § 160D-1208(e).
      (2)   In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated or
dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with an order of the Town
Planner within the time specified, if injunctive relief has not been sought or
has not been granted as provided in division (C)(1), the Town Planner shall
submit to the Town Council an ordinance ordering the Town Planner to cause that
dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, closed,
removed or demolished, as provided in the original order of the Town Planner,
and pending removal or demolition, to place a placard on that dwelling as
provided by G.S. § 160D-1203(4) and §
157.040 of this code.

taken by any aggrieved person. Any appeal from the Town Planner shall be taken
within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order and
shall be taken by filing with the Town Planner and with the Board of Adjustment
a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is
based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the Town Planner shall
forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the
record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a
decision of the Town Planner refusing to allow the aggrieved person to do any
act, his or her decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When
an appeal is from a decision of the Town Planner requiring the aggrieved person
to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement
until the hearing by the Board of Adjustment unless the Town Planner certifies
to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal is filed with him or
her, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a copy of which
shall be furnished the appellant, a suspension of this requirement would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be
suspended except for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written
notice to the Town Planner, by the Board of Adjustment,  or by a court of
record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. § 160D- 1208(e) and division (E) of
this section.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its
decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent
or attorney. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision
and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end
shall have all the powers of the Town Planner; but the concurring vote of four
members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to reverse or modify any
decision or order of the Town Planner. The Board of Adjustment shall have power
also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict
letter of this chapter, to adapt the application of this chapter to the
necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
      (3)    Every decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be subject to
review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of
the decision of the Board as provided by G.S. § 160D-1208(c).
   (E)   Petition to superior court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the Town Planner or a decision rendered by the Board shall have the
right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision,
to petition the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the Town

1208(d).
