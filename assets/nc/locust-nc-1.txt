shall be conditioned on the defendant’s full compliance with the terms of the
order of abatement within a time fixed by the judicial order.

Administrator, or designee, within 15 days of the date of the citation, or
alternatively to pay the citation by mail.
      (3)   The violation for which the citation is issued must have been
corrected by the time the citation is paid, otherwise further citations shall
be issued.
      (4)   Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until

   (M)   If the violator fails to respond to a citation within 15 days of its

civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of the state
General Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty, costs, attorney
fees, and such other relief as permitted by law.

30.046 is a misdemeanor, punishable as provided in G.S. § 105-109. Each day
that a person conducts business in violation of this subchapter is a separate
offense. Payment of a fine imposed in criminal proceedings in accordance with
this section does not relieve a person of the liability for taxes imposed under
§§
30.020 through

      (2)   Equitable remedies. In addition to the criminal remedies set forth
in division (C)(1) of this section, and in compliance with G.S. § 160A-75(d),

required by city laws, ordinances, and resolutions.
   (B)   City residents and users of the city sewer system are required to pay
for their sewer service by a date specified on their utility system bill.
Failure to pay a bill by its due date will result in the addition of a
delinquency fee added to the amount past due on the sewer bill. The delinquency
fee and the past due sewer bill amount must be paid in full to the city, in
order for the customer's sewer account to be considered current. Failure of the
customer to pay the full amount of the delinquency fee will be treated in the
same manner as the sewer bill being past due for the customer's next sewer bill
and grounds for sewer service interruption by the city, if not paid in full in
the subsequent sewer bill.
   (C)   Delinquent sewer accounts are subject to disconnection of sewer
service at the customer's expense at any time, in the discretion of the
Director of Public Works.

or other applicable law.
      (4)   The demand for a hearing filed with the clerk shall be accompanied
by a filing fee as established by the Committee. Failure to timely file the
demand and fee shall constitute a waiver of any rights to appeal under this
chapter, and the Committee shall have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
      (5)   Within five days of receiving the petitioner’s demand for a
hearing, the clerk shall notify the chairman of the Committee (“chairman”) of

present evidence through witnesses and competent testimony relevant to the
issue(s) before the Committee.
      (2)   Rules of evidence shall not apply to a hearing conducted pursuant
to this chapter, and the Committee may give probative effect to competent,
substantial and material evidence.
      (3)   At least seven days before the hearing, the parties shall exchange
a list of witnesses intended to be present at the hearing, and a copy of any
documentary evidence intended to be presented. The parties shall submit a copy
of this information to the clerk. Additional witnesses or documentary evidence
may not be presented, except upon consent of both parties or upon a majority
vote of the Committee.
      (4)   Witnesses shall testify under oath or affirmation to be
administered by the court reporter or another duly authorized official.

decision on the evidence submitted at the hearing and not otherwise.

Committee concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that the grounds for the
City of Locust’s actions (including the amount assessed as a civil penalty),
with regard to either issuing a notice of violation, assessing a civil penalty,
issuing a cease and desist order, or issuing a compliance order, are true and
substantiated, the Committee shall uphold the action on the part of the City of
Locust.

or modify any order, requirement, decision or determination of the City of
Locust. The Committee will determine the number of concurring votes needed to
reverse or modify any order, requirement, decision or determination of the City
of Locust. If the Committee finds that the violation has occurred, but that, in
setting the amount of a penalty or setting order directives, the City of Locust
has not considered or given appropriate weight to either mitigating or
aggravating factors, the Committee shall either decrease or increase the civil
penalty per day within the range allowed by this chapter, or modify order
directives, as appropriate to the case. Any decision of the Committee that
modifies the amount of the civil penalty or an order directive shall include,
as part of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, findings as to which
mitigating or aggravating factors exist, and the appropriate weight that should
have been given to such factors by the City of Locust in setting the amount of
the civil penalty or in issuing orders.
      (7)   The Committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the
vote of each member upon each question and the absence or failure of any member
to vote. The decision of the Committee shall be based on findings of fact and
conclusions of law to support its decision.
      (8)   The Committee shall send a copy of its findings and decision to the
applicant/petitioner and City of Locust Stormwater. If either party
contemplates an appeal to a court of law, the party may request and obtain, at
that party’s own cost, a transcript of the proceedings.
      (9)   The decision of the Committee shall constitute a final decision.

vehicles, and junked vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if the
registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the vehicle
but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is abandoned, a
nuisance vehicle, or in the case of a junked motor vehicle that the aesthetic
benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, the appeal shall be made

special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health,
safety, and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation, these
circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to
businesses and residences, vehicles parked in such location or manner as to
pose a traffic hazard, and vehicles causing damage to public or private
property.

§ 93.12 POWERS AND DUTIES OF HOUSING INSPECTOR.
   (A)   The Housing Inspector is hereby designated as the officer to enforce
the provisions of this chapter and to exercise the duties and powers herein
prescribed. The Housing Inspector is authorized to exercise such powers as may
be necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purpose and
provisions of this chapter. The Housing Inspector will be selected by the City
Council.
   (B)   The Housing Inspector shall have the following powers and duties:
      (1)   To investigate the dwelling conditions and to inspect dwellings and
dwelling units located in the city in order to determine which dwellings and
dwelling units are unfit for human habitation, and for the purpose of carrying
out the objectives of this chapter with respect to the repair, closing, or
demolition of the dwellings and dwelling units;
      (2)   To take such action together with other appropriate departments and
agencies, public and private, as may be necessary to effect rehabilitation of
housing which is deteriorated;
      (3)   To keep a record of the results of inspections made under this
chapter and an inventory of those dwellings that do not meet the minimum
standards of fitness herein prescribed;
      (4)   To administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and
receive evidence;
      (5)   To enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations and
inspections; provided, the entries shall be made in accordance with §
93.13 and state law, and shall be made in such a manner as to cause the least
possible inconvenience to the persons in possession;
      (6)   To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents, and
employees as he or she deems necessary to assist in carrying out the purpose of
this chapter, and to delegate any of his or her functions and powers to the

      (7)   To perform such other duties as may be prescribed herein or by the
City Council.
(Ord. 98-5, passed 5-6-1999)
§ 93.13 INSPECTIONS; DUTY OF OWNER AND OCCUPANTS.
   (A)   For the purpose of making inspections, the Inspector is hereby
authorized to enter, examine, and survey at all reasonable times all dwellings,
dwelling units, rooming houses, rooming units, and the premises associated
therewith. The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming
house, or rooming unit, or the person in charge thereof, shall give the
Inspector free access to the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, or rooming
unit and its premises at all reasonable times for the purposes of the
inspection, examination, and survey.
   (B)   Every occupant of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, or rooming

the Housing Inspector must obtain a warrant to inspect. G.S. § 15-27.2 provides
for the issuance of warrants for the conduct of inspections authorized by law.
The state Court of Appeals, In Re Dwelling, 24 N.C.
      (2)   App. 17 (1974) has held that the consent of the tenant-occupant who
was in actual possession and control of the premises was sufficient to
authorize an inspection without a warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the
owner had objected to the warrantless search. When faced with a situation where
permission to inspect is denied, building inspectors are advised to seek the
advice of an attorney.

allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his or her decision shall
remain in force until modified or reversed.
         (b)   When an appeal is from a decision of the Inspector requiring the
person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending
the requirement until the hearing by the Board of Adjustments, unless the
Inspector certifies to the Board of Adjustments, after the notice of appeal is
filed with him or her, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a
copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his or her
requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the
requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order. The
restraining order may be granted for due cause shown upon not less that one
days’ written notice to the Inspector, by the Board of Adjustments, or by a
court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. § 160A-446(f) and division

FALSE ALARMS
§ 94.01 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that excessive false alarms unduly burden the Police
Department and waste limited police resources. The purpose of this chapter is
to establish reasonable expectations of alarm users and to ensure that alarm
users are held responsible for their use of alarm systems. It is not the intent
of the City Council in adopting this subchapter to create new or expand
existing legal obligations of the city or the Police Department or to establish
a special duty or special relationship between the city or the Police
Department and alarm users or persons who own real or personal property or are
physically present at or in the vicinity of property monitored by an alarm
system.
(Ord. 85, passed 10-12-2006)
§ 94.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALARM SIGNAL. A detectable signal, either audible or visual, generated by an
alarm system, to which the police are expected to respond.
   ALARM SYSTEM. Any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal
the occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other activity requiring
immediate attention and to which the Police Department is expected to respond,
but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles, fire alarms, domestic
violence alarms, or alarms designed to elicit a medical response.
   ALARM USER. Any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship,
governmental or educational entity, or any other entity owning or leasing an
alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the
protection of the premises.
   AUTOMATIC DIAL PROTECTION DEVICE. An automatic dialing device or an
automatic telephone dialing alarm system, and shall include any system which,
upon being activated, automatically initiates to the Police Department a
recorded message or code signal indicating a need for police response.
   CITY. The City of Locust or its agent.
   FALSE ALARM. The activation of an alarm system through mechanical or
electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of
the alarm user, his or her employees or agents, and signals activated to summon
police personnel unless law enforcement response was cancelled by the alarm
user or his or her agent before police personnel arrive at the alarm location.
An alarm is false within the meaning of this chapter when, upon inspection by
the Police Department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery,
or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which
would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a FALSE ALARM shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be
determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of
nature, nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably
subject to control by the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an
alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the
alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the user’s alarm
company, or designee, to test the system.
   RUNAWAY ALARM. An alarm system that produces repeated alarm signals that do
not appear to be caused by separate human action.
(Ord. 85, passed 10-12-2006)
§ 94.03 PROHIBITED ACTS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to activate an alarm system for the purpose of
summoning police when no burglary, robbery, or other crime dangerous to life or
property is being committed or attempted on the premises, or otherwise to cause
a false alarm.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful to install, maintain, or use an audible alarm
system which can sound continually for more than 15 minutes.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful to install, maintain, or use an automatic dial
protection device that reports, or causes to be reported, any recorded message
to the Police Department.
(Ord. 85, passed 10-12-2006) Penalty, see §
94.99
§ 94.04 ENFORCEMENT OF PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Payment of civil penalties. Civil penalties shall be paid within 30
days from the date of the invoice.
   (B)   Discontinuance of police response. The failure of an alarm user to
make payment of any civil penalty assessed under §
94.99 within 30 days from the date of the invoice shall result in
discontinuance of police response to alarm signals that may occur at the
premises until payment is received. The Police Department may in its discretion
discontinue police responses to alarm signals from what appears to be a runaway
alarm.
   (C)   Equitable remedy. The city may enforce the provisions of this
subchapter by applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction,
abatement order, or any other appropriate equitable remedy.
   (D)   Noncriminal violation. A violation of any of the provisions of this
subchapter shall not constitute a misdemeanor or infraction punishable pursuant
to G.S. § 14-4.
(Ord. 85, passed 10-12-2006)
§ 94.05 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeals process. Assessments of civil penalties and other enforcement
decisions made under this subchapter may be appealed by filing a written notice
of appeal with the city within 30 days after the date of notification of the
assessment of civil penalties or other enforcement decision. The failure to
give notice of appeal within this time period shall constitute a waiver of the
right to contest the assessment of penalties or other enforcement decision.
Appeals shall be heard through an administrative process established by the
Police Department. The hearing officer’s decision is subject to review in the
Superior Court of the county by proceedings in the nature of certiorari.
   (B)   Appeal standard. The hearing officer shall review an appeal from the
assessment of civil penalties or other enforcement decisions using a
preponderance of the evidence standard. Notwithstanding a determination that
the preponderance of the evidence supports the assessment of civil penalties or
other enforcement decision, the hearing officer shall have the discretion to
dismiss or reduce civil penalties or reverse any other enforcement decision
where warranted.
(Ord. 85, passed 10-12-2006)
§ 94.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Generally. Any person violating any provision of §§
94.01 through
94.05 for which no specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99.
   (B)   Excessive false alarms. It is hereby found and determined that three
or more false alarms within a physical year is excessive, constitutes a public
nuisance, and shall be unlawful. Civil penalties for false alarms within a
calendar year may be assessed against an alarm user as follows:
 
Third through fifth false alarm $50
Sixth false alarm               $100

   (B)   If the petition from the property owners is found to be sufficient,

project as it deems best.
   (D)   When a street improvement project is approved, the property owners
abutting the improvement shall be notified of the total estimated cost per foot

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   City streets are to be inviting public space and integral components
of community design. A transportation system should have a rich variety of
types, including bicycle and pedestrian. All streets should connect to help
create a comprehensive network of public areas to allow free movement of
automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians. In order for this street network to be
safe for motorists and pedestrians, all design elements must consistently be
applied to calm automobile traffic.
   (B)   In summary, streets shall:
      (1)   Interconnect within a development and with adjoining development.
Cul-de-sacs shall be allowed only where topographical and/or lot line
configurations offer no practical alternatives for connections. Street stubs
shall be provided within development adjacent to open land to provide for
future connections. The Land Development Map should be reviewed to locate
potential connections in new neighborhoods.
      (2)   Be designed as the most prevalent public space of the town and,
thus, scaled to the pedestrian.
      (3)   Be bordered by sidewalks on both sides, with the exception of rural
roads, lanes, alleys and the undeveloped edge of neighborhood parkways.
      (4)   Be lined with street trees on both sides, with the exception of
rural roads, lanes, alleys and the undeveloped edge of neighborhood parkways.
Private drives are permitted only as described in the Open Space District.
      (5)   Be public. Private streets are not permitted within any new
development. Alleys may be either public or private, depending upon function.
      (6)   Be the focus of buildings. Generally, all buildings will front on a
public street.
(Ord. passed 8-8-2019)
§ 153.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose for the street design standards is to provide flexible
design guidelines that establish a framework by which individual modes of
transportation function as an integrated system, thus providing functional
connections within the transportation system and choices for citizens to move
about the city.
   (B)   The transportation system is one of the most visible components of the
city’s infrastructure system. The city has the responsibility to ensure that
the transportation system is designed in a manner that is safe and efficient
and fits the context of the community, within reasonable and prudent
expectations. These street design standards have been developed in a manner
that balances the rights and interests of property owners and the needs of the
traveling public for safe and efficient streets. The policy and standards
included herein meet the following objectives:
      (1)   To provide street designs that enhance the safety of vehicles and
pedestrians;
      (2)   To provide street designs that are consistent with the context of
the surrounding environment;
      (3)   To provide street design and construction criteria that accommodate
pedestrian and bicycle activities;
      (4)   To provide access management to and from streets in a manner
consistent with their classification.

system. The primary goal is to integrate motor vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle
facilities in a well-balanced network that provides connections and choices for
citizens to move about the city. To accomplish this goal, street design
standards have been developed to provide the minimum specifications and
standards for the design and construction of roadway improvements for all
classifications of the street system. Additional requirements may be deemed
necessary by the Public Works Director, City Engineer, or their designee,
depending on the proposed improvement. The additional requirements may be
utilized in conjunction with or in lieu of current ordinances or specifications
utilized for development within the city limits or the jurisdictional
boundaries of the city.
      (2)   There are several methods by which streets are designed and
constructed within the city. These methods include:
         (a)   Private developers building public streets;
         (b)   The city designing and constructing new streets or improving
existing streets;
         (c)   The North Carolina Department of Transportation designing and
building new streets or improving existing streets.
      (3)   The design standards set forth in this chapter are intended to be
used by any entity, public or private, and shall be designed and constructed in
conformance with the standards set forth in this chapter.
      (4)   Streets constructed or improved within the city and its
jurisdictional boundaries on public rights-of-way shall be designed and
constructed in conformance with the standards set forth in this chapter, the
North Carolina Department of Transportation’s Standard Specifications for Roads
and Structures, and other engineering publications, as required, supporting the
design of the proposed improvement. In the event of conflicts between
specifications, the more restrictive specification shall be enforced.
      (5)   It shall be unlawful for any person to construct or improve a
public street or construct a new private street except as authorized by
provisions of this chapter.
      (6)   All streets to be constructed or improved on city rights-of-way
shall be reviewed and approved by the Director of Public Works, or a designated
representative, and the City Engineer, or a designated representative, prior to
the issuance of a permit to undertake such construction or improvement.
      (7)   Any street constructed, improved or connecting to a state-
maintained roadway shall conform to the specifications of the North Carolina
Department of Transportation (NCDOT), and obtain approval from NCDOT prior to
beginning construction.
   (B)   Permits and fees.
      (1)    No person, firm, or corporation shall remove, alter or construct
any street or perform any other improvement on any public street or dedicated
street right-of-way without permits authorizing such improvements.
      (2)   Driveways connecting to city streets or public right-of-way shall
require a permit prior to installation and inspection by the city during
construction of the driveway.
   (C)   Submittal requirements. Construction plans shall be submitted to the
city as outlined in this Code of Ordinances. Construction plans shall adhere to
the specifications set forth by the city.
   (D)   Protecting the public from injury. Whenever any person shall do or
undertake to do any of the activities set forth in this chapter, it shall be
the responsibility of such person to protect from harm and damage all persons
who may be using any street or sidewalk or other public place where such
activity is in progress. To that end, such person shall erect and maintain
suitable signs, lights, barricades and other traffic control devices at the
proper location where such work is in progress. These safeguards shall be
applied in accordance with the current (NCDOT) Work Zone Traffic Control,
Section 1101-1180.
   (E)   Traffic impact analysis (TIA).
      (1)   A TIA shall be prepared by professional engineer registered in the
State of North Carolina.
      (2)   The city and the developer will discuss possible firms to prepare
the TIA. The city shall make the final decision of the firm preparing the TIA.
      (3)   A TIA may be required to support the proposed improvements
associated with a new development.
      (4)   Once staff has determined a TIA is required, a scoping meeting
shall be required to outline specific data to be included in the TIA. City
staff, the NCDOT and the developer are required at the scoping meeting. The
developer should invite the needed support staff of their design team.
      (5)    During the scoping meeting, a memorandum of understanding shall be
prepared by the city to specify the scope of work to be performed in the TIA.
      (6)   All costs associated with the preparation of a TIA shall be
encumbered by the developer.

agreement of mitigation form, outlining the prescribed measures of improvement,
shall be executed by all entities listed above and/or responsible parties with
the proposed development.
      (9)   All improvements agreed to be performed for the development shall
be completed prior to acceptance of the final plat and/or certificate of
occupancy, unless otherwise noted in the executed agreement.
      (10)   All costs of the improvements shall be the responsibility of the
developer unless otherwise noted.
      (11)   Any TIA prepared for developments within the jurisdictional limits
of the city shall follow the criteria and methodology of the ITE Trip
Generation Manual.

7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 .p.m.
      (13)    Expansions, upfits and/or change of use applications will require
the staff to determine the appropriate TIA trip-generation threshold for each
use.
         (a)   Trip generations for the proposed site shall be compared to the
trip generations of the current site within the past six-month period.
         (b)   Development approvals within the most recent five-year period
will be included in the trip generation, unless a separate TIA has been
performed for the previously approved development.
         (c)   Notwithstanding the above values, a TIA shall be required for a
site-specific development plan if city staff determines one of the following
conditions exist:
            (1)   Traffic generated from a nonresidential development will
significantly impact adjacent residential neighborhoods.
            (2)   Traffic-operation problems for current and/or future years on
nearby streets are expected to be substantially aggravated by traffic generated
by the proposed new development.
            (3)   Traffic-safety issues exist at intersections or streets that
would serve the new development.
            (4)   The proposed land use differs significantly from that
contemplated in the adopted City Land Use Plan
            (5)   The internal street or access system is not anticipated to
accommodate the expected traffic generation.

from an earlier approved study or more than 24 months have passed since
completion of the previous transportation study.
      (14)   The capacity analysis included in the TIA shall utilize the
Highway Capacity Manual, and signalized intersections shall incorporate
information from the city and/or NCDOT.
      (15)   For developments with multiple phases, the TIA shall account for
traffic counts of each phase as they are completed, as well as the cumulative
traffic counts at the completion of the development.
      (16)   Crash data within the scope of the project limits shall be
included for a three-year period for the following criteria:
         (a)   Type;
         (b)   Number;
         (c)   Severity.
      (17)   Level of service (LOS) shall show no signs of degradation or
further delays on intersections with a current LOS of E or F.
      (18)   The NCDOT Municipal School Transportation Assistance (MSTA)
calculator should be used to calculate the projected trip generation for school
sites. School sites may need to be sent to NCDOT MSTA in Raleigh, North
Carolina, for review as part of the review process.
   (F)   Administrative controls.
      (1)   The city recognizes that not all streets will be able to conform to
every standard set in this chapter.
      (2)   Any street needing special attention due to exceptional conditions
will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
      (3)   The city reserves the right to override the standards set forth in
this chapter should the street necessitate such action.
      (4)   If, based on sound engineering judgment, there is a question as to
whether or not a site will qualify for a variance in any standard documented in
this chapter, City Public Works should be contacted to discuss that potential
variance.
