§ 32.06 RELATIONSHIP OF FIRE DEPARTMENT AND VOLUNTEER MEMBERS.
   (A)   The Board of Aldermen recognizes that historically the volunteer
members of the Fire Department have organized into a group for the purpose of
enhancing their capability as fire fighters and improving fire suppression
services provided to the town. The Board of Aldermen recognizes the right of
the volunteer members to organize into such a volunteer group known as the
"Wrightsville Beach Volunteer Firefighters Association," (herein "WBVFA")
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to
authorize any activities which are in violation of the restrictions of G.S. Ch.
95, Art. 12.
   (B)   (1)   The responsibility for: (a) establishing recruitment policies
for volunteer members; (b) selecting volunteer members consistent with existing
town policies; (c) establishing and maintaining training and performance
standards for volunteer members; (d) terminating participation by volunteer
members in the Fire Department; and (e) managing and supervising the activities
of volunteer members while participating as members of the Fire Department is
given to the Town Manager acting through the Fire Chief.
      (2)   Prior to implementing changes to (a) recruitment and selection
policies of volunteer members or (b) training and performance standards for
volunteer members, the town will use its best efforts to consult with officers
of the WBVFA regarding such matters; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall obligate the town to consult with WBVFA, and the town shall be and
remain responsible for all such actions as they relate to volunteer members of
the Fire Department. In the event WBVFA is dissatisfied with such changes in
recruitment and selection policies of volunteer members or training and
performance standards for volunteer members, it may request a meeting regarding
such changes with the Fire Chief. If after meeting with the Fire Chief, WBVFA
continues to be dissatisfied with such changes, it may request a meeting
regarding those matters with the Town Manager. Any such request shall be in
writing, shall specifically state the concerns of WBVFA and shall be signed by
the President of WBVFA. The request shall be presented to the Fire Chief. Upon
receipt of a request in proper form, the Fire Chief will forward such request
to the Town Manager who will set a date and a time for a meeting to consider
the concerns of WBVFA. Such meeting will be attended by town personnel as
deemed appropriate by the Town Manager. Officers of WBVFA may attend but the
meeting will not be open to the general membership of WBVFA. The Town Manager
shall give a written response to the concerns of WBVFA following such meeting
and the Manager's decision in such matter shall be final.
   (C)   WBVFA may use the fire station as a meeting place subject to rules and
regulations and scheduling as approved by the Fire Chief.
   (D)   Because of the relationship between the Fire Department and WBVFA,
there is the possibility that the general public may confuse the two
organizations. The volunteer members of the Fire Department have historically
solicited funds from members of the community. The town does not intend to
restrict the ability of WBVFA to solicit funds on its own, but all such
solicitations must clearly state that they are being made on behalf of WBVFA
and no town funds may be used in conjunction with such solicitation efforts.
   (E)   (1)   All equipment used by volunteer and paid members of the Fire
Department shall be owned by the town. The town acknowledges that it has been
the policy of the volunteer members of the Fire Department to purchase
equipment for use by members of the Fire Department. The town acknowledges the
debt that it owes to the volunteer Fire Department members for their efforts in
obtaining equipment for the Fire Department. However, in order to eliminate any
question regarding ownership of property used by members of the Fire
Department, it is hereby declared that all such property is property of the
town.
      (2)   All equipment purchased by WBVFA for use by the Fire Department
shall be formally offered to the town and accepted by the Board of Aldermen.
The Town Manager is hereby authorized to act as agent for the Board of Aldermen
and to accept equipment purchased by WBVFA for use by the Fire Department and
having a value of $500 or less.
   (F)   In the event WBVFA chooses to use some of its funds raised through
solicitation or otherwise for the purpose of providing training for members of
the Fire Department, both paid and volunteer, such funds shall only be utilized
in a manner as approved by the Fire Chief. In no event shall there be a co-
mingling of town funds with funds of WBVFA.
   (G)   The Town Manager is ultimately responsible for the operation of the
Fire Department in a manner consistent with direction given by the Board of
Aldermen. All members of the Fire Department, both paid and volunteer, shall be
subject to rules and regulations regarding operation of the Fire Department as
promulgated by the Town Manager and the Fire Chief.

SEWERS USER REGULATIONS
§ 50.030 INTENT OF REGULATION OF SEWER USE.
   (A)   It is intended that this subchapter include provisions for prohibiting
the discharge by any wastewater customer into a public sanitary sewer of
substances which may endanger the public health and safety; or of unpolluted
waters which do not require treatment and therefore reduce the effectiveness of
the biological operations of a treatment facility.
   (B)   It is further understood that the biological and chemical operations
which can be designed for wastewater treatment do, by their scientific nature,
limit the types of constituents in wastewater which may be treated by
facilities constructed and maintained within a reasonable cost to the public.
Consequently, the treatment facilities are designed for the primary purpose of
treating domestic wastewater in sufficient manner to protect public health.
   Certain industrial wastewater constituents can be treated without
interference at the wastewater facilities, but only in a limited quantity or
concentration. To ensure that discharges of industrial wastewater into the
public sanitary sewer are within such quantity and concentration limits,
reasonable and adequate regulations are provided in this subchapter.

provides a proper sewer connection and industrial waste discharge application,
the Director shall issue the applicant a waste discharge permit. The permit
shall authorize such connection and permit the applicant to discharge such
waste into the public sewer at the rate and in the quantity and/or connection
stated herein. These pretreatment facilities shall be maintained continuously
in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (D)   The conditions and limits in this subchapter shall be used as
pretreatment plant design criteria and shall be applied to the maximum
estimated rate of flow through the plant. Customers who are required to pass
wastewater through a grease trap or other interceptor will provide for a
minimum detention period of ten minutes between the influent and effluent
baffles with 20% of the total volume of the grease trap or interceptor being
allowed for a sludge pocket. This sludge pocket shall be serviced as required,
but at intervals of not longer than 30 days at the owner's expense. It shall be
kept free of inorganic solids which settle into the required sludge pocket, and
all grease or other floating material shall be skimmed from the trap or basin
tank at intervals of a frequency sufficient to avoid accumulation of scum
covering the surface of the liquid, but not less frequently than each 30 days.
   (E)   Upon written notification by the Director that a grease interceptor is
required for a given discharge, the user will have a period of 120 days for
compliance. Such compliance consists of the provision to the Director of
detailed plans and specifications for approval and the method of installation
and operability of a grease trap or other interceptor device. Failure to comply
will result in the implementation of the enforcement procedures of this
subchapter. There shall be a debris screen included in pretreatment facilities,
if such is required by the Director of Public Works, immediately preceding and/
or following the grease interceptor through which all industrial waste,
excepting flow from toilet and personal sanitary facilities, shall pass. A
debris screen may be required as the final feature of a pretreatment facility
with a maximum size opening necessary to protect the public sewer system.
   (F)   The solid matter removed from any interceptor or that which is
retained by the debris screen shall be disposed of in lawful manner, without
nuisance, by the owner at his expense, but shall in no case be placed in the
town's wastewater system.
   (G)   Should the wastewater system customer operate a grease trap, an
interceptor or other pretreatment device in which sludge is collected and
stored, such sludge shall not be placed in the town's wastewater system and all
effluent from such pretreatment plant or device must pass through a debris
screen if required.
   (H)   If it is determined that an applicant discharges wastewater which does
not require pretreatment, the applicant may be issued a permit permitting the
applicant to discharge wastewater to the public sewer at a publicly provided
access point at a rate, and in the quantities and qualities, stated in the
permit.

   (A)   Periodic measurements of flow, suspended solids, B.O.D., and other
appropriate waste characteristics for surcharge determination and other
purposes shall be made by those permittees specifically designated by the
Director of Public Works. The Director shall determine the number of 24-hour
flow measurements and samples required. Continuous monitoring may be required
by the Director in cases involving large fluctuations in quantity or quality of
wastes, or if the wastewater appears to have characteristics which may damage
the receiving system.
   (B)   All public sanitary sewer users whose total average sewage discharge
is greater than 50,000 gallons per day, or whose total average discharge has a
flow or pollutant loading requiring utilization of greater than 5% of the
design capacity of the town's collection system, shall, unless exempted by the
Director, install and maintain, at the user's expense, facilities for
continuously measuring and sampling the total waste discharge. This requirement
may be waived for a particular user only when the quantity, flow rate, and
characteristics of the wastewater can be adequately determined without such
structures; when the physical arrangement of industrial plant facilities with
respect to sewer facilities make such an arrangement unusually costly and other
means of ascertaining the quantity, flow rate, and characteristics can be
devised; or when previous sampling facilities have been built by either the
town or a prior owner.
      (1)   When the Director shall determine for such facilities discharging
less than 50,000 gallons per day that the nature of the discharge or conditions
of the permit warrant continuous monitoring and sampling, the Director may
require the user to install and maintain sampling facilities as stated
heretofore.
      (2)   Any sampling facility previously built by the town shall become the
maintenance responsibility of the user after the adoption of this chapter,
unless the Director determines that it is in the best interest of the town to
continue maintenance.
   (C)   All flow measurements, sampling, and analysis shall be performed by
qualified personnel. All laboratory analyses of industrial wastewater samples
shall be performed by an EPA/DEM certified laboratory in accordance with
current standard chemical analysis methods for wastewater established by EPA/
DEM. All samples shall represent the normal wastewater flow from the premises
over a 24-hour period. The samples shall be composited according to the flow,
either manually with at least one sample collected hourly, or by automatic
integrated sampling equipment.
   (D)   Unless otherwise prescribed by the Director, self-monitoring reports
of the sampling shall be submitted to the town quarterly in accordance with the
following schedule:
 
Monitoring Period       Report Due Date
January l - March 31    April 15
April l - June 30       July 15
July l - September l    October 15
October l - December 31 January 15
 
   (E)   Where a permittee operates as an integrated complex involving varying
processes and having separate industrial waste sewer connections within the
same contributory area, the permittee may be considered as one unit with
multiple connections. An analysis for each connection may be combined in
proportion to the flow from the connection and the weighted average of the
results thus obtained may be used as the measure of the total flow and
concentration of the wasterwater discharged into the public sanitary sewer.
   (F)   The handling, storage, and analysis of all samples taken for the
determination of the characteristics of waste discharged shall be performed in
accordance with standard methods.
   (G)   The town may test for quality, to include sampling, any of the waste
being discharged to the public sanitary sewers at any time. A duly authorized
representative of the Director may enter an industrial user's facility at any
time, by appropriate application at the plant office during business or
operational hours, for this purpose or for reviewing operations in the plant to
estimate the quality of wastes being produced.

§ 50.066 QUANTITY DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Unless otherwise provided, the quantity of wastewater delivered to the
public sanitary sewers shall be the same as the water delivered to the producer
by the town water system.
   (B)   Should the user evaporate or otherwise legally dispose of water
delivered by the town's water system, it shall be the obligation of the user to
install at his expense such meters or other flow measurement devices to
accurately determine the portion or quantity of the metered water delivered to
the wastewater system.
   (C)   The Director of Public Works may establish a constant ratio, factor,
or percentage to be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by the town
in order to estimate the quantity of wastewater delivered by the user.
Determination of this factor shall be the responsibility of the user as will be
the demonstration of the accuracy and generality of the factor to obtain the
Director's approval thereof. The value of this factor will be periodically
reviewed for accuracy and may be revised.
   (D)   All domestic and industrial users served by the town wastewater system
shall pay sewer user charges to the town. Where no payment procedure is
established, it shall be the obligation of the owner in all instances to
immediately submit to the Director a statement concerning water consumption and
disposal upon which wastewater service fees can be determined. If changes in
the consumption and disposal conditions so stated take place after billing
rates and charges have been initially established, a further statement is
required to be submitted on forms supplied by the Director.

hearing before the Director of Public Works. If the person does not respond
within the time prescribed in the notice, the town may immediately discontinue
service to this person upon the expiration of the prescribed time. If the user
receives notice due to non-payment of a bill, the town may suspend service,
after notice, at the direction of the Town Clerk.

of the provision as alleged in the notice, he or she shall order the person to
correct the condition giving rise to the violation, and establish a reasonable
time for compliance. If the Director cannot, at the hearing, determine the
existence or extent of the alleged violation, he or she may order the
suspension of services. In the case of suspension of services, the person is
entitled to request a second hearing following the period of suspension, and in
the event he or she does so, no further action may be taken by the town until
the conclusion of the second hearing.

but has denied the alleged violation, the town may require that the user cease
to discharge into a public sanitary sewer, upon a hearing by the Director of
Public Works, for up to 30 days. The suspension shall be only for the purpose
of clearly determining the operational effect of the user's discharge; the
suspension shall not be made if it will likely endanger the public health,
safety, or welfare or otherwise create a public health or safety nuisance.
Depending upon the results of the suspension on the operation of the wastewater
treatment facilities, the town may take appropriate action to either restore
service or discontinue further service.

imminent and substantial endangerment to the health and welfare of persons, or
is likely to cause the disruption or inhibition of the operation of the town's
treatment facilities, the Director may immediately, upon written notice or
verbal notification to the user, discontinue service to the user. In such
event, the town shall serve a written notice to the user after discontinuation
of service and shall, where feasible, follow the procedural requirements of
this chapter. If, upon fulfillment of such requirements, it is determined that
no violation has occurred, service to the user shall be restored at no cost to
the user.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 50.130 TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be officially known as the "Stormwater Management
Ordinance." It is referred to herein as "this subchapter."
(Ord. 1538, passed 5-24-07)
§ 50.131 AUTHORITY.
   The town is authorized to adopt this subchapter pursuant to North Carolina
law, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of
North Carolina; G.S. § 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the Environmental
Management Commission thereunder; Session Law 2006-246; Chapter 160A, §§ 174,
185 and Chapter 153A, Article 18.
(Ord. 1538, passed 5-24-07)
§ 50.132 FINDINGS.
    (A)   It is hereby determined that:
      (1)   Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of
local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding,
soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and
sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
      (2)   These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are
harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and
      (3)   These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper
design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development
sites.
   (B)   Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water
Act") and Federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as
rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in
response to Federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas,
including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those
included in this subchapter.
   (C)   Therefore, the town establishes this set of water quality and quantity
regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control
of stormwater runoff and discharge.
(Ord. 1538, passed 5-24-07)
§ 50.133 PURPOSE.
    (A)   General. The purpose of this subchapter is to protect, maintain and
enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by
establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects
of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source
pollution associated with new development and redevelopment and illicit
discharges into municipal stormwater systems. It has been determined that
proper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater
runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure;
safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and protect water and
aquatic resources.
   (B)   Specific. This subchapter seeks to meet its general purpose through
the following specific objectives and means:
      (1)    Establishing decision-making processes for development that
protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
      (2)   Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as
practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, stream bank
erosion, non-point and point source pollution and increases in stream
temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic
habitats;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the
minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices,
such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of
greenspace, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent
practicable;
      (6)   Establishing provisions for the longterm responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they
continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no
threat to public safety;
      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of
approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance;
      (8)   Controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate
stormwater system;
      (9)   Controlling erosion and sedimentation from construction activities;
and
      (10)   Assigning responsibility and processes for approving the creation
and maintenance of adequate drainage and flood damage prevention measures.
(Ord. 1538, passed 5-24-07)
§ 50.134 APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   General. Beginning with and subsequent to its effective date, this
subchapter shall be applicable to all development and redevelopment, including,
but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and
grading applications.
   (B)   No development or redevelopment until compliance and permit. No
development or redevelopment shall occur except in compliance with the

covered by impervious or partially impervious surface including, but not
limited to, buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots,
and paths; and recreation facilities such as tennis courts. "Built-upon area"
does not include a wooden slatted deck, the water area of a swimming pool, or
pervious or partially pervious paving material to the extent that the paving
material absorbs water or allows water to infiltrate through the paving
material.
   "COASTAL AREA MANAGEMENT ACT (CAMA)." An act that requires the establishment
of a cooperative program of coastal land management between local government
and the State of North Carolina for preparing, adopting and enforcing local
land use plans. CAMA requires that local governments within the 20 coastal

orderly development, and management of the coastal area of North Carolina.
   "DESIGN MANUAL." The stormwater design manual approved for use by the town
for the proper implementation of the requirements of the Federal Phase II
Stormwater Program. All references herein to the design manual are to the
latest published edition or revision.
   "DEVELOPMENT." Any land-disturbing activity that increases the amount of
built-upon area or that otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation
into the soil.
   "FLOODPLAIN." The 1% Annual Chance Floodplain as delineated by the North
Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program in the Division of Emergency Management.
   "HIGH QUALITY WATERS (HQW)." Supplemental classification intended to protect
waters with quality higher than state water quality standards. In general,
there are two means by which a water body may be classified as HQW:
      (1)   By definition; or
      (2)   They may be supplementally classified as HQW through the rule-
making process.
   "LARGER COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT OR SALE." Any area where multiple
separate and distinct construction or land-disturbing activities will occur
under one plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including
but not limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch,
advertisement, loan application, drawing, permit application, zoning request,
or computer design) or physical demarcation (including but not limited to
boundary signs, lot stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction
activities may occur on a specific plot.
   "OWNER." The legal or beneficial owner of land, including but not limited to
a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, or long-term
or commercial lessee, or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights
in the property or having legal power of management and control of the
property. "Owner" shall include long-term commercial tenants; management
entities, such as those charged with or engaged in the management of properties
for profit; and every person or entity having joint ownership of the property.
A secured lender not in possession of the property does not constitute an
owner, unless the secured lender is included within the meaning of "owner"
under another description in this definition, such as a management entity.
   "REDEVELOPMENT." Any development on previously-developed land, other than a
rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and
provides equal or greater stormwater control than the previous development.
   "SA WATERS." Surface waters that are used for shellfishing or marketing
purposes and all SC and SB uses. All SA waters are also HQW by definition.
Stormwater controls are required under CAMA. No domestic discharges are
permitted in these waters.
   "SB WATERS." Surface waters that are used for primary recreation, including
frequent or organized swimming and all SC uses. Stormwater controls are
required under CAMA and there are no categorical restrictions on discharges.
   "SC WATERS." All tidal salt waters protected for secondary recreation such
as fishing, boating and other activities involving minimal skin contact;
aquatic life propagation and survival; and wildlife. Stormwater controls are
required under CAMA and there are no categorical restrictions on discharges.
   "STRUCTURAL BMP." A physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter
pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff
velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-
development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of
these goals. Structural BMP includes physical practices such as constructed
wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other
methods installed or created on real property. "Structural BMP" is synonymous
with "structural practice," "stormwater control facility," "stormwater control
practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater management practice,"
"stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater treatment systems," and
similar terms used in this subchapter.
   "SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS." For the purposes of determining whether sufficient
progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following
construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan
shall occur: obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a
continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; or installation
and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the
construction and approval of a building foundation. "Substantial progress" for
purposes of determining whether an approved plan is null and void is not
necessarily the same as "substantial expenditures" used for determining vested
rights pursuant to applicable law.

stormwater BMPs.
      (2)   The design manual includes a list of acceptable stormwater
treatment practices, including specific design criteria for each stormwater
practice. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and
maintained in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed
to meet the minimum water quality performance standards of the Phase II and
other applicable stormwater laws.
   (B)   Relationship of design manual to other laws and regulations. If the
specifications or guidelines of the design manual are more restrictive or apply
a higher standard than other laws or regulations, that fact shall not prevent
application of the specifications or guidelines in the design manual.
   (C)   Changes to standards and specifications. If the standards,
specifications, guidelines, policies, criteria, or other information in the
design manual are amended subsequent to the submittal of an application for

included in the concept plan, which should be submitted in advance of the
meeting:
         (a)   Existing conditions/proposed site plans. Existing conditions and
proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a minimum: existing and
proposed topography; perennial and intermittent streams; mapping of predominant
soils from soil surveys (if available); boundaries of existing predominant
vegetation; proposed limits of clearing and grading; and location of existing
and proposed roads, buildings, parking areas and other impervious surfaces.
         (b)   Natural resources inventory. A written or graphic inventory of
natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the
commencement of the project. This description should include a discussion of
soil conditions, geologic features, topography, wetlands, and native vegetative
areas on the site, as well as the location and boundaries of other natural
feature protection and conservation areas such as ponds, floodplains, stream
buffers and other setbacks. Particular attention should be paid to
environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or
constraints for development and stormwater management.
         (c)    Stormwater management system concept plan. A written or graphic
concept plan of the proposed post-development stormwater management system
including: preliminary selection and location of proposed structural stormwater
controls; low-impact design elements; location of existing and proposed

bridge, or utility crossing as long as it is located, designed, constructed,
and maintained to minimize disturbance, provide maximum nutrient removal,
protect against erosion and sedimentation, have the least adverse effects on
aquatic life and habitat, and protect water quality to the maximum extent
practicable through the use of BMPs.
      (2)   When there is a lack of practical alternatives for a stormwater
management facility; a stormwater management pond; or a utility, including, but
not limited to, water, sewer, or gas construction and maintenance corridor, as
long as it is located 15 feet landward of all perennial and intermittent
surface waters and as long as it is located, designed, constructed, and
maintained to minimize disturbance, provide maximum nutrient removal, protect
against erosion and sedimentation, have the least adverse effects on aquatic
life and habitat, and protect water quality to the maximum extent practicable
through the use of BMPs.
      (3)   A lack of practical alternatives may be shown by demonstrating
that, considering the potential for a reduction in size, configuration, or
density of the proposed activity and all alternative designs, the basic project
purpose cannot be practically accomplished in a manner which would avoid or
result in less adverse impact to surface waters.

loading. The best practices are ones that result in the highest degree of fecal
die-off and control sources of fecal coliform to the maximum extent practicable
while still meeting the other requirements of this subchapter.
   (B)   No direct discharge or expansion of discharges to SA waters. No new
direct points of stormwater discharge to SA waters or increases in the volume
of stormwater flow through conveyances or increases in capacity of conveyances
in existing stormwater conveyance systems that drain to Class SA waters are
permitted. Any modification or redesign of a stormwater conveyance system
within the contributing drainage basin must not increase the net amount or rate
of stormwater discharge through existing outfalls to Class SA waters. Diffuse
flow of stormwater at a nonerosive velocity to a vegetated buffer or other
natural area capable of providing effective infiltration of the runoff from the
one-year, 24-hour storm shall not be considered a direct point of stormwater
discharge. Consideration shall be given to soil type, slope, vegetation, and
existing hydrology when evaluating infiltration effectiveness.

loss, expense, or liability incurred because of the removal, storage, or sale
thereof.
   (D)   No person shall be held to answer in any civil or criminal action to

vehicle as defined in this chapter.
Penalty, see § 90.99
§ 90.04 EXEMPTIONS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any motor vehicle in an
enclosed building or any vehicle on the premises of a business enterprise being

or depository maintained in a lawful place and manner by the town.
§ 90.05 NOTICE AND HEARING.
   (A)   In those cases where motor vehicles are towed pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter and the person who tows the vehicle is responsible
for collection of all towing fees, all provisions of G.S. Chapter 20, Article
7A (G.S. §§ 20-219.9 et seq.), shall apply.
   (B)   In those situations where motor vehicles are towed pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter and the town is responsible for collecting any
towing fees, the procedures set forth hereinafter shall apply.
   (C)   Pre-towing notice. Except as set forth in division (D) below, a motor
vehicle subject to the provisions of this chapter may only be towed after
notice to the owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle. Notice
shall be given by affixing notice on the windshield or some other conspicuous
place on the vehicle. The notice shall state that civil penalties will begin in
seven days after the notice is affixed unless the motor vehicle is moved by the
owner or legal possessor at that time. Additionally in the case of a health or
safety hazard vehicle, if the names and mailing address of the owner of the
vehicle and the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be
determined with reasonable diligence, the notice shall also be given to both by
first class mail sent to the last known address of such persons as reflected on
the county tax records. Such note shall be deemed given when delivered into the
possession of the U.S. Postal Service.
   (D)   Pre-towing notice exception. If it is determined by the town that an
abandoned vehicle on public streets impedes the flow of traffic or otherwise
jeopardizes the public welfare so that immediate removal is required, the
vehicle may be removed without any pre-towing notice. Circumstances justifying
the immediate removal of a motor vehicle include but are not limited to,
vehicles obstructing traffic, vehicles parked in violation of parking
ordinances, vehicles blocking or impeding access to and from residences and
places of business, vehicles posing a traffic hazard and vehicles causing
damage on public or private property.
   (E)   Removal of vehicle; post-towing notice. Following removal of a motor
vehicle pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the town shall notify the
last known registered owner of the vehicle of the following:
      (1)   That the vehicle has been towed;
      (2)   A description of the vehicle;
      (3)   The place where the vehicle is stored;
      (4)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;
      (5)   The procedure that the owner must follow to have the vehicle
returned to such owner which shall include permitting the release of the
vehicle at any time after towing by the posting of a bond acceptable to the
town in an amount equal to twice the towing fees or by payment of all towing
fees owed;
      (6)   That the owner may file a request in writing with the magistrate in
the county where the vehicle was towed to determine if probable cause existed
for the towing. Such written request must be filed with the magistrate within
15 days of service on the owner of the notice required by this section. If the
owner is served by publication in the manner described in division (F) below,
the time for filing such request shall begin to run the day after the second
required publication.
   (F)   Procedure for giving the required notice. The notice required by
division (E) shall initially be given by telephone if possible. If the vehicle
has a North Carolina registration, notice shall be attempted by telephone
within 24 hours of towing. If the vehicle is not registered in this state,
notice shall be attempted by telephone within 72 hours of towing. Whether or
not the owner is reached by telephone, notice shall be mailed to the owner's
last known address within 48 hours of towing unless the owner or his agent
waives this notice in writing. Such mailing shall be by first class mail and by
certified mail, return receipt requested. If the owner's last known address
cannot be determined after a reasonable search for such address, such notice
shall be given by publishing the required notice once a week for three
successive weeks in a newspaper that is qualified for legal advertising in
accordance with G.S. § 1-597 and G.S. § 1-598 and circulated in the area where
the party to be served is believed by the serving party to be located or if
there is no reliable information concerning the location of the party then in a
newspaper circulated in Hanover County. The costs of such publication shall be
included in the towing fee to be recovered by the town as provided herein.
   (G)   Right to probable cause hearing before sale or final disposition of
vehicle; Right to recover vehicle; unauthorized removal unlawful.
      (1)   After towing of a motor vehicle under the provisions of this
chapter, the owner or other person entitled to possession may request in
writing a hearing to determine if probable cause existed for towing the
vehicle. The request must be filed within 15 days of the owner's receipt of the
notice required by division (E) above with the magistrate in the county in
which the vehicle was towed. The magistrate will set the hearing within 72
hours of receipt of the request and the hearing will be conducted in accordance
with the provisions of G.S. § 20-219.11.
      (2)   At any time after towing of a motor vehicle pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter, the owner may obtain possession of the motor
vehicle by paying the towing fee or by posting bond in accordance with G.S. §
20-219.12.
      (3)   It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or attempt to remove
from any storage facility any vehicle which has been impounded pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter unless and until all towing fees are paid or a bond
is posted as prescribed by G.S. § 20-219.12.
   (H)   Sale and disposition of vehicle.
      (1)   With the consent of the owner, the town may dispose of any vehicle
towed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter without holding it for any
prescribed time.
      (2)   Any vehicle towed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall
be held for at least 30 days during which the owner may claim it by exhibiting
proof of ownership satisfactory to the town and paying all towing fees. A motor
vehicle held for more than 30 days may be sold in accordance with the
applicable provisions of G.S. 44A-4 except that no hearing other than the
probable cause hearing provided for in division (G) above shall be required. If
no one purchases the vehicle at the sale and the value of the vehicle is less
than the towing fees, the town may destroy the vehicle.
      (3)   The proceeds of the sale shall be paid in the manner set forth in
G.S. § 44A-5.
   (I)   Definitions. The definitions set forth in G.S. § 20-219.9 shall be
applicable to all provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1785, passed 5-9-19)
§ 90.06 GEOGRAPHICAL AREA TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   The provisions of this Chapter 90 shall apply in those areas where the town
exercises territorial and extraterritorial jurisdiction under G.S. § 160A-360.
(Ord. 1785, passed 5-9-19)
§ 90.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   A violation of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute an
infraction punishable by a penalty of not more than $50.
   (B)   (1)   Any person who causes or allows a motor vehicle as defined in §
90.01(E) or (F) to be abandoned shall be subject to a civil penalty in the
amount of $250 for the first day of such offense and in the amount of $100 for
each after the first day of such offense that such violation continues within
12 months of the first offense to be recovered by the town in a civil action in
the nature of debt if the offender does not pay the penalty within ten days of

160A-175(b), a violation of this section shall not be subject to the penalty
provisions of G.S. § 14-4 and shall not be considered a breach of the penal
laws of the state.

the offender to a civil penalty of $50.00. If any offender fails to pay the
civil penalty within ten days after being cited for a violation, the town may

   At any location within the town where necessary to prevent flotation due to
possible high flood waters, LP-Gas containers shall be securely anchored as
follows:
   (A)   Containers shall be anchored as follows:
      (1)   Horizontal containers: each container shall be secured with four
mobile home type earth anchors as described in division (B) (2) below. Two
anchors will be sunk at each end of the container. Each anchor will be
connected so as to resist motion from buoyancy and to prevent floatation and
rotation. Anchor connections will be over the top of the container from anchor
to anchor. Anchors will be set such that their tops will be flush with the
ground at a point under the turn of the container not greater than 12 inches
from and in line at each end with the legs on either end of the container.
Connecters to anchors will be torqued to not less than 50 foot pounds.
      (2)   Underground containers: each container shall be secured by using
four mobile home type earth anchors. Two anchors will be sunk at each end of
the container. Each anchor will be connected so as to resist motion from
buoyancy and to prevent floatation and rotation. Anchor connections will be
over the top of the container from anchor to anchor. Anchors will be set such
that their tops will be flush with the ground at a point in line and
perpendicular with the turn of the tank and in line at each end with the legs
on either end of the container. Connecters to anchors will be torqued to not
less than 50 pounds.
      (3)   Vertical containers: each container shall be secured with two
mobile home type earth anchors. Anchors will be connected to the legs of the
container through the bottom assembly. Each container in any group shall be
anchored individually. Vertical containers may be affixed to solid surfaces
instead of using anchors as described hereinabove provided such fastening will
prevent floatation and not affect the vertical stability of the container.
Connecting straps shall be fastened together with not less than 50 foot pounds
of torque. Anchors shall be augured into the earth such that the tops are flush
to the ground surface. Anchors shall be located opposite to each other.
   (B)   Materials for strapping and anchoring shall be as follows:
      (1)   Strapping: materials shall consist of galvanized steel strapping
not less than 1.25 inches wide and not less than .031 inch thickness, or
stainless steel strapping not less than .75 inches wide and not less than .031
inch thickness; or stainless steel cable not less than three-eighths inches in
diameter. When galvanized strapping is used, vinyl, rubber or plastic sheathing
over the strap will be required in order to separate the container surface from
the strap surface and prevent galvanic action between these materials. All
strapping material shall have a tensile breaking strength of not less than
4,000 pounds.
      (2)   Anchors: anchors shall consist of steel mobile home earth type
anchors. The anchor shank shall not be less than 36 inches in length and five-
eighths inches in diameter. Each anchor shall contain at least two auger discs
not less than four inches in diameter. The anchor assembly shall be capable of
maintaining not less than 3,000 pounds holding strength. Anchors shall be
capable of withstanding not less than 50 foot pounds of torque for connecting
of straps or cable.
   (C)   The following requirements must be met for containers anchored prior
to adoption of this section;
      (1)   Galvanized strapping affixed prior to adoption of the section must
be protected from galvanic action by the use of plastic, rubber or vinyl
sheathing material.
      (2)   Preexisting strapping must connect anchors through the legs of the
container at its base to prevent floatation or movement with cable or strapping
material under a load of not less than 50 foot pounds of applied torque.
   (D)   Containers may be secured to permanent vertical surfaces if this can
be accomplished in a fashion that will prevent the container from being
dislodged or floating. Fastening shall be at the top portion of the containers
and at the bottom portion of the container with a connection to the adjacent
vertical surface with straps or cable under load of not less than 50 foot
pounds of torque. Top and bottom fastenings will be fitted 90 degrees to the
vertical plain of the container. Such fastenings must achieve 3,000 pound
holding potential. Other alternative fastening methods may be utilized subject
to the prior approval of the Fire Official as defined in § 94.30.

§ 97.01 STATEMENT OF POLICY; INTERPRETATIONS.
   (A)   Statement of policy. It is the policy of the Town of Wrightsville
Beach to maintain a peaceful community while recognizing that certain noises
are generated by the acceptable economic and recreational activity of a vibrant
community. The goal of the town is to encourage such activity while ensuring
that time periods during which many residents are customarily at rest or have
an expectation of peaceful enjoyment of their residences are not disturbed by
unacceptable levels or types of noise.
   (B)   Interpretations and definitions. For purposes of this chapter, the
following interpretations and definitions shall apply.
      (l)   When the word "REASONABLE" is used herein, it shall be evaluated
with reference to the normal expectations for sound during normal waking hours
versus the normal expectations for sound during normal sleeping hours, with a
higher level of sound acceptable during the day and a lower level of sound
acceptable during the night. It shall also be evaluated with reference to the
location involved, with a higher level of noise expected and tolerated if
generated within a commercial district within the town and a lower level of
noise expected and tolerated if generated within a residential district within
the town.
      (2)   A "REASONABLE PERSON" is one who is moderate, fair and sensible.
Although enforcement of this chapter shall often be the result of a complaint
received by the town, in each instance where a complaint is received and the
standard of "reasonableness" invoked, a Wrightsville Beach police officer
answering the complaint shall separately determine, based upon his or her
investigation and in light of the circumstances of the situation, whether the
noise in question is at an "unreasonable" level pursuant to the provisions of
this
Chapter 97 .
      (3)   Whether a sound is "AUDIBLE WITHIN A PERSON'S TEMPORARY OR USUAL
PLACE OF ABODE" shall be determined with one or more windows of the complaining
party open, assuming weather conditions during which it is reasonable and
customary for one or more windows to be open.
      (4)   Noise is "DISTURBING" if it is perceived by a person of ordinary
sensibilities as interrupting the normal peace and calm of an area.
      (5)   "UNREASONABLY LOUD NOISE" shall mean noise which is loud, raucous
and disturbing which unreasonably obstructs, disturbs, injures, or endangers
the comfort, health, peace, or safety of reasonable persons of ordinary
sensibilities.
(Ord. 1810, passed 9-10-20)
§ 97.02 GENERAL PROHIBITION.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to make, allow, continue, or
assist to be made, allowed or continued:
      (l)   Any unreasonably loud noise;
      (2)   Any noise which unreasonably disturbs, injures, or endangers the
comfort, repose, health, peace, or safety of reasonable persons of ordinary
sensibilities, within the jurisdictional limits of the town; or
      (3)   Any noise which is so harsh, prolonged, unnatural, or unusual in
time or place as to occasion unreasonable discomfort to any person of
reasonable and ordinary sensibilities residing, visiting or working in the area
from which said noises emanate, or as to unreasonably interfere with the peace
and comfort of such residents or their guests, or operators or customers in
places of business, or as to detrimentally or adversely affect such residences
or places of business.
   (B)   Factors for determining whether noise is unreasonably loud or
disturbing include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The proximity of the sound to sleeping facilities, whether
residential or commercial;
      (2)   The land use, nature, and zoning of the area(s) from which the
sound emanates and the area where it is received or perceived;
      (3)   The time of day or night the sound occurs;
      (4)   The duration of the sound; and
      (5)   Whether the sound is recurrent, intermittent, or constant.
(Ord. 1810, passed 9-10-20)

97.02 if generated between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. and are
prohibited between those hours. This enumeration shall not be construed to be

(Ord. 1810, passed 9-10-20)
§ 97.05 NOISES THAT GENERALLY DO NOT VIOLATE THIS CHAPTER.
   The following noises and activities are exempt from the provisions of this
chapter unless they produce a risk of serious or unnecessary bodily harm:
   (A)   Town work. The sounds produced by town vehicles, employees and
contractors engaged in:
      (1)   Critical and/or emergency town duties such as removing snow,
repairing damaged water or sewer lines, responding to fires, responding to
vehicle accidents, and the like; or
      (2)   The normal day-to-day operations of the town; provided, that such
activities are exempt only if conducted between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:
00 p.m., unless explicitly authorized by the Town Council following general
notice to the public and a public hearing.
   (B)   Community events.
      (1)   The normal and customary sounds emanating from a non-recurring
community event conducted by a governmental entity, school, church, or similar
non-commercial entity, so long as the event with which the noise is associated
begins no earlier than 7:00 a.m. and ends no later than 10:00 p.m. For purposes
of this division, "non-recurring" shall refer to an event which occurs no more
than four times during any calendar year. However, an event can lose its status
as a community event under this division if multiple complaints from different
sources are received about the noise level emanating from the event, and upon
investigation, the police determine that the noise levels ten feet or more from
the property boundaries of the property upon which the event is conducted, or
with respect to events such as parades which utilize the public streets, ten
feet or more from the curb or edge of the street pavement when no curb exists,
violate the standards set out in §
97.06. If an event loses its status as a "community event" it shall no longer
enjoy the presumption under this section that it does not violate the chapter.
      (2)   Any community event or series of events specifically authorized by
the town as a community event, including one for which it is predicted will
generate noise otherwise prohibited by this Chapter 97, upon a finding that
such event provides a benefit to the citizens of Wrightsville Beach and the
public at large that exceeds the potential detrimental effects of the noise it
may generate. Before approving such event or series of events, the Board of
Aldermen shall confirm that notice of the public hearing was posted at least
seven days prior to the hearing on the town's website and in every other place
at which the town has posted notice of the meeting during which the public
hearing is to take place. The applicant for designation as a community event
shall provide a schedule of the starting and ending time of the event, a
description of the noise-generating activities which are expected from the
event, a summary of all steps which will be taken to mitigate any negative
noise impacts of the event, and the applicant shall describe the expected
benefits to the citizens of Wrightsville Beach and the public at large which
will be derived from the event.
   (C)   Sporting events. The normal and customary sounds emanating from a
sporting event held on the campus of a school or on town owned property will
not be considered noises or activities which violate this chapter, so long as
the event with which the noise is associated does not begin prior to 6:00 a.m.
and has been scheduled to end by 11:00 p.m., and any crowd associated with the
event is expected to disperse by 11:30 p.m., even if due to unexpected delays,
overtime periods and the like, the event extends past 11:00 p.m. and the crowd
does not disperse until after 11:30 p.m. This exemption, however, does not
relieve people leaving such an event from minimizing any loud talking,
shouting, and the like, which may be heard in places of abode in the vicinity
of the event, and should any person fail to heed a request by a Wrightsville
Beach police officer to lower the volume of such noise, that person may be
cited and fined pursuant to this
Chapter 97 .
   (D)   Remote vehicle entry or key. The use of a remote vehicle entry or key
causing an audible "beep" when used simply to lock or unlock a vehicle prior to
or following the reasonable use of the vehicle.

such as a lawnmower, weed trimmer, circular saw, chain saw, and the like, if
used on weekdays between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., so long as the
tool is being used for a legitimate maintenance or construction purpose
associated with the property upon which it is utilized and the person using
such tool takes all practical steps to minimize its disturbing noise impacts on
others.
   (F)   Emergency work. Emergency work performed for the purpose of preventing
or alleviating physical trauma or property damage threatened or caused by an
existing or imminent peril. This emergency exception includes maintenance,
backup, or upkeep strictly necessary to keep emergency equipment, such as
generators, in operating order. In addition, this exception only applies for
the shortest duration of time reasonably required to address the emergency.
   (G)   Public demonstrations. Noise resulting from parades, lawful picketing
or other public demonstrations protected by the U.S. Constitution or federal
law or for which a permit has been granted by the town, provided that such
demonstrations are held between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on
weekdays, or between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on weekends.
   (H)   Safety signals. Noise of safety signals, warning devices, and
emergency pressure relief valves, provided such signals are used in a manner
consistent with promoting public health and safety.
   (I)   Emergency vehicles. Noise resulting from the lawful operation of any
authorized emergency vehicle.
(Ord. 1810, passed 9-10-20)
§ 97.06 RESPONSIBLE PARTIES; NOTICE.

event.

citizens to engage in protected free speech expressive activities and yet allow

upon public facilities and services.

§ 98.11 POLICE PROTECTION.
   (A)   The Chief of Police shall determine whether and to what extent

traffic control and public safety. The Chief of Police shall base this decision
on the size, location, duration, time and date of the event, the expected sale
or service of alcoholic beverages, the number of streets and intersections
blocked, and the need to detour or preempt citizen travel and use of the
streets and sidewalks. The speech content of the event shall not be a factor in

disruption of ordinary police services or compromise of public safety,
regularly scheduled on-duty personnel will police the event. If additional
police protection for the special event is deemed necessary by the Chief of

§ 99.17 GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Rights-of-way in the town may be controlled by N.C. Department of
Transportation (DOT), private parties, and/or the town. The town issues and/or
monitors work and/or encroachments in the town's public right-of-way (the
"PROW"). The town may also issue permits for work on town property in DOT's
rights-of-way. Encroachment permits, or agreements are required to attach or
use any town property. Wireless telecommunication facility encroachments in the
PROW require review by the Planning Department (see UDO §
155.7.18). All PROW encroachments must be reviewed by the Public Works
Department, including attachments to town utility poles, replacement of town
utility poles, and "make ready" requests.
   (B)   The right to perform work in the PROW and the ability to maintain
facilities in the PROW are allowed subject to the conditions below, as
supplemented by those set forth in other sections of this chapter, standards
adopted by the town and requirements contained in permits and/or other
authorizations.
      (1)   An encroachment permit does not convey any legal right, title, or
interest in the PROW. Persons doing work in the PROW and users may need to
obtain approvals from persons with property interests in the property.
      (2)   A permit or authorization does not limit the town's exercise of its
regulatory, police, government, legislative, or contracting authority. The town
retains all rights to use all portions of public rights-of-way for its purposes
not prohibited by law. If a permit or authorization conflicts with the terms of
another permit or authorization, or with the town code, the stricter of the
applicable provisions shall control. The stricter provision shall not control,
however, if a later-issued permit, authorization, or ordinance explicitly and
specifically states that particular terms are to override prior, less strict
terms in an authorization.
      (3)   The town and its officials, officers, and employees are not liable
for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages that result when facilities
in the PROW are damaged during the construction, installation, inspection,
maintenance, use, or repair of public improvements that have received town
funding or that are installed pursuant to a contract with the town.
      (4)   Users and persons who cause work to be done in the PROW shall pay
for all damage that results, directly or indirectly, from work performed for
their benefit in the PROW, and for the installation, repair, maintenance, and
operation of their facilities in the PROW.
      (5)   An encroachment permit creates no third-party rights against the
town and is intended only for the benefit of the person receiving the permit or
authorization.
      (6)   Persons doing work in the PROW shall not interfere with existing
town utilities, such as infrastructure for electricity, water and sewer, the
natural and constructed storm water system, and traffic signals and associated
lines, or the repair or replacement of such systems. Persons doing work in the
PROW shall apply for an encroachment permit at least ten working days prior to
initiating work, to allow time to locate and mark any existing town utility
lines. Persons building structures, including utility poles and/or wireless
facilities shall apply for an encroachment permit at least 30 calendar days
prior to beginning work (see §
99.18 below). The application shall accurately describe the portion of the
street to be affected. Damage to town utilities or other infrastructure shall
be paid for by the person or user contracting for the work that resulted in
such damage. If an encroachment permit is not required, persons doing work in
the PROW shall also give the Town Public Works Department ten working days'
notice to locate and mark any existing town utility lines prior to initiating
work. In addition, persons will give the department a second notice 24-hours
before beginning any work in the PROW as required by §
99.17(B)(15), below.
      (7)   Persons and users performing work in the PROW shall ensure worker,
traffic, and pedestrian safety and shall ensure that all work is performed in
accordance with industry standards. Compliance with all federal, state, and
local regulations, and all federal, state, local, and industry codes and
standards is required. These include, but are not limited to, compliance with
the Occupation Safety and Health Act; compliance with the Manual of Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, National Electrical Code, and National Electrical
Safety Code; compliance with fiber optic installation standards and
telecommunication industry standards; compliance with plumbing and pipe
installation codes and standards; and compliance with standards and codes for
traffic safety and lane closures. Persons and users shall provide all equipment
and personnel necessary to meet applicable regulations, codes, and standards,
and shall furnish additional equipment or personnel if requested by the town.
      (8)   The Public Works Department shall have the discretion to approve,
deny, alter, and condition all proposed locations of facilities in the public
way, and to determine whether placement, if allowed, shall be above ground or
below ground.
      (9)   Wires, fiber, and other similar conduit shall generally be located
underground. A user that wishes to place such facilities above ground shall
demonstrate to the town's satisfaction why above-ground placement is necessary.
      (10)   The town recommends that facilities shall be located in existing
ducts if such ducts are available and practicable to use.
      (11)    A user shall demonstrate to the Public Works Department's
satisfaction that sufficient space exists in the public way for its proposed
facilities without interfering with existing or planned public projects, and
that placement of the facilities will not unduly disrupt use of the public way
or negatively impact the condition of the public way.
      (12)   The town may require a user to post written notice of proposed
work or activities along the public way impacted and/or distribute notices to
individual properties located along the impacted public way.
      (13)   Users shall give the Public Works Department all information it
requests regarding the installation of facilities upon completion. Such
information may include, but is not limited to, as-built or other maps, which
shall be furnished in the form required by the Public Works Department, and
changes to planned locations that were necessary to avoid pre-existing
infrastructure.
      (14)   A person or user that conducts excavation or other activities that
disturb the public rights-of-way or plantings within the public rights-of-way
or facilities within the public way shall restore the area to a functional
condition equivalent to that it was in prior to the disturbance. The
restoration shall include, but is not limited to, installation of pavement,
resurfacing nearby areas, grading other surface areas, restoring below-ground
areas, planting and landscaping, replacing curb ramps to current standards, and
repairing improvements and facilities.
      (15)   Users shall contact the Public Works Department at least 24 hours
prior to actual work performed in the right-of-way, except in the case of an
emergency.
      (16)   To the extent permitted by North Carolina law, the town may
require a performance bond for work to be done in the PROW.
      (17)   A user shall, at its own cost, relocate its facilities within a
time determined at the discretion of the town if the town determines in its
discretion that the facilities:
         (a)   Interfere with the use of the public way, or the provision of
services to town residents;
         (b)   Interfere with the repair or maintenance of any town-maintained
utility; or
         (c)   Will impede the construction of a project funded in part with
public funds, or a project to be dedicated to the public upon completion.

responding to an alarm activation, the enforcement official shall notify any
person identified in the permit required pursuant to § 100.03 of the activation
of the alarm system and such person shall thereupon travel to the premises
within 30 minutes of such notification to ascertain the status thereof. Failure
of such person to appear at the premises within 30 minutes after being notified
to do so shall be deemed a false alarm and shall subject the owner to the
penalties set forth hereinafter.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to reactivate an alarm system
without authorization from the enforcement official following an alarm
activation resulting in the dispatch of a police officer or member of the fire
department to the premises where the alarm was activated.

transmitted as the result of an alarm malfunction, then such official shall
deliver to the owner an alarm activation report indicating that an alarm
activation has occurred and that it has been determined to have resulted from
an alarm malfunction.
   (D)   The activation of an alarm system due to an alarm malfunction shall be
deemed a false alarm and shall subject the towner to the penalties set forth
hereinafter.

§ 100.05 DISCONNECTION OF ALARM SYSTEM.
   (A)   The enforcement official is authorized to order the disconnecting or
deactivation of any alarm system for which seven false alarms have occurred
within a 12 consecutive month period. Notice of such action shall be in writing
and be mailed to the owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the
address shown on the permit application required under § 100.03. The notice
shall specify the date on which the owner shall be required to disconnect or
deactivate the alarm system, which date shall be at least 20 days following the
day of the notice. The owner may appeal the order of the enforcement official
in accordance with § 100.06.
   (B)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any alarm system
installed or maintained in accordance with the North Carolina State Building

Penalty, see § 100.99
§ 100.06 APPEAL.
   An owner to whom a notice to disconnect or deactivate an alarm system is
mailed pursuant to § 100.05 shall be entitled to appeal the order of the
enforcement official to the Town Manager. An appeal must be in writing and must
be delivered to the Town Manager no later than five days prior to the date
disconnection or deactivation is to occur. The appeal must state the reasons
why the order to disconnect or deactivate should be withdrawn. Upon receipt of
an appeal in proper form, the Town Manager may schedule a hearing at which time
the owner and enforcement official shall appear. The Town Manager is authorized
to waive a hearing and to make a decision based on the written appeal from the
owner and information provided by the enforcement official. The Town Manager is
authorized to reverse the decision of the enforcement official if the Manager
determines that the revocation was based on circumstances beyond the control of
the owner, that medical necessity or other reasons justify reinstatement of the
permit or that justice will be best served by reinstatement of the permit. The
decision of the Town Manager in this matter shall be final. The Town Manager
shall notify the owner of his/her decision in writing by mailing a copy of the
decision by first class mail addressed to the owner at the address provided on
the permit application in accordance with § 100.03. If the Manager affirms the
order to disconnect or deactivate an alarm system, the owner shall have 10 days
from the date of the Manager's decision within which to comply with the order.
The appeal of an order to disconnect or deactivate shall suspend the effective
date of the order until the appeal has been acted upon by the Town Manager.
(Ord. 1254, passed 8-17-95)
§ 100.07 FAILURE TO DISCONNECT OR UNAUTHORIZED RECONNECTION OF AN ALARM SYSTEM.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to disconnect or deactivate an
alarm system which has been ordered disconnected or deactivated pursuant to §
100.05, including situations in which the Town Manager affirmed the order to
disconnect or deactivate. It shall be unlawful for any person to reconnect an
alarm system which has been disconnected or deactivated pursuant to the order
of the enforcement official unless reconnection of the alarm system is
authorized pursuant to § 100.08. In addition to the penalties provided in §
100.99, any person violating the provisions of this section shall be subject to
a civil penalty of $200. If a person fails to pay this civil penalty within 10
days after being cited for a violation, the town may seek to recover the
penalty by filing a civil action in the nature of debt.
(Ord. 1254, passed 8-17-95)
Penalty, see § 100.99
§ 100.08 RECONNECTION OF ALARM SYSTEM.
   Any order to disconnect or deactivate an alarm system may be rescinded by
the enforcement official upon a finding by said enforcement official that the
owner has taken corrective action to remedy the cause of the false alarms or
alarm malfunctions at the premises. In making a request for such a rescission,
the owner shall have the burden to show what corrective action has been taken
and that such action is sufficient to support a finding that the cause of the
false alarms or alarm malfunctions has been remedied. The enforcement official
shall have the right to inspect the alarm system and test it prior to
rescinding the order to disconnect or deactivate. Before any reconnection of an
alarm system after the order to disconnect said system, a reconnection fee of
$25 shall be assessed. The enforcement official shall not rescind an order to
disconnect or deactivate if the owner has failed to pay any fee charged the
owner pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 110.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "BUSINESS." Each trade, occupation, profession, business, and franchise
taxed under this chapter. A business is "SEASONAL" in nature when it is
conducted for profit six months out of the year or less.
   "PERSON." Any individual, trustee, executor, other fiduciary, corporation,
unincorporated association, partnership, sole proprietorship, company, firm, or
other legal entity.
('72 Code, § 7-4.1)(Ord. 1090, passed 1-12-89)
§ 110.02 CONSTRUCTION.
   This chapter is enacted for revenue purposes only. Therefore, it should be
construed to require payment of the maximum tax permitted under its terms. In
addition, issuance of a license pursuant to this chapter does not excuse a
licensee from compliance with any other applicable ordinance or statute. This
chapter does not prevent the town from imposing license taxes on additional
businesses, from increasing or decreasing the amount of any license tax, or
from regulating any business taxed.
('72 Code, § 7-4.2)(Ord. 1090, passed 1-12-89)
LEVY
§ 110.10 LEVY OF TAX.
   An annual privilege license tax is hereby levied on each business conducted
within this town listed in §§ 110.65 through 110.68 in the amounts set forth in
those sections.
('72 Code, § 7-4.3)(Ord. 1090, passed
1-12-89)
§ 110.11 WHO MUST PAY TAX.
   Each person who conducts a business within this town is subject to this
chapter. A person "CONDUCTS BUSINESS" when he engages in one act of business
taxed under this chapter. He conducts the business "WITHIN THE TOWN" if he
maintains a business location within the town; or if, either personally or
through agents, he solicits business within the town limits or picks up or
delivers goods or delivers services within the town limits.
('72 Code, § 7-4.4)(Ord. 1090, passed 1-12-89)
§ 110.12 PERIOD OF LICENSE; DUE DATE.
   (A)   Annual license. Unless the section of this chapter levying the
privilege license tax applicable to a particular business provides otherwise, a
license issued pursuant to this chapter is good for the 12-month period
beginning July 1 and ending June 30. The tax is due on July 1 of each year.
However, if a person begins a business after July 1 of a year, the tax for that
year is due before the business is begun.
   (B)   Licenses for periods shorter than one year. If the section of this
chapter levying the privilege license tax applicable to a particular business
so provides, a license may be issued for a period of one day, one week, or some
comparable period of less than a full license year. A person may not commence a
business conducted within the town and taxed under such provision until the
privilege license tax due is paid and may not continue such a business beyond
the period for which the license is issued.
('72 Code, § 7-4.5)(Ord. 1090, passed 1-12-89)
110.13 [REPEALED.]
§ 110.14 REFUNDS.
   If for any reason a licensee discontinues his business during the license
year, he is not entitled to a refund.
('72 Code, § 7-4.7)(Ord. 1090, passed 1-12-89)
§ 110.15 SEPARATE BUSINESSES.
   A separate license is required and a separate privilege license tax must be
paid for each place of business unless two or more places of business under
common ownership, each conducting a business subject to the same tax under this
chapter, are contiguous to each other, communicate directly with and open into
each other and are operated as a unit. In addition, a separate privilege
license tax must be paid for each business taxable under this chapter conducted
by the taxpayer at any one location; however, the town may issue a single
license for all taxable businesses conducted at one location by a single
taxpayer.
('72 Code, § 7-4.8)(Ord. 1090, passed 1-12-89)
§ 110.16 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Generally. Except as otherwise provided in this section or by state
law, no person is exempt from the payment of a privilege license tax levied by
this chapter.
   (B)   Charitable organizations. A person who operates a business for a
religious, educational, civic, patriotic, charitable, or fraternal purpose,
when the entire gross income of the business is used for such a purpose, is
exempt from paying any privilege license tax levied by this chapter.
   (C)   Blind persons and members of the armed forces and merchant marine.
Blind persons and persons who serve in the United States armed forces or the
merchant marine are exempt from paying any privilege license tax levied by this
chapter to the extent provided by G.S. § 105-249 and G.S. § 105-249.1.
   (D)   Must obtain license. A person exempt from paying a privilege license
tax levied by this chapter shall nevertheless obtain a license from the town.
The license shall state that the licensee is exempt from paying the privilege
license tax.

§ 110.28 TOWN TO ISSUE LICENSE; PAYMENT OF TAX A PREREQUISITE.
   After receipt of the completed application, if the town believes that no
reason exists for refusal of a license under § 110.26, he shall determine the

ARTICLE I: IN GENERAL
§ 117.01 STATEMENT OF INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The town, pursuant to applicable federal and state law, is authorized
to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, operate, maintain,
and reconstruct cable systems within the incorporated areas of the town.
   (B)   The Board of Aldermen of the town finds that cable service has become
an integral part of its citizens’ lives and that evolving cable systems have
the potential to play an even more dramatic role in the future, providing great
benefits and advanced capabilities to the town. At the same time, the Board
further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best
be served by establishing regulatory powers that are vested in the town or such
persons as the town designates.
   (C)   In order to ensure that the town and its residents receive state-of-
the-art cable services and capabilities as this technology further evolves, all
franchises granted pursuant to this chapter will be subject to periodic review
and modifications to keep current with changing law, technology, and services.
It is the intent of this chapter to help ensure that local cable operators
provide the best possible cable service to residents of the town, and any
franchises issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this
finding as an integral part thereof.
   (D)   Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to
provide entertainment and information services to the town’s residents and may
have the capacity to provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications
services to institutions and individuals. For these purposes, the following
goals underlie the regulations contained herein:
      (1)   Cable television services should be made available to all of the
town’s residents at the lowest reasonable cost.
      (2)   The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and
reasonably foreseeable future state-of-the- art cable television needs of the
town.
      (3)   The systems authorized by this chapter shall be responsive to the
needs and interests of the local community and shall provide the widest
possible diversity of information sources and services to the public.
      (4)   Each of the above-enumerated goals shall be sought to the maximum
extent, taking into account the costs and benefits to the residents of the
town.
   (E)   The Board further finds that on- going industry consolidation could
result in less local accountability, and that, therefore, stringent customer
service standards, including liquidated damages provisions, may be the only
practical means of ensuring compliance and approximating the costs of franchise
agreement noncompliance to the town and its residents.
§ 117.02 SHORT TITLE.

   (A)   Upon either the expiration or revocation of a franchise, grantor may
permit and/or require a grantee to continue to operate the cable system for an

equipment or documents necessary for continued operation of the system.
   (C)   At all reasonable times, grantee shall permit examination by the town
of the system, together with any appurtenant property of grantee situated
within or without the town when necessary to ascertain the grantee’s compliance
with this chapter, the franchise agreement, and all applicable laws.
   (D)   The town shall have the right of intervention in any suit or
proceeding to which the grantee is a party relative to grantee’s operations in
the town, and the grantee shall not oppose such intervention by the town.

   If any material portion of this chapter, or a franchise agreement adopted
pursuant to it, is held by an authority of competent jurisdiction, to be
invalid or unlawful as conflicting with applicable laws now or hereafter in

modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such
applicable laws, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and
independent part of this chapter or franchise agreement, and, to the extent
possible, such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all
other provisions thereof.

§ 117.12 UNLAWFUL TO OPERATE WITHOUT A FRANCHISE.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, operate, or maintain a
cable system or to provide cable service in the town without a franchise. Any

fine notwithstanding, all such violators shall be subject to all other
applicable provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to the payment
of a franchise fee.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.13 FRANCHISES NON-EXCLUSIVE.
   Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The

including itself, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable federal and
state law.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.14 FRANCHISES COMPETITIVELY NEUTRAL AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY.

         (c)   Public, educational, and governmental (“PEG”) access channels;
         (d)   PEG access capital and operating support
      (2)    Any franchise granted, when evaluated as a whole, shall not be

chapter.
   (B)   Procedure for review and equal requirements.
      (1)   The town will notify existing grantees in writing at least 30 days
in advance, with a copy of a proposed additional franchise, of its intent to
grant an additional franchise for cable services.
      (2)    Within ten days after receipt, existing grantees may give written
notice to town that the proposed additional franchise is inconsistent with (A)
above.
      (3)   The town shall, prior to approving the additional franchise, notify
existing grantees of the town’s determination related to notice under the terms
of this chapter.
      (4)   If the town determines that the terms of an additional franchise
are more favorable or less burdensome than those imposed upon the grantees,
then:
         (a)   Except for PEG capital and operating grant requirements:
            1.    The town may make such modifications as it deems necessary to
ensure that the terms of the additional franchise are no more favorable or less
burdensome than those imposed upon existing grantees; or
            2.   The town may modify the terms and requirements of existing
franchises as mutually agreed to by existing grantees, and if the existing
grantees do not reasonably so agree, the town shall be deemed to have fulfilled
its obligations under (A) above.
         (b)   The town may adjust the peg capital and operating grant
requirements to ensure the total dollars contributed by a new grantee are the
same as required of existing grantees. In the event existing grantees have paid

      (5)   The town shall provide notice to existing grantees of the date,
time, and place of its proceedings relating to the approval of the proposed
franchise.

§ 117.15 TERM OF THE FRANCHISE.
   A franchise agreement shall establish the term of each individual franchise.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.16 FEDERAL, STATE, AND TOWN JURISDICTION.
   (A)   The town shall exercise appropriate regulatory authority under the
provisions of this chapter, the Cable Act, and all applicable laws. This
authority shall be vested in the Town Board and administered through the Town
Manager or his/her designee in order to provide day-to- day administration and
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and any franchise granted
hereunder, and to carry out the town’s responsibilities with regard to cable
service.
   (B)   This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all
applicable federal and state laws.
   (C)   In the event that the federal or state government discontinues
preemption in any area of cable communications over which it currently
exercises jurisdiction in such manner as to expand rather than limit municipal
regulatory authority, grantor may, if it so elects, adopt rules and regulations
in these areas to the extent permitted by law, provided that the same do not
materially alter the rights and obligations of a grantee under any existing
franchise.
   (D)   Grantee’s rights are subject to the police powers of the town to adopt
and enforce ordinances necessary to the health, safety, and welfare of the
public. Grantee shall comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances
enacted by the town pursuant to that power.
   (E)   (1)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all franchises
granted or renewed after the effective date of this chapter. This chapter shall
also apply to all existing franchises, to the extent not inconsistent with the
terms of any such franchise or applicable law. In the event of any conflict
between the terms and conditions of a franchise agreement and the provisions of
this chapter, and other generally applicable regulatory ordinances of the town,
the specific terms of the franchise agreement shall control. A franchise
agreement (including all of grantee’s particular rights, powers, protections,
privileges, immunities, and obligations associated therewith as the same exist
on the date hereof) shall constitute a legally binding contract between the
town and grantee, and as such, cannot be amended, modified, or changed by the
town without the consent of grantee in any manner whatsoever, whether by
ordinance, rule, regulation, or otherwise, to impose on grantee more stringent
or burdensome requirements or conditions, provided, however, that nothing
herein contained shall preclude the town from the proper exercise of its police
powers or its powers of eminent domain.
      (2)   In the event of a change in state or federal law which by its terms
would require the town to amend this chapter, the parties shall modify the
existing franchise in a mutually agreed upon manner.
   (G)   Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of
the provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement by reason of any
failure of the town to enforce prompt compliance.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.17 RIGHTS RESERVED TO GRANTOR.
   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to grantor by this chapter
or a franchise agreement, grantor reserves to itself every right and power that
is required to be reserved by a provision of any other ordinance or under any
other franchise.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.18 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT.
   (A)   Every grantee shall agree to the terms and provisions of a franchise
agreement as negotiated between the grantee and the grantor.
   (B)   In addition to those matters required elsewhere in this chapter to be
included in the franchise agreement, each franchise agreement must contain the
following express representations by each grantee:
      (1)   Grantee has examined all of the provisions of this chapter and
accepts and agrees to all of the provisions of this chapter, as it exists as of
the effective date of the grantee’s franchise agreement, except as set forth in
this chapter and any supplementary specifications as to construction,
operation, or maintenance of the system which the town may include in the
franchise agreement, unless otherwise agreed in the applicable franchise
agreement.
      (2)   Grantee recognizes, unless otherwise agreed in the applicable
franchise agreement, the right of the town to adopt such additional regulations
of general applicability as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its
police power.
   (C)   Every franchise agreement shall contain such further conditions or
provisions as may be negotiated between the town and a grantee, except that no
such conditions or provisions shall be such as to conflict with any provisions
of state or federal law. In case of any conflict or of any ambiguity between
any terms or provisions of a franchise agreement and this chapter, the
provisions of the franchise agreement shall control.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.19 INITIAL FRANCHISE APPLICATIONS.
   Any person desiring an initial franchise for a cable system shall file an
application with the town. An application for an initial franchise for a cable
television system shall contain, where applicable:
   (A)   A statement as to the proposed franchise area;
   (B)   Resumé of prior history of applicant, including the legal, technical,
and financial expertise of applicant in the cable television field;
   (C)   List of the partners, general and limited, of the applicant, if a

   (D)   List of officers, directors, and managing employees of applicant,

administration of the franchise.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)

   Upon receipt of any application and application fee for an initial
franchise, the Town Administrator shall prepare a report and make his or her
recommendations respecting such application to the Board.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.21 FRANCHISE RENEWAL.
   Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable law, including but
not limited to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended. Grantor
and a grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any
time during the term of the franchise.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.22 GRANT OF ADDITIONAL FRANCHISE.
   In considering whether to grant one or more additional franchises, the town
shall consider granting such additional franchise on a competitively neutral
basis with terms that, when taken, as a whole are no less burdensome than any
current franchise(s). The purpose of this section is to ensure that any
competition which may occur among grantees will be on terms which when taken as
a whole are nondiscriminatory according to federal law.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.23 PERMITS FOR NON-FRANCHISED ENTITIES.
   (A)   The town may issue a license, easement, or other permit to a person
other than the grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the
grantee’s franchise area within the town in order to provide service outside,
but not within the town. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a
franchise in accordance with this chapter, shall not authorize nor permit said
person to provide cable service to any subscriber within the town nor render
any other service within the town.
   (B)   The granting of such license, easement, or permit shall be conditioned
upon the payment of fee for occupancy of the public right-of-way to the extent
permitted by applicable law.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.24 REVIEW FOR COMPETITION.
   The town recognizes that the cable television and telecommunications
industries are in a period of convergence, that the technologies and services
provided by these industries are rapidly changing, and that the
Telecommunications Act of 1991 promoted and encouraged competition between and
among these formally discrete industries. At this time it is premature to know
fully the extent to which there will be changes in law, technology, or services
that may impact entities that have been or may be granted franchises or
licenses to use the town’s rights-of-way. It is the desire of the town to be a
communications friendly town that encourages the development of competitive
advanced communications capabilities for the benefit of all its citizens. For
this reason the regulatory ordinances and franchises of the town should not
impede or restrict the fair opportunity to compete, but rather are intended to
provide uniform and consistent requirements for all similarly situated
providers.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.25 APPLICATION AND RENEWAL FEES.
   (A)   An application fee shall not be deemed to be “franchise fees” within
the meaning of Section 11722 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. §542), and such
payments shall not be deemed to be (i) “payments in kind” or any involuntary
payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid to the town by grantee,
or (ii) part of the compensation to be paid to the town by grantee pursuant to
this chapter or a franchise agreement.
   (B)   All applicants for an initial franchise grant shall submit an
application fee of $6,500 to compensate the town for its costs in reviewing,
preparing, and awarding a franchise, including the costs of outside
consultants. Upon grant of a franchise the town may request the payment of an
additional fee to the extent that the reasonable costs of the franchise review
and negotiation process exceed the initial application fee amount. Consistent
with the Cable Act, all such fees shall not constitute or be credited towards a
grantee’s franchise fee obligations. Reasonable costs include staff time,
professional fees, and administrative costs as determined by the town to be
necessary.
   (C)   The town reserves the right, unless prohibited by applicable law, to
require a grantee to pay the reasonable costs of the franchise renewal and
negotiation process. Reasonable costs include staff time, professional fees,
and administrative costs determined by the town to be necessary and generally
will not exceed $7,500, the payment of which shall not be treated as a
franchise related cost or passed through to subscribers.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.26 SYSTEM DESIGN.
   (A)   Every grantee shall offer service that meets the current and future
needs of the town, taking into account the costs of meeting those needs. The

including the general design and capabilities of the system to identify for the
town how the system will meet the current and future cable service needs of the
town.
   (B)   State-of-the-art review. The grantee shall ensure that cable service
and the cable system is compatible with changes in law, technology, and
programming and services to maintain a state-of-the-art system throughout the
franchise term in accordance with the provisions contained in the franchise
agreement.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)

§ 117.28 DROPS TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Every grantee shall provide installation of at least one cable drop
and provide monthly CPST service, without charge, to public buildings in
accordance with the line extension policies of this chapter, or as otherwise
specified in the applicable franchise agreement. Schools shall also receive one
cable drop and monthly CPST service at no charge. Following the town’s
designation of additional public buildings(s) to receive cable service, and
upon the town’s request, a grantee shall complete construction of the drop and
outlet within 30 days to that new building.
   (B)   All such cable service outlets shall not be utilized for commercial
purposes.
   (C)   In instances where the drop to the public building exceeds 150 feet,
the grantee may charge for the actual and reasonable cost of its labor and

   The town shall have the right to install and maintain town equipment upon
the poles and conduit owned by the grantee, at the actual cost of the space and
on terms mutually agreeable to the town and the grantee. Installed town
equipment shall not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the cable
system. The town shall relinquish its use of such poles and conduit upon 90
days’ notice from grantee that town’s use interferes with the grantee’s actual
or anticipated use of same.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.30 UPGRADE OF SYSTEM.
   Every grantee shall upgrade its system (herein referred to as the “system
upgrade”), if required, as set forth in its respective franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.31 NON-DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO CABLE SYSTEM.
   Grantee may be required to allow non- discriminatory access to its cable
system if such shall be required by federal law. Prior to the enactment of any
such requirement, a grantee shall be provided with reasonable notice and an
opportunity to be heard, including the right to present evidence with respect
to the need for such a requirement. Grantee reserves, and has not waived, any
right it may have, or may later be determined to have, to challenge the town’s
implementation of an open access requirement.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.32 INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK, ACCESS CHANNELS.
   (A)   Every grantee may, to the extent required by the franchise agreement,
provide institutional networks as a condition of an initial grant or renewal,
or transfer of a franchise. To the extent that a grantee is obligated to
provide such support pursuant to its franchise agreement, such obligation will
be implemented in a competitively neutral manner, on a per subscriber basis
with respect to any other franchises granted after the adoption of this
chapter. Costs associated with construction and operation of an I-Net shall not
be a franchise fee unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement.
   (B)   Every grantee may provide a channel or channels, bandwidth capacity,
service, and funding for public, educational, and government (“PEG”) access

law.
   (C)   Oversight and administration of the PEG access channel(s) shall be set

corporation or similar entity to administer one or more of the PEG access
channel(s).

hours all books, records, maps, plans, financial records, service complaint
logs, performance test results, and other like materials of the grantee kept or
maintained by grantee or under its control concerning the operations, finances,

   Attached as Appendix A are the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)
customer service standards with which grantee must comply.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.42 PARENTAL CONTROL.
   Every grantee shall make available to any subscriber upon request a
“lockout” device for blocking both video and audio portions of any channel(s)
of programming entering the subscriber’s premises. Such device shall be
provided at a reasonable charge, except to the extent that federal law
specifically provides otherwise. The grantee may, however, require a reasonable
security deposit for the use of such a device. This section shall not apply to
channels that are on the basic or expanded basic tier of programming unless the
subscriber receives service via a programmable terminal device, such as a
converter.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.43 INSTALLATIONS EXCEEDING STANDARD INSTALLATION.
   Service drops in excess of 150 feet and concealed wiring in the home shall
be charged to the subscriber based upon time and material. The desire of the
subscriber as to the point of entry into the residence shall be observed
whenever possible. Runs in building interiors shall be as unobtrusive as
possible. The grantee shall use due care in the process of installation and
shall repair any damage to the subscriber’s property caused by said
installation. Such restoration shall be undertaken within no more than ten days
after the damage is incurred and shall be completed as soon as possible
thereafter.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.44 SERVICE AREA AND LINE EXTENSION POLICY.
   (A)   No grantee may discriminate in the build-out of its system to a
particular area of the town in providing service to an individual or groups of
residents on the basis of race, creed, religion, or economic condition. Unless
the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall serve all areas
of the town equally. Unless the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every
grantee shall extend service to commercial areas at no additional cost.
   (B)   During the initial construction phase of a new system, a grantee may
implement its system in stages pursuant to a schedule and line extension policy
established in its franchise agreement that serves all areas of the town
equally, provided that any deviation from the service and line extension
requirements of this chapter do not discriminate between different areas of the
town on the basis of race, creed, religion, or economic condition. A grantee of
any such new franchise shall comply with all customer service obligations with
respect to customers whose premises are passed by portions of the grantee’s
network that are fully activated, tested, and available for service.
   (C)   Cost-sharing. In newly annexed areas with less than 20 homes per
proposed cable mile, grantee shall offer a cost- sharing arrangement to
residents. Grantee shall bear its pro rata share of the current construction
costs based upon the actual number of homes per mile. The cost-sharing
arrangement shall consist of the following: on the request of a resident
desiring service, grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and
cost analysis to determine the cost of the plant extension required to provide
service to the resident from the closest usable point on the cable system. The
cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: if a
request for extension into a residential area requires the construction of
cable plant which does not pass at least 20 homes per cable mile, a
proportionate share of construction costs shall be borne by grantee and by the
subscribers. For example, if there are ten dwelling units per mile, grantee’s
share will equal 10/20ths of the construction cost. The remaining cost will be
shared equally by each subscriber in the area to be constructed. The line
extension formula shall also be applied to a portion of a cable mile meeting
proportionate density requirements. For example, if there are ten dwelling
units per one-half mile, the grantee shall construct the plant. The cost
sharing described above would be utilized if there were less than the
proportionate share of dwelling units per the portion of a mile needed to reach
the dwelling units. Should additional subscribers request cable service,
subscribers utilizing the cost-sharing plan for extension shall be reimbursed
pro rata for their contribution or a proportional share thereof. In such case,
the pro rata shares shall be recalculated and each new subscriber shall pay the
new pro rata share, and all prior subscribers shall receive refunds. In any
event, at the end of 24 months from completion of the project, the subscribers
are no longer eligible for refunds, and the amounts paid by subscribers will be
credited to the plant account of the grantee. The average cost of the line
extension shall be recalculated annually based upon the current costs of labor
and material. Each subscriber contributing toward the direct cost of the line
extension shall waive all ownership interest in the line extension. All
equipment and components of the line extension, including but not limited to
cable wire, electronics, and pedestals, shall at all times remain the exclusive
property of the grantee.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.45 TOWN MONITORING.
   In addition to free cable service required by the chapter, grantee shall
provide one service feed to Town Hall (unless otherwise specified by town) that
shall receive without charge all basic and expanded basic cable programming
provided by grantee. Such service shall be provided in such a manner that the
town may monitor the programming and use of the cable system for compliance
with the franchise agreement and this chapter. The service provided pursuant to
this requirement shall be in a secure office location, and not in a location
open to public viewing.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.46 ACCESS TO INSIDE WIRING.
   Access to, and ownership of, inside wiring shall be in accordance with
Section 7117.800 et. seq. of the FCC rules and regulations as the same may be
amended from time to time.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
ARTICLE III: CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
§ 117.47 RIGHT-OF-WAY CONSTRUCTION.
   Prior to commencing any construction in the town, a grantee must obtain all
necessary permits and licenses required by federal, state, and generally
applicable town laws, ordinances, and rules and pay all associated non-
discriminatory fees. Further, a grantee shall comply with all applicable laws,
ordinances, rules, and standards relating to the construction, operation, and
maintenance of a cable system.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.48 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.
   The construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be
effectuated by grantee in a manner that is consistent with the laws,
ordinances, and construction standards of the state, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, the National Electrical Safety Code, National
Electrical Code, and the FCC to the extent applicable, as well as all other
laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances that are generally applicable and
promulgated pursuant to the town’s lawful police power. All open connections on
splitters, couplers, and other devices shall be properly terminated.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.49 MINIMUM INTERFERENCE.
   All of grantee’s construction, installation, operation, repair, and
maintenance and the arrangement of its lines, cables, and other appurtenances
on public or private property shall be conducted in such a manner as to not
unreasonably interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of property
owners that may be affected. In the event such work is not in accordance with
applicable rules and regulations, the town may require the removal, within such
period of time after notice as is reasonable under the circumstances, of
grantee’s lines, cables, and appurtenances from the rights-of-way in question,
at the sole expense of the grantee.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.50 REPAIR OF PROPERTY.
   Grantee shall promptly repair and restore any town or private property that
may be damaged as a result of the construction, installation, operation,
repair, maintenance, or removal of the cable system. Any such property damaged
or destroyed shall be promptly repaired and restored by grantee, at grantee’s
sole cost and expense, to the reasonable satisfaction of the town to its
condition prior to being damaged or shall be replaced by grantee with
equivalent property. The town may inspect and approve the condition of the
right-of- ways and cables, wires, attachments, and poles after restoration. The
liability, indemnity, insurance, and performance bond as provided herein shall
continue in full force and effect during the period of any removal and until
the grantee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter
and the franchise agreement. In the event of a failure by the grantee to
complete any restoration work required by the town within the time as may be
established by the town and to the reasonable satisfaction of the town, the
town may, following reasonable notice to the grantee, cause such work to be
done, and the grantee shall reimburse the town the cost thereof within 30 days
after receipt of an itemized list of such costs, or the town may at its option
recover such costs through the performance bond provided by grantee. The town
shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions
of this section.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.51 ERECTION OF POLES.
   Grantee shall not erect any pole on or along any rights-of-way in an
existing aerial utility system without the advance written approval of the
town. If additional poles in an existing aerial route are required, grantee
shall negotiate, as needed, with the owners thereof for the installation of the
needed poles. Grantee shall negotiate the lease of pole space and facilities
from the existing pole owners for all aerial construction, under mutually
acceptable terms and conditions.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.52 RESERVATIONS OF STREET RIGHTS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the town from
constructing storm or sanitary sewers, grading, paving, repairing, or altering
any rights-of-way, or laying down, repairing, or removing water mains, traffic
signal control systems, town fiber plant, or constructing or establishing any
public utility, service, or other public work that the town may operate or
undertake now or in the future. All such work shall be done, insofar as
practicable, in such manner as not to obstruct, injure, or prevent the free use
and operation of poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes, or appurtenances of
grantee. If town in its reasonable judgment shall determine that grantee’s
facilities interfere with the construction, location, or repair of any rights-
of-way or public improvement, then all such facilities of grantee shall be
removed or replaced, or temporarily disconnected, in such manner as shall be
directed by the town so that the same shall not interfere with the public works
of the town. Such removal or replacement shall be at the expense of grantee,
provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall preclude grantee from
seeking reimbursement for removal or replacement costs from any public funds
generally available to rights-of-way users for the reimbursement of such costs.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.53 UNDERGROUND INSTALLATION.
   In those areas within the town where cable television, telephone, or
electrical facilities are currently placed underground, all cable system
facilities shall remain or be placed underground. In areas where either
telephone or electric utility facilities are above ground at the time of
installation, grantee may install its cable system facilities above ground,
provided that at such time as both electric and telephone utility facilities
are placed underground, grantee shall likewise place its cable system
facilities underground without cost to the town. Nothing contained in this
section shall require a grantee to construct, operate, and maintain underground
any ground-mounted appurtenances, except that grantee shall take steps to
minimize the number and visual impact of such facilities. If the grantor
reimburses any utility for such relocation, grantee shall be similarly
reimbursed. This section shall not prevent the town or any of its agencies or
joint agencies from requiring the installation or relocation of cable services
facilities underground pursuant to a separate ordinance or regulation or
requirement imposed in accordance with the exercise of the general police power
or regulatory function of such agency or joint agency.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.54 CONDUIT.
   (A)   The town shall not be responsible for any cuts or damage to buried or
underground facilities of a grantee that are not clearly marked or cannot be
located through the state “one-call” service.
   (B)   Grantee shall provide strand and trench maps without detailed
measurement, calculations in a format mutually agreeable to both the town and
grantee. Such information shall be subject to and not restrict any other town
ordinances. Town agrees to treat the maps as proprietary information to the
extent provided under law, or as may be indicated in town ordinances.
   (C)   Grantee shall provide a contact number for the town to call in
emergency situations requiring an immediate response on the part of the town.
If the grantee does not properly and effectively identify the precise location
of its facilities within a reasonable period of time, taking into account the
circumstance of an emergency call from the town, the town shall not be
responsible for damage to the grantee’s facilities.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.55 CLEARING POLES AND CABLES.
   Grantee shall have the right to remove, trim, and cut and to keep clear of
its poles, cables, underground conduits, and related equipment the trees in and
along the rights-of-way, but, in the exercise of such right, grantee shall not
cut such trees to any greater extent than is reasonably necessary for the
construction, erection, installation, maintenance, and use of cable system
equipment. Except in emergency situations, grantee shall not remove, trim, or
cut such trees from any rights-of-way without first providing reasonable
written notice to the town of its intention to do so, such notice to be
delivered not less than ten days in advance. No clearing may go forward without
written approval from town. Town agrees to use its best efforts to provide such
written approval no later than 48 hours in advance of the scheduled clearing.
Town may, at its discretion, have town staff observe the scheduled clearing.
Such personnel are authorized to stop all clearing activities if it appears to
such staff that the clearing exceeds the authority granted by town or for other
good and sufficient reasons. The grantee shall compensate the town or any
private owners of such trees for any damage proximately caused by grantee’s
negligent conduct.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.56 MOVING FACILITIES.
   Grantee, on the request of the town, or any person holding a building permit
issued by the town, or any permit issued by an appropriate state agency, shall
temporarily move its wires, cables, poles, or other cable system facilities to
permit the moving of large objects, vehicles, buildings, or other structures.
The expense of such temporary moves shall be paid to grantee by the person
requesting the same, and grantee shall have the authority to require such
payment in advance. Grantee shall be given not less than 30 days advance notice
to arrange for such temporary moves.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.57 WORK PERFORMED BY OTHERS.
   To the extent applicable, all provisions of this chapter shall apply to any
subcontractors or others performing any work or services pursuant to the
provisions of a franchise agreement on behalf of a grantee.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.58 DUTY TO GRANTEE.
   Nothing contained in this chapter shall relieve any person from liability
arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring
grantee’s facilities while performing any work connected with grading,
regrading, or changing the line of any rights-of-way or with the construction
or reconstruction of any sewer or water system or utility system.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.59 SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION CAPABILITIES AND SCHEDULE.
   (A)   The cable system shall generally conform to the system design and
channel capacity specifications set forth by the grantee in its application for
a franchise submitted to the town. The grantee is permitted to modify its
design and implementation plan, pursuant to the conditions provided herein, to
accommodate technological innovations and refinements, which enhance system
reliability and capacity.
   (B)   The initial construction required under initial franchise agreement
shall be completed in compliance with a schedule specified therein. If the
grantee shows, notwithstanding its due diligence, that it has been unable to
extend service to a specified area because the acts or omissions of a third
party (excluding the grantee’s subcontractors or agents) or that other factors
have caused a delay in construction beyond that reasonably expected during the
course of construction, and the grantee proposes a reasonable alternative
deadline for extension of service to that area, the town shall grant reasonable
extensions of time to complete construction.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
ARTICLE IV: GENERAL FINANCIAL ANDINSURANCEPROVISIONS
§ 117.60 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   The administration of this chapter or the franchise agreement imposes
upon the town additional regulatory responsibility and expense, and in
consideration of permission to use the rights-of-way of the town for the
construction, operation, and maintenance of a cable system within the town, a
grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the town a franchise fee in an
amount as designated in the franchise agreement, up to the maximum amount
allowed by applicable law. To the extent that applicable law changes the
maximum authorized franchise fee, the town reserves the right to change the
franchise fee as stated in the franchise agreement, by adopting an ordinance
establishing the new franchise fee rate and allowing reasonable notice to the
grantee for administration of the change. The town shall hold a public hearing
prior to adopting any change in the franchise fee.
   (B)   Payments due grantor under this section shall be computed quarterly,
for the preceding quarter. Each quarterly payment shall be due and payable no
later than 30 days after the end of the preceding quarter. Each payment shall
be accompanied by a brief report by a grantee showing the basis for the
computation and a “franchise fee worksheet” listing all of the sources of
revenues attributable to the operation of grantee’s system in the town. All
such payments shall be certified as correct by an officer of the grantee.
   (C)   No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the
amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment
be construed as a release of any claim grantor may have for further sums
payable under the provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement. All
amounts paid shall be subject to audit and re-computation by grantor or its
designee at any time during any calendar year (but not more than once per
calendar year) upon 20 calendar day’s notice, which shall include a request for
any documents sought to be reviewed. Audits shall be at the expense of the
grantee if the additional amount due is greater than 10% of the amount paid.
Any additional amount due to the town as a result of the audit shall be paid
within 60 days following written notice to the grantee by the town which notice
shall include a copy of the audit report. Grantor’s right to audit and
grantee’s obligation to retain records related to the franchise fee audit shall
expire three years from the date on which the most recent franchise fee payment
by the grantee was due from the time of written notice of request of audit.
   (D)   In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not
made on or before the dates specified herein, grantee shall pay as additional
compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual
rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the town’s primary
depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.61 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   Each grantee shall maintain a performance bond with the town to ensure
compliance with this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, in an
amount and in a manner as set forth in the grantee’s franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.62 PENALTIES PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Whenever grantor has reason to believe that a grantee has violated any
material provision of a franchise agreement or this chapter, grantor shall
first notify the grantee of the material violation and demand correction within
a reasonable time, which shall not be less than 20 days in the case of the
failure of a grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the grantor under a
franchise agreement, and 30 days in all other cases. If a grantee fails to
correct the violation within the time prescribed, or if a grantee is unable to
correct the violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time
prescribed and to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee
shall then be given written notice of not less than 20 days for public comment.
Said notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the violation alleged to
have occurred.
   (B)   At the public hearing, the Board shall hear and consider all relevant
evidence and thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence.
Any such hearing must, at a minimum, provide the grantee a full and fair
opportunity to be heard by the Board.
   (C)   In the event the Board finds that a grantee has corrected the
violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice
thereof from grantor and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the violation
or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no
penalty or other sanction shall be imposed.
   (D)   In the event the Board finds that a violation exists and that a
grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or did not promptly
commence and diligently proceed to correct the violation, the Board may impose
liquidated damages to be collected from the security fund, as set out in the
franchise agreement.
   (E)   If the Board elects to assess liquidated damages, then such election
shall constitute grantor’s exclusive remedy for a period of 60 days.
Thereafter, if a grantee remains in non-compliance, the grantor may pursue any
other available remedy.
   (F)   In the event that a franchise is cancelled or terminated by reason of
the default of a grantee, the security fund deposited pursuant to a franchise
agreement shall remain in effect and be available to the grantor until all
pending claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point any
remaining amounts in the security fund shall revert to the grantee.
   (G)   The rights reserved to grantor with respect to the security fund are
in addition to all other rights of grantor, whether reserved by a franchise
agreement, this chapter, or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or
exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other
right grantor may have.
   (H)   In instances of repeated violations, whether remedied or not, the
grantor shall serve special notice outlining additional remediation
requirements. Failure to cure, as measured by repeated instances of the same
violation, is evidence of an evasive practice and may lead to revocation under
§117.64.
   (I)   Grantee acknowledges that non- compliance with the provisions of the
franchise agreement and this chapter will harm subscribers and the town and
that the amounts of actual damages will be difficult or impossible to
ascertain. The town may therefore assess the following liquidated damages
against grantee for unexcused non- compliance with the requirements of the
franchise agreement and this chapter.
   Grantee acknowledges that the liquidated damages set forth below are a
reasonable approximation of actual damages and that this provision is intended
to provide compensation and is not a penalty. All damages provided shall be
cumulative, unless expressly stated.
      (1)   For failure to materially complete construction or extend service
in accordance with the chapter and the franchise agreement: $250 per calendar
day for each day the violation continues;
      (2)   For failure to materially comply with requirements for public
access channels: $250 per calendar day for each day the violation continues;
      (3)   For failure to pay franchise fees in accordance with this chapter/
franchise agreement: $100 per calendar day for each day the violation
continues, plus interest computed on the unpaid amount computed at the current
bank rate of interest.;
      (4)   For repeated, willful, or continuing failure to submit reports,
maintain records, or provide documents or information: $50 per calendar day for
each day the violation continues;
      (5)   For failure to comply with the material requirements of the
customer service standards: $50 per calendar quarter the violation continues;
      (6)   For failure to comply with the transfer provisions: $250 per
calendar day for each day the violation continues;
      (7)   For violation of other material provisions of the chapter and the
franchise agreement: $50 per calendar day for each day the violation continues.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.63 BONDS, INDEMNIFICATION, AND INSURANCE.
   Each grantee shall maintain bonds and insurance with the town in amounts and
in a manner as set forth in the grantee’s franchise agreement. Each grantee
also shall be required to indemnify the town in a manner as set forth in the
grantee’s franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.64 GROUNDS FOR REVOCATION.
   Grantor reserves the right to revoke the franchise, and all rights and
privileges pertaining thereto, in the event that:
   (A)   A grantee substantially violates any material provision of this
chapter or a franchise agreement;
   (B)   A grantee attempts to evade any of the material provisions of this
chapter or a franchise agreement;
   (C)   A grantee practices an act of fraud or deceit upon the grantor;
   (D)   A grantee becomes insolvent, unable, or unwilling to pay its debts or
is adjudged bankrupt;
   (E)   A grantee fails to provide or maintain in full force and effect the
liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond as required
pursuant to its franchise; or
   (F)   A grantee violates any orders or rulings of any regulatory body having
jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this chapter or the franchise and,
after notice thereof, shall continue the violation and not remedy the same
within 60 days.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.65 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Whenever grantor has reason to believe that there may be grounds for
revocation of a franchise, grantor shall first notify the grantee in writing of
its basis for believing grounds for revocation exist. Such notice shall
indicate with reasonable specificity the grounds for revocation that are
believed to exist so that the grantee may have a reasonable opportunity to cure
or otherwise address the same. If a grantee fails to adequately cure or address
the purported grounds for revocation within 30 days of such notice, then the
grantor may, upon 30 days written notice to the grantee, commence a public
administrative hearing to determine whether there exists any ground for
revocation.
   (B)   The administrative hearing shall be conducted so as to protect the
full due process rights of the parties and provide for, at a minimum, the right
to have counsel, the right to call and cross examine witnesses, and the right
to a full transcript of the proceedings.
   (C)   After the close of the hearing, grantor or the designated hearing
officer shall issue a written decision based on the record of the proceedings,
stating with specificity the findings and reasons supporting the decision.
   (D)   Upon revocation, a grantee shall have a period of 120 days subsequent
to the date of the formal adoption of a revocation of the franchise by the town
within which to file an appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (E)   During the appeal period, the franchise shall remain in full force and
effect.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.66 FORECLOSURE.
   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a part of a system, a
grantee shall notify grantor of such fact, and such notification shall be
treated as a notification that a change in control of the grantee has taken
place, and the provisions of this chapter governing the consent to transfer or
change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change
in ownership occurred.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.67 RECEIVERSHIP.
   Apart from and supplemental to the right to revoke a franchise, grantor
shall have the right to cancel a franchise agreement 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of a
grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action
or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
   (A)   Within 120 days after its election or appointment, the receiver or
trustee has fully complied with all the provisions of grantee’s franchise
agreement and this chapter and remedied all defaults thereunder; and
   (B)   Such receiver or trustee, within said 120 days, has executed an
agreement, duly approved by a court having jurisdiction, whereby such receiver
or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this
chapter and the applicable franchise agreement.

§ 117.68 PURCHASE BY GRANTOR UPON TERMINATION OR REVOCATION OF FRANCHISE.
   The grantor may, in accordance with and to the extent permitted by 47 U.S.C.
§547, upon the payment of a fair valuation, purchase, condemn, acquire, take
over, and hold the property and plant of a grantee, in whole or in part, on the
following conditions:
   (A)   Upon revocation of a franchise, a fair valuation shall be an equitable
value that shall not include any sum attributable to the value of the franchise
itself, and plant and property shall be valued according to its book value at
the time of revocation, or the system’s initial cost less depreciation and
salvage.
   (B)   At the expiration of a franchise agreement and following a denial of
renewal of the franchise agreement, a fair valuation shall be the fair market
value of the plant and property, exclusive of the value attributed to the
franchise itself.
   (C)   In the event grantor shall acquire a franchise pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement, and commenced operation of
the system, grantor shall reimburse the grantee for the fair market value of
the system.
(Ord. 1497, passed 2-22-06)
§ 117.69 SALE OR TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   No grantee shall sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose of,
in whole or in part; an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system
or any of the rights or privileges granted by a franchise agreement, without
the prior consent of the grantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably
denied or delayed and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the
grantor that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical, or financial
qualifications to consummate the transaction and operate the system so as to
perform its obligations under this chapter and the applicable franchise
agreement. This section shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in
the normal course of business. Consent from the grantor shall not be required
for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in
whole or in part, to secure indebtedness, or for a transfer to a person
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a grantee.
   (B)   The following additional events shall be deemed to be a sale,
assignment, or other transfer of an interest in or control of a grantee or its
franchise or cable system requiring compliance with this section: (i) the sale,
assignment, or other transfer of all or a majority of a grantee’s assets; (ii)
the sale, assignment, or other transfer of capital stock or partnership,
membership, or other equity interests in a grantee by one or more of its
existing shareholders, partners, members, or other equity owners so as to
create a new controlling interest in a grantee; (iii) the issuance of

the grantee and the town agree to an extension of the 120-day period.

GENERAL BUILDING REQUIREMENTS AND FEDERAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM
§ 151.065 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of
Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5 and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of
Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local
governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Ord. 1503, passed 3-23-06; Am. Ord. 1515, passed 8-24-06)
§ 151.066 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. 1503, passed 3-23-06)
§ 151.067 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 1503, passed 3-23-06)
§ 151.068 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this subchapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (that is, water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
   (G)   To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a
special flood hazard area.

alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
      (2)   The cost of repair from damage or destruction resulting from a
natural disaster shall be determined by the Building Inspector. The Building
Inspector shall do so by comparing the insurance claim awarded for repairs to
the structure resulting from such damage or destruction with the estimated cost
of such repairs provided by the contractor or property owner. In such event,
the larger of the two amounts shall be deemed the cost of repair, subject to
the provisions of this subdivision. Insurance claims awarded for contents
coverage shall not be included in determining the cost of repair. In the event
no insurance award is made in connection with damage or destruction from a
natural disaster, any property owner wishing to make repairs to a damaged
structure shall be required to fill out the substantial improvement/substantial
damage application forms available in the office of the Building Inspector in
order to determine the cost of repair from damage or destruction. In both
circumstances (where there is or is not an insurance claim awarded), the
Building Inspector may also consider the prevailing cost within the town for
such repairs at the time the repairs are undertaken. In addition, the property
owner may be required to provide other information as required by the Building
Inspector to substantiate the cost of repair from damage or destruction.
      (3)   The cost of repairs, reconstruction, improvements, or additions to
a structure in situations other than those resulting from a natural disaster
will be determined by the Building Inspector. Such determination shall be based
on the estimated cost provided by the contractor or property owner, subject to
the provisions of this subdivision. The Building Inspector may also consider
the prevailing cost within the town for such repairs, reconstruction,
improvements, or additions at the time such work is undertaken. In addition,
the property owner may be required to provide other information as required by
the Building Inspector to substantiate the cost of such repairs,
reconstruction, improvements, or addition.
      (4)   Structures designated by the town as historic landmarks are
excluded from the provisions of this section, provided that the repairs,
reconstruction, improvements, or additions to such structure do not prevent the
structure’s continued designation as a historic landmark.
   "VARIANCE."    A grant of relief from the requirements of this subchapter.
   "VIOLATION." The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s flood plain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required under §
151.078 through §
151.088 of this subchapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as
that documentation is provided.
   "WATER SURFACE ELEVATION." The height, in relation to mean sea level of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.
   "WATERCOURSE." A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other

reference level elevation, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit
to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the
reference level, in relation to mean sea level. Any work done within the 14-day
calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at the
permit holder’s risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate
data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to further work being permitted to proceed.
Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required corrections
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
         (c)   A final as-built elevation certificate (FEMA form 81-31) is
required after construction is completed and prior to certificate of
compliance/occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of final as- built
construction of the elevation of the reference level and all attendant
utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy.
         (d)   All new or substantially improved structures shall be certified
by a registered engineer that the construction shall be securely anchored to
adequately anchored pilings or columns in order to withstand velocity waters
and hurricane wave wash as required. All engineering certification shall be in
writing and bear the engineer’s seal and signature. All engineering
certifications shall comply with standard ASTM D-698.
      (2)   Floodproofing certificate. If nonresidential floodproofing is used
to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a floodproofing
certificate (FEMA form 81-65), with supporting data and an operational plan, is
required prior to the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a
certification of the floodproofed design elevation of the reference level and
all attendant utilities, in relation to mean sea level. Floodproofing
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
professional engineer or architect and certified by same. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data and plan. Deficiencies detected
by such review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit approval.
Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required corrections
shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to construct in
accordance with the certified design shall be cause to withhold the issuance of
a certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (3)   If a manufactured home is placed within Zone A, AO, AE, or Al—30
and the elevation of the chassis is more than 36 inches in height above grade,
an engineered foundation certification is required per §151.083(D).
      (4)   If a watercourse is to be altered or relocated, a description of
the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation; a professional engineer’s
certified report on the effects of the proposed project on the flood-carrying
capacity of the watercourse and the effects to properties located both upstream
and downstream; and a map showing the location of the proposed watercourse
alteration or relocation shall all be submitted by the permit applicant prior
to issuance of a floodplain development permit.
      (5)   Certification exemptions. The following structures, if located
within Zone A, AO, AE, or A1—30, are exempt from the elevation/floodproofing
certification requirements specified in items (1) and (2) of this subsection:

   (I)   Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction,
or replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of
this subchapter and located totally or partially within the floodway, non-
encroachment area, or stream setback, provided that there is no additional
encroachment below the regulatory flood protection elevation in the floodway,
non-encroachment area, or stream setback, and provided that such repair,
reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this
subchapter.
   (J)   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in § 151.081(N). A structure or
tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an allowed use or to the
operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater treatment facility may be
located in a special flood hazard area only if the structure or tank is either
elevated or floodproofed to at least the regulatory flood protection elevation
and certified according to § 151.078(C) of this subchapter.
   (K)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   (L)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
   (M)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (N)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have

§ 151.083 SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in § 151.071, or § 151.079(J) and (K), the
following provisions, in addition to § 151.082, are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in § 151.069 of this subchapter.
   (B)   Coastal high hazard areas; nonconforming uses; development.
      (1)   Within those areas designated as coastal high hazard areas by the
flood maps, all nonconforming uses on land below the 100-year flood level shall
not be expanded.
      (2)   Within those areas designated as coastal high hazard areas by the
flood maps, no land below the level of the 100-year flood elevation shall be
developed unless the new construction or substantial improvement shall:
         (a)   Be located landward of the reach of the mean high tide. No man-
made alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands shall be permitted within the
V Zones as shown on the town’s flood insurance rate map which would increase
potential flood damage.
         (b)   Be elevated on adequately anchored piles or columns and must be
protected from hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. The bottom of the lowest supporting structural member, exclusive of
piles, is at or above the applicable 100-year flood level which shall be
adjusted for wave height in appropriate zones. The use of fill material for
structural support of buildings shall be prohibited within the V zones as shown
on the town’s flood insurance rate map.
         (c)   Have no basement and have the space below the lowest floor free
of obstructions so that the impact of abnormally high tides or wind driven
water is minimized except as described in §
151.083(A).
   (C)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non- residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.069 of this subchapter. Structures located in A, AE and A1—30 Zones may be
floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation,
provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing
elevation shall be in accordance with §
151.085(A). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in §
151.078(C), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
   (D)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New or replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the
reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
151.069 of this subchapter.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by engineer certification, or in accordance with the most current edition of
the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured Homes, adopted by the
Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15 or a certified
engineered foundation. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an
elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the
chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When
the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering
certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of § 151.083(E)(1), (2), and (3).
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local emergency management coordinator.
   (E)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed areas of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which are below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials, up to
the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE, and A1—30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to enter and exit
automatically;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      (4)   Shall allow, in coastal high hazard areas (Zones VE and V1—30),
breakaway walls, open wood latticework, or insect screening, provided that it
is not part of the structural support of the building and is designed so as to
breakaway, under abnormally high tides or wave action, without causing damage
to the structural integrity of the building, provided that the following design
specifications are met:
         (a)   Material shall consist of open wood latticework or insect
screening; or
         (b)   Breakaway walls shall meet the following design specifications:
            1.   Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall be not less
than ten nor more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
            2.   Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance
of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by state or
local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of
the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-
structural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with the
base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the North
Carolina State Building Code.
   (F)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more
nonconforming than the existing structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Where an independent perimeter load-bearing wall is provided
between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall be
considered a separate building and only the addition must comply with the
standards for new construction.
   (G)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or
      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
   (H)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood, or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified should not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (that is, minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (I)   Accessory structures.
      (1)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be
placed within a special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met:
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas);
         (b)   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
         (c)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
         (d)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
         (e)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
§ 151.082(A);
         (f)   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in
accordance with § 151.082(D); and
         (g)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation in conformance with § 151.083(E)(3).
      (2)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet
that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or
floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with § 151.078(C).
   (J)   New or replacement water and sewer systems. Within those areas
designated as special flood hazard areas by the flood maps, all new or
replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems, including on-
site systems shall be designed, located, and constructed so as to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters. If in the opinion of town officials the conditions
warrant such action, certification may be required from a professional engineer
who is registered in the state that the systems mentioned are so designed.
   (K)   Water to air heat pumps.
      (1)   Any property owner may make application for construction of wells,
not for the purpose of or to be used for human consumption, to supply water for
and dispose of water from water to air heat pumps. Such wells shall have a
maximum depth of 40 feet. The property owner shall acquire a building permit
before commencing construction of the wells and shall submit all supporting
documents required by the Building Inspector.
      (2)   The line supplying water to the heat pump shall be equipped with a
filter and be capable of supplying 125% of the rated capacity of the system. It
shall be the responsibility of the property owner to dispose of all water from
water to air heat pumps by means of a separate well of a depth not to exceed 40
feet. This disposal system shall consist of a disposal line the minimum size of
which shall be two inches in diameter. The disposal line shall contain a
strainer. In no case may water from the heat pump be disposed of in sewer
lines, storm drains, or estuarine waters.

§ 151.084 COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREAS (ZONES VE).
   Coastal high hazard areas are special flood hazard areas established in §
151.071, and designated as Zones VE. These areas have special flood hazards
associated with high velocity waters from storm surges or seismic activity and,
therefore, in addition to meeting all requirements of this subchapter, the
following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   All development shall:
      (1)   Be located landward of the reach of mean high tide;
      (2)   Be located landward of the first line of stable natural vegetation;
and
      (3)   Comply with all applicable CAMA setback requirements.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated so
that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor
(excluding pilings or columns) is no lower than the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Floodproofing shall not be utilized on any structures in coastal
high hazard areas to satisfy the regulatory flood protection elevation
requirements.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space
below the lowest floor free of obstruction so as not to impede the flow of
flood waters, with the following exceptions:
      (1)   Open wood latticework or insect screening may be permitted below
the regulatory flood protection elevation for aesthetic purposes only and must
be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance
with §
151.083(E)(4)(a). Design plans shall be submitted in accordance with §
151.078(A)(4)(C)(2); or
      (2)   Breakaway walls may be permitted, provided that they meet the
criteria set forth in §
151.083(E)(4). Design plans shall be submitted in accordance with §
151.078(A)(4)(c)(1).
   (D)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be securely
anchored to pile or column foundations. All pilings and columns and the
structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all building components.
      (1)   Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base
flood.
      (2)   Wind loading values used shall be those required by the current
edition of the North Carolina State Building Code.
   (E)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
design, specifications, and plans for construction are in compliance with the
provisions contained in §
151.083, §
151.084(C)(1) and (2), §
151.084(D) and §
151.084(F) of this subchapter on the current version of the North Carolina
“National Flood Insurance Program V-Zone Certification” form.
   (F)   Fill shall not be used for structural support. Limited non-compacted
and non-stabilized fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for
landscaping/aesthetic purposes, provided that it is demonstrated through
coastal engineering analysis that the proposed fill would not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation and not cause any adverse impacts by wave
ramping and deflection to the subject structure or adjacent properties.
   (G)   There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase
potential flood damage.
   (H)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted except in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be
placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided
that the anchoring and elevation standards of this section have been satisfied.
   (I)   Recreational vehicles may be permitted in coastal high hazard areas,
provided that they meet the recreational vehicle criteria of § 151.083(G)(1)
and the temporary structure provisions of § 151.083(H).

§ 151.085 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO).
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 151.071 are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate. In addition to § 151.082, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall meet the following requirements:
   (A)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two feet
above the highest adjacent grade plus a freeboard of two feet if no depth
number is specified.
   (B)   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed
to the same level as required in § 151.085(A) so that the structure, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that level shall be
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as per §
151.078(C) and § 151.083(C).
   (C)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes,
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1201, it is hereby found and declared that
there exists in the town dwellings which are unfit for human habitation due to
dilapidation, defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents and other
calamities, lack of ventilation, light and sanitary facilities, and other
conditions rendering such dwellings unsafe or unsanitary, dangerous and
detrimental to the health and otherwise inimical to the welfare of the
residents of the town. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of
the residents of the town as authorized by G.S. 160D-1201 et seq. it is the
purpose of this article to establish minimum standards of fitness for the
initial and continued occupancy of all buildings used for human habitation, as
expressly authorized by G.S. 160D-1205.
   (B)   Furthermore, all projects concerning construction (erection,
alteration, and/or repair) are areas of environmental concern and shall be
treated as such. All of the concerns of the minimum housing code and technical
guidelines shall be considered as to their impact on the environment and every
effort shall be made by all concerned to preserve and maintain the environment
for our own protection, safety, and welfare, and for those generations yet
unborn.
(Ord., passed 1-22-77; Am. Ord. 1845, passed 6-22-23)
§ 152.002 SCOPE.
   (A)   This code is hereby declared to be remedial, and shall be construed to
secure the beneficial interests and purposes thereof through structural
strength, stability, sanitation, adequate light and ventilation, and safety to
life and property from fire and other hazards incidental to the construction,
alteration, repair, removal, demolition, use and occupancy of dwellings,
apartment houses, rooming houses or buildings, structures, or premises used as
such.
   (B)   The provisions of this code shall apply to all existing housing and to
all housing hereafter constructed within the town. Portable, mobile, or
demountable buildings or structures, including trailers, when used or intended
to be used for housing within the town shall be subject to the provisions of
this code.
   (C)   This chapter establishes minimum requirements for the initial and
continued occupancy of all buildings used for human habitation within the town.
   (D)   The construction or repair or alteration in any way of buildings
within the bounds and jurisdiction of the town comes under the codes and
standards of the following regulatory agencies: North Carolina State Building
Code (all volumes most recent edition and amendments), Fire Prevention Code
(most recent edition), Coastal Area Management Act, Federal Flood Insurance
Program, and the following additions or more stringent requirements adopted by
the town and approved as a part of the minimum housing code. No building may be
occupied without a proper occupancy permit.
   (E)   Plans and specifications for all structures not within the scope of
this code shall be submitted simultaneously to the North Carolina Department of

other environmentally concerned agencies. Permits for these structures will not
be issued until approval has been received from all concerned agencies.
   (F)   Building permits for structures estimated to cost in excess of $30,000
will be issued only to contractors licensed by the state and only when plans
and specifications for such bear the seal of a registered architect or
engineer. The seal is not a requirement for plans for one- and two-family
dwellings regardless of their estimated cost. In all construction special
attention should be paid to the North Carolina Uniform Residential Building
Code Appendix D: "Windstorm Resistive Construction".
   (G)   A building permit is valid for a period of time stated on said permit
or according to the State Building Code. Renewals or extensions of this time
limit shall be at the discretion of the Building Inspector, not to alter or
change those standards set by the North Carolina State Building Code.
   (H)   A building permit is required to erect, alter, repair, or demolish any

§ 152.116 PURPOSE.
   This subchapter is adopted to preserve and promote the protection of the
shore line of the town and environs within one mile of the corporate limits of
the town by maintaining the existence of natural or constructed dunes which

surrounding waters and storms for adjacent lands against the actions of sand,
wind, water, and people. The past practice of destroying the dunes constitutes
a serious threat to the safety of adjacent properties and people. This
subchapter is therefore adopted for the health, safety, and welfare of persons
living, visiting, or sojourning in the town and its environs within one mile of
the corporate limits of the town, and for the protection of public and private
property in those areas.

inspector shall have issued an order, ordering a dwelling to be repaired or
vacated and closed, as provided in subdivision (C)(1) of this section, and if
the dwelling has been vacated and closed for a period of one vear pursuant to
the ordinance or order, then if the town council shall find that the owner has
abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in
order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the
dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health,
safety, morals and welfare of the municipality in that the dwelling would
continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a
threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal
activities, would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of
property values in the area, and would render unavailable property and a
dwelling which might otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent
shortage of decent and affordable housing in this state, then in such
circumstances, the town council may, after the expiration of such one-year
period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth
the following:
      (1)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days; or
      (2)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days. Such ordinance shall be
recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county and shall be
indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner
fails to comply with this article, the inspector shall effectuate the purpose
of the ordinance.
      (3)   Appeals from orders of inspector. An appeal from any decision or
order of the inspector may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby or by any
officer, board or commission of the town. Any appeal from the inspector shall
be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service ofthe
order, and shall be taken by filing with the inspector and with the town board
of adjustment, hereinafter referred to as "board," a written notice of appeal
which shall specify in detail the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon
the filing of any notice of appeal, the inspector shall forthwith transmit to
the board all the paper constituting the record upon which the decision
appealed from was made. When appeal is from a decision of the inspector
refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision
shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a
decision of the inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the
appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by
the board, unless the inspector certifies to the board, after the notice of
appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate
(a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his
requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the
requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be
granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the
inspector, by the board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to
G.S. § 160D-1208 and subsection (F) of this section.
   (E)   The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals,
shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within
a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The
board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the decision or order
appealed from, and may make any decision and order as in its opinion ought to
be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have the powers of the
inspector, but the concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the board
shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the inspector.
The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where
there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of this subchapter, to adapt the application of
this subchapter to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of
this subchapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and
substantial justice done.
   (F)   Decision subject to review. Every decision of the board shall be
subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within
15 days of the decision of the board, but not otherwise, as provided in G.S. §
160D-1208. In addition, any person aggrieved bv an order issued by the
inspector or a decision rendered by the board shall also have the right, within
30 days after issuance of the order or rendering ofthe decision, to petition
the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the inspector pending
a final disposition ofthe cause, as provided bv G.S. 160D-1208.

PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
Section 155.1.1 Title.
   This Ordinance is officially titled as Unified Development Ordinance of
Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, and shall be known as the Unified
Development Ordinance (UDO). The official map designating the various zoning
districts shall be titled, Town of Wrightsville Beach Zoning Map, and shall be
known as the Zoning Map.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.1.2 Authority.
   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of
Chapter 143; Article 6 of Chapter 153A; Article 8 of Chapter 160A; and Article
7, 9, and 11 of Chapter 160D (Effective July 1, 2021) of the North Carolina
General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the authority to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (A)   Zoning. Zoning provisions enacted herein are under the authority of
North Carolina General Statutes N.C.G.S. § 160D-702, which extends to local
jurisdictions, the authority to enact regulations which promote the health,
safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community. It is further
authorized under N.C.G.S. § 160D-703, which authorizes local jurisdictions to
regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair or use of buildings, structures, or land. This section further
authorizes the establishment of overlay districts in which additional
regulations may be imposed upon properties that lie within the boundary of the
district. The statutes also require that all such regulations shall be uniform
for each class or type of building throughout each district, but that the
regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts.
   (B)   Subdivision. Subdivision provisions enacted herein are under the
authority of N.C.G.S. § 160D-801, which provide for the coordination of streets
within proposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and with other
public facilities, the dedication or reservation or recreation areas serving
residents of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision, or
alternatively, for the provision of funds to be used to acquire recreation
areas serving residents of more than one neighborhood in the immediate area,
and for the distribution of population and traffic in a manner that will avoid
congestion and overcrowding.
   (C)   Unified Development Ordinance. This UDO, which combines zoning and
subdivision authority, is further enacted under N.C.G.S. § 160D-103.
   (D)   Comprehensive or Land Use Plan Required. In accordance with N.C.G.S. §
160D-501(a), as a condition of adopting and applying zoning regulations,
Wrightsville Beach shall adopt and reasonably maintain a comprehensive or land
use plan. Such plans may be completed in conjunction with land use plans
required by the Coastal Area Management Act in N.C.G.S. § 113A-110. Further the
adoptions and update of these plans shall be in accordance with the procedures
required for a legislative decision, as outlined in Section
155.4.1.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.1.3 Purpose.
   This Unified Development Ordinance and Zoning Map are made in accordance
with a comprehensive and land use plan and is designed to lessen congestion in
the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to promote
health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent
the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to
facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, parks and
other public requirements; to control development of flood prone areas and
regulate stormwater runoff/discharge; to regulate signs; and to establish
proceedings for the subdivision of land. The regulations have been made with
reasonable consideration, among other things, as to the character of the
jurisdiction and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view
to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use
of land throughout the jurisdiction. Furthermore, the UDO will aim to:
   •   Continue utilization of the established mixed-use pattern of certain
portions of the community;
   •   Acknowledge and protect a character that is unique to Wrightsville
Beach;
   •   Protect existing housing and lodging opportunities;
   •   Protect the existing uses, densities, and intensities;
   •   Provide new investment and reinvestment opportunities;
   •   Ensure new development and redevelopment compliments and enhances
community character; and
   •   Implement thoughtful controlled growth.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.1.4 Applicability.
   155.1.4.1 Jurisdiction.
   (A)   The regulations set forth in this Ordinance shall apply to all

(Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.1.5 Conflicts with Other Regulations.
   It is not intended by this Ordinance to interfere with, abrogate, or annul
any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties. However, where
this Ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or
premises or upon the height of buildings or requires larger open spaces than
are imposed or required by other ordinances, rules, regulations, or by
easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of this Ordinance shall
govern.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.1.6 Deed Restrictions.
   The enforcement and interpretation of the UDO shall not be affected by deed
restrictions, covenants, or easements, other than those made as a condition of

other section, provision, standard, or district boundary of these regulations
except the provision in question. The other portions of these regulations not
affected by the decision of the court shall remain in full force and effect.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)

be prohibited.
   (B)   Building Restrictions. Every building hereafter erected or
structurally altered shall be located on a lot.
   (C)   Minimum Requirements. The provisions of this Ordinance shall be held

   155.1.8.2 Responsibility. In the event that any question arises concerning
the application of regulations, performance standards, definitions, development
criteria, or any other provision of the UDO, the UDO Administrator shall be
responsible for interpretation and shall look to the Ordinance for guidance.
Responsibility for interpretation by the UDO Administrator shall be limited to
standards, regulations and requirements of the UDO, but shall not be construed
to include interpretation of any technical codes adopted by reference in the
UDO, and shall not be construed as overriding the responsibilities given to any
commission, board, or official names in other sections or articles of the UDO.
   155.1.8.3 Delegation of Authority. Unless otherwise specified in the UDO,
the identification of certain officials, including the Town Manager, Planning &

   155.1.8.4 Computation of Time.
   (A)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, the time within which an act
is to be done shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last
day. If the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, that day shall be
excluded. When the period of time prescribed is less than seven days,
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be excluded.
   (B)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, whenever a person has the
right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the
service of a notice and the notice or paper is served by mail (Certified Mail/
Return Receipt Requested), three days shall be added to the prescribed period.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.1.9 Identification of Official Zoning Map.
   (A)   The Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor
attested by the Town Clerk and bearing the seal of the town under the following
words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the Unified
Development Ordinance, Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina," together with the
date of the adoption of this Ordinance.
   (B)   If, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, changes are
made in district boundaries or other items portrayed on the Zoning Map, such
changes shall be entered on the official zoning map promptly after the
amendment has been approved by the Board of Aldermen, with an entry on the
official zoning map denoting the date of amendment, description of amendment,
and signed by the Town Clerk. No amendment to this Ordinance which involves
matter portrayed on the official zoning map shall become effective until after
such change and entry has been made on said map.
   (C)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
Ordinance and state law. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person
shall be considered a violation of this Ordinance and punishable as provided
under Section
155.1.12.
   (D)   Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning
map which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map,
which shall be located in the office of the Town Clerk, shall be the final
authority as to the zoning status of land and water areas, buildings, and other
structures in the town.
   (E)   In the event the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost,
or difficult to interpret, the Board of Aldermen may by resolution adopt a new
official zoning map which shall supersede the prior zoning map. The new
official zoning map may correct drafting errors or other errors or omissions in
the prior official zoning map, but no correction shall have the effect of
amending the original official zoning map, or any subsequent amendment thereof.
The new official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor
attested by the Town Clerk, and bearing the seal of the town under the
following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes
and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of map being
replaced), as part of the Unified Development Ordinance, Wrightsville Beach,
North Carolina."
   (F)   Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost, or has been
totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining,
shall be preserved together with all other previous versions and available
records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.1.10 Zoning Map Interpretation.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the
Official Zoning Map, the UDO Administrator shall employ the following rules of
interpretation.
   (A)   Centerline. Where a boundary line lies within and follows a street or
alley right-of-way or utility easement, the boundary shall be construed to be
in the center of such street or alley right-of-way or utility easement. If the
boundary between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from
dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as following the
centerline of the abandoned or vacated road bed or utility easement.
   (B)   Edge Line. Where a boundary line follows the edge of a street or alley
right-of-way, a railroad right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary shall
be construed to be on the edge of such street or alley right-of-way, railroad
right-of-way, or utility easement. If such a street or alley right-of-way,
railroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary between two
separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the district
boundaries shall be construed as following the edge of the abandoned or vacated
road bed or utility easement.
   (C)   Lot Line. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines. In the event that a district
boundary line divides a lot or tract, each part of the lot or tract so divided
shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this Ordinance
for the district in which said part is located.
   (D)   Town Limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following town
limits shall be construed as following the town limits.
   (E)   Watercourses. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the
centerlines of streams, estuarine shorelines, oceanfront shorelines, canals,
lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
   (F)   Extensions. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of
street or alley rights- of-way, utility easements, lot lines, city limits,
county lines, or extraterritorial boundaries shall be so construed.
   (G)   Scaling. In the case where a district boundary does not coincide with
any boundary lines as above and no distances are described by specific
ordinance; the boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing
on the map.
   (H)   Where the UDO Administrator determines that physical features existing
on the ground or actual property lines or other man-made boundary lines used to
depict zoning district boundaries, are at variance with those shown on the
Official Zoning Map, the Board of Adjustment shall have the authority to
interpret zoning district boundaries.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.1.11 Interpreting Permitted Uses.
   (A)   If a use is not specifically listed in any of the districts listed in
this Ordinance, then the UDO Administrator shall have the authority to
interpret in which district the use, if any, should be permitted.
   (B)   If the UDO Administrator rejects a proposal for a use that is not
clearly disallowed in a particular district, then the UDO Administrator shall:
      (1)   Ensure that the citizen is provided with a copy of the
interpretation in writing.
      (2)   Inform the citizen of the right to appeal the decision to the Board
of Adjustment.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.1.12 Enforcement.
   155.1.12.1 Development Approvals. No person shall commence or proceed with
development without first securing any required development approval from the
town. A development approval shall be in writing and may contain a provision
requiring that the development comply with all applicable state and local laws.
The town may issue development approvals in print or electronic form. Any
development approval issued exclusively in electronic form shall be protected
from further editing once issued. Applications for development approvals may be
made by the landowner, a lessee or person holding an option or contract to
purchase or lease land, or an authorized agent of the landowner. An easement

owner of the parcel of land involved in the change and all abutting property
owners as shown on the New Hanover County tax listing at the addresses listed
for such property owners on the New Hanover County tax abstracts, at least ten
days and not more than 25 days prior to the Planning Board meeting at which the
rezoning is to be considered. When multiple parcels are included in a proposed
zoning map amendment, a posting of each individual site is not required, but
the town shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to
interested persons. The UDO Administrator or his or her designee shall certify
to the Planning Board that such notices have been made.
   (B)   Zoning Text Amendment. In any case where the Planning Board will
consider an amendment to the zoning code text, notice of the amendment to be
considered shall be published once in a newspaper having general circulation in
the area. The notice shall be published not less than ten days before the date
of the Planning Board meeting at which the text amendment will be considered.
   (C)   Planning Board Action on Development Regulations and other Legislative
Decisions.
      (1)   Zoning Text or Map Amendments. The Planning Board shall advise and
comment on whether the proposed text amendment or map amendment is consistent
with the adopted comprehensive plan and any other applicable officially adopted
plans. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the Board
of Aldermen that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed
appropriate by the Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board that a
proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not
preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Board of
Aldermen.
      (2)   Comprehensive Plan Updates, Other Ordinances, and Actions. Any
development regulation or action required by this Ordinance other than a zoning
regulation may be referred to the Planning Board for review and comment.
      (3)   The review and comment of a proposed development ordinance or
zoning amendment as required herein and by N.C.G.S. § 160D-604, must be
performed by a separate board and not the Board of Aldermen.
   155.4.1.4 Action by the Board of Aldermen.
   (A)   Notice and Public Hearings - Zoning Text Amendment. No amendment shall
be adopted by the Board of Aldermen until after public notice and hearing.
Notice of such a public hearing shall be published once a week for two
successive calendar weeks in a local newspaper of general circulation in the
town. The notice shall be published the first time not less than ten days nor
more than 25 days before the date scheduled for the hearing.
   (B)   Notice and Public Hearings - Zoning Map Amendment.
      (1)   In any case where the Board of Aldermen will consider a change in
the zoning classification of a parcel of land, notice of the proposed petition
or application shall be mailed by first class mail to the owner of that parcel
of land and all abutting property owners as shown on the New Hanover County tax
listing at the last addresses listed for such property owners on the New
Hanover County tax abstracts. For purposes of this Ordinance, properties
adjacent to the parcel subject to the map amendment but separated by a street,
railroad, or other transportation corridor shall be considered "abutting" and
included. The party applying for the change in zoning classification shall
submit the following material with the request for rezoning; the application
shall be considered incomplete without such material:
         (a)   A list of names of owners, their addresses and the tax parcel
numbers of the property involved in the change and the properties immediately
adjacent to the property of the request, including the property owners directly
opposite the proposed request but separated by a street right-of-way, railroad,
or other transportation corridor, as shown on the New Hanover County tax
listing.
         (b)   Two sets of plain, letter sized envelopes equal in number to the
above list of names shall be furnished by the applicant. Both sets of envelopes
are to be unsealed, stamped, and addressed for mailing to the adjacent property
owners as shown on the New Hanover County tax listing, and bear the return
address of the town.
      (2)   At least ten but no more than 25 days prior to the date of the
meeting at which the Board of Aldermen will consider the request for rezoning,
the Town Clerk shall mail a letter of notification in the supplied envelopes
containing a description of the request and the time, date and location of the
public hearing. Additionally, the site proposed for rezoning or an adjacent
public right-of-way shall be posted with a notice of the public hearing within
the same time period specified for mailed notices of the hearing at which the
rezoning is to be considered. When multiple parcels are included in a proposed
zoning map amendment, a posting of each individual site is not required, but
the town shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to
interested persons. The Town Clerk shall certify to the Board of Aldermen that
such notices have been made and such certification shall be deemed conclusive
in the absence of fraud.
      (3)   The first class mail notice required under subsections (1) and (2)
of this section shall not be required if the zoning map amendment directly
affects more than 50 properties, owned by a total of at least 50 different
property owners, and the town elects to use the expanded published notice. In
this instance, the town may elect to either make the mailed notice provided for
in this section or may as an alternative elect to publish a notice of the
hearing as required by N.C.G.S. § 160D-601, but provided that each
advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size. The
advertisement shall only be effective for property owners who reside in the
area of general circulation of the newspaper which publishes the notice.
Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation area, according
to the address listed on the most recent New Hanover County property tax
listing for the affected property, shall be notified according to the
provisions of subsections (1) and (2).
      (4)   Reserved.
   (C)   Recommendations of Planning Board. The Board of Aldermen shall not
hold its required public hearing or take action on any proposed zoning
amendment until it has received a recommendation regarding such Ordinance
amendment from the Planning Board. If no recommendation is received from the
Planning Board within 30 days from the date when submitted to the Planning
Board, the Board of Aldermen may consider the proposal without a recommendation
from the Planning Board.
   (D)   Citizen Comments. If any resident or property owner submits a written
statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification or repeal to a zoning
ordinance to the Town Clerk at least two business days prior to the proposed
vote on such change, the Town Clerk shall deliver such written statement to the
Board of Aldermen.
   (E)   Statements of Consistency and Reasonableness.
      (1)   Plan Consistency. Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning text
and/or map amendment, the Board of Aldermen shall adopt a statement describing
whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive
plan. This requirement may also be met by a clear indication in the minutes of
the Board of Aldermen that at the time of action on the amendment the Board was
aware of and considered the Planning Board's recommendations and any relevant
portions of an adopted comprehensive plan. If a zoning map amendment is adopted
and the action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan, the
zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending any future land-use map
in the approved comprehensive plan, and no additional request or application
for a plan amendment shall be required. However, if the plan is one that
requires review and approval subject to N.C.G.S. § 113A-110, (CAMA Plan), the
plan amendment shall not be effective until that review and approval is
completed. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered
concurrently. A consistency statement is not subject to judicial review.
      (2)   Reasonableness Statement for Rezonings. When adopting or rejecting
any petition for a zoning map amendment, a statement analyzing the
reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be approved by the Board of
Alderman. A reasonableness statement may be provided to zoning text amendments.
This statement of reasonableness may consider, among other factors:
         (a)   the size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the area
proposed to be rezoned;
         (b)   the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors,
and the surrounding community;
         (c)   the relationship between the current actual and permissible
development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be
permissible under the proposed amendment;
         (d)   why the action taken is in the public interest; and
         (e)   any changed conditions warranting the amendment.
      (3)   Single Statement. The statement of reasonableness and the plan
consistency statement may be approved as a single statement.
   (F)   A development regulation shall be adopted by ordinance on the first
reading, by a simple majority of the Board of Aldermen.
   155.4.1.5 Withdrawal of Application. An applicant may withdraw his or her
application at any time by written notice to the UDO Administrator.

Section 155.4.2 Establishment of Vested Rights.
   155.4.2.1 Purpose. The zoning vested right is a right, established pursuant
to N.C.G.S. § 160D-108, which precludes any action by a local government that
would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the
development or use of the property allowed by the applicable land development
regulation or regulations. As such, amendments in land development regulations
are not applicable or enforceable without the written consent of the owner with
regard to any of the following:
   (A)   Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development permit
application has been submitted and subsequently issued in accordance with
N.C.G.S. § 143-755.
   (B)   Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application
authorizing the subdivision has been submitted and subsequently issued in
accordance with N.C.G.S. § 143-755.
   (C)   A site-specific vesting plan pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 160D-108.1 and
subsection 155.4.2.8 below.
   (D)   A multi-phased development pursuant to subsection 155.4.2.4.
   (E)   A vested right established by the terms of a development agreement.
   155.4.2.2 Duration of a Vested Right.
   (A)   Upon issuance of a development permit, the vesting granted for a
project is effective upon the filing of the application, for so long as the
permit remains valid. Unless otherwise specified, building permits expire after
six months and development approvals/permits expire one year after issuance
unless work authorized by the permit has substantially commenced.
   (B)   Except where a longer vesting period is provided by this Ordinance,
the vesting granted expires for an uncompleted development project if
development work is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of
more than 24 consecutive months. The vesting period for a nonconforming use of
property expires if the use is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a
period of more than 24 consecutive months.
   155.4.2.3 Multiple Permits. Where multiple local development permits are
required to complete a development project, the applicant may choose the
version of each of the local land development regulations applicable to the
project, upon submittal of the application for the initial development permit.
This provision is applicable only for those subsequent development permit
applications filed within 18 months of the date following the approval of an
initial permit.
   155.4.2.4 Multi-Phased Development. A multi-phased development is a
development containing over 25 acres that is both submitted for a development
approval to occur in more than one phase and subject to a master development
plan with committed elements showing the type and intensity of each phase.
   (A)   A multi-phased development is vested for the entire development with
the land development regulations then in place at the time a site plan approval
is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development.
   (B)   A right which has been vested as provided for herein remains vested
for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for
the initial phase of the multi-phased development.
   155.4.2.5 Continuing Review. Following issuance of a development permit, the
town may make subsequent inspections and reviews to ensure compliance with the
applicable land development regulations in effect at the time of the original
approval.
   155.4.2.6 Process to Claim a Vested Right. A person claiming a vested right
may submit information to the UDO Administrator, who shall make an initial
determination as to the existence of the vested right. The decision of the UDO
Administrator or officer may be appealed under N.C.G.S. § 160D-405. On appeal,
the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking
such a determination or pursuing an appeal under N.C.G.S. § 160D-405, a person
claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by
N.C.G.S. § 160D-1403.1.
   155.4.2.7 Runs with the Land. Vested rights run with the land except for the
use of land for outdoor advertising governed by N.C.G.S. § 136-136.1 and
N.C.G.S. § 136-131.2 in which case the rights granted by this section run with
the owner of the permit issued by the North Carolina Department of
Transportation.
   155.4.2.8 Site Specific Vesting Plans.
   (A)   A site-specific vesting plan consists of a plan submitted to the town
in which the applicant requests vesting, describing with reasonable certainty
on the plan the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of
property. For purposes of this section the following plans or approvals qualify
as site-specific vesting plans:
      (1)   Preliminary Plat
      (2)   Minor Subdivision
      (3)   Major Subdivision
      (4)   Special Use Permit
   (B)   Establishment of Vested Right. A vested right is established with
respect to any property upon the valid approval, or conditional approval, of a
site-specific vesting. Such a vested right confers upon the landowner the right
to undertake and complete the development and use of the property under the
terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan, including any
amendments thereto.
   (C)   Approval Process for a Site-Specific Vesting Plan.
      (1)   Each site-specific vesting plan shall include the information
required by the Board of Aldermen for the underlying type of development
application.
      (2)   Each site-specific vesting plan shall provide the notice and
hearing required for the underlying type of development application. If the
vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing as
required by N.C.G.S. § 160D-602 shall be held.
      (3)   The town may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms
and conditions that may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare.
      (4)   A site-specific vesting plan is deemed approved upon the effective
date of the Board of Aldermen's decision approving the plan.
      (5)   An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be
amended with the approval of the owner and the local government in the same
manner as required for the underlying type of development plan.
   (D)   Duration and Termination of a Vested Right.
      (1)   A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan remains valid for
two years. Upon following the same process as required for the original
approval, the Board of Aldermen or the Administrator may extend the vesting of
a site-specific vesting plan up to three years (with total length of vesting
not to exceed five years) upon finding that:
         (a)   The permit has not yet expired;
         (b)   Conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new
application; and,
         (c)   The extension is warranted in light of all other relevant
circumstances-including, but not limited to the size and phasing of
development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic
cycles, and market conditions or other considerations.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a building permit, the provisions of N.C.G.S. §
160D-1111 and N.C.G.S. § 160D-1115 apply, except that a permit does not expire
and shall not be revoked because of the running of time while a vested right
under this section is outstanding.
      (3)   A right vested as provided in this section terminates at the end of
the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no
valid building permit applications have been filed.
   (E)   Changes and Exceptions.
      (1)   A vested right precludes any zoning action by the town which would
change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or
use of the property as set forth in an approved site-specific vesting plan,
except under the following conditions outlined in N.C.G.S. § 160D-108.1.
      (2)   The establishment of a vested right does not preclude the
application of overlay zoning or other development regulations which impose
additional requirements but do not affect the allowable type or intensity of
use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are
applicable to all property subject to development regulation by a local
government, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing,
electrical, and mechanical codes. Otherwise, applicable new regulations become
effective upon the expiration or termination of the vesting rights period of
the site-specific plan.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of
a vested right does not preclude, change, or impair the authority of the town
to adopt and enforce development regulations governing nonconforming situations
or uses.
   155.4.2.9. Annexation Declaration. Whenever the town acquires jurisdiction
over a territory that theretofore has been subject to the jurisdiction of
another local government, any person who has acquired vested rights in the
surrendering jurisdiction may exercise those rights as if no change of
jurisdiction had occurred. The town acquiring jurisdiction may take any action
regarding such a development approval, certificate, or other evidence of
compliance that could have been taken by the local government surrendering
jurisdiction pursuant to its development regulations. Except as provided in
this subsection, any building, structure, or other land use in a territory over
which the town has acquired jurisdiction is subject to the development
regulations of the town.
   155.4.2.10. Permit Choice. If an applicant submits an application for any
type of development and a rule or ordinance is amended, including an amendment
to any applicable land development regulation, between the time the development
application was submitted and a decision is made, or if a land development
regulation is amended after a development permit decision has been challenged
and found to be wrongfully denied or illegal, N.C.G.S. § 143-755 applies. The
applicant may choose which adopted version of the rule or ordinance will apply
to the development and use of the building, structure, or land indicated on the
application. If the applicant chooses the version of the rule or ordinance
applicable at the time of the application, the applicant shall not be required
to await the outcome of the amendment to the rule, map, or ordinance prior to
acting on the development permit.
   (A)   When a development required multiple permits under the development
regulations of this Ordinance, the applicant may choose the regulations
applicable to the project at the time of their initial permit application. The
applicant must submit the subsequent applications within 18 months of approval
of the initial permit in order to claim permit choice.
   (B)   If the development permit applicant chooses the version of the rule or
ordinance applicable at the time of the permit application, the development
permit applicant shall not be required to await the outcome of the amendment to
the rule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development permit. The
provisions contained in N.C.G.S § 143-755 apply.
   (C)   If a permit application is on hold for six or more consecutive months
at the request of the applicant, then permit choice is waived and the rules in
effect at the time of resuming consideration of the application apply.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.4.3 Moratorium.
   155.4.3.1 Temporary Moratorium. The town may adopt temporary moratoria on
any town development approval required by law. The duration of any moratorium
shall be reasonable in light of the specific conditions that warrant imposition
of the moratorium and may not exceed the period of time necessary to correct,
modify, or resolve such conditions. Except in cases of imminent and substantial
threat to public health or safety, before adopting an ordinance imposing a
development moratorium with a duration of 60 days or any shorter period, the
governing board shall hold a public hearing and shall publish a notice of the
hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the area not less than
seven days before the date set for the hearing. A development moratorium with a
duration of 61 days or longer, and any extension of a moratorium so that the
total duration is 61 days or longer, is subject to the notice and hearing
requirements of N.C.G.S. § 160D-601. Absent an imminent threat to public health
or safety, a development moratorium adopted pursuant to this section shall not
apply to any project for which a valid building permit issued pursuant to
N.C.G.S. § 160D-1108 is outstanding, to any project for which a special use
permit application has been accepted as complete, to development set forth in a
site-specific vesting plan approved pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 160D-108.1, to
development for which substantial expenditures have already been made in good
faith reliance on a prior valid development approval, or to preliminary or
final subdivision plats that have been accepted for review by the town prior to
the call for public hearing to adopt the moratorium. Any preliminary
subdivision plat accepted for review by the town prior to the call for public
hearing, if subsequently approved, shall be allowed to proceed to final plat
approval without being subject to the moratorium.
   155.4.3.2 Ordinance Establishing a Development Moratorium. Any ordinance
establishing a development moratorium must expressly include at the time of
adoption each of the following:
   (A)   A clear statement of the problems or conditions necessitating the
moratorium and what courses of action, alternative to a moratorium, were
considered by the town and why those alternative courses of action were not
deemed adequate.
   (B)   A clear statement of the development approvals subject to the
moratorium and how a moratorium on those approvals will address the problems or
conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
   (C)   An express date for termination of the moratorium and a statement
setting forth why that duration is reasonably necessary to address the problems
or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
   (D)   A clear statement of the actions, and the schedule for those actions,
proposed to be taken by the town during the duration of the moratorium to
address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
   155.4.3.3 Renewal or Extension of Moratorium. No moratorium may be
subsequently renewed or extended for any additional period unless the town
shall have taken all reasonable and feasible steps proposed to be taken by the
town in its ordinance establishing the moratorium to address the problems or
conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium and unless new facts and
conditions warrant an extension. Any ordinance renewing or extending a
development moratorium must expressly include, at the time of adoption, the
findings set forth in subsections (A) through (D) of Section
155.4.3.2, including what new facts or conditions warrant the extension.
   155.4.3.4 Persons Aggrieved by Imposition of Moratorium. Any person
aggrieved by the imposition of a moratorium on development approvals required
by law may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice
for an order enjoining the enforcement of the moratorium, and the court shall
have jurisdiction to issue that order. Actions brought pursuant to this section
shall be set down for immediate hearing, and subsequent proceedings in those
actions shall be accorded priority by the trial and appellate courts. In any
such action, the town shall have the burden of showing compliance with the
procedural requirements of this section.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.4.4 Administrative Appeals, Variances, and Interpretations.
   155.4.4.1 Administrative Appeals.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from decisions
of the UDO Administrator concerning the interpretation or administration of
development regulations contained in
Chapter 155 of the Town Code.
   (B)   Appeals under the provisions of this section may be filed by any
person who has standing under N.C.G.S. § 160D-1402(c) or by the town to the
Board of Adjustment.
   (C)   Decisions concerning the interpretation or administration of this
chapter shall be given in writing to the owner of the property that is the
subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different
from the owner. The written notice, or the notice of determination, shall be
delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first class mail. The
town shall assume that if a notice of determination is sent by mail, it is
received on the third business day after it is sent.
   (D)   The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice
of determination within which to file an appeal with the Town Clerk. Any other
person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source
of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an
appeal. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.
   (E)   It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to
appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing
the words "Zoning Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" in letters at least six
inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information
about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of
the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least ten days.
Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting
shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the
posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Posting of a
sign as described herein is not required but shall be done at the discretion of
the landowner or applicant. The town may post such sign.
   (F)   The UDO Administrator shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from is taken. The UDO Administrator shall also provide a copy of the record to
the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the
appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
   (G)   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays
enforcement, including fines, of the action appealed from unless the official
who made the decision certifies to the Board of Adjustment after notice of
appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay
would cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is
transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the
development regulation. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be
stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If
enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the
official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of
Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is
filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a
development approval or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is
consistent with the Ordinance shall not stay the further review of an
application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these
situations the appellant may request and the Board may grant a stay of a final
decision of development approval applications including building permits
affected by the issue being appealed.
   (H)   Subject to the provisions of subdivision (G) of this subsection, the
Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
   (I)   The official who made the decision, or his/her successor, shall be
present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the
hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the town
would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the
notice of appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing. The Board of Adjustment
may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed
from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that
ought to be made. The Board shall have all the powers of the official who made
the decision.
   155.4.4.2 Variances.
   (A)   An application for a variance shall be submitted to the Board of
Adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the UDO Administrator.
Applications shall be handled in the same manner as applications for
development approvals.
   (B)   A variance may be granted by the Board of Adjustment if it concludes
that, by granting the variance, all of the following findings are supported by
the Board of Adjustment decision:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the Ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the Ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial
justice is achieved.
   (C)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by a variance.
   (D)   Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that
the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.
   (E)   The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be
entered on the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note
the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance
for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner
as any other applicable requirement of this Ordinance.
   155.4.4.3 Interpretations.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment is authorized to interpret the zoning map and
to pass upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary lines and
similar questions. If such questions arise in the context of an appeal from a
decision of the UDO Administrator, they shall be handled as provided in Section
155.4.4.1.
   (B)   An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to the
Board of Adjustment by filing a standard Town of Wrightsville Beach appeal form
with UDO Administrator. The application shall contain sufficient information to
enable the Board to make the necessary interpretation.
   (C)   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on
the Official Zoning Map, the rules of interpretation as specified in Section

located within 150 feet of the lot that is the subject of the hearing.
   (B)   In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the town may rely on the
county tax listings to determine owners of property entitled to be mailed
notice.
   (C)   The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten days, but not
more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time
period, the town shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the

inadmissible in a court of law.
   (I)   If a member of the decision-making board has prior or specialized
knowledge about a case, that knowledge should be disclosed to the rest of the
board and parties at the beginning of the hearing. A member of any board
exercising quasi-judicial functions pursuant to this chapter shall not
participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter in a manner that would
violate affected persons' constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker.
Impermissible violations of due process include, but are not limited to, a
member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not
susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close familial,
business, or other associational relationship with an affected person, or a
financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised to a
board member's participation at or prior to the hearing or vote on a particular
matter and that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining
members of the board shall by majority vote rule on the objection.

      (2)   A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one
or more of the criteria set forth in subsection 155.4.4.2(B) are not satisfied
or that the application is incomplete. Insofar as practicable, such a motion
shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact that
support it. This motion is adopted as the board's decision if supported by more
than one-fifth of the board's membership (excluding vacant seats).
   (C)   A majority of the members shall be required to decide any other quasi-
judicial matters.
   155.4.4.9 (Reserved)

hearing or to suggestions or recommendations by the Board of Adjustment, the
applicant may agree to modify his application, including the plans and
specifications submitted.
   (B)   Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the
Board cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the
proposed changes without revised plans before it, the Board may approve the
application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until plans
reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the planning staff.
   155.4.4.11 Record.
   (A)   Accurate written minutes shall be kept of all such proceedings.
   (B)   All documentary evidence, including any exhibits, presented at a

   155.4.4.12 Written Decision.
   (A)   The Board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within
a reasonable time. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent,
material and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision
shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Board's determination of contested
facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision
shall be signed by the Chair or other duly authorized member of the Board.
   (B)   A quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written
decision with the Clerk to the Board. The decision of the Board shall be
delivered by personal delivery, or electronic mail, or by first-class mail to
the applicant, property owner, and to any other person who has submitted a
written request for a copy prior to the date the decision becomes effective.
The Director of Planning and Parks or his/her designee shall certify that
proper notice has been made.
   (C)   Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the
Superior Court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to N.C.G.S.
§ 160D-1402. A petition for review shall be filed with the Clerk of Superior
Court by the later of 30 days after the decision is effective or after a
written copy thereof is given in accordance with subsection (B) above. When
first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three days shall be added to the
time to file the petition.

Section 155.4.5 Special Use Permits.
   155.4.5.1 Purpose and Applicability. This Ordinance provides for a number of
uses to be located by right in each general zoning district subject to the use
meeting certain area, height, yard, and off-street parking and loading
requirements. Beginning after the adoption of conditional zoning, no new
special-use permit (SUP) applications will be accepted except when a single
business within a multi- tenant center cannot practicably pursue conditional
zoning without rezoning the entire parcel or a subdivided portion of it. In
that case, the business may apply for a special-use permit limited to its
premises under the procedures of this section. In addition to these uses, this
Ordinance allows some uses to be allowed in these districts as a special use
subject to issuance of a special use permit by the Board of Aldermen. The
purpose of special use permits is to ensure that uses would be compatible with
surrounding development and in keeping with the purposes of the general zoning
district in which the uses are located and would meet other criteria as set
forth in this section. A lawfully issued special-use permit granted before the
adoption of conditional zoning remains valid, and the permit holder may seek
Board of Aldermen approval to amend, expand, or revoke that permit under the
same standard and evidentiary hearing process that governed the original
approval. All special use permits require some form of a site plan as outlined
in Section
155.5.3.
   155.4.5.2 Application Process/Completeness.
   (A)   The deadline for which a special use permit application shall be filed
with the UDO Administrator is the first business day of the month in the month
prior to the meeting at which the application will be heard. Permit application
forms shall be provided by the UDO Administrator.
         In the course of evaluating the proposed special use, the Board of
Aldermen may request additional information from the applicant. A request for
any additional information may stay any further consideration of the
application by the Board of Aldermen.
   (B)   No application shall be deemed complete unless it contains or is
accompanied by a site plan drawn to scale which complies with the requirements
contained in Section
155.5.3 and a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule approved by the Board of
Aldermen for the submittal of special use permit applications.
   (C)   One hard copy and one digital copy of an application, and all
attachments and maps, for a special use permit shall, be submitted to the UDO
Administrator.
   155.4.5.3 Technical Review Procedure.All applications for a special use
permit, including required site plans, shall follow the technical review
procedure (Article 155.3, Part II) before being submitted to the Board of
Aldermen for consideration. The UDO Administrator shall forward any comments
received during the technical review process to the Board of Aldermen.
   155.4.5.4 Board of Aldermen Action.
   (A)   Special use permits are quasi-judicial decisions approved by a simple
majority vote of the Board of Aldermen. Quasi-judicial decisions must be
conducted in accordance with subsections
155.4.4.5 through
155.4.4.12. For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the Board and
members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not
be considered "members of the Board" for calculation of the requisite majority
if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such
members.
   (B)   Once the comments of the Technical Review Committee have been made,
the Board of Aldermen shall hold an evidentiary hearing to consider the
application at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A quorum of the Board of
Aldermen is required for this hearing. Notice of the evidentiary hearing shall
be as specified in subsection
155.4.4.6. In addition, notice shall be given to other potentially interested
persons by publishing a notice one time in a newspaper having general
circulation in the area not less than ten nor more than 25 days prior to the
evidentiary hearing.
   (C)   In approving an application for a special use permit in accordance
with the principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures specified herein,
the Board of Aldermen may impose reasonable and appropriate conditions and
safeguards upon the approval. Conditions and safeguards imposed under this
subsection shall not include requirements for which the local government does
not have authority under statute to regulate. In no instance shall any of these
conditions be less restrictive than any requirements which would pertain to
that particular development found elsewhere in a similar zoning district.
   (D)   The applicant has the burden of producing competent, material and
substantial evidence tending to establish the facts and conditions which
subsection
155.4.5.4(E) below requires.
   (E)   The Board of Aldermen shall issue a special use permit if it has
evaluated an application through a quasi-judicial process and determined that:
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, or general
welfare.
      (2)   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (3)   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
      (4)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, parking, or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
      (5)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
      (6)   The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to all the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (7)   Public access shall be provided in accordance with the
recommendations of the town's land use plan and access plan or the present
amount of public access and public parking as exists within the town now. If
any recommendations are found to conflict, the system requiring the greatest
quantity and quality of public access, including parking, shall govern.
      (8)   The proposed use shall be consistent with recommendations and
policy statements as described in the adopted land use plan.
   (F)   Conditions and Guarantees. Prior to the granting of any special use,
the Board of Aldermen may require, conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the
special use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest
and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified above.
In all cases in which special uses are granted, the Board of Aldermen shall
require the applicant or land owner's written consent to the conditions as
evidence and guarantee that the conditions required in connection therewith are
being and will be complied with.
   155.4.5.5 Effect of Approval. If an application for a special use permit is
approved by the Board of Aldermen, the owner of the property shall have the
ability to develop the use in accordance with the stipulations contained in the
special use permit, or develop any other use listed as a permitted use for the
general zoning district in which it is located.
   155.4.5.6 Binding Effect. Any special use permit so authorized shall be
binding to the property included in the permit unless subsequently changed or
amended by the Board of Aldermen.
   155.4.5.7 Record. Any special use permit issued by the Board of Aldermen
shall require recordation with the New Hanover County Register of Deeds within
90 days of its approval.
   155.4.5.8 Certificate of Occupancy. No certificate of occupancy for a use
listed as a special use shall be issued for any building or land use on a piece
of property which has received a special use permit for the particular use
unless the building is constructed or used, or the land is developed or used,
in conformity with the special use permit approved by the Board of Aldermen. In
the event that only a segment of a proposed development has been approved, the
certificate of occupancy shall be issued only for that portion of the
development constructed or used as approved.
   155.4.5.9 Change in Special Use Permit. An application to materially change
a special use permit once it has been issued must follow the same procedure as
the original approval and first be submitted, reviewed, and approved in
accordance with subsections
155.4.5.3 and
155.4.5.4, including payment of a fee in accordance with the fee schedule
approved by the Board of Aldermen.
   155.4.5.10 Implementation of Special Use Permit. A special use permit, after
approval by the Board of Aldermen shall expire one year after the approval date
if work has not commenced or in the case of a change of occupancy the business
has not opened; however, it may be, on request, continued in effect for a
period not to exceed an additional one year by the UDO Administrator. No
further extension shall be added except on approval of the Board of Aldermen.
If such use or business is discontinued for a period of 12 months, the special
use permit shall expire. Any expiration as noted or any violation of the
conditions stated on the permit shall be considered unlawful and the special
use permit may be repealed through the same hearing process and procedure as
the original approval. The applicant will be required to submit a new special
use application to the appropriate agencies for consideration and the
previously approved special use permit shall become null and void.

   When an application involving a quasi-judicial procedure/petition is denied
by the Board of Aldermen or Board of Adjustment, reapplication involving the
same property, or portions of the same property, may not be submitted unless

conditions governing the use of the property, or conditions surrounding the
property itself.

Aldermen may request that the applicant add reasonable and appropriate
conditions to the approval of the petition.
   (B)   Any such conditions shall be in accordance with NCGS § 160D-703 and
should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to the impact on town

improvements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision
of open space, and other matters that the participants in the public input
meeting, staff, Planning Board, and Board of Aldermen find appropriate or the
petitioner may propose. Such conditions to approval of the petition may include
right-of-way dedication, easements for streets, water, sewer, or other public
utilities necessary to serve the proposed development.
   (C)   The petitioner shall consider and respond to any such conditions after
the Planning Board meeting and within seven days prior to the staff report for
the Board of Aldermen being published. If the applicant does not agree with the

forwarded from the review process. All conditions shall be consented to in
writing by the applicant.
   (D)   If for any reason any condition for approval is found to be illegal or

and of no effect and proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to
its previous zoning classification.
   155.4.8.4 Effect of Approval.
   (A)   If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and
use of the property shall be governed by the predetermined ordinance
requirements applicable to the district's classification, the approved master

regulations, and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning
regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as an
amendment to these regulations and to the zoning maps.
   (B)   The conditional zoning request, once approved, shall be effective upon
property owner signature(s).
   (C)   Following the approval of the petition for a Conditional Zoning
District, the subject property shall be identified on the zoning map by the
appropriate district designation. A parallel conditional zoning shall be
identified by the same designation as the underlying general district followed
by the letters "CZ" (for example "C-1-CZ").
   (D)   No zoning or building permit shall be issued for any development
activity within a Conditional Zoning District except in accordance with the
approved petition and applicable site plan and/or subdivision plat.
Nonresidential projects may comply with the site plan requirement of Section
155.5.2 by including said requirements on the approved master development plan.
Accordingly, resubmittal of a minor or major site plan is not required.
   (E)   Any violation of the approved regulations and conditions for the
district shall be treated the same as any other violation of this Ordinance and
shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation.
   155.4.8.5 Review of Approval of a Conditional Zoning District.
   (A)   It is intended that property shall be reclassified to a Conditional
Zoning District only in the event of firm plans to develop the property.

the property in accordance with the approved petition and any conditions
attached to the approval.
   (B)   A report of the findings of the UDO Administrator may be provided for
Planning Board consideration, which may then recommend that the property be
rezoned to its previous zoning classification or to another district.

Section 155.7.18 Wireless Facilities and Wireless Support Structures.
   155.7.18.1 Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to ensure that
residents and businesses in the Town of Wrightsville Beach have reliable access
to wireless telecommunications networks and state of the art communications
services while also ensuring that this objective is achieved in a fashion that
preserves the intrinsic aesthetic character of the community and is
accomplished according to the Town of Wrightsville Beach's zoning, planning and
design standards. The Telecommunication Act of 1996, the regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the N.C. General Statutes
(particularly N.C.G.S. § 160D-930, et seq.) preserved, with certain
limitations, local government land use and zoning authority concerning the
placement, construction, and modification of wireless facilities. The Town of
Wrightsville Beach recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless
service technology can be an economic development asset to the Town of
Wrightsville Beach and a significant benefit to residents. This section
establishes parameters for the siting of wireless telecommunications
facilities. It is the intent of this section to:
   (A)   Ensure access to reliable wireless telecommunications services
throughout all areas of the Town of Wrightsville Beach;
   (B)   Encourage the use of existing monopoles, towers, utility poles and
other structures for the collocation of telecommunications facilities;
   (C)   Encourage the location of new monopoles and towers in non-residential
areas;
   (D)   Minimize the number of new monopoles and towers that would otherwise
need to be constructed by providing incentives for the use of existing
structures;
   (E)   Encourage the location of monopoles and towers, to the extent possible
in areas where the adverse impact on the community will be minimal;
   (F)   Minimize the potential adverse effects associated with the
construction of monopoles and towers through the implementation of reasonable
design, landscaping and construction practices;
   (G)   Ensure public health, safety, welfare and conveniences; and
   (H)   Conform to federal and state laws that allow certain antennas to be
exempt from local regulations.
   This section is divided into subsections, one for each type of wireless
facility listed in Section
155.6.4, Table of Permitted/Special uses. The three types of facilities as
defined in
Appendix A are:
      (1)   Wireless facility and substantial modifications (See subsection
155.7.18.3 below.);
      (2)   Small wireless facility (See subsection
155.7.18.4 below.); and
      (3)   Stealth wireless facility and collocation on existing structures.
(See subsection
155.7.18.5 below.).
      (4)   Stealth wireless facilities may be small wireless facilities.
Stealth wireless facilities that do not meet the definition of small wireless
facility must meet the standards of this section. This section is also
mandatory for collocations that do meet the definition of a small wireless
facility.
      (5)   The fifth subsection discusses non-conforming situations.
   155.7.18.2. General Requirements.
   (A)   Requirements for all applications.
      (1)   Applications will be deemed abandoned if left incomplete for more
than 90 days from the date the applicant was notified in writing that the
application was incomplete or deficient.
      (2)   No work of any kind may begin until all the required permits have
been approved. Collocations on existing structures and small wireless
facilities require a certificate of zoning compliance and a building permit,
unless constructed in a town public right-of-way (PROW). Small wireless
facilities constructed in a PROW also require an encroachment permit. Stealth
facilities require a certificate of zoning compliance and a building permit.
Stealth facilities located on town property require an encroachment permit. All
other wireless facilities, including substantial modifications, require a
special use permit, certificate of zoning compliance and building permit(s).
      (3)   The applicant must provide a deed, lease, or in the case of siting
in the PROW, an application for an encroachment permit substantiating that it
has the right to use the property for a wireless facility.
      (4)   All wireless support structures and their accessory structures
shall use building materials, colors and textures designed to blend with the
structure to which it may be affixed and to harmonize with the natural
surroundings. The use of stealth camouflage or concealment is encouraged.
      (5)   Any technical information must be provided in such a manner, detail
and form that the content and any conclusions are able to be verified by a
third party using the information provided by the applicant.
   (B)   Exemptions.
      (1)   Ordinary maintenance of existing telecommunications facilities and
wireless support structures, shall be exempt from zoning and permitting
requirements.
      (2)   In addition, the following facilities are not subject to the
provisions of this subsection:
         (a)   antennas used by residential households solely for broadcast
radio and television;
         (b)   satellite antennas used solely for residential or household
purposes;
         (c)   cells on wheels (COWS) placed for a period of not more than 120
days at any location within the town after a declaration of an emergency or a
disaster by the Governor or by the responsible official of the Town of
Wrightsville Beach.
      (3)   The replacement of one facility with another like facility. For
example, the replacement of a small wireless facility with another small
wireless facility.
      (4)   Installation, placement, maintenance or replacement of micro
wireless facilities that are suspended between existing utility poles or town
utility poles.
      (5)   Communication services providers authorized to occupy town rights-
of-way who are paying taxes under N.C.G.S. § 105-164.4(a), (4c) or (6).
   (C)   Abandonment and removal.
      (1)   Wireless services providers are required to remove an abandoned
wireless facility within 180 days of abandonment. Should the wireless services
provider fail to timely remove the abandoned wireless facility, the town may
cause such wireless facility to be removed and may recover the actual cost of
such removal, including legal fees, if any, from the wireless services
provider. For purposes of this subsection, a wireless facility shall be deemed
abandoned at the earlier of the date that the wireless services provider
indicates that it is abandoning such facility or the date that is 180 days
after the date that such wireless facility ceases to transmit a signal, unless
the wireless services provider gives the town reasonable evidence that it is
diligently working to place such wireless facility back in service.
      (2)   This section applies to rights-of-way controlled by the N.C. Dept.
of Transportation and the town.
      (3)   Any wireless support structure or part of a tower that ceases to be
used for communications broadcasting and/or broadcast receiving shall be
removed by the tower owner at the tower owner's expense, along with any and all
associated structure. The owner of the wireless facility or wireless support
structure shall remove the wireless facility within six months of its
abandonment. Upon removal, the site shall be revegetated to blend with the
existing surrounding vegetation. In the event that a wireless support structure
is not removed by its owner in the specified time, the tower and associated
structures may be removed by the town and the costs of removal assessed against
the tower or property owner. The Town of Wrightsville Beach shall ensure and
enforce removal by means of its existing regulatory authority.
   (D)   Multiple uses on a single parcel or lot telecommunications facilities
and support structures may be located on a parcel containing another principal
use on the same site.

Beach, wireless support structures shall be galvanized silver or gray finish.
            (iv)   Except for omni-directional antennas, all new or replacement
antennas shall be flush mounted, or as close to flush mounted on the wireless
support structure as is functionally possible unless it can be demonstrated by
clear and convincing technical evidence that flush mounting has the effect of
prohibiting the provision of service to the intended service area, or unless
the applicant proves that flush mounting is technologically impracticable.
            (v)   If mounted on a building, all antennas shall be flush mounted
on the building's fascia and camouflaged so as to match the color and, if
possible, the texture of the building, or in a manner to make the antennas as
undetectable as is reasonably possible given the facts and circumstances.
         (b)   Stealth telecommunications facilities shall be designed to
accommodate the collocation of other antennas whenever feasible.
         (c)   Upon request of the applicant, the Board of Aldermen may waive
the requirement that new wireless support structures accommodate the
collocation of other service providers if it finds that collocation at the site
is not essential to the public interest, or that the construction of a shorter
wireless support structure with fewer antennas will promote community
compatibility.
      (2)   Setbacks.
         (a)   Properly lines. Unless otherwise stated herein, wireless support
structures shall be setback from all property lines a distance equal to their
height measured from the base of the structure to its highest point, excluding
antennas.
         (b)   Residential dwellings. Unless otherwise stated herein, wireless
support structures shall be setback from all off-site residential dwellings a
distance equal to the height of the structure, excluding antennas. There shall
be no setback requirement from dwellings located on the same parcel as the
proposed structure. Existing or replacement utility poles shall not be subject
to a setback requirement.
         (c)   Unless otherwise stated herein, all accessory equipment shall be
located in the equipment compound. The equipment compound shall be setback from
all property lines in accordance with the minimum setback requirements in the
underlying zoning district. Accessory equipment associated with an existing or

         (d)   The Board of Aldermen shall have the authority to reduce or
waive any required setback upon the request of the applicant if the wireless
facility or wireless support structure will be less visible as a result of the
diminished setback. The Board of Aldermen must also find that the reduction or
waiver of the setback is consistent with the purposes and intent of this
Ordinance. The structure must still meet the underlying setback requirements of
the zoning district.
      (3)   Height. Height shall be measured from the natural undisturbed
ground surface below the center of the tower base to the top of the tower,
excluding the highest antenna or piece of equipment attached thereto.
         (a)   In non-residential districts, support structures shall not
exceed a height of 50 feet from the base of the structure to the top of the
highest point. Any proposed support structure shall be designed to be the
minimum height needed to meet the service objectives of the applicant.
         (b)   Support structures and antennas located on buildings shall not
exceed 15 feet in height. Roof-mounted antennas extending over five feet above
the principle building shall be located behind a facade that blends with the
principal building.
         (c)   In all districts, the Board of Aldermen shall have the authority
to reduce or waive the height restrictions listed in this section upon a
satisfactory showing of the need for a greater height. With its request the
applicant shall submit such technical information or other justification as are
necessary to document the need for the additional height to the satisfaction of
the Board of Aldermen.
      (4)   Aesthetics.
         (a)   Lighting and marking. Wireless facilities or wireless support
structures shall not be lighted or marked unless required by the Federal
Communications Commission or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Any
additional lighting beyond minimum FAA requirements must be approved by the
Board of Aldermen. If approved, the lighting shall be shielded and oriented so
as not to project directly onto adjacent property, and so as to minimize glare
onto adjacent property and streets.
         (b)   Signage. Signs on any portion of a tower and/or related
accessory building, fence, or wall shall be prohibited with the following
exceptions:
            (i)   A two square foot sign located at the telecommunications
facility shall be limited to ownership and contact information, FCC antenna
registration number (if required) and any other information as required by
government regulation. Commercial advertising is strictly prohibited.
            (ii)   Warning signs may be placed on the premises. Equipment
information signs may be placed at appropriate locations as determined by the
Town Manager or his/her designee.
            (iii)   A freestanding sign may be permitted only if the lot also
contains the main business office of the telecommunications server.
            (iv)   A sign permit is required whenever a sign is allowed.
      (5)   Landscaping. In all districts, the Board of Aldermen shall have the
authority to impose reasonable landscaping requirements surrounding the
equipment compound or accessory equipment. Required landscaping shall be
consistent with surrounding vegetation and shall be maintained by the facility
owner. The Board of Aldermen may choose to not require landscaping for sites
that are not visible from the public rights-of-way or adjacent property or in
instances where in the judgment of the Board of Aldermen, landscaping is not
appropriate or necessary.
      (6)   Equipment compounds and/or accessory equipment, including any
buildings, cabinets or shelters, shall be used only to house equipment and
other supplies in support of the operation of the wireless facility or wireless
support structure. Any equipment not used in direct support of such operation
shall not be stored on the site. Ground mounted accessory equipment, wireless
facilities and wireless support structures shall be secured and enclosed with
fence not less than six feet in height as deemed appropriate by the Board of
Aldermen and must comply with the UDO. Barbed wire, razor ribbon, concertina
wire and other similar security measures shall be prohibited. The Board of
Aldermen may waive the fencing requirement if it is deemed that a fence is not
appropriate or needed at the proposed location.
         (a)   An equipment building, shelter or cabinet must not exceed 560
square feet and 12 feet in height, including the support structure for the
equipment.
         (b)   Equipment buildings must comply with local, state and federal
flood zone restrictions.
         (c)   Exception to height restriction. Upon the applicant's request,
the Board of Aldermen may waive the height restriction to allow for the
stacking of equipment on top of each other. The Board of Aldermen must find
that there is a practical necessity for the stacking of the equipment and that
any resulting impact on adjoining properties is minimal or may be minimized by
requiring appropriate screening. The Board of Aldermen may also waive the
height restriction where a higher support structure is needed to raise the
equipment above a slope or floodplain.
         (d)   If the equipment compound and/or accessory equipment is adjacent
to or visible from a residential zone, the Board of Aldermen may require that
the building or shelter be faced with brick or other suitable material on all
sides and that the compound area is surrounded by landscaping providing a
screen of at least three feet in height at installation. The equipment compound
and/or accessory equipment must conform to the setback standards of the
applicable zone. In the situation of stacked equipment buildings, additional
screening/landscaping measures may be required by the Board of Aldermen.

   (A)   Scope. Applications for certificates of zoning compliance for
collocated antenna and stealth telecommunications facilities ("stealth
facility") are permitted by the Town Manager or designee if the conditions of
this section are met. This section applies to stealth facilities and to
collocations that meet the definitions of small or micro wireless facilities.
This section does not apply to substantial modifications. (Collocated antennas
and stealth facilities are sometimes referred to together in this subsection as
"the facility".)
   (B)   Additional Approval Criteria for Certificates of Zoning Compliance.
Collocations may only be approved if all the following criteria are met:
      (1)   The additional antenna(s) does not exceed the number of wireless
facilities previously approved for the wireless support structure on which the
collocation is proposed and meet all the other requirements of the original
approval; or
      (2)   The application meets all the following requirements:
         (a)   The collocation does not exceed a height of ten feet above the
utility pole and the width of the tower or wireless support structure to which

Section 155.8.16 Reconstruction Damage Less Than 50%.
   Any nonconforming building or structure or any building or structure
containing a nonconforming use or any building or structure constituting a
nonconforming situation, which has been damaged by fire, acts of God, and other
causes beyond the control of the owner, may be reconstructed and used as before
subject to the conditions and restrictions of this Ordinance and further
subject to a determination by the UDO Administrator that the cost to repair
such damage or destruction is less than 50% of the assessed tax value of the
structure as listed by the New Hanover County Tax Office or that value (as
defined in Exhibit A) as determined by a certified appraisal. For purposes of
this section, "value" shall mean the value of the building before the damage or
destruction occurred. In addition, the property owner may be required to
provide other information as required by the UDO Administrator to substantiate
the cost of such repairs, reconstruction, improvements, or addition.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.8.17 Reconstruction Damage More Than 50%.
   If such building or structure as described in the preceding paragraph is
damaged to an extent equal to or greater than 50% of the value as specified in
the preceding paragraph, then such building may only be reconstructed if it is
brought into full compliance with
Article 155.11, Part I (Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance);
Article 155.9, Part I (Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading Requirements);
and the setback requirements contained in Section
155.6.5. In the event the number of units in the building that existed before
the damage cannot be rebuilt because of an inability to meet the requirements
of this paragraph, a building containing a lesser number of units (but more
than are permitted under the zoning applicable to the property) may be rebuilt
so long as all applicable requirements of the UDO, to include this paragraph,
are met. For example, a damaged quadraplex in a zoning district permitting only
single-family units cannot be rebuilt because the current parking requirements
cannot be met. However, a duplex can be built on the subject property that will
meet the requirements of the UDO and this section. In this situation, a duplex
may be constructed in this zoning district.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.8.18 Increase in Extent of Nonconformity.
   In no event shall the extent of nonconformity of a building or structure
repaired under the provisions of this Ordinance be increased or enlarged in any
manner except as permitted herein.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.8.19 Time for Carrying Out Reconstruction.
   Any owner wishing to repair a nonconforming building or structure under the
provisions of this Ordinance must acquire a building permit for such repairs
within 18 months of the date of the damage or destruction. The UDO
Administrator shall have the authority to extend such 18 month period for an
additional 90 days upon receipt of a written request to do so prior to the
expiration of the initial 18 month period. In the event the owner fails to meet
these time restrictions, the right to continue the nonconforming situation,
use, building or structure shall terminate and the property shall thereafter be
used only in a conforming manner.

ARTICLE 155.9
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
PART I.
OFF-STREET PARKING AND OFF-STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS
Section 155.9.1 Off-Street Parking Requirements.
   There shall be provided at the time of the erection of any building, or at
the time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding
dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, or floor area, permanent off-street parking
space in the amount specified by this section. Such parking space may be
provided in a parking garage or properly graded open space that complies with
the standards for parking established in this section.
   155.9.1.1 Certification of Minimum Parking Requirements. Each application
for a building permit or certificate of zoning compliance submitted to the UDO
Administrator as provided for in this Ordinance shall include information as to
the location and dimensions of off-street parking and the means of entrance and
exit to the space. This information shall be in sufficient detail to enable the
UDO Administrator to determine whether or not the requirements of this section
are met. In the case of mixed use developments, the total required off-street
parking or loading space shall be the sum of the requirements for the various
uses computed separately except for as provided below.
   (A)   Up to one-half of the parking spaces required for one use in a mixed
use development may be used to satisfy the parking requirements for a second
use within the proposed development, subject to certification by the Board of
Aldermen that such joint usage parking complies with the following provisions:
      (1)   The peak usage of the parking facility by one use will be at night
or on Sundays and the peak usage of the parking facility by the second use will
be at other times as provided in subsection
155.9.1.2; and
      (2)   The second use is ancillary to the first use, such as restaurants
and meeting rooms to hotels and motels.
   (B)   Minimum parking requirements for a mixed use development may be
reduced by the Board of Aldermen if a traffic/parking study is submitted to
demonstrate and the Board of Aldermen finds that:
      (1)   Sidewalks, bicycle facilities, transit service, and transit
amenities are in place such that together with the number of parking spaces
that are proposed, transportation is adequately served or the commercial
establishment(s) existing or previously existing on the subject property have
historically utilized on-street public parking for a significant portion of
customer parking and there is sufficient on-street public parking available
within a 400-foot radius of the mixed-use development to meet the demand for
the commercial component of the mixed-use development; and provided the
commercial component of the mixed use in the proposed project is equal to and
not less than 100% of the previous commercial use as determined by heated
square footage; and
      (2)   Reduction of the minimum parking requirements will not be injurious
to the general health, safety, and welfare.
   155.9.1.2 Combination of Required Parking Space. The required parking space
for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot but the required
space assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use. However, one-half
of the parking space required for churches, theaters, or assembly halls whose
peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which
will be closed at night or on Sunday mornings until 12:00 noon.
   155.9.1.3 Bicycle Rack Requirements. For all parking lots containing 20 or
more spaces, bicycle racks which accommodate at least five bicycles shall be
installed. The final location of the bicycle rack shall be determined by the
UDO Administrator or his/her designee.

condition would be impossible to meet, the Board of Aldermen, upon review and
recommendation by the UDO Administrator, may exempt this requirement provided
that adequate provision is made of drainage.
   (H)   Twenty-five percent of all parking spaces may be established as
compact parking stalls. The dimensions for standard and compact parking stalls
are outlined in subsection
155.9.1.7.

vehicles to back into public rights-of-way, sidewalks, or strike against or
damage any wall, vegetation, utility, or other structure.

establishment of landscaped islands and buffers per the requirements of
Article 155.9, Part IV.
   (N)   Off-street parking area shall be properly maintained in all respects.

setback for lots if the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The driveway existed at the time of adoption of this subsection
(which date is March 10, 2022) and encroached into a required setback; the
driveway was legally permitted by the town at the time it was constructed; and
the following conditions are satisfied:
            1)   Any part of the driveway encroaching into the required side
yard setback that is repaired or replaced must be constructed of pervious
materials;
            2)   Such repair or replacement shall not create new
nonconformities or increase encroachments into the required setbacks;
            3)   Any part of the driveway that is located within the town's
right- of-way that is repaired or replaced shall comply with the provisions of
subsection (E) above; and
            4)   All other provisions of this chapter are complied with.
         (b)   For lots on which structures exist that have been determined to

without the prior written consent of the Board of Aldermen if the creation of
such driveway causes a metered on-street parking space to be eliminated; and
            4)   The removal and replacement of a driveway that was legally
permitted prior to November 18, 2012 can occur if:
               a)   The lot is a legally conforming lot.
               b)   The replacement of the driveway is in the same location and
same size as it previously existed or if the driveway is enlarged or changed in
any way thos changes would have to meet the provisions of this Code.

            5)   All other provisions of this section are complied with.
   (F)   If a structure has a driveway at the time of adoption of this section
that does not comply with the provisions of subsection (E) above, and such
structure is subsequently repaired, reconstructed, improved, or added to in
such a manner as to meet the definition of "substantial improvement" as set
forth in Exhibit A, Definitions, the owner of such structure shall be required
to bring the driveways into compliance with the provisions of subsection (E)
above.

inch, monolithic concrete, having a depth of not less than six inches
throughout and shall be given a float finish to assure an even surface having
suitable roughness. All driveway entrances and sidewalk surfaces shall be
screened and given a float finish to assure an even surface having suitable
roughness. Driveway entrances shall conform to the contour of the street
pavement, making provision for drainage flows and gutter continuity, and shall
rise not less than six inches above the gutter at the point at which the
driveway reaches the property lines in order to assure containment of drainage
flows and proper runoff. Expansion joints shall be placed at edges of driveways
where sidewalks abut, and in aprons not less than 24 feet apart.
   (H)   Where existing driveway entrances do not conform to these regulations
and constitute a hazard, obstruct drainage, or are in a dangerous state of
repair, and the owner is instructed by the Board of Aldermen to repair said
driveway entrance, or adjacent curbs and sidewalks as provided in this section,
the owner shall submit a drawing showing the proposed new driveway to be placed
in accordance with the Ordinance and these regulations.
   (I)   Where streets are widened or curb and gutter sections are placed after
driveways are installed, the owner of the property adjacent to the street where
such improvements take place shall be assessed all costs of modification of
said existing driveways in order to conform to the street improvements in
accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the Charter of the Town of Wrightsville Beach.
   (J)   All requests for a zoning permit to construct driveways shall be
accompanied by a sketch showing the location of the property involved, the
frontage concerned, and the location of any structures on the property. The
inclusions of this information on site plans for building permits for new
construction will be acceptable for the purpose of driveway permit issue.
   (K)   The street area immediately adjacent to a permitted driveway as
described in this section shall be painted and/or marked so as to indicate that
no-parking is permitted within the street right-of-way immediately adjacent to
the permitted driveway. Parking shall be permitted on all other areas of the
street except those portions of such street otherwise designated as no parking
areas by this Unified Development Ordinance or action of the Board of Aldermen.
Provided, that should the designation of no parking areas adjacent to permitted
driveways as described herein result in permitted parking areas of a length of
less than 15 feet, such area shall be designated as a no parking area.
   (L)   It shall be unlawful for any person except authorized employees of the
town to paint, mark or otherwise designate no parking areas on a public street.
Any person violating the provision of this section shall be subject to the
penalties set forth in subsection

tree or groups of trees to be protected. Neither shall the developer allow the
disposal of waste materials such as paint, oil solvents, asphalt, concrete,
mortar and so on within the drip line of any tree or groups of trees.
      (7)   No attachments or wires other than those of a protective nature
shall be attached to any tree.
      (8)   Soil disturbances within the drip line of a protected tree shall be
limited to two inches in depth removed or two inches in depth added. Any soil
added under the drip line of the tree shall be a loamy soil mix to ensure
minimal compaction.
      (9)   During land clearing and construction stage of development, the UDO
Administrator shall periodically inspect the site to insure compliance with the
provisions of this section.
      (10)   Tree location and replacement activity permitted or required under
this section shall be done in accordance with standard forestry practices and
procedures, and all such plantings shall be reasonably maintained and attended
to promote successful establishment thereof.
   (F)   Tree Loss Mitigation Policy. To offset negative impacts to natural
environment, aesthetics, and property values of Wrightsville Beach and to
uphold the intent of this section, the following tree replacement schedule
shall be followed, which shall be in addition to any and all fees and/or fines
paid or incurred by a party that removes or alters a tree, the effect of which
is to eliminate it.
      (1)   All protected trees removed shall be replaced in accordance with
the following criteria:
         (a)   All trees required by this section, all trees on town-owned
property and other protected trees, excluding specimen trees, shall be replaced
in a one-to-one ratio with trees that at maturity will be of comparable DBH and
height of the tree removed. All replacement trees shall have a DBH of at least
three inches when planted.
         (b)   Specimen trees shall be replaced on a two-to-one ratio with
trees of the same species. All replacement trees shall have a DBH of at least
three inches when planted.
         (c)   All mitigation shall occur on the property where the tree was
removed. Mitigation in connection with construction shall be completed prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
      (2)   Tree loss mitigation shall not take effect when a tree removed is
that lost to natural causes, such as age, disease, or storm, or other causes
beyond the control of the landowner and property developer, such as a car crash
or fire for which no party is found responsible. Tree loss mitigation shall
take effect for all other trees allowed to be removed by permit from the UDO
Administrator or by variance from the Board of Adjustment as well as for those
trees altered or removed in violation of this section.
      (3)   A developer or property owner may be excused from the requirement
to install new required trees that would cause the lot in question to contain
more than five total protected trees, to include new and existing trees, if the
UDO Administrator determines that the size of a given property and presence of
existing vegetation is such that the introduction of a significant number of
new trees may be detrimental to both existing vegetation and proposed trees.
The decision of the UDO Administrator in such matter shall be final.
   (G)   Penalties.
      (1)   Any person who violates the provisions of Section
155.9.23, Tree Preservation, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor or
infraction punishable as provided in N.C.G.S. § 14-4 and shall be subject to a
maximum fine upon conviction of up to $2,500. Additionally, conviction thereof
shall be grounds for the revocation or suspension of any permit granted for the
construction or remodeling of any building or structure on the site so
involved.
      (2)   The violation of the provisions of Section
155.9.23, Tree Preservation, shall subject the offender to a civil penalty for
each violation as follows:
         (a)   The removal of each protected tree, excluding specimen trees,
without first obtaining an approved tree removal permit, shall subject the
offender to a civil penalty in the amount of $500.
         (b)   The removal of each specimen tree without first obtaining an
approved tree removal permit shall subject the offender to a civil penalty in

155.9.23, Tree Preservation, shall subject the offender to a civil penalty of
$50 for each violation.
         (d)   Each day that a violation of Section
155.9.23, Tree Preservation, as described in subsection (G)(2)(c) above
continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense and shall be subject
to a fine of $50 per day.
      (3)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for
any improvements upon a property where the provisions of Section
155.9.23, Tree Preservation, have not been complied with. A stop work order
shall be issued until violations of the provisions of Section
155.9.23, Tree Preservation, are corrected and until all fines and penalties
are paid.
      (4)   The UDO Administrator may defer any civil penalty levied under the
provisions of Section
155.9.23, Tree Preservation, if the offender obtains an approved tree permit
and if the offender replants the disturbed area in accordance with an approved
tree protection plan meeting the requirements of Section
155.9.23, Tree Preservation.
      (5)   Damages to protected trees shall be repaired to the maximum extent
possible. Each tree removed, destroyed, or damaged in violation of Section

   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of
N.C.G.S. Ch. 143; Articles 7 and 11, Part 2 of Article 9 and Parts 2 and 3 of
Article 13 of N.G.C.S. Ch. 160D; and Article 8 of N.C.G.S. Ch. 160A, delegated
to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of
Alderman of Town of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 1780, passed 7-10-18; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.11.2 Findings of Fact.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of
Wrightsville Beach are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of
life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. 1780, passed 7-10-18; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.11.3 Statement of Purpose.
   It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 1780, passed 7-10-18; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.11.4 Objectives.
   The objectives of this Ordinance are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas
mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that
are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
   (G)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the National
Flood Insurance Program;
   (H)   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
   (I)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
   (J)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.

include:
   (A)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to
an effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA is based on technical
data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being in the
floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is
not located in a special flood hazard area.

accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations.
   (D)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP
requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood
hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map or
flood insurance study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built
documentation, a letter of map revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the
effective FIRM.

other improvement of a structure, taking place during any one-year period for
which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure
before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes
structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
   (A)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
   (B)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure
and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to Article 4 Section
E of this Ordinance.
Technical Bulletin and Technical Fact Sheet
   A FEMA publication that provides guidance concerning the building
performance standards of the NFIP, which are contained in Title 44 of the U.S.
Code of Federal Regulations at § 60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are
intended for use primarily by state and local officials responsible for
interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and by members of the development
community, such as design professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as
updates of existing bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins
do not create regulations; rather they provide specific guidance for complying
with the minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations.
   It should be noted that technical bulletins and technical fact sheets
provide guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or
community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design
professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more
restrictive state or local regulations apply to the building or site in
question. All applicable standards of the state or local building code must
also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
Temperature Controlled
   Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or cooling system, built-
in or appliance.
Variance

Violation
   The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required in Articles 4 and 5 is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Water Surface Elevation (WSE)
   The height, in relation to NAVD 1988, of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
Watercourse
   A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on
or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes
specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

submitted with the application for a variance.
   (F)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this Ordinance, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
Ordinance.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the BFE and the elevation to which the
structure is to be built and that such construction below the BFE increases
risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the BFE may result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the FEMA and the State of North Carolina
upon request.
   (I)   Conditions for variances:

Section 155.11.18 Specific Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction.
   In all special flood hazard areas where BFE data has been provided, as set
forth in Section
155.11.6, or Section
155.11.20, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of Section
155.11.17, are required:
   (A)   Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in subsection
155.11.4.1.
   (B)   Non-residential Construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in subsection
155.11.4.1. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A99 may be
floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation
provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing
elevation shall be in accordance with Article 5, Section I (2). A registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the floodproofing
standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in Section
155.11.13(C), along with the operational plan and the inspection and
maintenance plan.
   (C)   Manufactured Homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in subsection
155.11.4.1.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 143-
143.15. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the
chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be
supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of
the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is
required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of Section
155.11.18(D).
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated Buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor or below the
lowest horizontal structural member in VE zones:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A99 flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      (4)   Shall, in coastal high hazard areas (Zone VE), either be free of
obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls, open wood latticework or
insect screening, provided they are not part of the structural support of the
building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or
wave action without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or
supporting foundation system or otherwise jeopardizing the structural integrity
of the building. The following design specifications shall be met:
         (a)   Material shall consist of open wood or plastic lattice, or
insect screening; or
         (b)   Breakaway walls shall meet the following design specifications:
            1.   Design safe loading resistance shall be not less than ten nor
more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
            2.   Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance
of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by state or
local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of
the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and
nonstructural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with
the base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the
North Carolina State Building Code.
         (c)   Concrete pads, including patios, decks, parking pads, walkways,
driveways, pool decks, etc. the following is required:
            1.   Shall be structurally independent of the primary structural
foundation system of the structure and shall not adversely affect structures
through redirection of floodwaters or debris; and
            2.   Shall be constructed to breakaway cleanly during design flood
conditions, shall be frangible, and shall not produce debris capable of causing
damage to any structure. (The installation of concrete in small segments
(approximately four feet x four feet) that will easily break up during the base
flood event, or score concrete in four feet x four feet maximum segments is
acceptable to meet this standard); and
            3.   Reinforcing, including welded wire fabric, shall not be used
in order to minimize the potential for concreted pads being a source of debris;
and
            4.   Pad thickness shall not exceed four inches; or
            5.   Provide a design professional's certification stating the
design and method of construction to be used meet the applicable criteria of
this section.
            6.   The provisions above shall not apply to non-residential or
multi-family construction that is designed by a professional engineer and
constructed with self- supporting structural slabs capable of remaining intact
and functional under base flood conditions, including expected erosion.
      (5)   Fill/grading.
         (a)   Minor grading and the placement of minor quantities of
nonstructural fill may be permitted for landscaping and for drainage purposes
under and around buildings and for support of parking slabs, pool decks, patios
and walkways.
         (b)   The fill material must be similar and consistent with the
natural soils in the area.
         (c)   The placement of site-compatible, non-structural fill under or
around an elevated building is limited to two feet. Fill greater than two feet
must include an analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional
demonstrating no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave
reflection that would increase damage to adjacent elevated buildings and
structures.
         (d)   Nonstructural fill with finished slopes that are steeper than
five units horizontal to one unit vertical shall be permitted only if an
analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional demonstrates no
harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave reflection that would
increase damage to adjacent elevated buildings and structures.
      (6)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record a non-
conversion agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring that the
area below the lowest floor shall not be improved, finished or otherwise
converted to habitable space; the Town of Wrightsville Beach will have the
right to inspect the enclosed area. This agreement shall be recorded with the
New Hanover County Register of Deeds and shall transfer with the property in
perpetuity.
      (7)   Release of restrictive covenant. If a property which is bound by a
non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed areas below BFE, then
the owner may request release of restrictive covenant after staff inspection
and submittal of confirming documentation.
   (E)   Additions/Improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally
modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the
addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
      (2)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one-year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with
the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the one-
year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this Ordinance. If
the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered
substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
requirement does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions.
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (F)   Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Temporary Placement.
         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no
permanently attached additions.)
      (2)   Permanent Placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
   (G)   Temporary Non-residential Structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible

OCEANFRONT PROPERTY
Section 155.11.26 Oceanfront Policies.
   (A)   This section is adopted to preserve and promote the protection of the
oceanfront area of environmental concern by maintaining the existence of
vegetation and natural or constructed dunes, which provide a protective barrier
from the actions of the Atlantic Ocean, other surrounding waters, sand, wind,
and pedestrians. The past practice of destroying this barrier system
constitutes a serious threat to the safety of oceanfront properties and the
public. These requirements are therefore adopted for the health, safety, and
welfare of persons living and visiting in the town and for the protection of
public and private property. Section 160A-174 of the North Carolina General
Statutes authorizes and empowers the town under general ordinance-making powers
to regulate the protection of natural or constructed dunes within the town. The
2018 CAMA Land Use Plan Update for the town includes management goals, planning
objectives, and implementation actions that support the purpose and intent of
these ordinances. The applicable policies are listed below:
      (1)   Land Use Compatibility Implement Action 12: "suitable land uses in
ocean hazard areas include ocean shoreline erosion control activities and dune
establishment and stabilization."
      (2)   Public Access Implementing Action 17: "Public pedestrian access is
limited to designated crossover areas in order to minimize damage to dunes and
vegetation."
      (3)   Water Quality Implementing Action 80: "the Town shall avoid
'approving of any activity which would destroy remaining habitat for loggerhead
turtle nesting’.”
      (4)   Water Quality Implementing Action 81: "tree cover at Wrightsville
Beach, whether maritime or otherwise, is a highly valued asset."
   (B)   When this section conflicts with Coastal Resources Commission
regulations and provisions of the Coastal Area Management Act, the more
restrictive rule shall apply.

(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)
Section 155.12.4 Plat Approval Not to Constitute Acceptance of Dedication.

of any street or other ground, public utility line, or other public facility
shown upon the plat.
(Ord. 1695, passed 11-8-12; Am. Ord. 1838, passed 3-10-22)

violation of applicable town ordinances or transfers or sells land by reference
to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land
before the plat has been properly approved under applicable town ordinances and
recorded in the office of the New Hanover County Register of Deeds, shall be
guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The description by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or
transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The town
may bring an action for injunction of any illegal subdivision, transfer,
conveyance, or sale of land, and the court shall, upon appropriate findings,
issue an injunction and order requiring the offending party to comply with the
subdivision ordinance. Building permits required pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 160D-

plat has not yet been approved under the provisions of the subdivision
ordinance or recorded with the Register of Deeds, provided the contract does
all of the following:

prospective buyer or lessee with respect to approval of the final subdivision
plat, that changes between the preliminary and final plats are possible, and
that the contract or lease may be terminated without breach by the buyer or
lessee if the final recorded plat differs in any material respect from the
preliminary plat.
      (3)   Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat does not
differ in any material respect from the plat referred to in the contract, the
buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any
earlier than five days after the delivery of a copy of the final recorded plat.

any material respect from the preliminary plat referred to in the contract, the
buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any
earlier than 15 days after the delivery of the final recorded plat, during
which 15-day period the buyer or lessee may terminate the contract without
breach or any further obligation and may receive a refund for all earnest money
or prepaid purchase price.
   (B)   The provisions of this section shall not prohibit any owner or its
agent from entering into contracts to sell or lease land by reference to an
approved preliminary plat for which a final plat has not been properly approved
under the subdivision ordinance, or recorded with the Register of Deeds where
the buyer or lessee is any person who has contracted to acquire or lease the
land for the purposes of engaging in the business of construction of
residential, commercial, or industrial buildings on the land, or for the
purpose of resale or lease of the land to persons engaged in that kind of
business, provided that no conveyance of the land may occur and no contract to
lease it may become effective until after the final plat has been properly
approved under the subdivision ordinance and recorded with the Register of
Deeds.

   (C)   Performance Guarantees. In lieu of requiring the completion,

whereby the subdivider shall agree to complete any remaining required
improvements as specified by the approved preliminary plat for that portion of
the subdivision to be shown on the final plat within a mutually agreed upon
specified time period not to exceed one year. The total cost of the remaining
improvements and administration for which the surety is offered shall not
exceed $50,000 except for minor subdivisions that require the extension of
sidewalks along existing streets. The surety limit stated in this section shall
be adjusted annually, at the beginning of each calendar year or fiscal year, to
compensate for construction costs, inflation, or other factors, in accordance
with an appropriate established index, as approved by the Town Attorney. Once
agreed upon by both parties and the security required herein is provided, the
final plat may be approved by the Board of Aldermen, if all other requirements
of this Ordinance are met. The town shall require a certified cost estimate
from a licensed contractor or engineer for the cost of completion of such
improvements.
      (1)   The subdivider shall provide one of the following performance
guarantees, elected at the subdivider's discretion, to ensure installation of
required improvements:
         (a)   Surety Performance Bond(s). The subdivider shall obtain a
performance bond(s) from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in
North Carolina. The bond(s) shall be payable to the Town of Wrightsville Beach,
and shall be in an amount not to exceed 125% of the entire cost, as estimated
by the subdivider in conjunction with the Board of Aldermen, and approved by
the Board of Aldermen for installing all required improvements. The duration of
the bond(s) shall be one year from the date the bond is issued, unless the
developer determines that the scope of work for the required improvements
necessitates a longer duration.
         (b)   Cash or Equivalent Security. The subdivider shall deposit cash,
an irrevocable letter of credit, or other instrument readily convertible into
cash at face value, either with the town or in a non-interest bearing escrow
account with a financial institution designated as an official depository of
the town. The use of any instrument other than cash shall be subject to the
approval of the Board of Aldermen. The amount of deposit shall not exceed 125%
of the cost, as estimated by the subdivider in conjunction with the Board of
Aldermen for installing all required improvements. If cash or other instrument
is deposited in escrow with a financial institution as provided above, then the
subdivider shall file with the town an agreement between the financial
institution and himself guaranteeing the following:
            1.   That said escrow account shall be held in trust until released
by the Board of Aldermen and may not be used or pledged by the subdivider in
any other matter during the term of the escrow; and
            2.   That in the case of a failure on the part of the subdivider to
complete said improvements, the financial institution shall, upon notification
by the town and submission by the town to the financial institution of an
engineer's estimate of the amount needed to complete the improvements,
immediately either pay to the Town of Wrightsville Beach the funds estimated to
complete the improvements, up to the full balance of the escrow account, or
deliver to the town any other instruments fully endorsed or otherwise made
payable to the town.
      (2)   A developer shall demonstrate reasonable, good-faith progress
toward completion of the required improvements that are secured by the
performance guarantee. If the improvements are not completed to the
specifications of Wrightsville Beach, and the current performance guarantee is
likely to expire prior to completion of the required improvements, the
performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance guarantee issued,
for an additional period. An extension under this subdivision shall only be for
a duration necessary to complete the required improvements.
      (3)   Upon default, meaning failure on the part of the subdivider to
complete the required improvements in a timely manner as spelled out in the
performance bond or escrow agreement, then the surety, or the financial
institution holding the escrow account shall, if requested by the town, pay all
or any portion of the bond or escrow fund to the Town of Wrightsville Beach up
to the amount needed to complete the improvements based on an engineering
estimate. Upon payment, the Wrightsville Beach Board of Aldermen, in its
discretion, may expend such portion of said funds as it deems necessary to
complete all or any portion of the required improvements. The town shall return
to the subdivider any funds not spent in completing the improvements.
      (4)   The town may release a portion of any security posted as the
improvements are completed and recommended for approval by the UDO
Administrator. Within 30 days after receiving the UDO Administrator's
recommendation, the Board of Aldermen shall approve or not approve said
improvements. If the Board of Aldermen approves said improvements, then it
shall immediately release any security posted.
      (5)   For subdivisions which are underwritten or constructed with federal
funds and for which the specifications for facilities or improvements are equal
to or of a higher standard than those required by the town, the bond-posting
requirement may be waived and the final plat approved prior to completion of
facilities or improvements.
