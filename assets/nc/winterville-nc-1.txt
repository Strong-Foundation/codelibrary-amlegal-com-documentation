(1992 Code, § 52.04)
§ 52.05 WATER AND SANITARY SEWER EXTENSION POLICY.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   These regulations set forth the conditions under which water and/or
sewer service may be extended to property which is without service. It is the
intent of these regulations to allocate, to the extent practical, the cost of
extensions to those property owners served by the extensions. The full costs of
facilities required within subdivisions and developments shall be borne by the
subdivider or developer.
      (2)   It is not the intent of these regulations to limit the town from
making any water or sewer extension which it deems is in the best interest of
the town.
      (3)   No sewer extensions or service from existing sewers to lots lying
outside the town corporate limits will be provided until the property owner has
filed a petition of voluntary annexation with the town.
      (4)   At the discretion of the Board of Alderpersons, the above
referenced petition for voluntary annexation may be held in abeyance for a
maximum of two years.
   (B)   Subdivisions/developments.
      (1)   A developer or subdivider requesting extensions from existing
facilities to or within the developer's property shall pay the full cost of the
facilities within the subdivision, including all connections, taps, fire
hydrants, loops necessary for fire protection and services to all lots within
the property, except as hereinafter provided.
      (2)   Board of Alderpersons approval of plans for water and sewer
extensions is subject to existing systems having capacity to serve the proposed
extension. Any request for water or sewer outside the town limits to serve a
proposed development shall be reviewed and approved by the Board of
Alderpersons prior to any commitment for service.
      (3)   Extensions from existing facilities to the developer's property may
be provided by the town, subject to funds being available, economic
feasibility, and easement acquisition.
      (4)   All preliminary planning, final planning, construction, testing and
acceptance of water and sewer facilities shall be in compliance with the town's
standard requirements and procedures. When the town is to share in any portion
of the extension costs, the developer shall provide adequate evidence that
competitive bids and costs have been received for the work involved.
      (5)   As a condition of providing service to proposed developments or
subdivisions, the town reserves the right to require the installation of water
and sewer facilities in addition to or in sizes in excess of those which would
be required to serve the proposed development or subdivision. Approval of the
Board of Alderpersons is required prior to any such proposed enhancements.
Following completion and acceptance of water and sewer facilities, the town may
reimburse the developer or subdivider those additional installation and
material costs incurred as a result of the required changes.
      (6)   All water and sewer facilities installed by the developer which are
to be owned and maintained by the town shall be installed in dedicated streets,
dedicated public right-of-way, or in easements provided by the developer in
accordance with the requirements of the town.
   (C)   Extensions by the town. The Board of Alderpersons may at its
discretion extend water and/or sewer mains. The rationale for which the Board
may elect to do so includes but is not limited to connecting to an additional
source of supply or storage tank, to loop lines to improve water pressure and
water quality, to improve fire flows, to connect to another sewage disposal
area, improve transmission of sewage for the existing system, to serve a
facility owned by the town, to reach unserved property, to save money in
anticipation of high construction costs later, or to serve a facility it deems
in the best interest of the citizens of the town to serve.
   (D)   Extensions to serve existing subdivisions, developments or properties.
      (1)   The Board of Alderpersons may at its discretion extend water and/or
sewer facilities to serve an existing subdivision, development or properties.
The Board may elect to consider the extensions to properties within the town
limits or to properties beyond the town limits upon receipt of a petition for
voluntary annexation of the properties to be served or upon decision by the
Board to pursue involuntary annexation of the properties.
      (2)   Upon completion of water and/or sewer facilities installed under
this section and, when applicable, after the effective date of annexation, the
properties served shall be subject to assessment for the costs of the
facilities. The assessments shall be made on an equal rate per lot being served
or subject to being served. Upon completion of the facilities, the Board of
Alderpersons shall ascertain the total project cost which may include
construction costs, the cost of all necessary legal services, engineering
services, the amount of interest paid during construction, costs of rights-of-
way, and costs of publication of notices and resolutions. Assessments shall be
made based on 66-2/3% of the total project cost to be borne by the properties
being served or subject to being served and 33-1/3%of the total project cost to
be borne by the town. In addition to the project cost assessment, each property
connecting to the facilities shall pay the regular tapping fees according to
the town fee schedule. All connections to sewer facilities shall also be
subject to sewer access fee charges as established by the Contentnea
Metropolitan Sewerage District (CMSD).
   (E)   Ownership of facilities.
      (1)   All water and sewer extensions connected to the town's system
shall, upon acceptance by the Board of Alderpersons, become the property of the
town.
      (2)   Water and sewer extensions installed by a developer or subdivider
shall, upon acceptance by the Board of Alderpersons, become the property of the
town. All facilities so constructed shall be warranted by the developer or
subdivider for 12 months following acceptance.

which is proposed to be developed in phases, may request that fees be assessed
on the basis of the acreage of each phase as service is requested. This request
may be granted provided the following conditions are met:
      (1)   All phases are identified on the preliminary plan approved by the
Planning and Zoning Board;
      (2)   Service is to be provided from an existing sewer;
      (3)   Each payment must be for one or more complete phases as necessary
such that, except for the final payment, no payment will be made for an area of
less than ten acres; and
      (4)   The acreage fee must be paid for a phase prior to service being
provided to any portion thereof.
   (D)   The owner of a parcel of land containing more than one acre may
request that sewer acreage fees be charged for only the developed portion (one
acre minimum) of the property. The request must be made in writing to the Town
Manager and be accompanied by a map which accurately describes the total parcel
and the developed portion, along with their respective acreage. Payment for the
total acreage shall be required unless the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The property is used for single-family residential or institutional
(church, unit of government, non-profit or charitable organization, and the
like) purposes only;
      (2)   Only domestic wastewater will be discharged to the sanitary sewer
system;
      (3)   The requested service is for a facility which either existed or was
under construction prior to the availability of sewer service. (A facility will
be considered under construction as of the issuance date of the building
permit); and
      (4)   The property is not proposed to be subdivided within five years of
the date service is requested.
   (E)   The sewer acreage fee shall be adjusted from time to time by the town
to reflect current costs. The sewer acreage fee shall be as follows:
      (1)   For any parcel to which service is available at the property line
from the existing sewer system, the sewer acreage fee shall be $900 per acre;
      (2)   For any parcel which requires an extension of the existing sewer
system and the customer pays the entire cost of the extension, the sewer
acreage fee shall be $900 per acre; and
      (3)   For any parcel which requires an extension of the existing sewer
system and the town participates in the funding of the extension, the sewer
acreage fee shall be $1,200 per acre.

(1992 Code, § 53.04)
§ 53.05 CREDIT HISTORY.
   The town will maintain a confidential credit history on all customers based
on payment of utility bills. A customer's credit history shall be classified
good unless the customer has appeared on the cut-off list, though not
necessarily cut-off, during any preceding 12-month period, or has issued a bad
check to the town during any preceding 12-month period. The cut-off list will
be prepared each month by the town from customers who fail to pay utility
accounts by the final payment date. A list of bad checks received by the town
shall be kept on a continual basis.
(1992 Code, § 53.05)
§ 53.06 DEPOSITS AND SERVICE DISCONNECT.
   (A)   Not withstanding the initial deposits specified in §§
53.02 and
53.03, any customer, residential, commercial or industrial, whose payment
history becomes not good shall pay the deposit as required to protect the town
from loss of revenue. Any customer who fails to make deposits as required,
within ten-days’ written notice, shall be subject to disconnection of service
until the deposit has been made.
   (B)   Any customer whose service has been disconnected because the meter,
wires or other apparatus has been tampered with in any way, shall pay the
deposit, in addition to penalties and re-connection fees, as required to
protect the town from loss of revenue.
   (C)   Deposits will draw no interest while held by the town.
   (D)   All recognized church organizations and public school facilities shall
be exempt from utility deposits, except where the Town Board of Alderpersons
should decide that an unusual situation would warrant such a deposit.
(1992 Code, § 53.06)
§ 53.07 UNCOLLECTABLE DEBT.
   (A)   The town has determined criteria for identifying and writing off
uncollectable debt related to town-operated utilities.

town’s staff with specific direction related to the removing of uncollectable
debt from the town’s utility receivable ledger.
      (1)   The utility account balance must be a minimum of three years old.
      (2)   The utility account must have been sent to the North Carolina Debt
Set Off Program.
      (3)   The utility account must have been sent to a collections agency for
active collection.
      (4)   The writing off of the receivable balance on utility accounts does
not stop the town from collecting debt owed by the customer.
   (C)   This policy establishes limits, criteria and guidelines that will
ensure the town’s utility accounts receivable balances are managed properly,
and are not harmful to the town's fiscal health. This policy will enable the
town to keep its credit rating at a high standard.

TOWN OF WINTERVILLE         DATE:
Due to (Describe situation, such as abnormally dry weather conditions, well
failure, etc.) the Town of Winterville, North Carolina is asking its customers
to conserve water. Voluntary conservation is needed now to ensure water is
available for critical uses and to prevent the need for mandatory restrictions.
By using voluntary water consecrations practices in the home and garden,
consumers can cut water use by as much as 20 percent with very little
difficulty or inconvenience.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact
                                        
Water Saving Tips
Kitchen
-   Eliminate leaks. A dripping faucet can waste 3,600 gallons a year.
-   Install faucet aerators.
-   Keep a pitcher of cold water in the fridge instead of running water until
it is cold.
-   Do not leave the water running while rinsing dishes.
-   Only use the dishwasher with full loads, and use the water-saver setting,
if available.
Bathroom
-   Don't leave the water running while shaving or brushing teeth.
-   Install a water-filled plastic jug or a toilet tank bag in your toilet tank
to reduce the water used per flush. Do not use a brick, which may crumble and
prevent the flapper from closing properly.
-   Check for leaks by dropping a small amount of food coloring in the toilet
tank. If color appears in the bowl, you have a leak.
-   Take shorter showers
-   Install water-saving showerheads.
Outdoors
-   Water in the morning or evening, not in the heat of the day, to prevent
evaporation.
-   Avoid watering on windy days.
-   Water slowly & thoroughly to promote deep roots and healthy plants.
-   Water close to the roots of plants so that there’s little waste and
evaporation.
-   Add compost and other organic matter to your soil to improve its water-
holding capacity.
-   Choose plants that don't require a lot of water.
-   Mulch all plant beds to reduce evaporation, weeds, and soil temperature.
-   Limit car washing. Use a bucket and hose with spray attachment.
-   Use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 55.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be officially known as “The Phase II Storm Water
Ordinance.” It is referred to herein as “this chapter.”
(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)
§ 55.02 AUTHORITY.
   The Town Council is authorized to adopt this chapter pursuant to North
Carolina law, including but not limited to, Article 14, Section 5 of the
Constitution of North Carolina; the Town Charter; G.S. 143-214.7, and rules
promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder; Session Law
2004-163; G.S. 160A-174, G.S. 160A-185.
(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)
§ 55.03 FINDINGS.
   It is hereby determined mat:
   (A)   Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil
erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and
sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
   (B)   These changes in storm water runoff contribute to increased quantities
of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to
public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and
   (C)   These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design
and well-planned controls to manage storm water runoff from development sites.
   (D)   Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (“Clean Water
Act”) and federal Phase II Storm Water Rules promulgated under it, as well as
rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in
response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas,
including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum storm water controls such as
those included in this chapter.
   (E)   Therefore, the Town Council establishes this set of water quality and
quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law
regarding control of storm water runoff and discharge.
(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)
§ 55.04 PURPOSE.
   (A)   General. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and
enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by
establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects
of increased post-development storm water runoff and nonpoint and point source
pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit
discharges into municipal storm water systems. It has been determined that
proper management of construction-related and post-development storm water
runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure;
safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare; and protect water and
aquatic resources.
   (B)   Specific. This chapter seeks to meet its general purpose through the
following specific objectives and means:
      (1)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect
the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
      (2)   Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as
practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, streambank
erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream
temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic
habitats;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development storm water management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of storm water
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function and use of structural storm water BMPs that may be used to meet the
minimum post-development storm water management standards;
      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices,
such as the use of vegetated conveyances for storm water and the preservation
of greenspace, riparian buffers and other conservation areas, to the maximum
extent practicable;
      (6)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural storm water BMPs to ensure that
they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose
no threat to public safety;
      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of storm water management plans, for the inspection of
approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.
      (8)   Coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural
areas with Chapter 154, Subdivision Regulations.
      (9)   Controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate storm
water system.
(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)
§ 55.05 APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   General. Beginning with and subsequent to its effective date, this
chapter shall be applicable to all development and redevelopment, including but
not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading
applications, unless exempt pursuant to division (B) below.

not part of a larger common plan of development or sale is exempt from the
provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Development and redevelopment that disturb less than one acre are
not exempt if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development
or sale, even though multiple, separate or distinct activities take place at
different times on different schedules.
      (4)   Activities that are exempt from permit requirements of Section 404
of the federal Clean Water Act, as specified in 40 C.F.R. 232 (primarily,
ongoing farming and forestry activities), are exempt from the provisions of
this chapter.
   (C)   No development or redevelopment until compliance and permit.  
      (1)   No development or redevelopment shall occur except in compliance
with the provisions of this chapter or unless exempted.

structural BMPs required pursuant to this chapter, and that are to be or are
owned and maintained by a homeowners’ association, property owners’
association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance
agreement shall include all of the following provisions:
      (1)   Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and
maintain the storm water control and management facilities.
      (2)   Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for
sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major
repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not
performing adequately or as intended, or are not properly maintained, the town,
at its sole discretion, may remedy the situation. In such instances, the town
shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent
by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative
replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided
that the town shall first consent to the expenditure.
      (3)   Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the
escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits,
whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an
amount equal to 15% of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs.
Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into
the escrow account within the first five years, and the full amount shall be
deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural
BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of
the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the
escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced
in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking
fund budget.
      (4)   The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund
the escrow account may be varied by the town, depending on the design and
materials of the storm water control and management facility.
      (5)   Granting to the town a right of entry to inspect, monitor,
maintain, repair and reconstruct structural BMPs.
      (6)   Allowing the town to recover from the association and its members
any and all costs the town expends to maintain or repair the structural BMPs or
to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay the town all of its
expended costs, after 45 days written notice, shall constitute a breach of the
agreement. In case of a deficiency, the town shall thereafter be entitled to
bring an action against the association and its members to pay, or foreclose
upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement against the property, or both.
Interest, collection costs and attorney fees shall be added to the recovery.
      (7)   A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the town to
maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the town shall not be liable to any
person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs.
      (8)   A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish,
limit, or restrict the right of the town to enforce any of its ordinances as
authorized by law.
      (9)   A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the town for any
costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP, unless the
town has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for the
BMP, and has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out
that maintenance.

inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other
notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are
not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges,
surface water, groundwater, and material or water in BMPs; and evaluating the
condition of BMPs.
   (B)   If the owner at occupant of any property refuses to permit such
inspection, the Storm Water Administrator shall proceed to obtain an
administrative search warrant pursuant to G.S. 15-27.2 or its successor. No
person shall obstruct, hamper or interfere with the Storm Water Administrator
while carrying out his or her official duties.
(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)
§ 55.63 PERFORMANCE SECURITY FOR INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   May be required. The town may, at its discretion, require the
submittal of a performance security or bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of
credit or other acceptable legal arrangement prior to issuance of a permit, in
order to ensure that the structural BMPs are:
      (1)   Installed by the permit holder as required by the approved storm
water management plan; and/or
      (2)   Maintained by the owner as required by the operation and
maintenance agreement.
   (B)   Amount.
      (1)   Installation. The amount of an installation performance security
shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs approved under the
permit, plus 25%.
      (2)   Maintenance. The amount of a maintenance performance security shall
be the present value of an annuity of perpetual duration, based on a reasonable
estimate of the annual cost of inspection, operation and maintenance of the
BMPs approved under the permit, at a discount rate that reflects the
jurisdiction’s cost of borrowing, minus a reasonable estimate of long-term
inflation.
   (C)   Uses of performance security.
      (1)   Forfeiture provisions. The performance security shall contain
forfeiture provisions for failure, after proper notice, to complete work within
the time specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions that may be required
of the applicant or owner in accordance with this chapter, approvals issued
pursuant to this chapter, or an operation and maintenance agreement established
pursuant to this chapter.
      (2)   Default. Upon default of the owner to construct, maintain, repair
and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the
applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement, the Storm Water
Administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of the security to make
necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of
funds shall only be made after requesting the owner to comply with the permit
or maintenance agreement, In the event of a default triggering the use of
installation performance security, the town shall not return any of the unused
deposited cash funds or other security, which shall be retained for
maintenance.
      (3)   Costs in excess of performance security. If it takes action upon
such failure by the applicant or owner, the town may collect from the applicant
or owner the difference between the amount of the reasonable cost of such
action and the amount of the security held, in addition to any other penalties
or damages due.
      (4)   Refund. Within 60 days of the final approval, the installation
performance security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, except
any amount attributable to the cost (plus 25%) of landscaping installation and
ongoing maintenance associated with the BMPs covered by the security. Any such
landscaping shall be inspected one year after installation, with replacement
for compliance with the approved plans and specifications and, if in
compliance, the portion of the financial security attributable to landscaping
shall be released.

maintenance agreement or conservation easement (whichever is applicable),
pertaining to every structural BMP, shall be referenced on the final plat, and
shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds upon final plat approval.
If no subdivision plat is recorded for the site, then the operation and
maintenance agreement or conservation easement shall be recorded with the
county Register of Deeds so as to appear in the chain of title of all
subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching principles.
   (B)   Signage. Where appropriate in the determination of the Storm Water
Administrator to assure compliance with this chapter, structural BMPs shall be
posted with a conspicuous sign stating who is responsible for required

meaning set forth in this section, unless other provisions of this chapter
specifically indicate otherwise.
   BUILT-UPON AREA (BUA). That portion of a development project that is covered
by impervious or partially impervious surface, including but not limited to:
buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots, and paths;
and recreation facilities such as tennis courts. BUILT-UPON AREA does not
include a wooden slatted deck, the water area of a swimming pool, or pervious
or partially pervious paving material to the extent that the paving material
absorbs water or allows water to infiltrate through the paving material.
   DEPARTMENT. The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural
Resources.
   DESIGN MANUAL. The storm water DESIGN MANUAL approved for use in Phase II
jurisdictions by the Department for the proper implementation of the
requirements of the federal Phase II storm water program. All references herein
to the DESIGN MANUAL are to the latest published edition or revision.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any land-disturbing activity that increases the amount of
built-upon area or that otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation
into the soil.
   DIVISION. The Division of Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources in the
Department.
   HIGH-DENSITY PROJECT. Any project that exceeds the low-density threshold for
dwelling units per acre or built-upon area.
   LARGER COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT OR SALE. Any area where multiple separate
and distinct construction or land-disturbing activities will occur under one
plan. A PLAN is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not
limited to, a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan
application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design)
or physical demarcation (including but not limited to, boundary signs, lot
stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur
on a specific plot.
   LOW-DENSITY PROJECT.
      (1)   For a project that is not located within one-half mile of and
draining to shellfish resource waters, the project is a LOW-DENSITY PROJECT if
it has no more than two dwelling units per acre or 24% built-upon area (BUA)
for all residential and non-residential development.
      (2)   For a project that is located within one-half mile of and draining
to shellfish resource waters, the project is a LOW-DENSITY PROJECT only if it
contains no more than 12% built-upon area (BUA).
      (3)   A project with an overall density at or below the relevant low-
density threshold, but containing areas with a density greater than the overall
project density, may be considered low density as long as the project meets or
exceeds the post-construction model practices for low-density projects, and
locates the higher density in upland areas and away from surface waters and
drainageways to the maximum extent practicable.
   ONE-YEAR, 24-HOUR STORM. The surface runoff resulting from a 24-hour
rainfall of an intensity expected to be equaled or exceeded, on average, once
in 12 months and with a duration of 24 hours.
   OWNER. The legal or beneficial OWNER of land, including but not limited to,
a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, long-term or
commercial lessee, or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights in
the property or having legal power of management and control of the property.
OWNER shall include long-term commercial tenants; management entities, such as
those charged with or engaged in the management of properties for profit; and
every person or entity having joint ownership of the property. A secured lender
not in possession of the property does not constitute an OWNER, unless the
secured lender is included within the meaning of OWNER under another
description in this definition, such as a management entity.
   REDEVELOPMENT. Any development on previously-developed land, other than a
rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and
provides equal or greater storm water control than the previous development.
   SHELLFISH RESOURCE WATERS. Class SA waters that contain an average
concentration of 500  parts per million of natural chloride ion. Average
concentration is determined by averaging the chloride concentrations of five
water samples taken one-half mile downstream from the project site that are
taken on separate days, within one hour of high tide, and not within 48 hours
following a rain event. The chloride ion concentrations are to be determined by
a state-certified laboratory.
   STRUCTURAL BMP. A physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter
pollutants from storm water runoff; to alter or reduce storm water runoff
velocity, amount, timing or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-
development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of
these goals. STRUCTURAL BMP includes physical practices, such as constructed
wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other
methods installed or created on real property. STRUCTURAL BMP is synonymous
with “structural practice,” “storm water control facility,” “storm water
control practice,” “storm water treatment practice,” “storm water management
practice,” “storm water control measures,” “structural storm water treatment
systems,” and similar terms used in this chapter.
   SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS. For the purposes of determining whether sufficient
progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following
construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan
shall occur: obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a
continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; or installation
and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the
construction of a building foundation. For the purpose of determining whether
an approved plan is null and void, SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS is not necessarily the
same as “substantial expenditures” used for determining vested rights pursuant
to applicable law.
(Ord. 14-O-312, passed 7-14-2014)

expenses related to the restoration, loss, damage or any other liability that
may be incurred as a result of the spill or leak, nor shall such notification
relieve any person from other liability that may be imposed by state or other
law.
   (D)   Nuisance. Illicit discharges and illicit connections that exist within
the town limits are hereby found, deemed and declared to be dangerous or
prejudicial to the public health or public safety, and are found, deemed and

   (B)   It shall be unlawful to have more than one junked motor vehicle, as

   (D)   Subject to the provisions of division (E) below, upon investigation,
the authorizing official may order the removal of a junked motor vehicle as
defined in §
90.01 after finding in writing that the aesthetic benefits of removing the
vehicle outweigh the burdens imposed on the private property owner. The
findings shall be based on a balancing of the monetary loss of the apparent

community, neighborhood or area appearance. The following, among other relevant
factors, may be considered:
      (1)   Protection of property values;
      (2)   Promotion of tourism and other economic development opportunities;

entirely concealed from public view from a public street and from abutting
premises by acceptable covering.
      (2)   Concealment. The authorizing official of the town has authority to
determine whether any junked motor vehicle is adequately concealed as required
by this provision. The covering must remain in good repair and must not be
allowed to deteriorate. The covering or enclosure must be compatible with the
objectives sought to be obtained in this chapter.
      (3)   More than one junked motor vehicle. Any other junked vehicles(s)
must be kept in a garage or building structure that provides a complete
enclosure so that the junked motor vehicle(s) cannot be seen from a public
street or abutting property. A garage or building structure means either a
lawful, nonconforming use or a garage or building structure erected pursuant to
the lawful issuance of a building permit and which has been constructed in
accordance with all zoning and building code regulations.

90.99
§ 90.06 REMOVAL OF ABANDONED, NUISANCE OR JUNKED MOTOR VEHICLES; PRE-TOWING
NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Except as set forth in §
90.07, an abandoned, nuisance or junked vehicle which is to be removed shall be
towed only after notice to the registered owner or person entitled to
possession of the vehicle. In the case of a nuisance vehicle or a junked motor
vehicle, if the names and mailing addresses of the registered owner or person
entitled to the possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee or occupant of
the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be ascertained in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given first by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivered by the authorizing official
or his or her designee on a form approved by the Town Attorney. The person who
mails or delivers the notice(s) shall retain a written record to show the name
(s) and address(es) to which mailed and the date of mailing or delivery. If the
name(s) and address(es) cannot be ascertained, or the vehicle to be removed is
an abandoned motor vehicle, notice shall be given by affixing on the windshield
or some other conspicuous place on the vehicle a notice indicating that the
vehicle will be removed by the town on a specified date (no sooner than seven
days after the notice is affixed). The notice shall state that the vehicle will
be removed by the town on a specified date, no sooner than seven days after the
notice is affixed or mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by the owner or legal
possessor prior to that time.
   (B)   With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property, nuisance
vehicles and junked motor vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if
the registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the
vehicle, but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is abandoned,
a nuisance vehicle or in the case of a junked motor vehicle that the aesthetic
benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, the appeal shall be made
to the Board of Alderpersons, and further proceedings to remove the vehicle
shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and decided.
(1992 Code, § 90.06) (Ord. O-40-05129697, passed 5-12-1997; Ord. 01-52, passed

§ 90.07 EXCEPTIONS TO PRIOR NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The requirement that notice be given to the removal of an abandoned,
nuisance or junked motor vehicle may, as determined by the authorizing
official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a special need for
prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to otherwise maintain and
protect the public safety and welfare. The findings shall, in all cases, be
entered by the authorizing official in the appropriate daily records.
   (B)   Circumstances justifying the removal of vehicles without prior notice
include:
      (1)   Vehicles abandoned on the streets. For vehicles left on public
streets and highways, the Police Department may determine that immediate
removal of the vehicles may be warranted when they are:
         (a)   Obstructing traffic;
         (b)   Parked in violation of a code provision or ordinance of the town
prohibiting or restricting parking;
         (c)   Parked in a no-stopping or standing zone;
         (d)   Parked in loading zones;
         (e)   Parked in bus zones; and/or
         (f)   Parked in violation of temporary parking restrictions imposed
under code sections.
      (2)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles.  With respect to abandoned or
nuisance vehicles left on town-owned property other than streets and highways
and on private property, the vehicles may be removed without giving prior
notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing official finds a
special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health,
safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation, the
circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to
business and residences, vehicles parked in a location or manner as to pose a
traffic hazard and vehicles causing damage to public or private property.
(1992 Code, § 90.07) (Ord. O-40-05129697, passed 5-12-1997; Ord. 01-52, passed

§ 90.08 REMOVAL OF VEHICLES; POST-TOWING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Any abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle which has been ordered
removed may, as directed by the town, be removed to a storage garage or area by
a tow truck operator or towing business contracted to perform the services for
the town. Whenever a vehicle is removed, the authorizing town official shall
immediately notify the last known registered owner of the vehicle, the notice
to include the following:
      (1)   The description of the removed vehicle;
      (2)   The location where the vehicle is stored;
      (3)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;
      (4)   The procedure the owner must follow to redeem the vehicle; and
      (5)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable cause
hearing on the removal.
   (B)   The town shall attempt to give notice to the vehicle owner by
telephone; however, whether or not the owner is reached by telephone, written
notice including the information set forth in division (A) above shall also be
mailed to the registered owner's last known address unless this notice is
waived in writing by the vehicle owner or his or her agent.
   (C)   If the vehicle is registered in North Carolina, notice shall be given
within 24 hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the state, notice shall be
given to the registered owner within 72 hours from removal of the vehicle.
   (D)   Whenever an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle is removed,
and the vehicle has no valid registration or registration plates, the
authorizing town official shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the
vehicle identification number, to determine the last known registered owner of
the vehicle and to notify him or her of the information set forth in division
(A) above.
(1992 Code, § 90.08) (Ord. O-40-05129697, passed 5-12-1997)
§ 90.09 RIGHT TO A PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING BEFORE SALE OR FINAL DISPOSITION OF
VEHICLE.
   After removal of an abandoned vehicle, nuisance vehicle or junked motor
vehicle, the owner or any other person entitled to possession is entitled to a
hearing for the purpose of determining if probable cause existed for removing
the vehicle. A request for the hearing must be filed in writing with the county
magistrate designated by the Chief District Court Judge to receive the hearing
request. The magistrate will set the hearing within 72 hours of receipt of the
request, and the hearing will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of
G.S. § 20-219.11.
(1992 Code, § 90.09) (Ord. O-40-05129697, passed 5-12-1997)
§ 90.10 REDEMPTION OF VEHICLE DURING PROCEEDINGS.
   At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause
hearing, the owner may obtain possession of the removed vehicle by paying the
towing fee, including any storage charges or by posting a bond for double the
amount of the fees and charges to the tow truck operator or towing business
having custody of the removed vehicle. Upon regaining possession of a vehicle,
the owner or person entitled to the possession of the vehicle shall not allow
or engage in further violations of this chapter.

   Any abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle which is not claimed by the
owner or other party entitled to possession will be disposed of by the tow
truck operator or towing business having custody of the vehicle. Disposition of
such a vehicle shall be carried out in coordination with the town and in
accordance with G.S. Ch. 44A, Art. 1.
(1992 Code, § 90.11) (Ord. O-40-05129697, passed 5-12-1997)
§ 90.12 CONDITIONS ON REMOVAL OF VEHICLES FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   As a general policy, the town will not remove a vehicle from private
property if the owner, occupant or lessee of the property could have the
vehicle removed under applicable state law procedures. In no case will a
vehicle be removed by the town from private property without a written request
of the owner, occupant or lessee, except in those cases where a vehicle is a
nuisance vehicle or is a junked motor vehicle which has been ordered removed by
the town authorizing official. The town may require any person requesting the
removal of an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle from private property
to indemnify the town against any loss, expense or liability incurred because
of the removal, storage or sale thereof.
(1992 Code, § 90.12) (Ord. O-40-05129697, passed 5-12-1997)

mile of the town limits, a code enforcement officer shall have the following
authority:

subchapter shall be served on the owner or property manager of the identified
property by either hand delivery or certified mail and regular mail. Service by
mail shall be deemed complete by depositing the notice or order in the mail at
the address listed in the Pitt County tax records. When the manner of service

of mailing, service is deemed sufficient. The person mailing the notice or
order by regular mail shall certify that fact and the date of the mailing, and

that exist on the identified property constitute graffiti and such shall be
abated within ten calendar days of the date of the notification and that
failure to abate or remove the graffiti shall result in the assessment of the
costs of abatement or removal, imposition of administrative fees, and the
assessment of a civil penalty as identified in this chapter. The code
enforcement officer may afford the owner additional time to remove or abate the
graffiti if such failure was caused by weather conditions or other factors as
determined by the code enforcement officer not to have been within the control
of the owner.

refuses to abate the declared nuisance, then the code enforcement officer shall

writing to the Board of Adjustment and the appeal fee paid. Appeals of decision
by the Board of Adjustment shall be as provided by state law.
   (G)   When any public nuisance as set forth in this subchapter requires
immediate abatement to avoid and prevent an immediate and dangerous threat to
the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the town and would
degrade adjoining properties as determined by the code enforcement officer, the
nuisance may be summarily removed and abated by the town without prior notice
to the property owner, but the owner shall be responsible for all abatement
costs, administrative fees, and civil penalties.

   (E)   Following oral or written notice by the person in charge of an area
described in §
95.060(C) and (D), or his or her designee, failure to cease smoking or using

action in the general court of justice in the nature of a suit to collect a
debt in addition to any other remedy available under §§

reasonably prudent person would recognize as likely to unreasonably disturb
persons in the vicinity.

motorcycle, bus or other vehicle while not in motion, except as a danger signal
if another vehicle is approaching apparently out of control, or if in motion

unreasonably loud or harsh sound; and the sounding of the device for an
unreasonable period of time that a reasonably prudent person would recognize as
likely to unreasonably disturb persons in the vicinity.

the issuance of a permit. If the applicant is found to have an out-of-state

   (C)   Board of Alderpersons to issue certificates. The Board of Alderpersons
shall have the power to, and it shall be its duty to order the issuance or the

operation of taxicabs. The Board may attach to the exercise of the privileges
granted by the certificates the terms and conditions as in its judgement the
public convenience and necessity may require.
   (D)   Nature and duration of certificate. A certificate shall constitute a
franchise from the town for the operation of taxicabs within the town, subject

Applications for renewal shall be filed at the expiration of the previous
three-year franchise and hearings upon the question of renewal shall be
conducted as provided in division (F) below.
   (E)   Factors considered in issuing permit. In determining whether the
public convenience and necessity require the franchising of the taxicab or
taxicabs, the Board of Alderpersons shall, among other things take into
consideration the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the public convenience and necessity requires the proposed
or additional taxicabs within the town;
      (2)   The financial responsibility of the applicant and the likelihood of
the proposed service being permanent, responsible and satisfactory;
      (3)   The number and condition of equipment;
      (4)   The schedule of proposed rates to be charged;
      (5)   The number of taxicabs now operated within the town and the demand
for increased service, if any;

off-street parking of the taxicabs;
      (7)   The experience of the applicant in the taxicab business; and
      (8)   The other relative facts as may be deemed necessary or advisable to
consider.
   (F)   Investigation. Before making any decision with respect to the issuance
of any certificate of convenience and necessity, the Board of Alderpersons or a
committee thereof, shall make a full and complete investigation of all
pertinent facts, and may, if it so desires, subpoena witnesses and utilize the
services of the Chief of Police or any other officer or employee of the town.

least once in a newspaper of general circulation, or posted for ten days in
three public places within the town, a notice setting forth the name of the
applicant and the purpose, day, time and place of the hearing. The cost of the
notice will be paid in advance by the applicant.
   (H)   Burden of proof. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to
establish the fact that the public convenience and necessity requires the
operation of the taxicabs specified in his or her application, as well as other
facts requisite to the granting of a certificate.
   (I)   Failure to begin operations. If a certificate is granted to an
applicant, and the applicant fails to begin operation in accordance with the
