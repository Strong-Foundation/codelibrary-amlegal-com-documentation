CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL PROGRAM
§ 51.40 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The purpose of this cross connection control subchapter is to define
the authority of the Town of Ranlo Water as the water purveyor in the
elimination of all cross connections within its public potable water supply.
   (B)   This subchapter shall apply to all users connected to the Town of
Ranlo Water public potable water supply regardless of whether the user is
located within the county or outside of the county.
   (C)   This subchapter will comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act
(PL 93-523), the North Carolina State Administrative Code (15A NCAC 08C), and
the North Carolina State Building Code (Volume II) as they pertain to cross
connections with the public water supply.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 51.41 OBJECTIVES.
   The specific objectives of this cross connection control article for the
Town of Ranlo Water are as follows:
   (A)   To protect the public potable water supply of the county against
actual or potential contamination by isolating within the consumer's water
system contaminants or pollutants which could, under adverse conditions,
backflow through uncontrolled cross connections into the public water system;
   (B)   To eliminate or control existing cross connections, actual or
potential, between the consumer's potable water system and nonpotable or
industrial piping system; and
   (C)   To provide a continuing inspection program of cross connection control
which will systematically and effectively control all actual or potential cross
connections which may be installed in the future.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 51.42 RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   Health agency. The state Department of Environment and Natural
Resources has the responsibility for promulgating and enforcing laws, rules,
regulations, and policies to be followed in carrying out an effective cross
connection control program. The state Department of Environment and Natural
Resources also has the primary responsibility of insuring that the water
purveyor operates the public potable water system free of actual or potential
sanitary hazards, including unprotected cross connections. The state Department
of Environment and Natural Resources has the further responsibility of insuring
that the water purveyor provides an approved water supply at the service
connection to the consumer's water system and, further, that he or she requires
the installation, testing, and maintenance of an approved backflow prevention
assembly on the service connection when required.
   (B)   Water purveyor. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, the
water purveyor's (the Town of Ranlo Water’s) responsibility to ensure a safe
water supply begins at the source and includes all of the public water
distribution system, including the service connection, and ends at the point of
delivery to the consumer's water system. In addition, the water purveyor shall
exercise reasonable vigilance to ensure that the consumer has taken the proper
steps to protect the public potable water system. To ensure that the proper
precautions are taken, the Town of Ranlo Water is required to determine the
degree of hazard or potential hazard to the public potable water system; to
determine the degree of protection required; and to ensure proper containment
protection through an on-going inspection program. When it is determined that a
backflow prevention assembly is required for the protection of the public
system, the Town of Ranlo Water shall require the consumer, at the consumer's
expense, to install an approved backflow prevention assembly at each service
connection; to test immediately upon installation and thereafter at a frequency
as determined by the Town of Ranlo Water; to properly repair and maintain such
assembly or assemblies; and to keep adequate records of each test and
subsequent maintenance and repair, including materials and/or replacement
parts.
   (C)   Plumbing inspection. The plumbing inspection departments of the city
and the county have the responsibility to not only review building plans and
inspect plumbing as it is installed; but they have the explicit responsibility
of preventing cross connections from being designed and built into the plumbing
system within its jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests or
detects the potential for cross connections being made an integral part of the
plumbing system, the Plumbing Inspector has the responsibility, under the state
Building Code, for requiring that such cross connections be either eliminated
or provided with backflow prevention equipment approved by the state Building
Code. The Plumbing Inspector's responsibility begins at the point of delivery,
downstream of the first installed backflow prevention assembly, and continues
throughout the entire length of the consumer's water system. The Plan Inspector
should inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is
suspected that a cross connection might be made or where one is actually called
for by the plans. When such is discovered it shall be mandatory that a
suitable, approved backflow prevention assembly approved by the state Building
Code be required by the plans and be properly installed. The primary protection
assembly for containment purposes only shall have approval from the Town of
Ranlo Water, the state Building Code, and the state Department of Environment
and Natural Resources.
   (D)   Consumer. The consumer has the primary responsibility of preventing
pollutants and contaminants from entering his or her potable water system or
the public potable water system. The consumer's responsibility starts at the
point of delivery from the public potable water system and includes all of his
or her water system. The consumer, at his or her own expense, shall install,
operate, test, and maintain approved backflow prevention assemblies as directed
by the Town of Ranlo Water. The consumer shall maintain accurate records of
tests and repairs made to backflow prevention assemblies and shall maintain
such records for a minimum period of three years. The records shall be on forms
approved by the Town of Ranlo Water and shall include the list of materials or
replacement parts used. Following any repair, overhaul, repiping or relocation
of an assembly, the consumer shall have it tested to insure that it is in good
operating condition and will prevent backflow. Tests, maintenance and repairs
of backflow prevention assemblies shall be made by a certified backflow
prevention assembly tester.
   (E)   Certified backflow prevention assembly testers. When employed by the
consumer to test, repair, overhaul, or maintain backflow prevention assemblies,
a backflow prevention assembly tester will have the following responsibilities.
The tester will be responsible for making competent inspections and for
repairing or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies and making reports of
such repair to the consumer and responsible authorities on forms approved by
the Town of Ranlo Water. The tester shall include the list of materials or
replacement parts used. The tester shall be equipped with and be competent to
use all the necessary tools, gauges, manometers and other equipment necessary
to properly test, repair, and maintain backflow prevention assemblies. It will
be the tester's responsibility to insure that original manufactured parts are
used in the repair of or replacement of parts in a backflow prevention
assembly. It will be the tester's further responsibility not to change the
design, material or operational characteristics of an assembly during repair or
maintenance without prior approval of the Town of Ranlo Water. A certified
tester shall perform the work and be responsible for the competency and
accuracy of all tests and reports. A certified tester shall provide a copy of
all test and repair reports to the consumer and to the Town of Ranlo Water’s
Cross Connection Control Department within ten business days of any completed
test or repair work. A certified tester shall maintain such records for a
minimum period of three years. All certified backflow prevention assembly
testers must obtain and employ backflow prevention assembly test equipment
which has been evaluated and/or approved by the Town of Ranlo Water. All test
equipment shall be checked for accuracy annually, at a minimum, calibrated, if
necessary.

contractor, or have equivalent qualifications acceptable to the Town of Ranlo
Water and must hold a certificate of completion from an approved training
program in the testing and repair of backflow prevention assemblies.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE—APPROVED. A device used for isolation purposes
that has been shown to meet the design and performance standards of the
American Society of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE) and the American Water Works
Association (AWWA)
   BACK-PRESSURE BACKFLOW. Any elevation in the consumer water system, by pump,
elevation of piping, or steam and/or air pressure, above the supply pressure at
the point of delivery which would cause, or tend to cause, a reversal of the
normal direction of flow.
   BACK-SIPHONAGE BACKFLOW. A reversal of the normal direction of flow in the
pipeline due to a negative pressure (vacuum) being created in the supply line
with the backflow source subject to atmospheric pressure.
   CHECK VALVE—APPROVED. A check valve that is drip-tight in the normal
direction of flow when the inlet pressure is at least one psi and the outlet
pressure is zero. The check valve shall permit no leakage in a direction
reverse to the normal flow. The closure element (e.g. clapper, poppet, or other
design) shall be internally loaded to promote rapid and positive closure. An
approved check valve is only one component of an approved backflow prevention
assembly, i.e., pressure vacuum breaker, double check valve assembly, double
check detector assembly, reduced pressure principle assembly, or reduced
pressure detector assembly.
   CONSUMER. Any person, firm, or corporation using or receiving water from the
Town of Ranlo Water’s water system.
   CONSUMER'S POTABLE WATER SYSTEM. That portion of the privately owned potable
water system lying between the point of delivery and point of use and/or
isolation protection. This system will include all pipes, conduits, tanks,
receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey,
store, or use potable water.
   CONSUMER'S WATER SYSTEM. Any water system commencing at the point of
delivery and continuing throughout the consumer's plumbing system, located on
the consumer's premises, whether supplied by a public potable water or an
auxiliary water supply. The system or systems may be either a potable water
system or an industrial piping system.
   CONTAINMENT. Preventing the impairment of the public potable water supply by
installing an approved backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.
   CONTAMINATION. An impairment of the quality of the water which creates a

industrial fluids, or waste.
   CROSS CONNECTION. Any unprotected actual or potential connection or
structural arrangement between a public or a consumer's water system and any
other source or system through which it is possible to introduce any
contamination or pollution, other than the intended potable water with which
the system is supplied. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable
sections, swivel or change-over devices, and other temporary or permanent
devices through which or because of which "backflow" can or may occur are
considered to be CROSS CONNECTIONS.
   DOUBLE CHECK DETECTOR ASSEMBLY. A specially designed assembly composed of a
linesize proved double check valve assembly with a specific bypass water meter
and a meter-sized approved double check valve assembly. The meter shall
register (in U.S. gallons) accurately for only very low rates of flow and shall
show a registration for all rates of flow. This assembly shall only be used to
protect against a nonhealth hazard (i.e., pollutant).
   DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY. An assembly composed of two independently
acting, approved check valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves
attached at each end of the assembly and fitted with properly located test

of conditions within a system which can be classified as either a "pollutional"
(nonhealth) or a "contamination" (health) hazard.
   HAZARD—HEALTH. An actual or potential threat of contamination of a physical,
hazardous or toxic nature to the public or consumer's potable water system to
such a degree or intensity that there would be a danger to health.
   HAZARD—NONHEALTH. An actual or potential threat to the quality of the public
or the consumer's potable water system. A nonhealth hazard is one that, if
introduced into the public water supply system could be a nuisance to water
customers, but would not adversely affect human health.
   HAZARD—POLLUTIONAL. An actual or potential threat to the quality or the
potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but which would
not constitute a health or a system hazard, as defined. The maximum degree or
intensity of pollution to which the potable water system could be degraded
under this definition would cause a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable
or could cause minor damage to the system or its appurtenances.
   HEALTH AGENCY. The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
   INDUSTRIAL FLUIDS. Any fluid or solution which may be chemically,
biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration
such as would constitute a health or nonhealth hazard if introduced into a
public or consumer potable water system. Such fluids may include, but are not
limited to process waters; chemicals in fluid form; acids and alkalis; oils,
gases; and the like.
   INDUSTRIAL PIPING SYSTEM—CONSUMER'S. Any system used by the consumer for
transmission of or to confine or store any fluid, solid or gaseous substance
other than an approved water supply. Such a system would include all pipes,
conduits, tanks, receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to
produce, convey, or store substances which are or may be polluted or
contaminated.
   ISOLATION. The act of confining a localized hazard within a consumer's water
system by installing approved backflow prevention assemblies. Disclaimer: the
Town of Ranlo Water may make recommendations, upon facility inspection, as to
the usages of isolation devices/assemblies, but does not assume or have
responsibility whatsoever for such installations.

to the public street where the Town of Ranlo Water’s mains are located, or at a
point on the customer's property where the meter is located. The customer shall
be responsible for all water piping and control devices located on the
customer's side of the point of delivery.
   POLLUTION. An impairment of the quality of the water to a degree which does
not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and
unreasonably affect the aesthetic qualities of such waters for domestic use.
   POTABLE WATER. Water from any source which has been investigated by the
state Department of Environment and Natural Resources and which has been
approved for human consumption.
   PUBLIC POTABLE WATER SYSTEM. Any publicly or privately owned water system
operated as a public utility, under a current state Department of Environment
and Natural Resources permit, to supply water for public consumption or use.
This system will include all sources, facilities, and appurtenances between the
source and the point of delivery such as valves, pumps, pipes, conduits, tanks,
receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey,
treat, or store a potable water for public consumption or use.
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An assembly
containing within its structure a minimum of two independently acting, approved
check valves, together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically
independent, pressure differential relief valve located between the check
valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The first check valve
reduces the supply pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal flow
and at cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the checks is less than
the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the pressure
differential relief valve, by discharge to atmosphere, shall operate to
maintain the pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure. The
unit shall include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the
assembly and each assembly shall be fitted with properly located test cocks.
The assembly is designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e.,
contaminant).
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE DETECTOR ASSEMBLY. A specially designed assembly
composed of a line-size approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly with a specific bypass water meter and a meter-sized approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. The meter shall register, in
U.S. gallons, accurately for only very low rates of flow and shall show a
registration for all rates of flow. This assembly shall be used to protect
against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant).
   SERVICE CONNECTIONS. The terminal end of a service connection from the
public potable water system, i.e., where the Town of Ranlo Water loses
jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to
the consumer's water system.
   VACUUM BREAKER—ATMOSPHERIC TYPE. A device containing a float-check, a check
seat, and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the body causes the float
to close the air inlet port. When the flow of water stops, the float falls and
forms a check valve against back-siphonage and at the same time opens the air
inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shutoff valve
immediately upstream may be an integral part of the device. An atmospheric
vacuum breaker is designed to protect against a nonhealth hazard, isolation
protection only, under a back-siphonage condition only.
   VACUUM BREAKER—PRESSURE TYPE. An assembly containing an independently
operating internally loaded check valve and an independently operating loaded
air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The assembly
is to be equipped with properly located test cocks and tightly closing shutoff
valves attached at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed to
protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant) under a back-siphonage
condition only.
   WATER PURVEYOR. The owner or operator of a public potable water system,
providing an approved water supply to the public.
   WATER SUPPLY—APPROVED. Any public potable water supply which has been
investigated and approved by the state Department of Environment and Natural
Resources. The system must be operating under a valid health permit. In
determining what constitutes an approved water supply, the state Department of
Environment and Natural Resources has reserved the final judgment as to its
safety and potability.
   WATER SUPPLY—AUXILIARY. Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary
waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or
any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream, and the like, "used
water", or industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted, contaminated, or
objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water
purveyor does not have sanitary control.
   WATER SUPPLY—UNAPPROVED. A water supply which has not been approved for
human consumption by the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
   WATER—USED. Any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public water
system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of
delivery and is no longer under the control of the water purveyor.

   (A)   Authorized representatives from the Town of Ranlo Water shall have the
right to enter, upon presentation of proper credentials and identification, any
building, structure, or premises during normal business hours, or at any time
during the event of an emergency, to perform any duty imposed by this
subchapter. Those duties may include sampling and testing of water, or
inspections and observations of all piping systems connected to the public
water supply. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with the security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, the Town of Ranlo Water personnel will
be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities. Refusal to allow entry for these purposes may result
in discontinuance of water service.
   (B)   On request, the consumer shall furnish to the Town of Ranlo Water any
pertinent information regarding the water supply system on such property where
cross connections and backflow are deemed possible.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 51.45 ELIMINATION OF CROSS CONNECTIONS; DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   (A)   When cross connections are found to exist, the owner, his or her
agent, occupant, or tenant will be notified in writing to disconnect the cross
connection within the time limit established by the Town of Ranlo Water. Degree
of protection required and maximum time allowed for compliance will be based
upon the potential degree of hazard to the public water supply system. The
maximum time limits are as follows:
      (1)   Cross connections with private wells or other auxiliary water
supplies: immediate disconnection.
      (2)   All facilities which pose a health hazard to the potable water
system must have a containment assembly in the form of a reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly within 60 days.

consumer is responsible for installing sufficient internal isolation backflow
prevention assemblies and/or methods (i.e., air gap, pressure vacuum breakers,
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly, double check valve
assembly).
      (6)   Water mains served by the county but not maintained by the Town of
Ranlo Water should be considered cross connections, with degree of hazard to be
determined by the Town of Ranlo Water. Degree of protection shall be based upon
the degree of hazard, as determined by the Town of Ranlo Water.
      (7)   In the event that a Town of Ranlo Water cross connection control
inspector does not have sufficient access to every portion of a private water
system (e.g., classified research and development facilities; federal
government property) to allow a complete evaluation of the degree of hazard
associated with such private water systems, an approved reduced pressure
principle assembly shall be required as a minimum of protection.
   (B)   No person shall fill special use tanks or tankers containing
pesticides, fertilizers, other toxic chemicals or their residues from the
public water system except at a location equipped with an air gap or an
approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly properly
installed on the public water supply.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the town
and enables the town to comply with all applicable state and federal laws
including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 C.F.R. Part 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into any waters of the state, or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludges
from the municipal system;
      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance, and improvement of the municipal wastewater system;
      (5)   To protect both municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage,
sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting
the general public; and
      (6)   To ensure that the municipality complies with its NPDES or non-
discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any
other federal or state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is
subject.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the issuance of
permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the municipal wastewater
system, as authorized by G.S. § 160A-312. The town shall designate an
administrator of the POTW and pretreatment program hereafter referred to as the
POTW Director. Except as otherwise provided herein, the POTW Director shall
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers
granted to or imposed upon the POTW Director may be delegated by the POTW
Director to other town personnel. By discharging wastewater into the municipal
wastewater system, industrial users located outside the town limits agree to
comply with the terms and conditions established in this chapter, as well as
any permits, enforcement actions, or orders issued hereunder.

restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The POTW Director may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the POTW Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the POTW Director and shall be
so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the user at their expense.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the POTW
Director a report containing the information described in §
52.065(B)(4) to (B)(6). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c),
this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
52.051(D).
(Prior Code, § 5-2005)
§ 52.068 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   The town may, at its discretion, sample and analyze user discharges in lieu
of requiring the users to conduct sampling and analysis.
   (A)   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by
the POTW Director but in no case less than twice per year, submit a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which
are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with §
52.051(D).
   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (C)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW Director,
using the procedures prescribed in §
52.074, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005)
§ 52.069 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   Each user must notify the POTW Director of any planned significant changes
to the user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or
volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change.
   (A)   The POTW Director may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
52.051.
   (B)   The POTW Director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §
52.051 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
52.051 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
   (C)   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases or decreases of 20% or greater, and the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005)
§ 52.070 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW Director
of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken
by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the POTW Director, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005)
§ 52.071 REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the POTW Director as the POTW Director may require.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005)
§ 52.072 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the POTW Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the POTW Director within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation. The user is not required to resample if the POTW Director monitors
at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the POTW Director samples
between the user’s initial sampling and when the user receives the results of
this sampling.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005)
§ 52.073 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   The town prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes to the POTW. A
HAZARDOUS WASTE is any substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. Part 261.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.074 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005)
§ 52.075 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the POTW Director may
authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005)
§ 52.076 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005)
§ 52.077 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the town, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the POTW Director.
(Prior Code, § 5-2005) (Ord. passed - -)
COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 52.090 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The town requires the user to provide and operate, at the user’s own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the town’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the town.
(Prior Code, § 5-2006)
§ 52.091 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The town will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether
the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the town, approval authority, and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, or in the performance of any of their duties.
   (B)   The town, approval authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations.
   (C)   Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town, approval
authority, and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes
of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the POTW Director’s,
approval authority’s, or EPA’s access to the user’s premises shall be a
violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access.
(Prior Code, § 5-2006)
§ 52.092 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the POTW Director, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to
a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the POTW Director,
approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the
General Court with jurisdiction in the town.
(Prior Code, § 5-2006) (Ord. passed - - )
ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.105 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW Director finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, wastewater permit,
or any prohibition, limitation, or requirements contained therein or any other
pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the
date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the town by the user.
Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to division (D) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The POTW Director may order any industrial user
who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this
chapter or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit, to show
cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the
POTW Director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (1)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (2)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §
52.999(A), nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director under this
section subject to an administrative appeal under §
52.051(I).
   (D)   Administrative orders. When the POTW Director finds that a discharge
violates an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the
prohibition or effluent limitations of this chapter, or those contained in any
permit issued hereunder or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW
Director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct
those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
the order;
      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventative action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation;
      (4)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/
or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW, or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW Director shall take such steps
as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The POTW Director shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the
wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant
discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the POTW Director prior to the date of the
above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit.
      (1)   Any user who violates the following conditions of this chapter, or
applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to having its permit
terminated:
         (a)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his or her discharge;
         (b)   Failure to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
         (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
         (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
      (2)   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to
show cause under §
52.105 why the proposed action should not be taken.
(Prior Code, § 5-2008) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.106 ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   At least annually, the POTW Director shall publish in the largest daily
newspaper circulated in the service area, a list of those industrial users
which were found to be in significant noncompliance, also referred to as
reportable noncompliance in 15A NCAC 2H.0903(b)(10), with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements, during the previous 12 months.
(Prior Code, § 5-2009) (Ord. passed - - )
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 52.120 UPSET.
   (A)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (B) below are met.
   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW
Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (C)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (D)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Prior Code, § 5-2010) (Ord. passed - - )
§ 52.121 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS DEFENSE.
   (A)   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
52.015(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
52.015(B)(2), (B)(3), (B)(5) through (B)(7), and (B)(23) if it can prove that
it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or
interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (B)   Pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(a)(2), the affirmative defense outlined
in §
52.121 cannot apply to the specific prohibitions in §
52.015(B)(1), (B)(4), and (B)(8).
(Prior Code, § 5-2010) (Ord. passed - - )
§ 52.122 BYPASS.
   (A)   When allowed. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of divisions (B) and (C) below.
   (B)   Prior notice.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW Director, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue, and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW Director may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   Bypass prohibited.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) above.
      (2)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Director determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(1) above.
(Prior Code, § 5-2010) (Ord. passed - - ) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any user who is found to have failed to comply with any provision
of this chapter, or the orders, rules, regulations, and permits issued
hereunder, may be fined up to $25,000 per day, per violation. Each day on which
a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct
offense. Such assessments may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer
service charges and the POTW shall have such remedies for the collection of
such assessments as it has for collections of other service charges.
      (2)   In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the POTW Director
shall consider the following:
         (a)   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to
the public health, or to public or private property resulting from the
violation;
         (b)   The duration and gravity of the violation;
         (c)   The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or on
air quality;
         (d)   The cost of rectifying the damage;
         (e)   The amount of money saved by noncompliance;
         (f)   Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally;
         (g)   The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to
comply with the pretreatment program; and
         (h)   The costs of enforcement to the town.
      (3)   Appeals of civil penalties assessed in accordance with this section
shall be as provided in §
52.051(I).
   (B)   Other available remedies. Remedies, in addition to those previously
mentioned in this chapter, are available to the POTW Director who may use any
single one or combination against a noncompliant user. Additional available
remedies include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Criminal violations. The District Attorney for this judicial
district may, at the request of the town, prosecute noncompliant users who
violate the provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B. Under state law, it is a crime to
negligently violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment
permit, or negligently fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local
governments (G.S. § 143- 215.613(f)), to knowingly and willfully violate any
term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or knowingly and
willfully fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments
(G.S. § 143-215.68(g)), to knowingly violate any term, condition, or
requirement of a pretreatment permit issued by local governments, or knowingly
fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that a person is
placed in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury (G.S. § 143-
215.613(h)), and to falsify information required under G.S. Chapter 143,
Article 21 (G.S. § 143- 215.613(i));
      (2)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user is in violation of the
provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, the POTW
Director, through the Town Attorney, may petition the Superior Court of Justice
for the issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent
injunction which restrains or compels the activities in question;
      (3)   Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user is in violation
of the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, water
service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence
at the user’s expense, after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated ability
to comply; and
      (4)   Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent
limitations of this chapter or contained in a permit or order issued hereunder,
is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as
directed by the POTW Director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall
be subject to the provisions of the G.S. § 160A-175 governing such nuisances,
including reimbursing the POTW for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or
remedying said nuisance.
   (C)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The POTW Director may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with enforcement response plan of the town.
However, the POTW Director may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the POTW Director is empowered to take more
than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Prior Code, § 5-2008)
   (D)   Violation of §
52.039. The penalty for violation of §
52.039 shall be the same as the penalty for water. See §
51.06.
   (E)   General penalty. Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the
provisions of any section or division of this chapter for which no other
penalty is provided, or failing or neglecting or refusing to comply with same,
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor and subject to a
fine in the amount of $500, or as specified in the then-current fees, rates and
charges schedule adopted as part of the town’s annual operating budget; except,
that where state law provides specific remedies for violations of provisions of
this code adopted pursuant to such statutes, such remedies available to the
town for enforcement of this code shall be in addition to the remedies
hereinafter stated.

WATER AND SEWER EXTENSIONS
§ 53.01 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF WATER AND SEWER LINE EXTENSION.
   (A)   No sewer line or water main may be connected to the town’s water or
sewer system unless such line or main is properly designed and constructed to
service the properties intended to be served directly by such line or main and
is of a size and design sufficient to accommodate any necessary expansion of
the water and sewer system to serve other properties, including fire hydrant
protection.
   (B)   The town shall own and control any and all water mains, sewer lines,
and related facilities connected to and serviced by its water or sewer system,
except for those water mains, sewer lines, or facilities of other
municipalities.
   (C)   Because the extension of water mains or sewer lines to certain
properties benefits the owners of such properties by raising property values,
the cost of such extension should be borne by the owners of such properties
except in instances when the Board of Commissioners makes a determination that
the town is obligated to extend such utilities.
   (D)   To comply with municipal obligations imposed by state statutes, or in
cases of emergency where it is found to be in the public interest or necessary
to protect the public health, the town may authorize extensions of water and/or
sanitary sewer into specific areas.
   (E)   All extensions, expansions, and new facilities must be economically
feasible, and must be constructed in accordance with town engineering criteria
standards and specifications, and in conformity with any existing or future
comprehensive development plans which are adopted by the town.
   (F)   The town will maintain a program for approval of the construction or
alteration of the distribution of water or sewer collection system. The town
will adopt rules and regulations governing said program which will incorporate
all requirements of the Division of Health Services and/or the Division of
Environmental Management for certification of the program.
(Prior Code, § 5-3001) (Ord. passed 9-12-1996)
§ 53.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

a form provided by the town and shall designate by a general description the
improvements proposed and shall request that the same be made in conformance
with the provisions of this division (B) and that such proportion of the cost
of each of such improvements as may be specified in the petition be specially
assessed against the property abutting on the street or streets or part thereof
in which or on which such extensions are proposed to be made. The petition
shall be signed by at least a majority in number of the owners, which majority
must own at least a majority of all lineal feet of frontage of the lands
abutting the street or streets or part of the street proposed to be served by
the extension. For purposes of the petition, all owners of undivided interests
shall be deemed and treated as one person and such land shall be sufficiently
signed for when the petition is signed by the owner or owners of a majority in
amount of such undivided interests, provided that for purposes of this section
the word OWNER shall be considered to mean the owners of any life estate or of
estate of inheritance but shall not include mortgagees, trustees of a naked
trust, trustees under deeds of trust to secure payment of money, or
lienholders. Upon the filing of such petition with the town, the Clerk or other
person designated by the Board of Commissioners shall investigate the
sufficiency of the petition, and if found to be sufficient, shall certify the
same to the governing body.
      (2)   Whenever it is determined by the Council based on evidence
presented that an area is without water or sewer and that the protection of the
public health requires that water and sewer extensions be made into such area
and if in the opinion of the Board of Commissioners the abutting property will
be benefited by said improvement to the extent of the portion of the cost to be
assessed against such abutting property, the Council may without petition of a
majority of the property owners order the extension of such lines.
      (3)   Upon receipt of a petition certified as sufficient or upon a
determination pursuant to division (B)(2) above, the Board of Commissioners
shall follow the procedure set out in G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10 as amended

all applicants on any one project equal at least two-thirds of the projected
construction cost based on the preliminary plans, said projected construction
cost, for service to existing development, shall be based on the per linear
foot cost as approved and set annually for computing the fees described in §
53.02; and
      (2)   Deposits made under this division (C) are in lieu of the fees
described in §
53.02.

the following provisions.
      (1)   Installation of any water main or sewer line, including any
required fire hydrants, valves, manholes, sewer lift stations, force mains, or
collector sewer lines necessary in connection therewith, shall be done by the
applicant, if the applicant under the laws of the state is permitted to make
such installations, or by a contractor of the applicant licensed by the state
to make such installations. Such installations shall be done in accordance with
engineering plans, profiles, and specifications approved by the Director of
Public Works and Utilities, and a copy of the same shall be endorsed as to such
approval for the applicant’s use. The applicant shall be responsible, at his or
her own expense, for the preparation of any such required plans, profiles, and
specifications, for obtaining approval for sewer line and water line extensions
either under the local program described in division (C) below or from the
state’s Department of Human Resources respectively, and/or any other review
agencies so designated, and for any other engineering fees in connection with
the installation of such utilities.
      (2)   The installation of the utilities shall be subject to the
inspection and supervision of the town during construction, and the connection
thereof to the town water or sewer system shall not be made or maintained until
the same shall have been tested under supervision of and the written approval
and acceptance of such installation given by the Director of Public Works and
Utilities. After such approval and acceptance, the town shall therefor repair
and maintain the same except the applicant shall be responsible for defects in
workmanship or materials or any noncompliance with the plans and specifications
that appear within one year after such acceptance.
      (3)   Installation of such utilities shall be done and completed at the
sole expense and responsibility of the applicant, free and clear of all claims

month period. In addition, the applicant shall be solely responsible that such
utilities are installed within this period, in accordance with the plans,
profiles, and specifications approved by the town.
      (4)   The applicant shall, at his or her expense (including attorney’s
fees and recording expenses), obtain for or provide to the town such perpetual
rights-of-way or deeds as shall be specified by the town for the construction,
maintenance, and operation of such utilities, including any encroachment
agreements that may be required from the state’s Department of Transportation
or a railroad or other public utility.
      (5)   Upon completion of the utilities and the connection thereof to the
town’s water and sewer system, the water main or sewer line and any fire
hydrant, valves, manholes, sewer lift station, force mains, or collector sewer
lines required in connection therewith shall thereupon and thereafter be the
entire and sole property of the town and under the sole and exclusive control
of the town.
      (6)   Neither the applicants nor any other person shall be entitled to
any service laterals from any water main or sewer line installed by the
applicant except upon permission of the city and the payment of any water meter
or any other water or sewer service connection charges therefor as required by
the ordinances or regulations of the town.
      (7)   If a water main, sewer line, sewer force main, or collector line
shall be required by the town in excess of eight inches in size to provide for
the expansion of water or sewer service to other properties, then the city will
agree to reimburse the applicant the difference in the cost of the pipe for any
such water main, sewer line, sewer force main or collector line in excess of
eight inches in size and the cost of eight-inch pipe for any such water main or
sewer line, such difference in cost to be determined by the Director of Public
Works and Utilities and seated in the contract. However, the town will not
agree to refund any such difference if any such water main or sewer line in
excess of eight inches is necessary to serve the property intended to be then
served thereby. In addition, if in order to provide for the expansion of sewer
service to other properties a sewer pump station larger in size or capacity
than necessary to serve the properties intended to be then serviced by the
sewer installations shall be required by the town, then the town will agree to
reimburse the applicant the difference in the cost of a sewer pump station that
otherwise would be adequate to serve such properties intended to be then
serviced and of the sewer pump stations required by the town to be installed,
such difference in cost to be determined by the Director of Public Works and
Utilities and stated in the contract. Any such cost differences which the town
agrees to refund shall be due and payable without interest to the applicant in
August following the first April 1 after the date on which the utilities to be
installed under the contract have been completed, and accepted and approved by
the town.
      (8)   The applicant shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the town
from any and all loss, cost, damages, expense, and liability (including
attorney’s fees) caused by accident or occurrence causing bodily injury or
property damage arising from the installation of such utilities by the
applicant or the contractor of the applicant. The applicant or the contractor
of the applicant shall maintain workers compensation coverage as well as
general liability insurance with a contractual coverage endorsement and
automobile liability insurance with policy limits of not less than $1,000,000
per occurrence for bodily injury and $300,000 for property damage. The
applicant will furnish certificates of such insurance to the town with the
provision that the town will be given 30 days’ written notice of any intent to
terminate such insurance by either the applicant or the insuring company.
      (9)   The contract shall be conditioned on the applicant complying with
all zoning and subdivision ordinances and regulations of the town that are
applicable to any properties to be serviced by the utilities, and any
ordinances or regulations of the town for the operation, control, maintenance,
and protection of the water and sewer systems of the city.
      (10)   In the event the applicant violates any of the terms of the
contract, the town shall have the right to declare all or any of the right of
the applicant under the contract forfeited, and to remove and disconnect any
connections that might have been made to the town’s water or sewer system.
   (E)   (1)   Without limiting the right of the town to disapprove for any
reason whatsoever the execution of any written contract between an applicant
and the city prepared in accordance with this division, the city will not
approve any contract for the installation of any water main or sewer line to be
connected to and served by its water or sewer system if, in the judgment of the
Board of Commissioners, the projected volume of water that would be used by any
properties to be serviced thereby would unduly tax the available water supply
and/or sewage treatment capacity of the town, or it would not be financially
feasible for the city to commit itself to such cost.
      (2)   Before submitting a formal application under division (B) above, an
applicant may request from the Council an informal advisory opinion on its
willingness to allow such service line extension. Such request shall be filed
with the Director of Public Works and Utilities, together with such
documentation as the Director of Public Works and Utilities deems necessary,
and the Director of Public Works and Utilities shall thereafter bring such
request before the Council pursuant to normal agenda procedures. An advisory
opinion given by the Board of Commissioners shall not bind the Board of
Commissioners to approve an application submitted thereafter or to execute any
contract prepared under division (D) above.
   (F)   Whenever water and sewer line extensions serving single-family
dwellings have been made at the developer’s expense. The town will refund to
the developer of the property served the sum of $250 per water tap and $263 per
sewer tap. These reimbursements shall be limited to a maximum reimbursement of
one water tap and one sewer tap per lot. The maximum reimbursement amounts will
be included in the contract. Reimbursements are to be made by the town to the
developer from funds budgeted therefor on an actual tap basis to the lines
installed by the developer. Annual payments shall be made in August of each
calendar year based on the number of certificates of compliance issued by April
1 of the preceding fiscal year.
   (G)   Whenever water and sewer line extensions to serve developments other
than single-family dwellings (such as multi-family developments, condominiums,
shopping centers, businesses, industrial developments, and the like) are made
at the developer’s expense, the city will refund to the developer of the
property served by such extension an amount equal to $3.72 per foot for six-
inch or larger water lines, with an additional $513 for each fire hydrant, and
$5.62 per foot for eight-inch or larger sanitary sewer lines. The maximum
reimbursement amounts will be included in the contract. Reimbursements are to
be made by the town to the developer from budgeted funds in annual payments in
August of each calendar year based on certificates of compliance issued by
April 1 of the preceding fiscal year and the percentage of development
completed in accordance with site plans approved by the town.
   (H)   Reimbursements under this section shall be limited as follows.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of divisions (F) and (G) above, no
reimbursements shall be made unless the development in question is served with
both town water and town sewer.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of divisions (F) and (G) above, the
developer will be eligible for reimbursements only during the first five years
after the contract has been approved.
      (3)   An applicant shall submit a request for reimbursement to the Town
Coordinator by April 1 preceding the fiscal year in which he or she wishes to
be paid those reimbursements he or she is eligible for under the terms of the
contract. No reimbursements shall be paid unless the applicant has complied
with the above procedure.
      (4)   No reimbursements shall be made until the Town Engineer receives
and approves as-built drawings and dedications or conveyances of necessary
easements and rights-of-way. If such drawings, easements, and rights-of-way are
not received by the Town Engineer within 90 days of the acceptance of the water
and sewer line extensions by the town, 20% of the eligible refund will be
retained by the town for the preparation of as-built drawings, easements, and
rights-of-way.

directed may elect to quash the charge or may otherwise reduce the punishment

notify the person charged of his or her decision within ten days of having
received the offender’s request for reconsideration.

she shall have 30 days to notify the person charged of the final decision.
      (5)   Nothing in §§
71.45 through
71.51 shall be construed to prevent an offender from exercising any other right
of review as allowed by law.
   (D)   Application of state regulations. In the alternative, or in addition
to §§
71.45 through
71.51, a law enforcement officer may charge an offender for operating or
allowing the operation of a golf cart in a manner that violates any provision
of G.S. Chapter 20.

place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the

whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object.
      (3)   Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes it
impractical, a police officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under

otherwise be warranted, by requesting the person to identify himself or herself
and to explain his or her presence or conduct.

the police officer did not comply with the preceding division (B)(3), or if it
appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if it
had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled the
alarm.

loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.

police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,

131.04, the following offenses constitute a violation of this chapter.
   (A)   A juvenile commits an offense by being present in or remaining in any
public place or on the premises of any establishment within the town during the
restricted hours.
   (B)   A parent or guardian of a juvenile commits an offense if he or she
knowingly permits, or by insufficient control, allows the juvenile to remain in
any public place or on the premises of any establishment within the town during
the restricted hours. The term KNOWINGLY includes knowledge that a parent
should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile
in that parent’s legal custody, this requirement is intended to hold a
neglectful or careless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such juvenile.
   (C)   The owner/operator or any employee of an establishment commits an
offense if he or she knowingly allows a juvenile to remain upon the premises of
the establishment during the restricted hours. The term KNOWINGLY included
knowledge that an operator or employer should reasonably be expected to have
concerning the patrons of an establishment. The standard for KNOWINGLY shall be
applied through an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the
operator’s or employee’s position should have known that the patron was a
juvenile in violation of this chapter.
   (D)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person 18 years of age
or older to aid or abet a juvenile in the violation of division (A) above.
   (E)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for a parent or guardian to
refuse to take custody during the restricted hours of a juvenile for whom the
parent or guardian is responsible.
(Prior Code, § 8-6003) (Ord. passed 8-20-1998)
§ 131.04 EXCEPTIONS.
   A juvenile who is in a public place or establishment during the restricted
hours shall not be in violation of this chapter if the juvenile is:

   (B)   Accompanied by an adult 18 years of age or older authorized by the
parent or guardian of such juvenile to take the parent or guardian’s place in
accompanying the juvenile for a designated period of time and purpose within a
specified area;
   (C)   On an errand, using a direct route at the direction of the juvenile’s
parent or guardian until the hour of 12:30 a.m.;
   (D)   In a motor vehicle with parental consent engaged in interstate travel
through the town or originating or terminating in the town;
   (E)   Traveling in a motor vehicle with a parent or guardian, or traveling

parent or guardian of such juvenile to take the parent or guardian’s place in
accompanying the juvenile for a designated period of time and purpose with a
specified area;
   (F)   Engaged in a lawful employment activity, or using a direct route to or
from a place of employment;
   (G)   Reacting or responding to an emergency;
   (H)   Attending or traveling to or from, by direct route, an official
school, religious, or recreational activity that is supervised by adults and

civic organization, or another similar entity that accepts responsibility for
the juvenile;

right of assembly;
   (J)   Married or emancipated;
   (K)   When authorized, by special permit from the Chief of Police or his or
her designee, carried on the person of the juvenile thus authorized as follows.
When necessary nighttime activities of a juvenile may be inadequately provided
for by other sections of this chapter, then recourse may be had to the Chief of
Police or his or her designee either for a regulation as provided in division
(L) below, or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant upon the
findings of reasonable necessity for the use of a public place, the findings of
reasonable necessity for the use of a public place to the extent warranted by a
written application signed by a juvenile and by a parent of the juvenile, if
feasible, stating:
      (1)   The name, age, and address of the juvenile;
      (2)   The name, address, and telephone number of a parent thereof;
      (3)   The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair, and other physical
characteristics of the juvenile;
      (4)   The necessity that requires the juvenile to remain upon a public
place during the restricted hours otherwise applicable;
      (5)   The public place; and
      (6)   The beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and
hour the Chief of Police or his or her designee may grant a permit in writing
for the juvenile’s use of a public place at such hours as in the opinion of the
Chief of Police may reasonably be necessary and consistent with the purposes of
this chapter.
   (L)   When authorized by regulation issued by the Chief of Police, or his or
her designee in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled
as set forth in division (K) above but adapted to reasonably necessary
nighttime activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an
individual special permit basis. Normally, such regulation by the Chief of
Police or his or her designee permitting use of public places should be issued
sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and
through other agencies such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the
scope of the use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved
not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for termination of the
activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably
necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

§ 131.05 DEFENSE.
   It is a defense to prosecution under §
131.03(C) that the owner/operator or employee of an establishment promptly
notified the Police Department that a juvenile was present on the premises of
the establishment during the restricted hours and refused to leave.
(Prior Code, § 8-6005) (Ord. passed 8-20-1998)

131.05 is present.
      (3)   The police officer shall escort the juvenile home to his or her
parent or guardian. The officer will inform the parent/guardian in writing of

      (1)   Before taking any enforcement action under this chapter, a police
officer shall ask the apparent offender’s age and reason for being in the
public place or establishment during restricted hours.

of this code by the juvenile.

inspections may be made by approved and recognized inspection organizations;
provided, no approval shall be based upon reports of the organizations unless
they are in writing and certified by a responsible officer of the organization.
   (C)   All holders of permits, or their agents, shall notify the Inspection
Department and the appropriate inspector at each of the following stages of
construction so that approval may be given before work is continued:
      (1)   Foundation inspection shall be made after trenches are excavated
and the necessary reinforcement and forms are in place, and before concrete is
placed. Drilled footings, piles, and similar types of foundations shall be
inspected as installed.

is occupied.
   (D)   Request for inspections may be made to the office of the Inspection
Department or to the appropriate inspector. The Inspection Department shall
make inspections as soon as practicable after request is made therefor,
provided the work is ready for inspection at the time the request is made.

information and data necessary to determine compliance with this chapter, the
appropriate regulatory codes, and the zoning ordinance for the occupancy
intended. The Inspection Department shall issue a certificate of occupancy

§ 151.116 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is
filed with the Inspector, charging that any structure exists in violation of
this subchapter, or whenever it appears to the Inspector, upon inspection, that
any structure exists in violation hereof, he or she shall, if his or her
preliminary investigation discloses a basis for the charges, issue and cause to
be served, upon the owner of and parties in interest in the structure, a
complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be
held before the Inspector at a place therein fixed, not less than ten nor more
than 30 days after the serving of the complaint. The owner or any party in
interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear
in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the

persons signing a petition relating to the structure. Any person desiring to do
so may attend the hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard.
The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be
controlling in hearings before the Inspector.
   (B)   Procedure after hearing. After the notice and hearing, the Inspector
shall state in writing his or her determination whether the structure or
dwelling violates this subchapter. If the Inspector determines that the
dwelling or structure is in violation, he or she shall state in writing his or

   (D)   Limitations on order.
      (1)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling or
abandoned structure can be made at a cost of no more than 50% of the value of
the dwelling or building, as determined and published most recently by the
County Tax Assessor, the order may require the owner, within the time
specified, to repair, alter or improve the building, structure or dwelling in
order to render it fit for human habitation, or, in the case of abandoned
nonresidential buildings, to bring it into compliance with the standards of
this subchapter within 90 days. The order may require that the property be
vacated and closed only if continued occupancy during the time allowed for
repair will present a significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account
the nature of the necessary repairs, alterations or improvements; the current
state of the property; and any additional risks due to the presence and
capacity of minors under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental
disabilities. The order shall state that the failure to make timely repairs as
directed in the order shall make the dwelling subject to the issuance of an
subsequent order to repair or demolish the structure; or
      (2)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building
or structure cannot be made at a cost of less than 50% of the value of the
dwelling or building, as determined and published most recently by the County
Tax Assessor, the order may require the owner, within the time specified, to
remove or demolish the structure or dwelling within 90 days.
   (E)   Failure to comply with order. If the owner of any structure shall fail
to comply with an order of the Inspector within the time specified therein, the
Inspector may either:
      (1)   Place the matter on the agenda of the Board at its next regular
meeting; or
      (2)   Request an emergency meeting with the Board. At the meeting, the
Board of Commissioners may consider an ordinance finding that failure to comply
with the order jeopardized the public health safety and welfare of the general
public and/or the occupants of the building structure or dwelling. If the Board
finds that the public’s or occupant’s health and safety are jeopardized, the
Board shall adopt an ordinance:
         (a)   Describing the property;
         (b)   Listing the Board’s findings;
         (c)   Directing that the ordinance be recorded in the County Registry
and indexed in the grantor index in the name of the property owner(s); and
         (d)   Directing that the Inspector or officer cause the building or
dwelling to be repaired, altered and repaired or vacated and closed. If the
building or dwelling is to be closed, the ordinance will direct the Inspector
to post the property with a placard reading:
            1.   For abandoned nonresidential buildings: “This building is
unfit for any use; the use or occupation of this building for any purpose is
prohibited and unlawful;” or
            2.   For dwellings: “This building is unfit for human habitation;
the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and
unlawful.”
   (F)   Recorded in county office. Each ordinance shall be recorded in the
County Office of the Register of Deeds, and shall be indexed in the name of the
property owner in the grantor index.
   (G)   Misdemeanors. Any person who occupies or knowingly allows the
occupancy of an abandoned building or structure so posted shall be guilty of a
Class 3 misdemeanor. Any person who occupies or knowingly allows the occupancy
of a dwelling so posted shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
(Prior Code, § 9-2085) (Ord. passed - -; Ord. 14-2021, passed - -)
§ 151.117 METHODS OF SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)   Complaints or orders issued by the Inspector shall be served upon
persons, either personally or by registered or certified mail. When service is
made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the complaint or order will
also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the
registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is
not returned by the post office within ten days after the mailing. If the
whereabouts of the persons are unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by
the Inspector in the exercise of reasonable diligence, or if the owners are
known but have refused to accept service by registered or certified mail, the
Inspector shall make an affidavit to that effect, and the serving of the
complaint or order upon the person may be made by publication in a newspaper
having general circulation in the town at least once, no later than the time at
which personal service is required under §
151.116. Where service is made by publication, a notice of the pending
proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected by
the complaint or order.
   (B)   Whenever a determination is made pursuant to §
151.116 that a dwelling must be vacated and closed, or removed or demolished,
notice of the order shall be given by first-class mail to any organization
involved in providing or restoring dwellings for affordable housing that has
filed a written request for such notices. A minimum period of 45 days from the
mailing of such notice shall be given before removal or demolition by action of
the Inspector, to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate with
the owner to make repairs, lease or purchase the property for the purpose of
providing affordable housing. The Inspector or Town Clerk shall certify the
mailing of the notices, and the certification shall be conclusive in the
absence of fraud. Only an organization that has filed a written request for
such notices may raise the issue of failure to mail such notices, and the sole
remedy shall be an order requiring the Inspector to wait 45 days before causing
removal or demolition.
(Ord. 14-2021, passed - -)
§ 151.118 IN REM ACTION BY INSPECTOR; DEMOLITION.
   (A)   After failure of an owner of a dwelling to comply with an ordinance
issued pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter in one year, or two years
in the case of the owner of an abandoned nonresidential structure, the Board
may consider another ordinance if it finds that:
      (1)   The owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or
improve the building, structure or dwelling in order to render it fit for human
habitation; or
      (2)   For abandoned nonresidential buildings, to have abandoned the
intention to repair; and
      (3)   That the continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed
status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the town,
in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and
safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract
persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to blight and
the deterioration of property values in the area, and would render unavailable
property and a dwelling that might otherwise have been made available to ease
the persistent shortage of decent and affordable housing in the town.
   (B)   Any ordinance enacted shall set forth the following:
      (1)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the building, structure or dwelling within
90 days; or
      (2)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the building, structure or dwelling within 90 days.
   (C)   Any ordinance so adopted shall be served on the owner of the property
and recorded in the County Office of the Register of Deeds, and shall be
indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index.
   (D)   If the owner fails to comply with this subchapter, the Inspector shall
effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.
(Ord. 14-2021, passed - -)
§ 151.119 COLLECTION OF COSTS; CREATION OF LIEN ON PREMISES.
   (A)   Creation of lien. The expense of the action shall be paid by the
person in default. If the expense is not paid, it is a lien on the land or
premises where the nuisance occurred. A lien established pursuant to this
section shall have the same priority and be collected as unpaid ad valorem
taxes.
   (B)   Liens on residential and abandoned nonresidential buildings. The
amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or improvements, or vacating and
closing, or removal or demolition by the Inspector shall be a lien against the
real property upon which the cost was incurred, which lien shall be filed, have
the same priority, and be collected as the lien for special assessment provided
in G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10.
   (C)   Additional lien created in actions about residential buildings. Where
the original action was brought against a dwelling(s), the expense of the
action is also a lien on any other real property owned by the person in default
within the town limits, or within one mile of the town limits, except for the
person’s primary residence. A lien established pursuant to this section is
inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as money judgment. This
section shall not apply if the person in default can show that the nuisance was
created solely by the actions of another.
(G.S. § 160A-193)
   (D)   Notification of Town Attorney. The Inspector will notify the Town
Attorney to write a notice of lien and cause it to be recorded in the county
registry and/or judgments.
(Ord. 14-2021, passed - -)
§ 151.120 REMEDIES; APPEAL BY OWNER TO SUPERIOR COURT.
   (A)   The Board shall also hear any appeals from any decision or order of
the Inspector.
   (B)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Inspector may be taken to
the Board by any person aggrieved thereby, or by any officer, board or
commission of the town. Any appeal from the Inspector shall be taken within ten
days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order, by filing with
the Office of the Inspector, a notice of appeal to the Board, which shall
specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any
notice of appeal, the Inspector shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the
papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made.
When an appeal is from a decision of the Inspector, refusing to allow the
person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his or her decision shall remain in
force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the
Inspector, requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have
the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the Board, unless
the Inspector certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal is filed with
him or her, that, because of facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which
shall be furnished the person making the appeal), a suspension of his or her
requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the
requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be
granted for due cause shown, upon not less than one day’s written notice to the
Inspector by the Board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to
division (F) of this section.
   (C)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals, shall give
due notice to the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable
time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The Board may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order
appealed from, and may make any decision and order that, in its opinion, ought
to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the
Inspector. The Board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, when
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out
the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance
to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance
shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice
done.
   (D)   Every decision of the Board shall be subject to review by proceedings
in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the decision of the
Board, but not otherwise.
   (E)   Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the Inspector or a decision
rendered by the Board may petition the Superior Court for an injunction,
restraining the Inspector from carrying out the order or decision. The Court

§ 151.121 SUMMARY EJECTMENT IF OCCUPANTS FAIL TO OBEY ORDER OR ORDINANCE TO
VACATE.
   (A)   Notice before ejectment from dwellings only. An action to remove an
occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of
a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this division (A), unless the
occupant was served with notice, at least 30 days before the filing of the
summary ejectment proceeding, that the Board has ordered the Inspector to
proceed to exercise his or her duties under §
151.116 of this subchapter to vacate and close or remove and demolish the
dwelling.
   (B)   Ejectment procedure for abandoned nonresidential buildings and
structures. If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling,
the Inspector may file a civil action in the name of the town to remove the
occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of summary
ejectment, and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as parties-
defendant any person occupying the dwelling. The Clerk of Superior Court shall
issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a magistrate at a
certain time, date and place, not to exceed ten days from the issuance of the
summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as
provided in G.S. § 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its tenor.
If on its return it appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the
Inspector produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the governing
body pursuant to §
151.117, authorizing the officer to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling,
the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated, and
that all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated
shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary ejectment
entered under G.S. § 42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by
the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. § 7A-228, and the execution of
such judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. § 7A-227.

human life or health. The Inspector shall promptly cause such building,
structure or portion thereof to be made safe or abated. For this purpose, the
Inspector may at once enter the structure or land on which it stands, or
abutting land or structure, with such assistance and at such cost as he or she
may deem necessary, The Inspector may vacate adjacent structures and protect
the public by appropriate fences or such other means as may be necessary, and
for this purpose, may close a public or private way.

§ 151.151 PROCEDURE FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing.
      (1)   Whenever a petition is filed with the Housing Inspector by a public
authority or by at least five residents of the town charging that any building,
dwelling unit, or rooming unit is unfit for human habitation, or whenever it
appears to the Housing Inspector, upon inspection, that any building, dwelling
unit, or rooming unit (hereinafter collectively called “unsafe building”) is
unfit for human habitation, he or she shall, if his or her preliminary
investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served
upon the owner (as defined in §
151.146) of such unsafe building a complaint stating the charges and containing
a notice that a hearing will be held before the Housing Inspector at a place
and time therein fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the
serving of the complaint. The owner shall have the right to file an answer to
the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the
place and time fixed in the complaint. If applicable, notice of such hearing
shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating
to such unsafe building. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing
and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence
prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearing
before the Housing Inspector.
      (2)   At the hearing, the Housing Inspector may determine pursuant to
G.S. § 160D-1205 that an unsafe building is unfit for human habitation if he or
she finds that conditions exist in the unsafe building that render it dangerous
or injurious to the health, safety, or morals of the occupants of the unsafe
building, the occupants of the neighboring buildings, or other residents of the
town. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
defects therein increasing the hazards of fire, accidents, or other calamities;
failure in any way to conform to the minimum standards set forth in this
Housing Code; or especially dangerous to life because of bad condition of
walls, overloaded floors, defective construction, decay, unsafe wiring or
heating system, or inadequate means of egress.
   (B)   Procedure after hearing. After such notice and hearing, the Housing
Inspector shall state in writing his or her determination whether such unsafe
building is unfit for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is deteriorated
or dilapidated.
      (1)   If the Housing Inspector determines that the unsafe building is
deteriorated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact in
support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the
owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter, and
improve such unsafe building to comply with the minimum standards of fitness
established by this Housing Code within a specified period of time, not to
exceed 90 days. Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and
close such unsafe building until such repairs, alterations, and improvements
have been made.
      (2)   If the Housing Inspector determines that the unsafe building is
dilapidated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact to
support such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the
owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to either repair,
alter, and improve such unsafe building to comply with the minimum standards of
fitness established by this Housing Code or else vacate, close, and remove or
demolish the same within a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days.
Except in emergency situations endangering the immediate health, safety, or
welfare of any persons, there shall be no demolition of an unsafe building
until the owner has first had a reasonable opportunity to bring it into
conformity with this Housing Code; 30 days is the minimum hereby established as
such a reasonable opportunity and time.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated unsafe
building shall fail to comply with an order of the Housing Inspector to repair,
alter, or improve the same within the time specified therein, or if the owner
of a dilapidated unsafe building shall fail to comply with an order of the
Housing Inspector to either repair, alter, or improve the same or vacate,
close, and remove or demolish the same within the time specified therein, the
Housing Inspector may submit to the Board of Commissioners at its next regular
meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney to institute in the General
Court of Justice an appropriate action to seek an order of the Court directing
such owner to comply with the order of the Housing Inspector, as authorized by
G.S. § 160D-1208(e).
      (2)   In rem remedy.
         (a)   If the owner of any deteriorated unsafe building shall fail to
comply with an order of the Housing Inspector within the time fixed by that
order to repair, alter, or improve the same within the time specified therein;
or if the owner of a dilapidated unsafe building shall fail to comply with an
order of the Housing Inspector to either repair, alter, or improve the same, or
to vacate, close, and remove or demolish the same, within the time specified
therein; or if judicial relief has not been sought or has not been granted as
provided in division (C)(1) above; then in any of these events and pursuant to
G.S. §§ 160D1203(4), (5), and (6), the Housing Inspector shall request the
Board of Commissioners to order him or her by an ordinance specifically
describing the subject property to do the following, either: to cause such
unsafe building to be repaired, altered, and improved to comply with the
minimum standards of fitness established by this Housing Code; or to cause such
unsafe building to be vacated, closed, and removed or demolished. The Board, in
ordering one of the aforesaid alternatives, shall order the specific action
that will best effectuate the purposes of this Housing Code. Once the ordinance
is adopted by the Board of Commissioners, a true copy of such ordinance shall
be recorded in the office of the County Register of Deeds and Registrar shall
index the name of the property owner in the “Grantor Index”, as provided by
G.S. §§ 160D-1203(5) and (6).
         (b)   Once such an ordinance is adopted by the Board of Commissioners,
the Housing Inspector shall forthwith cause such repair, alteration, and
improvement or closing, vacating, and removal or demolition to be carried out
by any public authority or private concern. Pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1203(7),
the amount of the cost of repairs, alterations, and improvements, or vacating,
closing, and removal or demolition shall be a lien against the real property
upon which the cost was incurred. Such lien shall be filed, have the same
priority and be collected as the lien for special assessment provided in G.S.
Chapter 160A, Article 10. If the unsafe building is removed or demolished by
the Housing Inspector, he or she shall, if possible, sell in any commercially
reasonable manner the materials of the unsafe building and shall credit the
proceeds of the sale, if any, against the cost of the removal or demolition.
Any balance remaining shall be deposited by the Clerk of Superior Court for
subsequent disbursement by the Court to the persons found by the Court to be
entitled thereto.
         (c)   None of the provisions of this Housing Code shall be construed
to impair or limit in any way the power of the town to define and declare
nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or
otherwise; or to enforce this Housing Code by criminal process pursuant to G.S.
§ 14-4; and the enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the
enforcement of any other remedy or remedies provided herein or in any ordinance
of the town, or any statute of the state.
      (3)   Placarding. After there has been a failure of the owner to comply
with an order of the Housing Inspector to repair, alter, and improve, or to
vacate, close, and remove or demolish the unsafe building, then the Housing
Inspector shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of any such unsafe
building a placard with the following words: “This building is unfit for human
habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is
prohibited and unlawful.” Occupation or use of a building so posted is a
violation of this Housing Code and shall constitute a misdemeanor pursuant to
G.S. § 14-4.
   (D)   Appeals from orders of Housing Inspector. An appeal from any decision
or order of the Housing Inspector may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby.
Any appeal from the Housing Inspector shall be taken within ten days from the
rendering of the decision or if either the owner or his or her attorney was not
present when the decision was rendered, then within ten days of service of such
order, and such appeal shall be taken by filing with the Housing Inspector and
with the Board of Adjustments (hereinafter called the Board) a notice of appeal
which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing
of any notice of appeal, the Housing Inspector shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed
was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the Housing Inspector refusing
to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his or her decision shall
remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision
of the Housing Inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the
appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by
the Board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason
of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the
appellant), a suspension of his or her requirement shall not be suspended
except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause upon not less
than one day’s written notice to the Housing Inspector, by the Board, or by a
court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1208(d) division (E)
below.
      (1)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all
appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its
decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent
or attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify
the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision and decision or
order of the Housing Inspector. The Board shall have power also in passing upon
appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the subchapter, to
adapt the application of the subchapter to the necessities of the case to the
end that the spirit of the subchapter shall be observed, public safety and
welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
      (2)   Every decision of the Board shall be subject to review by the
County Superior Court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted
within 15 days of the decision of the Board, but not otherwise.
   (E)   Petition to Superior Court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the Housing Inspector or a decision rendered by the Board shall have
the right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the
decision, to petition the Superior Court for a temporary injunction restraining
the inspector pending a final disposition of the case, as provided by G.S. §
160D-1208(d).

same can not be ascertained by the Housing Inspector in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, the Housing Inspector shall make an affidavit to that
effect, and the serving of such complaint or order upon such persons may be

found to be in conflict with any provision of any other ordinance or code of
the town, the provision which establishes the higher standard or more stringent
requirement for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the
residents of the town shall prevail.

anchored overhanging objects, which constitute a danger of falling on persons
or property;

referenced in the contract, and obligates the owner to deliver to the buyer a
copy of the recorded plat prior to closing and conveyance;
      (2)   Plainly and conspicuously notifies the prospective buyer or lessee
that a final subdivision plat has not been approved or recorded at the time of
the contract, that no governmental body will incur any obligation to the
prospective buyer or lessee with respect to the approval of the final
subdivision plat, that changes between the preliminary and final plats are
possible, and that the contract or lease may be terminated without breach by
the buyer or lessee if the final recorded plat differs in any material respect
from the preliminary plat;
      (3)   Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat does not
differ in any material respect from the plat referred to in the contract, the
buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any
earlier than five days after the delivery of a copy of the final recorded plat;
and
      (4)   Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat differs in
any material respect from the preliminary plat referred to in the contract, the
buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any
earlier than 15 days after the delivery of the final recorded plat, during
which 15-day period the buyer or lessee may terminate the contract without
breach or any further obligation, and may receive a refund of all earnest money
or prepaid purchase price.
   (C)   The provisions of this chapter shall not prohibit any owner or its
agent from entering into contracts to sell or lease land by reference to an
approved preliminary plat, for which a final plat has not been properly
approved or recorded with the Register of Deeds, where the buyer or lessee is
any person who has contracted to acquire or lease the land for the purpose of
engaging in the business of construction of residential, commercial, or
industrial buildings on the land, or for the purpose of resale or lease of the
land to persons engaged in that kind of business; provided, that no conveyance
of that land may occur, and no contract to lease it may become effective, until
after the final plat has been properly approved under this chapter and recorded
with the Register of Deeds.
   (D)   No person, firm, or corporation shall lay, erect, or construct or
authorize the laying, erecting, or constructing, of any water or sewer line in
any street of a subdivision opened or laid out without approval of the Town

more of those divisions is created for the purpose, whether immediate or
future, of sale or building development, and all divisions of land involving
the dedication of a new street or a change in existing streets; provided,
however, that the following shall not be included within this definition nor be

primarily to provide direct access to abutting land and access to higher
systems.
      (2)   MAJOR THOROUGHFARES. Consist of interstate, other freeway,
expressway, or parkway links, and major streets that provide for the
expeditious movement of high volumes of traffic within and through urban areas.
      (3)   MINOR THOROUGHFARES. Important streets in the city system and
perform the function of collecting traffic from local access streets and
carrying it to the major thoroughfare system. MINOR THOROUGHFARES may be used
to supplement the major thoroughfare system by facilitating a minor through-
traffic movement and may also serve abutting property.
(Prior Code, § 9-3021) (Ord. passed 6- -2006)
§ 152.31 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Streets and roads.
      (1)   The design of all streets and roads within the town shall be in
accordance with the accepted policies of the state’s Department of
Transportation, Division of Highways, as taken or modified from the American
Association of State Highway Officials’ (AASHO) manuals.
      (2)   The provision of street rights-of-way shall conform and meet the
requirements of the thoroughfare plan for Gaston Urban Area as adopted by the
City Council and the state’s Department of Transportation.
      (3)   The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the existing
street system of the surrounding area. Normally, the proposed streets should be
the extension of existing streets if possible.
      (4)   The urban planning area shall consist of that area within the urban
planning boundary as depicted on the mutually adopted Gaston Urban Area
Thoroughfare Plan. The rural planning area shall be that area outside the urban
planning boundary.

Minor thoroughfare                                   70
*The desirable minimum right-of-way is 60 feet. If curb and gutter is provided,
50 feet of right-of-way is adequate on local residential streets.
**The right-of-way dimension will depend on radius used for vehicular turn
around. Distance from edge of pavement of turn around to right-of-way should
not be less than distance from edge of pavement to right-of- way on street
approaching turn-around.
 
      (1)   The subdivider will only be required to dedicate a maximum of 100
feet of right-of-way. In cases where over 100 feet of right-of-way is desired,
the subdivider will be required only to reserve the amount in excess of 100
feet. In all cases in which right-of-way is sought for an access controlled
facility, the subdivider will only be required to make a reservation.
      (2)   A partial width right-of-way, not less than 60 feet in width, may
be dedicated when adjoining undeveloped property that is owned or controlled by
the subdivider; provided, that the width of a partial dedication be such as to
permit the installation of such facilities as may be necessary to serve
abutting lots. When the said adjoining property is subdivided, the remainder of
the full required right-of-way shall be dedicated.
   (C)   Street widths. Widths for street and road classifications other than
local shall be as required by the thoroughfare plan. Width of local roads and
streets shall be as follows.
      (1)   Local residential.
            (a)   Curb and gutter section: 26 feet, to face of curb.
            (b)   Shoulder section: 20 feet to edge of pavement, four-foot
shoulders.
      (2)   Residential collector.
            (a)   Curb and gutter section: 34 feet, face to face of curb.
            (b)   Shoulder section: 20 feet to edge of pavement, six-foot
shoulders.
   (D)   Geometric characteristics. The standards outlined below shall apply to
all subdivision streets proposed for addition to the State Highway System or
Municipal Street System. In cases where a subdivision is sought adjacent to a
proposed thoroughfare corridor, the requirements of dedication and reservation
discussed under right-of-way shall apply.
   (E)   Design speed. The design speeds for subdivision type streets shall be
as follows.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has, in G.S. Chapter 143, Article 21, Part 6; G.S.
Chapter 160A, Article 8; G.S. Chapter 160D, Article 7; G.S. Chapter 160D,
Article 11; and G.S. Chapter 160D, Article 13, Part 2, delegated to local
governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the town’s Board of
Commissioners does ordain as follows.
(Prior Code, § 9-5001) (Ord. passed 9-4-2007)
§ 153.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are subject
to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life, property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Prior Code, § 9-5002) (Ord. passed 9-4-2007)
§ 153.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters, or may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Prior Code, § 9-5003) (Ord. passed 9-4-2007)
§ 153.004 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding, and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (such as, water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges)
located in flood-prone areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.

placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or

   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any combination of repairs, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure taking place
during any one-year period, for which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the START OF CONSTRUCTION of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGE, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official, and are the minimum necessary to assure
safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in §§
153.040 through
153.044, is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that documentation
is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION (WSE). The height, in relation to mean sea level, of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.

      (1)   Elevation certificates.
            (a)   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is required prior
to the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit
holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
elevation of the reference level, in relation to mean sea level. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder prior to the
beginning of construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to
make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development
permit.
            (b)   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is required after
the reference level is established. Within seven calendar days of establishment
of the reference level elevation, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the
reference level, in relation to mean sea level. Any work done within the seven-
day calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at
the permit holder’s risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
certificate data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be
corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further work being
permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
            (c)   A final as-built elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is
required after construction is completed and prior to certificate of
compliance/occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of final as-built
construction of the elevation of the reference level and all attendant
utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (2)   Flood-proofing certificate. If non-residential flood-proofing is
used to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a flood-
proofing certificate (FEMA Form 81-65), with supporting data, an operational
plan, and an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual
start of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the flood-proofed
design elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in
relation to mean sea level. Flood-proofing certification shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect, and
certified by same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate
data, the operational plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan.
Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant prior
to permit approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit.
Failure to construct in accordance with the certified design shall be cause to
withhold the issuance of a certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (3)   Zones A, AE, and A1-30. If a manufactured home is placed within
Zones A, AE, or A1-30, and the elevation of the chassis is more than 36 inches
in height above grade, an engineered foundation certification is required in
accordance with the provisions of §
153.056(C)(2).
      (4)   Watercourse disruption. If a watercourse is to be altered or
relocated, a description of the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation;
a professional engineer’s certified report on the effects of the proposed
project on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse, and the effects to
properties located both upstream and downstream; and a map showing the location
of the proposed watercourse alteration or relocation shall all be submitted by
the permit applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit.
      (5)   Certification exemptions. The following structures, if located
within Zone A, AE, or A1-30, are exempt from the elevation/flood-proofing
certification requirements specified in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above:
            (a)   Recreational vehicles meeting requirements of §
153.056(F)(1);
            (b)   Temporary structures meeting requirements of §
153.056(G); and
            (c)   Accessory structures less than 150 square feet meeting
requirements of §

and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters, and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (E)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (F)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and
the elevation to which the structure is to be built, and that such construction
below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25
per $100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a
record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
and the state upon request.
   (I)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or
non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that,
considering the flood hazard, the variance is the minimum necessary to afford
relief.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.

discharges from the systems into flood waters.
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (H)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall
meet the requirements of new construction as contained in this chapter.
   (I)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this
chapter, and located totally or partially within the floodway, non-encroachment
area, or stream setback; provided there is no additional encroachment below the
regulatory flood protection elevation in the floodway, non-encroachment area,
or stream setback; and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or
replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter.
   (J)   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not

adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (N)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which
approval is required by federal or state law, including § 404 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1344.
   (O)   When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard area,
the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
   (P)   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation shall apply.
(Prior Code, § 9-5046) (Ord. passed 9-4-2007)
§ 153.056 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in §§
153.021 or
153.057, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
153.055, are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
153.005.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
153.005. Structures located in A, AE, and A1-30 Zones may be flood-proofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation; provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight,
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the
effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator, as set forth
in §
153.041(C), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
153.005.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the state’s Regulations for Manufactured Homes adopted by
the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15. Additionally, when
the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less
above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers
or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches
in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of §
153.056(D).
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local emergency management coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. A fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of flood waters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
            (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow flood waters to automatically enter and
exit;
            (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
            (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of flood
waters in both directions; and
            (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1) Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements, in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure, are:
            (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more nonconforming than the existing structure; or
            (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements, in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure, are:
            (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; or
            (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is READY FOR HIGHWAY
USE, if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect-type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or
      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
   (G)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood, or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted, in writing, to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (such as, minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane, or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures.
      (1)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, and the like)
are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the following criteria
shall be met:
            (a)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas);
            (b)   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
            (c)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood
damage potential;
            (d)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood
waters;
            (e)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance
with the provisions of §
153.055(A);
            (f)   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed
in accordance with the provisions of §
153.055(D); and
            (g)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation, in conformance with the provisions of §
153.056(D)(3) above.
      (2)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet
that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or
flood-proofing certificate. Elevation or flood-proofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with §
153.041(C).
(Prior Code, § 9-5047) (Ord. passed 9-4-2007)
§ 153.057 STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS.
   Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Approximate Zone A and
established in §
153.021, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA,
the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
153.055, shall apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20
feet each side from top of bank, or five times the width of the stream,
whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered professional engineer is provided, demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined, based on the following criteria.
      (1)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter, and shall be
elevated or flood-proofed in accordance with standards in §§
153.055 and
153.056.
      (2)   When floodway or non-encroachment data is available from a federal,
state, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements
within floodway and non-encroachment areas shall also comply with the
requirements of sections §§
153.056 and
153.059.
      (3)   All subdivision, manufactured home park, and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data, if development is
greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such
base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference, in accordance
with §
153.021, and utilized in implementing this chapter.
      (4)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be
elevated or flood-proofed (non-residential) to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
153.005. All other applicable provisions of §
153.056 shall also apply.
(Prior Code, § 9-5049) (Ord. passed 9-4-2007)
§ 153.058 STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS WITH BASE FLOOD- ELEVATIONS, BUT
WITHOUT ESTABLISHED FLOODWAYS OR NON- ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available
from another source, but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are
identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report,
the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   Standards of §§
153.055 and
153.056; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification, with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer, is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.
(Prior Code, § 9-5050) (Ord. passed 9-4-2007)
§ 153.059 FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   (A)   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located
within the special flood hazard areas established in §
153.021. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of flood waters that have erosion potential and carry
debris and potential projectiles.
   (B)   The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in §§
153.055 and
153.056, shall apply to all development within such areas.
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments, shall be permitted unless:
            (a)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
            (b)   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been
approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon
completion of the proposed encroachment.
      (2)   If division (A) above is satisfied, all development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
provided the following provisions are met:
            (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
153.056(C); and
            (b)   The no-encroachment standard of division (B)(1) above.
(Prior Code, § 9-5051) (Ord. passed 9-4-2007)

IN GENERAL
§ 154.001 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as and cited as “The Zoning Ordinance of the
Town of Ranlo, North Carolina, and its perimeter”.
(Prior Code, § 9-4001) (Ord. passed 4-27-1970)
Statutory reference:
   Authority to adopt zoning ordinances, see G.S. §§ 160D-702 et seq.
§ 154.002 PURPOSE.
   The zoning regulations and districts as set forth in this chapter have been
made in accordance with a comprehensive plan. These zoning regulations and
districts are designed to avoid congestion of the streets, secure safety from
fire, panic, and other dangers, and promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare. They are further intended to provide adequate light and air,

Planning and Zoning Commission to review them so as to recommend and approve
them prior to presentation of its written recommendation and report to the
Board.
   (I)   Board approval. The Board may refuse to approve a site plan or
construction plan on the grounds that either it fails to provide unity of
development with other property in the area, or that it fails to adequately
protect residentially zoned properties in the same area from the adverse
effects of the operation, or that the proposal fails to provide safe conditions
for pedestrians and motorists, or that the plans fail to conform with the
requirements of this section.
   (J)   Final plans.

building inspection to include elevations of all buildings from all sides at a
scale not less than one-eighth inch to one foot.
      (2)   The final site plan shall be prepared on a 28-inch by 42-inch sheet
of reproducible permanent base material using the largest scale possible and

other information required by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (3)   The final site plan and final construction plan for the proposed
development for changes within the development shall be submitted by the
developer to the Planning and Zoning Commission and to the Inspections
Superintendent for their recommendations and report thereon.
      (4)   An affirmative recommendation of the final plans for the proposed
multi-family residential complex by the Planning and Zoning Commission and by
the Inspections Superintendent shall be upon the finding that the final plans
for the development are substantially in agreement with the preliminary site
plans and preliminary construction plans as approved by the Board and that
traffic hazards and congestion will not be created within the development and
upon the public streets at the point of ingress and egress to the development
and that the plans maintain the purposes of this subchapter and the functions
of the multi-family residential complex.
      (5)   After approval of the final plans by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and by the Inspections Superintendent and after a copy of the
approved plans is filed with the Inspections Superintendent, the latter, if
other pertinent town ordinances have been complied with, shall issue a building
permit for the construction, alteration, or expansion of any building within an
RMF Multi-Family Residential District upon application by the developer.
      (6)   (a)   No building shall be occupied within a RMF Multi-Family
District until the certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the
Inspections Superintendent and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued
unless the approved final plans have been substantially followed as to each
completed building and the use of the building complies with this chapter.
            (b)   Provided, however, that the Inspections Superintendent may
issue a certificate of occupancy for the completed structures or buildings even
though some other structures in the approved plans at the time are under
construction.
            (c)   Provided further, that a certificate of occupancy shall not
be issued for any completed structure until all drives, walks, parking spaces,
screens and truck loading and unloading facilities serving the structure shall
have been provided and substantially improved as shown on the approved final
plans.

   (L)   Effective approved site plan. All approved site plans for RMF Multi-
Family Districts shall be binding upon the applicants therefor, their
successors and assigns, shall limit and control the issuance and validity of
all building permits and certificates of occupancy and shall restrict and limit
the construction, location, use, and operation of all land and structures
included within the plans, provided, however, that upon a showing of necessity
therefor, minor changes in the location and size of structures may be permitted
if minor changes will not cause any of the following circumstances to occur:
      (1)   A change in the character of the development;
      (2)   A change of design for, or an increase of the hazards to,
pedestrian and vehicular circulation;
      (3)   Deleterious external effects on adjacent property; and
      (4)   A reduction in the originally approved setbacks from property
lines.
   (M)   Amendment or revision of site plan. Pursuant to the same procedure and

classification shall present to the Planning and Zoning Commission the
following items for consideration at the time, the petition for rezoning is
filed:
      (1)   A valid market analysis indicating the economic feasibility of the
proposed development by outlining:
            (a)   The trade area of the proposed shopping center;
            (b)   An estimate of the trade area population, present and future;
            (c)   An estimate of the effective buying power of the trade area,
both existing and proposed;
            (d)   An estimate of the net potential customer buying power for
stores in the proposed development; and
            (e)   An estimate of the amount of retail sales floor space in
square feet currently lacking in the trade area.
      (2)   A statement indicating readiness to proceed with the proposed
development by filing with the Inspections Superintendent an agreement signed
by the owner or owners of the proposed development that actual construction
shall begin within one year from the date final plans for the shopping center
are approved and shall be prosecuted to completion within a reasonable period
of time thereafter. In the event the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
Board find that the intent of this division (G)(2) has not been met or
construction has not commenced within the one-year period, proceedings may be
instituted for rezoning the area to its original classification. It is not the
intent of this section, however, to prohibit a reasonable extension of the one
year limit by the Board; and
      (3)   The preliminary site plan and the preliminary construction plan of
the proposed development.
   (H)   Preliminary plans.
      (1)   The preliminary site plan shall be prepared on a 30-inch by 42-inch
sheet of reproducible material using the largest scale possible and shall
contain:
            (a)   Dimensions of the property and adjacent lots and streets;
            (b)   Location and proposed use of all buildings with dimensions
and approximate ground floor area thereof;
            (c)   Topography of existing ground and paved areas and elevation
of street, alleys, utilities, sanitary and storm sewers, buildings, and
structures;
            (d)   Plans for collecting and disposing of storm water and
treatment of natural and artificial water courses;
            (e)   General indication of proposed grading, surface drainage,
terraces, retaining wall heights, grades on paved areas, and ground floor
elevations shown by contours or spot elevations;
            (f)   Parking areas with all spaces shown and dimensions thereof;
            (g)   Service area, truck loading facilities, service drives, and
dimensions thereof;
            (h)   Pedestrian walks or walkways with dimensions thereof;
            (i)   Drives and access to parking spaces with dimensions thereof;
            (j)   Curb cuts and points of ingress and egress and all sidewalks
with dimensions thereof;
            (k)   Distances between the buildings and the property lines;
            (l)   Locations of plantings, walls, and screening;
            (m)   Name and address of the development, name and address of the
developer, date and scale of the plan, and the name of the person or firm
preparing the plan; and
            (n)   Vicinity map at a scale of one inch to 1,000 feet.
      (2)   The preliminary construction plan, the preliminary site plan, and a
detailed perspective drawing of the shopping center representing the general
appearance of the buildings and grounds from the major thoroughfare must be
prepared by a person authorized by law.
      (3)   Recommendations and suggestions concerning the preliminary plans
for the proposed shopping center by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be
upon the findings that the plans for the development are so that traffic
hazards and congestion will not be created within the development and upon the
public streets at the point of ingress and egress to the development, and that
the plans maintain the purposes of this chapter and the functions of a shopping
center. Dedication of additional right-of-way for public street purposes may be
required to resolve potential traffic hazards and congestion. The lack of
minimum yard dimensions does not imply the lack of need for minimum dimensions.
The absence of minimum yard dimensions is to provide for flexibility and
imagination in design of the development. The purpose of a preliminary site
plan, preliminary construction plan, and perspective drawing of the shopping
center is to enable the Planning and Zoning Commission to review the shopping
center in order that it may recommend and approve the plans prior to
presentation of the written recommendation and report to the Board. In each
case consideration shall be given to the location of the various facilities and
buildings on the premises and minimum yard dimensions.
      (4)   The Board may refuse to approve a preliminary site plan or a
preliminary construction plan on the grounds that either fails to provide unity
of development with other business uses in the same zone, or that either fails
to adequately protect residential uses in adjacent zones from the adverse
effects of a business operation, or that either proposal fails to provide safe
conditions for pedestrians and motorists, or that either plan fails to conform
with the requirements of this chapter.
      (5)   Preliminary plans for the entire shopping center shall be prepared;
however, a section consisting of at least 33.3333% of the total proposed area
contained in the shopping center or a section of the shopping center consisting
of not less than five separate buildings, each housing a separate use, may be
designated for immediate development and final plans prepared for that section
only.
   (I)   Final plans.
      (1)   A final construction plan shall be prepared and shall include the
following:
            (a)   Detailed perspective drawing of the shopping center showing
the appearance of the buildings and grounds from the major access street; and
            (b)   Detailed final construction plans for purposes of building
inspection to include elevations of every building from all sides at a scale of
not less than one-eighth inch to one foot.
      (2)   The final site plan shall be prepared on a 30-inch by 42-inch sheet
of reproducible permanent base material using the largest scale possible and
shall include the following:
            (a)   Dimensions of the property and adjacent lots and streets;
            (b)   Location, ground floor area, and proposed use of buildings
with all dimensions thereof;
            (c)   Parking area with all spaces shown and dimensions thereof;
            (d)   Service area, truck loading facilities, service drives, and
dimensions thereof;
            (e)   Pedestrian walks or walkways with dimensions thereof;
            (f)   Drives and access to parking spaces with dimensions thereof;
            (g)   Curb cuts and points of ingress and egress and all sidewalks
with dimensions thereof;
            (h)   Distances between the buildings and the property lines;
            (i)   Location of plantings, walls, and screening; and
            (j)   Name and address of the development, names and addresses of
the developer or developers, date, scale of plan, and person or firm preparing
the plan.
      (3)   The final site plan shall show all the information required of the
preliminary site plan but the information shown shall be specific, precise, and
accurate to usual and recognized professional standards and not general in
nature.
      (4)   A design of the storm sewerage system shall be submitted to the
Public Works Director for his or her approval.
      (5)   The final site plan and final construction plan for the proposed
development or changes within the development shall be submitted by the
developer to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its approval. After the
approval is granted, the Inspections Superintendent shall, if other pertinent
town ordinances have been complied with, issue a building permit for the
construction, alteration, or expansion of any building within a BC-1 Shopping
Center Zone upon application by the developer, provided:
            (a)   Construction of at least five separate buildings housing at
least five separate units or construction of at least 33.3333% of the total
proposed area contained in the shopping center, whichever is greater, must be
commenced initially; thereafter, the developer may construct one building at a
time;
            (b)   No building shall be occupied within a BC-1 Shopping Center
Zone until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the Inspections
Superintendent and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless the
approved final plans have been substantially followed as to each completed
building and their use complies with this chapter;
            (c)   The Inspections Superintendent may issue a certificate of
occupancy for any completed structure or building even though some other
structures shown in the approved final plans at the time are under
construction; and
            (d)   A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for the
buildings constructed until all drives, walks, parking spaces, screening, and
truck loading and unloading facilities shall have been provided and
substantially improved as shown on the final plans as approved.
      (6)   Pursuant to the same procedure and subject to the same limitations
and requirements set forth in this section, a site plan may be amended or
revised, either partially or completely.

nonconforming use, except those required by law or ordinance or ordered by an
authorized officer to secure the safety of the building.
      (3)   The nonconforming use of any building or structure which is damaged

nonconforming use, is closely related to the former nonconforming use and no
more detrimental in its effects upon surrounding properties and the general
welfare than the former nonconforming use; and
            (g)   The granting of the special exception will not have an
adverse impact upon the adjoining properties and the neighborhood at large.
      (7)   Any special exception granted by the Board of Adjustments pursuant
to the provision of this section shall be valid only for a period of two years
from the date of issue. The special exception may thereafter be renewed for
two-years’ period, but only upon public hearings before the, and upon the,
Board’s again making the affirmative findings set out above. The Board may
impose any appropriate conditions and safeguards upon any such special
exception which it grants for the further protection of neighboring properties
and the public welfare.
   (B)   Nonconforming buildings or structures. Nonconforming buildings and
structures shall be allowed to remain subject to the following provisions.

exceeding 75% of its then reproduction value, exclusive of foundations, by
fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot, or Act of God, shall not be
reconstructed except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.

computed by subtracting 20% of the gross area (as allowance for street right-
of-way) and by dividing the remaining area by the minimum lot area requirements
for the zoning district in which the development is located. This section shall
apply regardless of the amount of land actually required for streets.
   (D)   An amount of land at a minimum equal to the amount of reduction in lot
size as determined by division (B) above shall be placed in open space within
the development and each lot shall have direct access or access by right-of-way
or easement to such open space. Such open spaces shall be held in nonprofit
corporate ownership by the owners of lots within the development. In
consideration of the purposes served by a cluster development, the title to
such open space property shall be preserved to the perpetual benefit of the
private properties in the development and shall be restricted against private
ownership for any other purposes. If the corporation desires, improvements may
be made within the open space provided that the maximum coverage of each type
of improvement shall not exceed the following:

   (G)   Development in a PUD shall be exempt from the minimum required lot
width, front yard, side yard and rear yard requirements of §§
154.027 through
154.030 relating to relationship of buildings to lots and access to streets
provided that the following development standards are followed. The overall
residential density limitation and residential building types of the
corresponding principal district shall apply in a PUD provided that a density
bonus which may involve a different residential development type may be
permitted during the PUD approval process as provided for herein.
      (1)   Lot size. The exemption from §§
154.027 through
154.030 provisions shall not apply in the following situations:
            (a)   No lot for a single family detached dwelling shall be less
that the minimum lot size for a single-family dwelling in the zoning district
in which the PUD is located.
            (b)   Cluster developments and zero lot line developments are
permitted subject to the special requirements for such developments.
      (2)   Vehicle access.
            (a)   Areas between structures shall be covered by easements where
necessary for access and to provide for maintenance and utility service.
            (b)   Primary vehicular access to office or commercial development
shall not be through intervening residential development.
            (c)   Local streets shall be located and designed so that they do
not encourage through access by traffic with origins and destinations outside
of the development.
      (3)   Pedestrian access. PUDs shall be designed and developed and uses so
arranged to promote pedestrian access within the development.
      (4)   Non-residential areas. Non-residential areas in PUDs shall be
designed and located to principally serve the residents of the PUD and the
surrounding area.
      (5)   Boundary treatment. The scale and setbacks of development in a PUD
within 150 feet of the perimeter of the PUD shall be in harmony with the
development on adjacent lands.
      (6)   Environmentally sensitive areas.
            (a)   One of the principal purposes of the PUD procedure is to
protect environmentally sensitive areas through the use of innovative
arrangement of buildings and spaces. It is the intent of the PUD process that
significant consideration in planning and design of PUDs shall be given to the
following elements such as but not limited to:
                  1.   Floodway and floodway fringe areas;
                  2.   Steep slopes and knolls;
                  3.   Wetlands;
                  4.   Water supply watersheds;
                  5.   Rock outcrops;
                  6.   Soil erosion and storm water management;
                  7.   Tree and foliage preservation;
                  8.   Habitat for threatened or endangered species;
                  9.   Areas of historical, archaeological or architectural
significance; and
                  10.   Useable open space; recreation area.
            (b)   In any case where the Board of Commissioners finds in its
opinion that the PUD provides for significant protection or enhancement of any
one or more of the above elements, or a similar element as determined by the
Board of Commissioners, the Board may award a bonus of up to 10% increase in
residential dwelling units for a PUD and may permit such additional dwelling
units to be of a development type not otherwise permitted in the PUD. The
determination by the Board of Commissioners of the significant protection or
enhancement of particular element shall be based upon a comparison between the
type of development that could be placed on the property under the current
zoning and other regulations and the proposed development scheme for the PUD.
      (7)   Unified development plan. The application for a PUD conditional use
permit as part of a conditional use rezoning shall be accompanied by a unified
development plan in the form of a site specific development plan.
      (8)   Phased development. A PUD may be developed in phases in the same
manner as a subdivision and subject to the phasing requirement for subdivision.

§ 154.052 FAMILY CARE HOMES.
   (A)   Performance criteria. A family care home shall be a use by right,
except that no family care home shall be located within one-half mile of
another family care home, unless a special exception is granted by the Board of
Adjustment for such reduced separation, in accordance with §
154.103.
   (B)   Special exception criteria.
      (1)   Such reduced separation will not result in the clustering of family
care homes that could promote the cloistering and isolation of handicapped
persons, instead of the integration and interaction of handicapped persons with
the community mainstream.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall only consider evidence relevant to
the above finding in reaching a decision to grant the special exception.
(Prior Code, § 9-4048) (Ord. passed 5-15-2007)
§ 154.053 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   The following procedures pertain to conditional use permits that are not
associated with a Parallel Conditional Use (PCUP) District.
   (A)   Purpose. There are many uses identified in this subchapter that are
“uses by right” and that are allowed “by right” in each general zoning district
subject to the use meeting certain area, height, yard, and off-street parking
and loading requirements. In addition to these uses, there are some uses in
these districts that are “conditional uses” are and subject to the issuance of
a conditional use permit. The purpose of having conditional uses is to ensure
that these uses are compatible with surrounding development and are in keeping
with the purposes of the general zoning district in which they are located.
There may be some uses that prior to adoption of this chapter were allowed as
“uses by right” but now are allowed subject to a conditional use permit. For
these uses, any expansion or modification to the uses would be subject to the
issuance of a conditional use permit.
   (B)   Procedures. A pre-application meeting between the applicant and the
administrator shall be required in order to familiarize the applicant of the
procedure for securing approval of a conditional use permit. The administrator
shall accept no conditional use permit application for review without such
meeting having first occurred unless the administrator determines that such
meeting would not serve any meaningful purpose and waives the meeting
requirement. Procedures for application submittal are as follows.
      (1)   A complete conditional use permit application that is signed by the
applicant and which is accompanied by a submittal fee (in accordance with a fee
scheduled approved by the governing board) shall be filed with the
administrator.
      (2)   The application shall be accompanied by a drawing or plan, drawn to
scale, that includes or is accompanied by the following:
            (a)   Name, address, and phone number of the property owner (or his
or her agent) and the property identification number of the property. (Note:
the property owner or his or her authorized agents are the only two parties who
may initiate a request for a conditional use permit);
            (b)   A boundary survey and vicinity map, showing the property’s
total acreage, general location in relation to adjoining streets, railroads
and/or waterways, date, and north arrow. The zoning classification of the
property in question and contiguous properties shall also be shown. (In lieu of
the boundary and survey maps, one or more up-to-date tax maps depicting the
area in question may be submitted. Any required drawing or depiction of the
proposed development or use shall not appear on the tax maps but rather shall
appear on the drawing or plan);
            (c)   The name and addresses of all owners, tax parcel numbers, and
existing land use(s) of all contiguous properties;
            (d)   Proposed use of all land and structures, including the number
of residential units proposed, if any, and total square footage of
nonresidential development;
            (e)   Location of all proposed structures, their approximate area
and exterior dimensions, height, and proposed number of structures;
            (f)   A description of all screening and landscaping required by
the this chapter and/or proposed by the applicant; the delineation of any
wooded, landscaped, or grassed areas existing prior to development and proposed
to remain on the property once the development is completed;
            (g)   All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way;
            (h)   Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time for
the project;
            (i)   Delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as
shown on the official Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood hazard
boundary maps for the county;
            (j)   Traffic, parking, and circulation plans showing the proposed
location and arrangement of parking spaces and ingress and egress to adjacent
streets;
            (k)   A list, if any, of all additional development conditions or
standards that differs from those that would normally apply to that use. Only
conditions that exceed the requirements within this chapter’s minimum standards
can be considered and listed by the applicant; and
            (l)   The administrator reserves the right to waive the depiction
of some or all of the information contained in divisions (B)(2)(e) through (B)
(2)(j) above, when, in his or her opinion, such information would serve no
meaningful purpose for the particular conditional use being requested.
Notwithstanding, if either the Board of Commissioners determines that
additional information as set forth in divisions (B)(2)(e) through (B)(2)(j)
above is needed to render a recommendation or decision on the application, they
may require the applicant to submit such additional information.
      (3)   In the course of evaluating the proposed conditional use, the Board
of Commissioners may request additional information from the applicant in order
to assist in the review process. A request for such additional information
shall stay any further consideration of the application by such agency. Such
additional requested information may include, but shall not be limited to, the
following:
            (a)   Storm water drainage plan;
            (b)   Existing and proposed topography at five-foot contour
intervals or less;
            (c)   The existing and proposed location of all water and sewer
lines and fire hydrants intended to serve the proposed development;
            (d)   Proposed number, type, and location of signs;
            (e)   A traffic impact study of the proposed development prepared
by a qualified transportation or traffic engineer or planner. Information
requested to be a part of the impact study may include:
                  1.   Existing traffic conditions within the study area
boundary;
                  2.   Traffic volumes generated by the existing and proposed
development on the parcel, including the morning peak, afternoon, or evening
peak, and average annual daily traffic levels;
                  3.   The distribution of existing and proposed trips through
the street network;
                  4.   Analyses of the capacities of intersections located
within the study area boundary;
                  5.   Recommendations for improvements designed to mitigate
traffic impacts and to enhance pedestrian access to the development from the
public right-of-way; and
                  6.   Other pertinent information, including, but not limited
to, accidents, noise, and impacts of air quality and other natural resources.
            (f)   Drawings of proposed building elevations; and
            (g)   An environmental impact statement that includes some or all
of the following:
                  1.   A cover sheet that provides, in summary form, a
description of the proposed project;
                  2.   A statement of purpose and need of the project;
                  3.   For projects proposed by public entities, a list of
alternatives of the proposed project;
                  4.   A succinct description of the environment affected by
the project;
                  5.   A discussion of short and long term consequences of the
project on the environment, including any adverse environmental impacts which
cannot be avoided; and
                  6.   A list of means that could be employed to mitigate any
negative effects on the environment caused by this project.
      (4)   Except as herein provided, no application shall be deemed complete
unless it contains or is accompanied by all items listed in division (B)(2)
above and as may otherwise be required per division (B)(3) above and a fee, in
accordance with a fee schedule approved by the governing board for the
submittal of conditional use permit applications. Said fee shall be waived for
any application submitted by any official or agency acting on behalf of the
county or the state.
      (5)   Any completed application submitted shall be heard by the
appropriate board for approval within 180 days. After the expiration of an
application, a new application may be submitted following the current
regulations in place at the time of the new application submittal.
   (C)   Public hearing notification.
      (1)   In order for a conditional use permit to be considered for
approval, a public hearing must be held by the Board of Commissioners. Any
complete application shall be submitted to the administrator at least 30
working days prior to the public hearing. This shall be sufficient time period
for the staff to review the application and produce a staff report and to
ensure that all applicable notification requirements can be met. Notification
of the public hearing shall be as follows.
            (a)   A notice shall be published in a newspaper having general
circulation in the county once a week, the notice to be published not less than
ten days nor more than 25 days prior to the date established for the hearing.
            (b)   The administrator shall post at least one notice on the site
for the proposed conditional use or an adjacent public street or highway right-
of-way at least ten days prior to the public hearing. Where multiple parcels
are included within the application, a posting on each individual parcel is not
required, but the county shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable
notice to interested persons. Such notice shall state the date and time of the
hearing, case number, and contact telephone number to obtain more information.
The notice shall be removed only after final action has been taken on the
matter.
            (c)   A notice of the public hearing shall be hand delivered or
sent by first class mail by the administrator to the applicant and to all
adjacent property owners at least ten days prior to the public hearing.
   (D)   Final decision.
      (1)   Conduct of public hearing. The Board of Commissioner’s public
hearing shall be held in a quasi-judicial manner. In approving an application
for a conditional use permit, the Board of Commissioner’s may attach fair and
reasonable conditions to the approval. Such conditions shall be limited to
those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the
development or use of the site. The petitioner will have a reasonable
opportunity to consider and respond to any additional requirements prior to
approval or denial by the Board of Commissioners. In no instance shall any of
these conditions be less restrictive than any requirements that would pertain
to that particular development found in the zoning district in which the
property is located and except where otherwise specifically allowed in this
chapter. Such conditions may exceed any performance criteria or minimum
requirements listed elsewhere in this chapter that pertain to that development.
Such conditions shall be mutually agreeable by the county and the petitioner.
      (2)   Burden of proof.
            (a)   The applicant has the burden of producing competent,
material, and substantial evidence tending to establish the facts and
conditions that divisions (D)(2)(b)2. and (D)(2)(b)4. below require. If any
person submits competent, material, and substantial evidence allegedly contrary
to any of the facts or conditions listed in divisions (D)(2)(b)1. and (D)(2)
(b)3. below, the burden of proof for overcoming such evidence shall rest with
the applicant.
            (b)   The Board of Commissioners may only issue a conditional use
permit if it has evaluated an application and found each of the following
findings in the affirmative:
                  1.   The use will not materially endanger the public health
or safety if located where proposed and developed according to plan;
                  2.   The use meets all required conditions and
specifications;
                  3.   The use will not substantially injure the value of
adjoining or abutting property unless the use is a public necessity; and
                  4.   The location and character of the use, if developed
according to the plan as submitted and approved, will be in harmony with the
area in which it is to be located and will be in general conformity with the
adopted land use plan and other plans for the physical development of the
county as adopted by the Board of Commissioners.
      (3)   Additional review criteria/findings of fact. In addition to the
findings of fact listed in division (D)(2) above, certain uses require the
consideration of additional review criteria. Before a conditional use permit
may be issued for said uses, the findings of fact listed in division (D)(2)
above along with those pertaining to that individual use must each be found in
the affirmative. (Note: in certain instances the findings contained in (D)(2)
above shall be substituted with those so indicated.)
      (4)   Effect of approval.
            (a)   If an application for a conditional use permit is approved,
the owner of the property shall have the ability to develop the use in
accordance with the stipulations contained in the conditional use permit or
develop any other use listed as a “permitted use” for the general zoning
district in which it is located. Such approval, however, does not immediately
authorize development activity, as the property owner will need to file for and
secure a zoning permit, in order to proceed with development. The administrator
shall ensure that any development plans submitted with such zoning permit
request are consistent with the terms and conditions of the conditional use
permit approved for such property or for any other use by right allowed in the
underlying zoning district. If, however, a conditional use permit is issued in
relation to the rezoning of a property to a Parallel Conditional Use (PCUP)
District, the property may be used only for the development for which that
conditional use permit was approved.
            (b)   Following approval of a conditional use permit authorizing
specified permitted uses and/or specified development conditions, the county
shall file and record a copy of the CUP in the office of the County Register of
Deeds.
      (5)   Binding effect.
            (a)   Any conditional use permit herein authorized shall be
perpetually binding to the property included in such permit unless subsequently
changed or amended by the Board of Commissioners. All conditions contained in
the conditional use permit shall run with the land and shall be binding on the
original applicants, their heirs, successors, and assigns, unless subsequently
changed or amended as provided for herein; however, the administrator may
approve minor changes in the detail of the approved application. A “minor
change” to the approved conditional use permit shall be deemed to be a change
which:
                  1.   Will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed
development to adjacent property;
                  2.   Will not increase the gross floor area of any
nonresidential use by the smaller of 10% or 10,000 square feet (Note: such
limitations shall be cumulative and shall be based on the gross floor area of
the conditional use permit as originally approved);
                  3.   Will not decrease the off-street parking ratio below the
minimum number of parking spaces required by this section;
                  4.   Will not increase the height of any structure to the
extent that additional usable floor space could be added;
                  5.   Will not result in an increase in the number of dwelling
units constructed; or
                  6.   Will not alter the uses permitted.
            (b)   Further changes to the development may be made only by the
Board of Commissioners in accordance with divisions (B) through (D) above.
            (c)   No certificate of compliance for a use listed as a
conditional use shall be issued for any building or land use on a piece of
property which has received a conditional use permit for such particular use
unless the building is constructed or used, or the land is developed or used,
in conformity with the conditional use permit. In the event that only a segment
of a proposed development has been approved, the certificate of compliance
shall be issued only for that portion of the development constructed or used as
approved.
      (6)   Period of validity of conditional use permit. Unless the Board of
Commissioners issues a conditional use permit which either is specifically
exempt from any time constraints or has some other specified time period for
implementation, the applicant must secure a valid building permit (or
certificate of compliance) within 24 months from date of issuance of the
conditional use permit. If a building permit or certificate of compliance is
not issued at the end of said time period, the conditional use permit shall
automatically expire and shall be deemed rescinded. Such rescission shall not
occur if the applicant has secured the vesting of a site development plan for a
period of greater than 24 months. The town shall file and record a copy of the
CUP in the office of the County Register of Deeds.
   (E)   Twelve-month limitation on reapplication.
      (1)   If a request for conditional use permit is denied, a similar
application for the same property or any portion thereof shall not be filed
until the expiration of a 12-month period from the date of denial. This waiting
period shall not be applicable where the application for a conditional use
permit is determined by the administrator to be substantially different from
(such as, not similar to) the original application.
      (2)   Notwithstanding, the administrator may allow resubmission of a
similar application within said 12-month period if he or she determines that
since the date of action on the prior petition:
            (a)   There has been a significant change in the zoning district
classification of an adjacent piece of property;
            (b)   The governing board has adopted a plan that changes public
policy regarding how the property affected by the proposed conditional use
should be developed;
            (c)   Construction or expansion of a road, water line, sewer line,
or other such facilities has occurred to serve the property and can accommodate
comfortably the intensity of development allowed under the proposed
classification; or
            (d)   There has been some other extraordinary change in conditions
or circumstances, outside the control of the petitioner, which justifies waiver
of the 12-month restriction on a new petition; this, however, shall not include
a change in the ownership of the subject property.
   (F)   Petition withdrawal.
      (1)   An applicant who has submitted a complete application for a
conditional use permit may withdraw the application prior to a final decision
being rendered.
      (2)   If said petition is withdrawn at least two working days prior to
the Board of Commissioners public hearing, a similar petition submitted by that
property owner (or his or her agent) shall not be accepted by the administrator
within 180 days of the date of withdrawal.
      (3)   If said petition is otherwise withdrawn prior to a final decision
being rendered, a similar petition submitted by that property owner/or his or
her agent shall not be accepted by the administrator within one year of the
date of withdrawal. Any new application shall be accompanied by the appropriate
fee.
   (G)   Change in conditional use permit. Any request to materially change
(such as, undergo a change other than one listed as a “minor change” in
division (D)(5) above) to the conditional use permit once it has been issued
shall require the issuance of a new conditional use permit. All notification
and procedural steps and requirements as outlined in divisions (B) through (D)
above shall be followed.
   (H)   Appeals. An appeal to the decision of the Board of Commissioners shall
be filed with the Clerk of Superior Court in the nature of certiorari no later
than 30 days after said decision has been filed in the administrator’s office
and as otherwise provided for in applicable state general statutes.

SCREENING
§ 154.065 REQUIREMENTS IN OFFICE AND INSTITUTIONAL, BUSINESS, AND INDUSTRIAL
ZONES.
   (A)   A buffer strip consisting of a durable masonry wall, fence, or hedge,
or other natural planting of comparable opacity, designed to be compatible with
the residential character of adjoining properties, shall be provided along the
side and/or rear lines of any lot zoned and used for nonresidential purposes,
wherever the side and/or rear lines adjoin a lot in any residential zone or
district. If a durable masonry wall or fence is used, it shall be four feet in
height between the street line and required setback line of the adjoining lot
in the residential zone or district and shall be from four feet in height to
six feet in height along the side or rear yards of the adjoining lot in the
residential zone or district.
   (B)   If a hedge or other natural planting of comparable opacity is used, it
shall consist of a planted strip at least ten feet in width, and containing a
mixture of deciduous and evergreen trees spaced in a staggered triangular
pattern not more than ten feet apart, and containing not less than two rows of
dense plant materials. The hedge shall be planted at an initial height of at
least three feet, and shall be of a variety that an average height of six feet
can be expected by normal growth within four years from the time of initial
planting. No plant material which would be a host to insects, would affect the
plants on adjoining property, or would spread disease can be used; and all
plant material must conform to the guidelines set forth in the 1959 edition of
American Standard for Nursery Stock, published by the American Association of
Nurserymen, Inc. All plant materials shall be planted at least three feet from
the side or rear lot line of the adjoining lot in a residential zone or
district.
(Prior Code, § 9-4051) (Ord. passed 4-27-1970)
§ 154.066 MAINTENANCE OF REQUIRED SCREENING.
   The durable masonry wall or fence shall be constructed and/or the plant
materials shall be planted in the required buffer strip prior to the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy by the Inspections Superintendent. The buffer
strip shall be maintained in neat order and condition by the property owner
and/or occupant of the premises. The plant material shall be periodically
trimmed or pruned at a height of not less than six feet, and diseased or dead
plant material shall be removed and replaced.
(Prior Code, § 9-4052) (Ord. passed 4-27-1970)
§ 154.067 OUTDOOR STORAGE.
   (A)   Outdoor storage of any material, stocks, or equipment, accessory to a
principal use on any lot shall be screened from any public street or from any
adjoining lots in a residential zone by a buffer strip ten feet in width, and
consisting of a durable masonry wall, fence, or hedge, or other natural
planting of comparable opacity as heretofore specified in this subchapter;
provided, however, that the screening may be located anywhere on the property.
   (B)   This requirement shall not apply to off-street parking lots nor to the
storage of new and used vehicles that are offered or intended for sale, except
along the side or rear yards of any lot in any zone or district where it
adjoins a lot in any residential zone or district, but shall apply to auto
wrecking and junk yards.
(Prior Code, § 9-4053) (Ord. passed 4-27-1970)
§ 154.068 WAIVER OF SCREENING REQUIREMENTS WHERE SCREENING IS ALREADY PROVIDED.
   In case of unusual topography or size of the tract involved, or in cases in
which screening devices already exist comparable to the general screening
requirements of §
154.048, creating a situation whereby the installation of a masonry wall,
fence, or hedge, or other natural planting of comparable opacity would not be
practical and would serve no useful purpose, the Inspections Superintendent is
hereby empowered to waive the requirements for screening; provided, however,
that the spirit and intent of this chapter and the provisions pertaining to the
required buffer strip are adhered to. This section shall not be construed to
negate the necessity for establishing screening for uses which are adjacent to
vacant properties.
(Prior Code, § 9-4054) (Ord. passed 4-27-1970)
§ 154.069 RESTRICTIONS.

or other agreements between parties, provided, however, that where this chapter
imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the
height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or

or agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.
(Prior Code, § 9-4093) (Ord. passed 4-27-1970)
§ 154.123 AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners may from time to time, on its own motion or
on petition, after public notice and hearing as provided by law, amend,
supplement, change, modify, or repeal the boundaries or regulations herein or
subsequently established, after submitting the petition to the Planning and
Zoning Commission for its recommendations and report.
      (1)   Once a completed application for petition has been received by the
Zoning Administrator, and the fees paid, the Zoning Administrator shall
promptly review it, and if complete, shall refer the application to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration at its next regularly
scheduled meeting.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have 30 calendar days from
the date of referral by the Zoning Administrator to review the application and
to submit its recommendation to the Board of Commissioners.
      (3)   A Planning and Zoning Commission member shall not vote on any
zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered
is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable
financial impact on the member.
      (4)   (a)   Upon making a recommendation, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is
consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted, and any other
officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall provide a written recommendation to the Board of Commissioners that
addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, but a comment by the Planning and Zoning
Commission that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive
plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by
the governing Board.
            (b)   In case, however, that a protest petition is filed against
the change on forms prescribed and furnished by the town, the amendment shall
not be passed except by a three-fourths vote of all members of the Board of
Commissioners.
            (c)   For purposes of this division(A)(4), vacant positions on the
Board of Commissioners and members who are excused from voting shall not be
considered “members of the Board of Commissioners” for calculation of the
requisite three-fourths vote. To qualify as a protest, the petition must be
signed by the owners of either: 20% or more of the area included in the
proposed change; or 5% of a 100-foot-wide buffer extending along the entire
boundary of each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned. A street
right-of-way shall not be considered in computing the 100-foot buffer area, as
long as that street right-of-way is 100 feet wide or less. When less than an
entire parcel of land is subject to the proposed zoning map amendment, the 100-
foot buffer shall be measured from the property line of that parcel. In the
absence of evidence to the contrary, the town may rely on the county tax
listing to determine the “owners” of potentially qualifying areas. A person who
has signed a protest petition may withdraw his or her name from the petition at
any time prior to the vote on the proposed zoning amendment. Only those protest
petitions that meet the qualifying standards set forth in this division (A)(4)
at the time of the vote on the zoning amendment shall trigger the super
majority voting requirement.
   (B)   A notice shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation
in the town area, once a week for two successive weeks, the first notice to be
published not less than ten days nor more than 25 days prior to the date
established for the public hearing. In computing such time, the date of
publication is not to be included, but the date of the hearing shall be
included.
   (C)   The Inspections Superintendent, when feasible, shall cause to be
erected, in a conspicuous place, a sign on the subject property or on an
adjacent street or highway right-of-way. The sign shall be erected with regard
to which any petition is filed to have the provisions of this chapter amended,
supplemented, changed, or modified, giving notice that it is proposed to rezone
the property, or that it is proposed to grant a special exception or variance,
and to which sign is attached a copy of the notice required by law to be posted
or advertised, which sign shall be so maintained on the property for at least
15 days prior to the date of the required public hearing. When multiple parcels
are included within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each
individual parcel is not required, but the town shall post sufficient notices
to provide reasonable notice to interested parties.
   (D)   A notice of the proposed zoning change shall be sent by first class
mail to all adjacent and abutting property owners at least ten calendar days
prior to the public hearing. In the case of “large-scale rezonings” (more than
50 properties owned by a total of at least 50 different property owners), the
town may elect to publish notice of the hearing per division (B) above,
provided that each of the advertisements shall not be less than one-half of a
newspaper page in size. The advertisement shall only be effective for property
owners who reside in the area of general circulations of the newspaper
publishing the notice. Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper
circulation area, according to the address listed on the most recent property
tax listing for the affected property, shall be notified by first class mail.
   (E)   Every petition to have the provisions of this chapter amended,
supplemented, changed, or modified as to any property shall be submitted on
forms prepared by the town, and shall be accompanied by a check in an amount
according to the fees established by the Board of Commissioners, to be used by
the town toward defraying the advertising costs and other expenses in
connection with the petition.
   (F)   When a petition for a change in zoning classification has been denied
by the Board of Commissioners after a public hearing, no new petition for any
change of the same property or any part thereof shall be filed within a period
of 12 months from the date of such decision by the Board.
      (1)   After the public hearing has been conducted and officially closed,
the Board of Commissioners shall render a decision concerning the proposal not
later than the next regularly scheduled Board of Commissioners meeting. A Board
of Commissioners member shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment
where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a
direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member.
      (2)   Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the Board of
Commissioners shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is
consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan, and explaining why the Board of
Commissioners considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public
interest.
   (G)   A petition for a change in zoning classification may be withdrawn by
the applicant at any time without penalty prior to consideration of such
request by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (H)   A petition for a change in zoning classification may be withdrawn
after approval of but prior to a public hearing before the Planning and Zoning
Commission, provided a written request for withdrawal bearing the signature of
the applicant shall have been received by the Town Clerk in sufficient time to
allow at least two normal working days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays, before the date established for the public hearing before the
Planning and Zoning Commission on the proposed change in order to notify the
public of such withdrawal. Thereafter, no new petition for any change in zoning
classification of the same property, or any part thereof, shall be filed within
a period of 60 days immediately following the withdrawal of the petition.
   (I)   A petition for a change in zoning classification may be withdrawal by
the applicant prior to a public hearing before the Board of Commissioners,
provided a written request for withdrawal bearing the signature of the
applicant which shall have been received by the Town Clerk in sufficient time
to allow at least two normal working days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and
legal holidays, before the date established for the public hearing in order to
notify the public of such withdrawal. Thereafter, no new petition for any
change in zoning classification of the same property, or any part thereof,
shall be filed within a period of 90 days immediately following the withdrawal
of the petition.
   (J)   A request for a withdrawal which does not meet the requirements of
divisions (F) and (G) above specifying the place and time for filing a written
request for withdrawal may be granted either by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or by the Board of Commissioners at the time of the public hearing;
provided however, in such event, no new petition for any change in zoning
classification of the same property, or any part thereof, shall be filed within
a period of six months from the date of such decision permitting withdrawal by
the Planning and Zoning Commission or within nine months from the date of such
decision permitting withdrawal by the Board of Commissioners.

first fiscal year, regardless of when they opened their business. (Example:
open a business in January 1999, get a permit before beginning business. In
June 1999 apply for a new permit for the year beginning July 1, 1999.) If a
homeowner moves to a new location within the town and plans to continue their
business, they must reapply for a new permit under the new location. Permits
cannot be transferred between persons or locations. If the name of the business
changes, then the homeowner must apply for a new permit for all records to be
accurate and legal.

inspections may be conducted.

cause unusual problems and hazards to the residents and visitors of the town.

other debris, to maximize the use of existing and new towers in order to reduce
the number of towers needed, to minimize potential hazards to low flying law
enforcement and medical helicopters, to restrict towers that adversely detract
from the natural beauty of the town by discouraging visual eyesores and to
minimize the negative economic impact on tourism.
   (B)   The Board of Commissioners specifically avers that this chapter is not
enacted with any consideration of the environmental health effects of radio
frequency emissions.
   (C)   The Board of Commissioners specifically avers that this chapter is not

§ 155.18 TOWER APPROVAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Any proposed tower shall provide a needed service or benefit to the
residents of the town and the surrounding area that cannot otherwise be met.
   (B)   Towers shall be sited to contain all ice-fall or debris from tower
failure on-site. The designated fall area is one and one-half times the tower
height or a minimum of 100 feet from property lines. A fall area of one-half to
one will be acceptable with a signed and sealed statement by a registered
professional engineer licensed by the state indicating such fall area would
prevent the tower’s fall from encroaching onto adjoining property.
   (C)   A tower shall be set back from other on-site and off-site towers and
supporting structures or other arrangements shall be made, such that one tower
will not strike another tower or its support structure if it falls.
   (D)   Tower lighting shall not exceed the minimum standards of the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) for a red obstruction lighting system contained
in Advisory Circular No. 70/7460-IF, dated September 27, 1978, as amended.
   (E)   To defeat unauthorized access, the base of the tower shall be
surrounded by a fence or wall at least eight feet in height unless the tower is
constructed entirely on a building over eight feet in height.
   (F)   Any telecommunications tower shall be engineered and constructed to
accommodate two additional antennas that are at least as large as the largest
proposed antenna identified in §
155.17(B)(4) of this chapter.
   (G)   Tower permit approval is conditional subject to the owner(s) agreeing
to allow future collocation of other antenna(s) or transmitting devices. This
agreement shall be submitted in writing and recorded in the Register of Deeds’
office.
   (H)   No tower shall exceed 200 feet in height.
   (I)   Towers shall be blended with the natural surroundings as much as
possible. Colors and materials shall be used that are compatible with the
surrounding area, except when otherwise required by applicable federal or state
regulations.
   (J)   The tower and equipment shall be located, designed and/or screened to
blend with the existing natural, or built surroundings to reduce the visual
impacts as much as possible, and to be compatible with neighboring land uses
and the character of the community.
   (K)   Any tower not in use for two continuous years shall be removed within
120 days after the tower owner and the current property owner have received
written notice by the Enforcement Officer or the Town Manager. The written
notice, mailed return receipt requested, shall be delivered to both the tower
owner identified on the tower permit application and the current property
owner.
   (L)    Property located within the tower’s fall area shall not be subdivided
as long as the tower is standing.
   (M)   A sign identifying the owner(s) and/or operator(s) of the tower and an
emergency telephone number shall be displayed in a clearly visible location on
the tower’s premises.
(Ord. 15-2021, passed - -)
§ 155.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
Each day’s violation of any provision of this chapter shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense. A violation begins from the date of first
written notification by the Enforcement Officer or the Town Manager. Further
violation shall be subject, upon conviction, to fine and/or imprisonment, as
provided by G.S. § 14-4.
   (B)   If a tower is constructed, reconstructed, altered, expanded or in
violation of this chapter, the Enforcement Officer or Town Manager in addition
to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceedings pursuant
to G.S. § 160A-175 to prevent the unlawful use, construction, reconstruction,
alteration or expansion, and to restrain, correct or abate the violation. The
Enforcement Officer or Town Manager may bring an action as to enjoin any
violations by action for injunction.
