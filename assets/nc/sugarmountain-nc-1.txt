§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, violation of any provision of
this code of ordinances for the village shall subject the offender to a civil
penalty in the amount of $200, to be recovered by the village. Violators shall
be issued written notice of the violation which must be paid within 20 days
after receipt of the notice. If the violator does not pay the penalty within 20
days, the village may recover such penalty, and all subsequent accruing
penalties, in a civil action.
   (B)   Upon the issuance of a notice of violation or citation, the Village
Manager may suspend any other permits or approvals issued to the violator,
including the issuance of a stop-work order, until such time as the violation
is cured and any civil penalty paid. An active appeal of the violation to the
appropriate village authority shall operate as a stay of the suspension of the
permits and approvals, unless the Village Manager determines that allowing the
work to continue would constitute a danger to health, life, safety, or
property.
   (C)   In the event there is an outstanding penalty amount or unresolved
violation of this code of ordinances, the village may require the violation to
be remedied as a condition for the issuance of any subsequent permit or
approval.

this code of ordinances shall not be a misdemeanor.
   (G)   If any division of this section is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, all other divisions shall nevertheless continue in full force
and effect.
   (H)   In the event it is necessary for the village to institute a civil
action to collect a civil penalty for the violation of any provision of any
village ordinance, the offender shall pay all court costs and reasonable
attorney’s fees incurred by the village.

§ 30.01 INCORPORATION AND CORPORATE POWERS.
   The inhabitants of the village are a body corporate and politic under the
name “Village of Sugar Mountain”. Under that name, they have all the powers,
duties, rights, privileges, and immunities conferred and imposed upon cities by
the general law of the state.
(Ord. passed 6-14-1985)
§ 30.02 VILLAGE COUNCIL.
   The governing body of the village is the Village Council, which has four
members and the Mayor.
(Ord. passed 6-14-1985)
§ 30.03 ELECTING COUNCIL MEMBERS.
   The qualified voters of the entire village nominate and elect the members of
the Council.
(Ord. passed 6-14-1985)
§ 30.04 TERM OF OFFICE OF COUNCIL MEMBERS.
   The Council members and Mayor shall each be elected by the qualified voters
of the village for four-year terms.
(Ord. passed 6-14-1985)
§ 30.05 QUORUM.
   The presence of any three members of the Village Council, including the
Mayor, at a duly called meeting if the Village Council, shall constitute a
quorum for all matters of business to be considered, unless a greater number of
members are specifically required by law to be present.
(Res. 2020.2, passed 3-24-2020)
§ 30.06 REMOTE MEETINGS.
   During a declared state of emergency by the Village of Sugar Mountain, the
duly elected Mayor, or in the vacancy or absence of the Mayor, the Mayor Pro
Tem, may determine that it is necessary for a meeting to be held telephonically
or by video conference. For purposes of a quorum, a member attending
telephonically or remotely shall be counted as present so long as they retain
the ability to address the other members of the Council and hear the other
members of the Council through that technology.
   (A)   (1)   Members not physically present. In the event a determination is
made that all parties, including Council members, attend remotely, the Village
Manager or his or her designee shall arrange suitable conference call
technology to allow all members of the Village Council to hear and communicate
with each other such that debate and motions are properly made and considered
by the Council. The Village Manger or her designee shall also make available
technology such that members of the public may listen to the proceedings of the
Village Council. In the event of a telephonic meeting, the provisions set forth
in G.S. § 160A-75 providing for a default "affirmative vote" of a non-voting
Council member shall not apply.
      (2)   Meeting without the physical presence of the public. In the event a
determination is made that some or all of the members of the Village Council
may be physically present for a meeting, but due to public health, safety, or
contagion concerns members of the public should not be physically present for a
meeting, the Village Manager or her designee shall also make available
technology such that members of the public may listen to the proceedings of the
Village Council. In the event a Council Member is attending telephonically, the
provisions set forth in G.S. § 160A-75 providing for a default "affirmative
vote" shall not apply. In the event of a failure of the technology such that
the general public is not able to listen to the proceedings of the Council, the
Council shall immediately recess the meeting and only reconvene after taking
reasonable actions to restore the opportunity of the general public to hear the
proceedings or allowing physical access to the meeting by the public.
   (B)   Notice of telephonic meetings or meetings without the physical
presence of the public. In the event a meeting is to be held telephonically or
without the physical presence of the public, the notice of meeting shall
include the method by which the meeting is to be held, whether the public is
allowed to be physically present at Village Hall or the location of the meeting
if held elsewhere, the method by which the public may access the meeting, and
the fact that the meeting is being held in this manner due to the declaration
of the state of emergency pursuant to G.S. Ch. 166A. This notice shall be
posted in a conspicuous place at the location of village government,
distributed to local media outlets, and emailed (if possible) to all
subscribers to the village's "sunshine list."
   (C)   Public comment and public hearings. During a state of emergency which
affects the public attendance of a meeting, the Village of Sugar Mountain will
make efforts to enable comment by the public in accordance with G.S. § 160A-
81.1 or upon public hearings pending before the Council. The Village Manager or
his or her designee shall include, on the notice of meeting, the method by
which citizens shall be able to participate in public comment or a public
hearing before the Council. In the event it is not possible for the Council to
take public comment in accordance with G.S. § 160A-81.1, the Village Manger
shall advise the Council of the steps which have been taken to attempt to
arrange for public comment and why public comment is not available. In the
event it is not possible for the Council to take public comment at a public
hearing, that hearing shall be continued in accordance with GS § 160A-81.
   (D)   This section shall only apply to meetings called or held during a
declared state of emergency pursuant to G.S. Ch. 166A.

§ 31.01 ESTABLISHMENT OF BOARD.
   The Village Council hereby establishes the village’s Board of Adjustment.
Members of the Board shall be appointed by the Village Council. The Board shall
constitute, function, and may be referred to as the “Board of Adjustment”.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XII § 1200)
§ 31.02 APPOINTMENT AND TERMS OF BOARD.
   (A)   There shall be a Board of Adjustment consisting of five regular in-
village members, two regular extraterritorial jurisdiction members, and three
alternate in-village members, and two alternate extraterritorial jurisdiction
members. Five regular members of the Board shall be citizens of the village and
shall be appointed by the Village Council, and two regular extraterritorial
jurisdiction members shall be appointed by the County Board of Commissioners
and shall be a citizen of the extraterritorial area outside the village limits.
The Village Council shall appoint three alternate members for the
municipalities’ regular members and the County Board of Commissioners shall
appoint two alternate members for the extraterritorial members. Alternates
shall serve on the Board in the absence or temporary disqualification of any
regular member or to fill a vacancy pending appointment of a member. Each
alternate, while attending any regular or special meeting of the Board and
serving on behalf of any regular member, shall have and may exercise all the
powers and duties of a regular member. Extraterritorial jurisdiction members
shall only serve on matters involving property located within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction. All members shall be residents of the village or
its extraterritorial jurisdiction, respectively.
   (B)   Board of Adjustment regular members and alternates shall be appointed
for three-year staggered terms, but both regular members and alternates may
continue to serve until their successors have been appointed. Vacancies may be
filled for the unexpired terms only.
   (C)   Members may be reappointed to successive terms without limitation.
   (D)   Unless the Village Council takes specific action to excuse the
absences and reappoints a member after being informed by the Administrator of
the member’s failure to attend, regular Board of Adjustment members may be
removed for failure to attend three consecutive meetings or for failure to
attend 50% of the regular meetings in any 12-month period. Absence due to
sickness, death, or other emergencies of like nature shall be recognized as
excused absences, and shall not affect the member’s status on the Board, except
that in the event of a long illness or other such cause for prolonged absence,
the member shall be replaced. Alternate members may likewise be removed for
failure to attend or participate in three consecutive meetings for which the
member’s attendance is requested. The Administrator shall notify in writing any
member for whom one more absence will trigger removal. In addition, the
Administrator or a member of the Village Council may propose removal of a
member for any other good cause related to the performance of Board duties, but
before removal on that basis, the member shall be given an opportunity to
appear before the Village Council to address the issues involved.
   (E)   If a regular or alternate member moves outside the jurisdiction of the
village, that shall constitute a resignation from the Board.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XII § 1201)
§ 31.03 MEETINGS OF THE BOARD.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall establish a regular meeting schedule and
shall meet frequently enough so that it can take action as expeditiously as
reasonably as possible.
   (B)   The Board shall conduct its meetings in accordance with the quasi-
judicial procedures.
   (C)   All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public and, whenever
feasible, the agenda for each Board meeting shall be made available in advance
of the meeting.
   (D)   Compensation for service on the Board of Adjustment may be set by the
Village Council, and may be changed at any time. No compensation will be paid
for periods in which no meetings have occurred.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XII § 1202)
§ 31.04 QUORUM.
   A quorum shall consist of four members of the Board, and shall be necessary
for the transaction of any business. The Board shall not pass upon any
questions relating to an appeal from a decision, order, requirement, or
determination of the Zoning Administrator, or an application for a variance or
special use permit when there are less than four members present. In those
cases where the chapter requires a four-fifths favorable vote of the Board, a
continuance shall be offered to the parties to obtain the presence of a full
Board, if feasible, based upon vacancies and existing membership.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XII § 1203) (Res. R-2021.9, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 31.05 VOTING.
   (A)   The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board shall be necessary to
grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any
other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of
certiorari. For purposes of this section, vacant positions on the Board and
members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not
be considered members of the Board for calculation of the requisite majority if
there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such members.
   (B)   Once a member is physically present at a Board meeting, any subsequent
failure to vote shall be recorded as an affirmative vote unless the member has
been excused in accordance with division (C) below or has been allowed to
withdraw from the meeting in accordance with division (E) below.
   (C)   A member shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter
in a manner that would violate an affected person’s constitutional rights to an
impartial decision maker. Impermissible conflicts include, but are not limited
to:
      (1)   A member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is
not susceptible to change;
      (2)   A member having undisclosed ex parte communications;
      (3)   A member having a close familial, business, or other associational
relationship with an affected person; and
      (4)   A member having a financial interest in the outcome of the matter.
   (D)   If an objection is raised to a member’s participation and that member
does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members shall by majority
vote rule on the objection.
   (E)   A member may be allowed to withdraw from the entire remainder of a
meeting by majority vote of the remaining members present for any good and
sufficient reason other than the member’s desire to avoid voting on matters to
be considered at that meeting.
   (F)   A motion to allow a member to be excused from voting or excused from
the remainder of the meeting is in order only if made by or at the initiative
of the member directly affected.
   (G)   A roll call vote shall be taken upon the request of any member.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XII § 1204)
§ 31.06 OFFICERS OF THE BOARD.
   (A)   At its first regular meeting in January, the Board of Adjustment
shall, by majority vote of its membership (excluding vacant seats), elect one
of its members to serve as Chairperson and preside over the Board’s meetings
and one member to serve as Vice-Chairperson. The persons so designated shall
serve in these capacities for terms of one year. Vacancies may be filled for
the unexpired terms only by majority vote of the Board membership (excluding
vacant seats).
   (B)   The Chairperson or any member temporarily acting as Chairperson may
administer oaths to witnesses coming before the Board.
   (C)   The Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson may take part in all
deliberations and vote on all issues.
   (D)   The Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson may make or second any motion.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XII § 1205)
§ 31.07 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide:
      (1)   Appeals from and review any order, decision, requirement, or
determination made by the Administrator;
      (2)   Applications for special use permits;
      (3)   Applications for variances;
      (4)   Questions involving interpretations of the zoning map, including
disputed district boundary lines and lot lines; and
      (5)   Any other matter the Board is required to act upon by any other
village ordinance.
   (B)   The Board may adopt rules and regulations governing its procedures and
operations not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment may subpoena witnesses and compel the
production of evidence.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XII § 1206) (Res. R-2021.9, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 31.08 APPEALS TO THE BOARD.
   (A)   An appeal from any final order, requirement, decision, or
determination or part thereof made by the Administrator may be taken to the
Board of Adjustment by any person aggrieved. An appeal is taken by filing with
the Administrator a properly filled out and signed application form and payment
of the applicable fee. The fee shall be reimbursable in the event that the
Board of Adjustment wholly reverses the order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Administrator or part thereof which is being appealed.
   (B)   An appeal must be taken within 30 days after the date of the receipt
of any final order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from.
Unless established at an earlier date by a return receipt for a certified mail
notice, the date of receipt shall be conclusively presumed as three days after
the notice of the decision or order appealed from has been deposited in the
United States mail with proper postage affixed, and addressed to the aggrieved
party.
   (C)   Whenever an appeal is filed, the Administrator shall forthwith
transmit to the Board of Adjustment the written notice of appeal and all the
papers constituting the record relating to the order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed from.
   (D)   An appeal stays all actions by the Administrator seeking enforcement
of or compliance with the order, requirement, decision, or determination
appealed from, unless the Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment
that (because of facts stated in the certificate) a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, or that because the
situation appealed from is transitory in nature, an appeal would seriously
interfere with enforcement of this subchapter. In that case, enforcement
proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the Board of Adjustment or a
court, issued on application of the party seeking the stay, for due cause
shown, after notice to the Administrator and all other persons who have
qualified as parties under the duly enacted rules of procedure of the Board of
Adjustment.
   (E)   The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or
may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from,
and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that in its
opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the Board shall
have all the powers of the Administrator from whom the appeal is taken.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XII § 1207)
§ 31.09 VARIANCES.
   (A)   An application for a variance shall be submitted to the Board of
Adjustment by filing a properly filled out and signed application form with the
Administrator and payment of the applicable fee.
   (B)   When unnecessary hardship would result from carrying out the strict
letter of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the
provisions of this chapter upon a showing of all of the following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
this chapter. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance;
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship; and
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of this subchapter, such that public safety is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.
   (C)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
   (D)   Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that
the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XII § 1208)
§ 31.10 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIANCES WITHIN WATER SUPPLY WATERSHEDS.
   (A)   The Administrator shall notify in writing each local government having
jurisdiction in the watershed district as well as any entity using the
watershed for water consumption. Such notice shall include a description of the
variance being requested. Local governments receiving notice of the variance
request may submit comments to the Administrator prior to a decision by the
Board of Adjustment. Such comments shall become a part of the record of
proceedings of the Board of Adjustment.
   (B)   If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if
the Board of Adjustment decides in favor of granting the variance, the Board
shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed.
The preliminary record of the hearing shall include:
      (1)   The variance application;
      (2)   The hearing notices;
      (3)   The evidence presented;
      (4)   Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on
them;
      (5)   Proposed findings and exceptions; and
      (6)   The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be
added to the permit.
   (C)   The preliminary record shall be sent to the state’s Environmental

   (B)   Due to the widespread narrow village streets within the corporate
limits of the village, the size of emergency vehicles, the limited amount of
parking areas, at both private residences and the local ski resort, available
for large numbers of people, the frequency of large inflows of people to said
village during the year and, finally the extreme weather conditions present
during the year, the Council finds that a potential hazard exists on each and
every village street concerning the passage of an emergency vehicle. Therefore,
the Council hereby designates all village streets and rights-of-way within the
corporate limits of the village as fire lanes, and the Village Manager shall
install appropriate traffic signs at the entrance to each village street
indicating that it is a fire lane. However, the enforcement of the provisions
of this section is not dependent on the installation of such signs.
   (C)   All construction personnel and service employees who are engaged in
performing work within the village may park their vehicles on the street right-
of-way only when such parked vehicles do not interfere or obstruct traffic and
said owners are available immediately so that the removal of a vehicle will be
prompt if so needed for any reason.
   (D)   No agent or employee of the village, no person or occupant of the
premises from which any derelict or abandoned vehicle shall be removed, not any
person or firm contracting for the removal of or disposition of any such
vehicle shall be held criminally or civilly liable in any way arising out of or
caused by carrying out or enforcing any provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   This section is written in accordance with G.S. § 20-162(b) and all
authority, both expressed and implied, granted by the aforestated statute shall

yard or area and thereafter may dispose of them in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   No motor vehicle may be removed from private property without the
written request of the owner, lessee, or occupant of the premises.
   (C)   The village may require any person requesting the removal of a junked
or abandoned motor vehicle from private property to indemnify the village
against any loss, expense, or liability incurred because of the removal,
storage, or sale thereof. Under no circumstance shall the village be required
to tow or cause to be towed any vehicle.
   (D)   No agent or employee of the village, no person or occupant of the
premises from which any derelict or abandoned vehicle shall be removed, nor any
person or firm contracting for the removal of or disposition of any such
vehicle shall be held criminally or civilly liable in any way arising out of or
caused by carrying out or enforcing any provision of this chapter.
(Prior Code, Ch. 4 § 4.3) (Ord. R-2019.10, passed 8-20-2019)
§ 71.08 NOTICE REQUIRED WHEN VEHICLE REMOVED.
   (A)   When any junked or abandoned motor vehicle is removed in accordance
with this chapter, the village shall promptly give written notice of the
removal to the owner of the vehicle at his or her last known address, according
to the latest registration certificate or certificate of title on file with the
state’s Division of Motor Vehicles, or if the vehicle is not required to be
registered according to the best information reasonably available concerning
the owner’s last known address. The notice shall also inform the owner that he
or she may regain possession of the vehicle by paying to the village all
reasonable costs incidental to the removal of and storage of the vehicle.
   (B)   Whenever a vehicle is towed in accordance with this chapter, the owner
of such vehicle shall be entitled to the right of an administrative hearing
(appeal) before the Village Manager to determine if the towing was legally
necessitated and proper. Said appeal shall be considered only if requested
within 72 hours of the time the relevant vehicle’s owner was notified. The
appeal request may be initiated on a “right to hearing notice” in which the
police officer will provide to the owner of the towed vehicle as soon as
practicable after the towing. The pertinent owner may waive the right to an
appeal on the foregoing form. If the said waiver is signed, the owner of the
towed vehicle is immediately responsible for all towing and storage fees that
accrue from the date of towing. If an appeal request is made within the
prescribed period of time, the Village Manager will hold a hearing concerning
the matter within ten days of receipt of said appeal request. If the Village
Manager determined that the towing was legally necessitated and proper, the
owner of the towed vehicle shall be immediately responsible for all towing and
storage fees that accrue from the date of towing. Conversely, if the Village
Manager determines that the towing of the vehicle was illegal and improper, the
owner of towed vehicle shall not be responsible for any towing and storage fees
accrued, and all towing and/or storage fees previously collected shall be paid
in full to the village (the Village Manager or his or her designee) in order to
obtain possession of the towed vehicle.

   (A)   After holding an abandoned or junked motor vehicle for 30 days as
provided in this chapter, the village may sell or dispose of it as provided in
this chapter.
   (B)   Failure of the owner of the vehicle to pay all costs and fees related
to the removal of the vehicle within 30 days of the removal shall entitle the
village to sell the vehicle to enforce the removal and storage lien, as
provided in G.S. §§ 44A-4 through 44A-6. If no one purchases the vehicle, and
if the value of the vehicle is less than the amount of the lien, the village
may destroy it.
   (C)   The village may release the vehicle to the owner at any time after
removal upon the owner posting an adequate bond to cover all costs and fees or
paying in cash the sum of all costs and fees related to the removal and
storage.
   (D)   Any person having an interest in the vehicle may redeem it any time
before the sale by paying all costs accrued to date.
   (E)   The proceeds of the sale shall be paid to the Finance Officer who
shall pay to the appropriate officers or persons the costs of removal, storage,
investigation, sale and lien of record, in that order. The remainder of the
proceeds of sale, if any, shall be paid over to the registered owner, or held
by the village for 60 days if the registered owner cannot be located with
reasonable diligence. If the owner does not claim the remainder of the proceeds
within 60 days after the sale, the funds shall be deposited in the village
general fund and the owner’s rights shall forever be extinguished.

developer must provide a debris container. The contractor shall remove all
trash and discard materials from the building site at least once per week so as
to maintain a reasonably clean area that would not be objectionable to the
general public. All trash, construction litter, and discarded building
materials shall be removed from the building site and surrounding area before
the structure is occupied.
   (C)   Only materials and equipment that are to be used to build a portion of
the project shall be stored on the construction site. No material shall be
stored within any public right-of-way. If the construction site is inactive for
a period of 30 days or more, all materials shall be neatly stacked and secured
from movement by wind, and all equipment shall be removed from the site. Ground
areas that are disturbed more than ten feet outside the footprint of the
structure shall be temporarily seeded; mulched, graveled, or adequately
mulched.
   (D)   In order to assure public safety, the contractor shall provide an
adequate amount of gravel at the entrance of the building site in order to
prevent the accumulation of mud upon village streets. If, in the opinion of the
Zoning Administrator or the Public Works Department, the material tracked on to
the road creates a hazard, the developer shall immediately remove the material
and take steps to continuously clean the road. Negligence of the responsible
parties to clean the roadway will result in a stop work order being issued.

§ 150.04 EXEMPT SIGNS.
   (A)   The village finds that particular features or concerns regarding the
following types of signs provide compelling reasons for their regulation in a
different manner from other signs of similar duration of display or located
within a common zoning district.
   (B)   The following signs and/or displays shall be exempt from the
regulations of this chapter:
      (1)   Signs not visible beyond the boundaries of the property on which
they are located;

signs or devices. For the purpose of this chapter, this exemption shall include
street signs and on-premises directional signs owned and maintained by the
village;

the Village Council which are erected to welcome visitors to the village. Such
signs may have affixed to them names and/or emblems of civic groups and
churches;
      (4)   Trade names and graphics which are customarily painted on newspaper
and soft drink dispensers. The village finds there is a compelling interest in
exempting these signs from regulation due to their ubiquitous nature and the
impracticality or inability to obtain soft drink dispensers and the like
without such trade names or graphics. Therefore, these signs are exempt from
the requirements of this chapter;
      (5)   Non-illuminated gasoline pump signs giving information such as
self-service instructions, price, type of fuel, and the like, shall be
permitted. These may contain the trade name and/or emblem, but shall not exceed
a total of six square feet per island. The village finds there is a compelling
interest in exempting these signs from regulation due to safety concerns and
the needs of the motoring public to discern both the type of fuel and the price
thereof. Therefore, these signs are exempt from the other requirements of this
chapter; and
      (6)   All off-premises directional signs existing prior to May 5, 1990,
provided that the message, background, colors, dimensions, orientation,
location, and design of the support structure of such signs shall not be

need for private property owners to be able to control aspects of traffic on
private property in order to avoid damage to property and inconveniences and
potential dangers caused by the restriction of ingress and egress to a property
by methods such as designating parking spaces and restricting “no parking”

permits and approvals, unless the Village Manager determines that allowing the
work to continue would constitute a danger to health, life, safety, or
property.
   (C)   In the event there is an outstanding penalty amount or unresolved
violation of this chapter, the village may require the violation to be remedied
as a condition for the issuance of any subsequent permit or approval.

in each subdivision as specified in this subchapter. Each subdivision shall
adhere to the minimum standards of design established.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. IV § 401)
§ 151.066 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   (A)   Where land to be subdivided is found by the Planning Board to be
subject to the conditions of flooding, improper drainage, severe erosion,
slides, or to have other characteristics which pose an ascertainable danger to
health, safety, or property, the subdivider shall take measures necessary to
correct said conditions and to eliminate said dangers. In making such
determinations, the Planning Board may seek to take into consideration the
following, if reasonably obtainable: official Federal Emergency Management
Agency flood boundary and floodway maps and flood insurance rate maps for the
county; the county soil survey; and recommendations from the Tennessee Valley
Authority, U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service, and the County Health
Department. Any findings made by the Planning Board pursuant to this section
and the basis for said findings shall be in writing and recorded in the minutes
of the Planning Board.
   (B)   Areas that have been used for disposal of solid waste shall not be
subdivided unless tests by the County Health Department, a structural engineer,
and a soils expert determine that the land is suitable for the purposes
proposed.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. IV § 402)
§ 151.067 NAME DUPLICATION.
   In order to lessen possible confusion which could hamper the response time
for emergency vehicles, the name of a subdivision shall not duplicate nor
closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision within the village.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. IV § 403)
§ 151.068 SUBDIVISION DESIGN.
   (A)   Blocks.
      (1)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks should be determined with
due regard to: provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the type of use contemplated; local ordinances; needs for vehicular
and pedestrian circulation and control of street traffic; and limitations and
opportunities of topography.
      (2)   Blocks should have sufficient width to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth except where single tier lots are required to separate
residential development from through vehicular traffic or another type of use
in nonresidential subdivisions or where abutting a water area.
   (B)   Lots.
      (1)   All lots in new subdivisions and all lots replatted in existing
subdivisions shall conform to the area and dimensional requirements of the
zoning district in which the subdivision is located, with the exception of lots
located in hillside subdivisions as defined in §§
151.090  to
151.093 . Conformance to area and dimensional requirements of
Chapter 154  means, among other things, that the smallest lot in the
subdivision shall meet all dimensional requirements of the chapter. The
averaging of lot areas to meet the minimums established in the zoning district
is not permitted.
      (2)   Property lot lines shall be drawn to the proposed street right-of-
way.
      (3)   All lots platted under the jurisdiction of this chapter shall meet
any applicable requirements of the County Health Department. The Health
Department must, according to state law and ordinances of the County Health
Department, require larger lot sizes if said larger lots are necessary to
protect the public health and ensure proper operation of septic systems and
wells.
      (4)   Each lot intended for the development of more than one plat and
shall conform to the area and dwelling unit shall be so designated on the plat
and shall conform to the area and dimensional requirements of the zoning
district in which it is located. If the lot is not served by public water and
sewer, written approval shall be obtained from the County Health Department.
      (5)   Each lot intended for development of nonresidential use shall be so
designated on the plat and shall conform to the area, dimensional, and other
applicable provisions of the zoning district in which it is located. If the lot
is not served by public water and sewer, written approval shall be obtained
from the County Health Department.
   (C)   Easements.
      (1)   Utility easements. Utility easements for utilities shall be
provided, where necessary, preferably centered on the side of rear lot lines
and shall be at least ten feet wide.
      (2)   Drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a
stream or drainageway, a drainage easement shall be provided conforming with
the lines of such stream or drainageway. The said drainage easement shall be of
sufficient width to carry storm water runoff from a ten-year storm.
      (3)   Buffer easement. The Village Council, upon recommendation by the
Planning Board, may require a buffer easement of at least ten feet in width
adjacent to a major street or a commercial or industrial development. The
Village Council also may require that the subdivider be responsible for the
grading and planting of said buffer easement.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. IV § 404)
§ 151.069 STREETS.
   (A)   Type of streets required. All subdivision lots shall abut on an
approved public or private street. All public and private streets located
within the jurisdiction of the village shall be designed and constructed to
meet the minimum construction requirements for public streets of the state’s
Department of Transportation’s publication, Subdivision Roads, Minimum
Construction Standards, July 1, 1985, or as hereafter amended.
      (1)   Public streets. All streets proposed for public use in the village
shall be dedicated to the village. A written maintenance agreement sufficient
for recording in the office of the Register of Deeds shall be submitted with
the final plat. Said maintenance agreement will provide for the subdivider or a
property owner’s association to maintain the street, drainage facilities, and
right-of-way until such time as the street is accepted for maintenance by the
village.
      (2)   Private streets. Private streets shall be platted as a part of any
subdivision or development as provided in
Chapter 154. All private streets shall be designed and constructed to meet the
minimum construction requirements for public streets of the state’s Department
of Transportation’s publication, Subdivision Roads, Minimum Construction
Standards, July 1, 1985, or as hereafter amended. All private streets shall
have a written maintenance agreement sufficient for recording in the office of
the Register of Deeds. Said maintenance agreement will provide for the
developer or a property owner’s association to perpetually own and maintain the
streets, drainage facilities, and rights-of-way within the development.
   (B)   Subdivision street disclosure statement. All streets shown on the
final plat shall be designated in accordance with G.S. § 136-102.6, and
designation as public shall be conclusively presumed on offer of dedication to
the public. Where streets designated private or are dedicated to the public but
not accepted into the village before lots are sold, a statement explaining the
status of the street and the required ownership and maintenance agreements
required in divisions (A)(1) or (A)(2) above shall be included with the final
plat.
   (C)   Half-streets. The dedication of half-streets at the perimeter of a new
subdivision shall be prohibited. The proposed subdivision shall provide the
amount of right-of-way required to meet the standards required in divisions (A)
(1) or (A)(2) above.
   (D)   Marginal access streets. Where a tract of land to be subdivided joins
a principal arterial street, the subdivider may be required to provide a
marginal access street parallel to the arterial street or reverse frontage on a
minor street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the arterial. Where
reverse frontage is established, private driveways shall be prevented from
having direct access to the principal arterial. No private driveway shall
access more than three homes at any given time. If more than three homes are
accessed by a driveway, it is then considered a road and shall be built to
standards stated under this section.
   (E)   Access to adjacent properties. Where, in the opinion of the Village
Council, it is necessary to provide street access to an adjoining property,
proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such
property and a temporary turn around provided.
   (F)   Design standards. The design of all public and private streets and
roads within the jurisdiction of this chapter shall be in accordance with the
standards and requirements for public streets of the state’s Department of
Transportation’s Subdivision Roads, Minimum Construction Standards, July 1,
1985, or as hereinafter amended. In any case, where standards or requirements
in this chapter are different from those in the Subdivision Roads, Minimum
Construction Standards, the more stringent requirement shall be required.
      (1)   Intersections.
         (a)   Subdivision streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other
street at an angle less than 60 degrees.
         (b)   Property lines at intersections should be set so that the
distance from the edge of pavement of the street turnout to the property line
will be at least as great as the distance from the edge of pavement to the
property line along the intersecting streets. This property can be established
as a radius or as a sight triangle. Greater offsets from the edge of pavement
to the property lines will be required, if necessary, to provide sight distance
for the vehicle on the side street.
         (c)   Offset intersections are to be avoided unless exception is
granted by the Division of Highways. Intersections which cannot be aligned
should be separated by a minimum length of 200 feet between survey centerlines.
         (d)   Intersections with arterials, collectors, and thoroughfares
shall be at least 1,000 feet from centerline to centerline, or more if required
by the state’s Department of Transportation.
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs. Permanent dead end streets should not exceed 500 feet
in length unless necessitated by topography or property accessibility, and in
no case shall be permitted to be over 900 feet. Measurement shall be from the
point where the centerline of the dead end street to the center of a turn
around of the cul-de-sac. Where one cul-de-sac intersects with another cul-de-
sac, the end of each cul-de-sac shall be no more than 500 to 900 feet from a
through street, measured as stated above. The distance from the edge of
pavement to the vehicular turn around to the right-of-way line shall not be
less than the distance from the edge of pavement to right-of-way line on the
street approaching the turn around. Cul-de-sacs should not be used to avoid
connection with an existing street or to avoid the extension of an important
street, unless exception is granted by the Village Council.
      (3)   Alleys.
         (a)   Alleys shall be required to serve lots used for commercial and
industrial purposes, except that this requirement may be waived where other
definite and assured provision is made for service access.
         (b)   The width of an alley shall be at least 20 feet.
         (c)   Dead end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if
unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turn around facilities at the dead
end as may be approved by the Village Council.
         (d)   Sharp changes in alignment and grade shall be avoided.
   (G)   Thoroughfare plan. The provision of street and road rights-of-way
shall conform to and meet the requirements of any thoroughfare plan adopted by
the Village Council and the state’s Board of Transportation.
   (H)   Other requirements.
      (1)   Through traffic discouraged on residential collector and local
streets. Residential collector and local streets shall be laid out in such a
way that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Streets shall be
designed or walkways dedicated to assure convenient access to parks,
playgrounds, schools, or other places of public assembly.
      (2)   Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment
with existing streets shall be given the same name. In assigning new names,
duplication of existing names shall be avoided, and in no case shall the
proposed name be phonetically similar to existing names in the village
irrespective of the use of a suffix such as street, road, drive, place, court,
and the like. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Village
Council.
      (3)   Street name signs. The subdivider shall be required to provide and
erect street name signs in accordance with the requirements of the village.
      (4)   Permits for connection to state roads. An approved permit is
required for connection to any existing state system road. This permit is
required prior to any construction on the street or road. The application is
available at the office of the nearest district engineer of the Division of
Highways.

shall have a written approval form the County Health Department submitted with
the preliminary plat.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. IV § 406)
§ 151.071 STORM WATER DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   The preliminary plat shall be accompanied by evidence satisfactory to
the Planning Board as to the proposed method of providing for storm water
drainage.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to provide a drainage
system which is designed to meet the following objectives.
      (1)   No surface water shall be channeled or directed into a sanitary
sewer.
      (2)   Where feasible, the subdivider shall connect to an existing storm
drainage system.
      (3)   Where an existing storm drainage system feasibly cannot be extended
to the subdivision, a surface drainage system shall be designed to protect the
proposed development and adjacent properties from water damage.
      (4)   Surface drainage courses shall have side slopes, where feasible, of
at least two feet of horizontal distance for each one foot of vertical
distance, and courses shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the drainage

required soil erosion and sedimentation control plan has been submitted to and
approved by the state or local agency having jurisdiction in accordance with
the rules and regulations for erosion and sediment control as adopted by the
state’s Sedimentation Commission, and as amended.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. IV § 408)
§ 151.073 SURVEYING AND PLACEMENT OF MOUNTAINS.
   Unless otherwise specified by this chapter, the Uniform Standards for
Professional Appraisal Practice as adopted by the State Board of Registration
for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, under 56 (21 NCAC 56), shall
apply when conducting surveys for subdivisions; to determine the accuracy for
surveys and placement of monuments, control corners, markers, and property
corner ties; and to determine other standards and procedures governing the
practice of land surveying for subdivisions.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. IV § 409)
§ 151.074 CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   No construction or installation of improvements shall commence in a
proposed subdivision until the preliminary plat has been approved, and all
plans and specifications have been approved by the appropriate authorities.
   (B)   No building or other permits shall be issued for erection of a
structure on any lot not of record at the time of adoption of this chapter
until all the requirements of this chapter have been met. The subdivider, prior

Administrator of this chapter to provide for adequate inspection. The approving
authorities having jurisdiction of their representatives shall inspect and
approve all competed work prior to release of the sureties.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. IV § 410)
§ 151.075 TREE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION.
   (A)   Purpose. The regulations of this chapter are intended to reduce tree
canopy loss and implement urban forest improvements through requirements for
tree protection, tree preservation, and planting or replanting of trees, and
the maintenance of existing trees within the village. The tree preservation
requirements are intended to enhance the quality of life through sustainable
urban forest practices and increase benefits that trees provide, including, but
not limited to the following:
      (1)   Absorption of carbon dioxide and returning oxygen;
      (2)   Reduction of soil erosion and the increase of rainwater
infiltration;
      (3)   Provision of shade for cooling;
      (4)   Screening of noise, dust, and glare;
      (5)   Improvement of storm water runoff;
      (6)   Maintenance and improvement of the village appearance and
aesthetics;
      (7)   Provision of habitat for wildlife; and
      (8)   Preservation, protection, and enhancement of the natural
environment.
   (B)   Applicability. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all
multi-family developments and residential planned unit developments.
   (C)   Exemptions. The requirements of this chapter do not apply to any of
the following:
      (1)   Existing or single-family detached dwellings or two-family
dwellings on individual owned lots;
      (2)   Forestry activity on farmland that is taxed on the basis of its
present-use value as forestland under G.S. Ch. 105 Art. 12; and
      (3)   Activity that is conducted in accordance with a forest management
plan that is prepared or approved by a forester registered in accordance with
G.S. Ch. 89B.
   (D)   Tree preservation and protection requirements.
      (1)   General rules/objectives. A tree protection plan and a tree
inventory are required. The inventory is intended to serve as the basis for
formulating a tree protection plan. In delineating areas to protect, the
following general objectives apply.
         (a)   The protection of tree stands, rather than individual trees, is
strongly encouraged. Where a project saves a stand of trees and is subject to
the tree save area requirements of this chapter, a 110% of the canopy area
shall count toward the required tree save area requirements.
         (b)   The protection of large heritage trees is a priority.
         (c)   Quality natural areas, free of exotic invasive species,(see §
151.009) should be the focus of tree preservation and tree save areas whenever
possible.
         (d)   If an area proposed for tree preservation or as a tree save area
contains exotic invasive species at the time of such proposal, such species
must be removed prior to development in order to promote the growth of large,
healthier trees. The removal of invasive species will be required prior to
issuance of a certificate of compliance for the development.
         (e)   The decision of which trees to preserve as shown on the tree
inventory shall be made jointly by the Zoning Administrator, the Board of
Adjustment, and the developer during the project approval process.
      (2)   Tree save area requirements. All developments subject to the
requirements of this chapter must designate tree save areas on site plans in an
amount consistent with this section. Generally, tree save areas should preserve
and protect existing trees, but such areas may also designate tree planting
areas consistent with this section. The requirements for protecting existing
tree canopy or protecting existing canopy and establishing new canopy will be
consistent with Table 1 below. These requirements apply to the entire property.
      (3)   Table 1: Requirements for protecting existing tree canopy and
creating new tree canopy.

                                                    (B) above
 
         (a)   Method of calculation. The total property area will be
calculated by taking the square footage for the entire site and subtracting the
square footage for existing or dedicated road rights-of-way, utility easements,
and any area covered by existing ponds or lakes. The property designated as a
tree save area must be equal to 20% of the property after right-of-way
easements and ponds and lakes are subtracted consistent with the requirements
of Table 1.
         (b)   Method of designating tree save areas. A tree save area shall be
considered the combined areas of the tree protection zone and the critical root
protection zone. The critical root and tree protection zones will be measured
as a radial distance from the tree trunk and will be the equivalent to the
greater area of the drip line, a minimum of six feet from the trunk, or a
distance of one and one-half feet for every inch of trunk diameter as measured
at breast height. If root disturbance or construction activities occur within
the drip line of any tree designated as protected, only the area actually being
protected will be included in the tree save area.
         (c)   Limitations on the removal of existing tree canopy. If existent
canopy must remain to satisfy the standard in Table 1, then it may be removed
only if:
            1.   The existing trees are located on a project’s future right-of-
way, within the outline of the building envelope, or within the project’s
required parking area. Preservation of existing trees is not intended to
prevent development of property or otherwise unreasonably restrict the use of
the property;
            2.   The existing trees pose a threat to property or public safety
because the trees are diseased, in danger of falling, or otherwise present a
hazard to other vegetation or surrounding properties;
            3.   The existing trees that are removed under this section are
replaced with new trees consistent with the requirements of Table 1 above;
            4.   For major projects (projects involving more than six units and
two acres), tree removal shall be phased, or completed in one acre increments,
excluding driveways or utility easements. Relief from this requirement will
require submission of the following documentation:
               a.   Justification/documentation from the engineer/architect as
to why phased clearing is not feasible;
               b.   Certification that removal of said trees would not
jeopardize meeting the tree preservation requirements for subsequent phases;
and
               c.   Certification from the owner/engineer or architect that the
trees proposed for removal represent the minimal number necessary to complete
the project.
            5.   Credit for newly planted trees. The area devoted to newly
planted trees may be counted as part of the tree save area. The land devoted to
the save areas that is represented by newly planted trees will be calculated on
the basis of the following credits for new trees. A planted large maturing tree
shall be counted as equivalent to 1,600 square feet of canopy; a medium
maturing tree shall be counted as the equivalent of 900 square feet of canopy;
and a small maturing tree shall be counted as the equivalent of 400 square feet
of canopy.
   (E)   Heritage tree protection. To the maximum extent feasible, heritage
trees located on any site subject to tree preservation requirements of this
section must be preserved. Where a project saves heritage trees and is subject
to the canopy tree requirements of this section, 150% of the heritage tree
canopy area shall count toward the required canopy tree requirements. A person
proposing to remove a heritage tree must identify the tree removal on the site
plan. Anyone who removes a heritage tree without plan approval is subject to
one or more of the civil penalties in §
10.99. Plans representing the removal of heritage trees will be granted only
where:
      (1)   The tree is located within that portion of the lot where buildings
or improvements are permitted. The applicant should demonstrate that there is
no other reasonable location for the building or improvements, and that
preservation would unreasonably restrict use of the property;
      (2)   The tree is diseased, dying or dead, or causes a safety hazard to
nearby buildings or pedestrian or vehicular traffic;
      (3)   The tree could potentially cause significant structural damage to a
building or other structure;
      (4)   The tree could potentially drop debris or sap that could
significantly affect vehicles in proposed parking areas;
      (5)   Removal is necessary to allow construction of a road or drive that
is essential for access to the site;
      (6)   A joint agreement regarding the replacement of any removed heritage
trees has been made by the Zoning Administrator, Planning Board, and/or Board
of Adjustment during the project approval process; and
      (7)   Where removal of healthy heritage trees is approved as part of an
approved site plan, new trees will be planted according to the following.
 
Tree Removed                      Tree Replaced
12” caliper to less than 18” tThree 2.5” caliper trees
18” caliper to 24” tree       Four 2.5” caliper trees
+24” caliper tree               Five 2.5” caliper trees
 
   (F)   Canopy tree planting requirements.
      (1)   All developments subject to the tree save area requirements that
cannot save the required amount of canopy through the preservation of existing
trees, will be required to meet the canopy requirement through the planting of
new canopy trees consistent with this section. The area of newly planted canopy
trees will be calculated on the canopy at maturity (i.e., 1,600 square feet for
large maturing trees; 900 square feet for medium maturing trees; and 400 square
feet for small maturing trees). The minimum canopy tree cover shall be 20% of
the property area.
      (2)   All tree canopy cover requirements may be met through the
preservation of existing trees and/or the planting of trees.
   (G)   Maintenance, tree protection, and planting standards.
      (1)   Maintenance of trees.
         (a)   All property owners subject to this section shall be responsible
for the maintenance of existing trees to be preserved and new plantings.
         (b)   All tree plantings required by or installed pursuant to the tree
planting plan approved under this section shall be maintained in good condition
so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance.
         (c)   All required tree plantings shall be kept free from refuse,
debris, and dead, diseased, or severely damaged plants or vegetation.
         (d)   All dead or unhealthy trees shall be removed or replaced within
180 days.
         (e)   All existing and proposed trees used to comply with this section
shall not be sheared, topped, or disfigured by improper pruning. Trees shall be
allowed to grow to their natural height and form.
      (2)   Tree protection standards.
         (a)   Existing trees must be protected during construction. To receive
credit for the protection of existing trees, trees must be protected from
direct or indirect root damage and trunk and crown disturbance.
         (b)   The tree protection zones and tree save areas shall remain open
and unpaved.
         (c)   Construction site activities such as parking, material storage,
dirt stockpiling, concrete washout, and other similar activities shall be
prohibited within the tree save and tree protection zone.
         (d)   Changes that significantly raise the grade of soil adjacent to
the tree save area or tree protection zone are prohibited.
         (e)   If an underground utility must cross the drip line area, the
contractor must tunnel or auger underneath major roots of the tress without
cutting them. Permission may be granted for auguring of one-third distance of
the drip line to the trunk of the tree only if there is no other feasible way.
Depth of auguring shall be a minimum of two feet.
         (f)   Protective fencing shall be installed around the tree save area
or tree protected zone of preserved trees prior to any land disturbing
activities. Fencing shall remain in place until construction is complete and
other planting requirements have been installed and the Zoning Administrator
has given approval for removal.
         (g)   All tree save areas shall be designated as such with “Tree Save
Area” signs posted visibly on the outside of the fenced in area. Signs may not
be posted on the trees, within public rights-of-way, or site triangles.
      (3)   Tree planting standards. All trees planted to meet the requirements
of this chapter shall be selected from the approved tree list (see §
151.076) and have a caliper of a minimum of one and one-half inches at breast
height (that is, four feet ground level), and meet the following requirements:
         (a)   All trees planted to meet the provisions of this chapter shall
be at least eight feet in height above ground level and at least two and one-
half inches in caliper at the time of installation.
         (b)   All prepared planting holes shall be a minimum of 18 inches in
depth.
         (c)   All new planting materials shall be of good quality, installed
in a manner to meet the standards set forth in the American Standard for
Nursery Stock by the American Association of Nurserymen.
         (d)   All tree plantings shall be required to provide a mix of
species.
         (e)   Installation and construction practices shall be utilized which
preserve existing topsoil or amend the soil to reduce compaction.
         (f)   All trees shall be properly guyed or staked (where required due
to grade changes, steep slopes, creek embankments, or human-made hazards),
fertilized and mulched (three- to four-inch layer).
         (g)   Where large canopy trees are required and overhead utility lines
exist, two small canopy trees may be substituted and planted no closer than 25
feet to adjoining trees.
   (H)   Administration and procedures.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall have the power and authority to
administer and enforce this chapter. The Zoning Administrator or designee may
serve notice to any person in violation of this chapter and/or institute legal
proceedings as may be required, and the Village Attorney is hereby authorized
to institute appropriate proceedings to that end.
      (2)   The Planning Board and the Board of Adjustment will have the power
and authority to the following:
         (a)   Review and recommend revisions to the tree preservation
standards;
         (b)   Review and approve tree preservation plans of residential
planned unit developments (RPUD) and multi-family projects containing more than
four units;
         (c)   Review and approve alternative methods of compliance with the
tree protection and tree planting requirements for RPUDs and multi-family
projects containing more than four units; and
         (d)   Provide community outreach and public education.
   (I)   Required submittals for tree protection preservation and planting
plan.
      (1)   Tree inventory. A tree inventory shall serve as the foundation for
all decisions concerning site planning and layout of new development. The
inventory will provide the village and applicant with a resource for planning
landscaping and aesthetic improvements of the proposed development and a basis
for encouraging preservation of existing forest, tree canopies, and specimen
trees. The tree inventory and the tree preservation plan required by this
section must be reviewed and approved consistent with
Chapter 154. A tree inventory shall accompany all preliminary plats and
construction plan submissions for all multi-family and all RPUDs prior to any
land disturbing activity. Such tree inventory will accurately depict current
conditions of the site and existing trees to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator. The tree inventory shall identify the following.
         (a)   The inventory shall identify any canopy tree 12 inches or larger
in diameter at breast height (DBH), and any understory tree (e.g., Dogwood, Red
Bud, Ironwood, American Holly, and the like) with a caliper measurement of four
inches or more. Groups of trees in close proximity (i.e., those within five to
ten feet of each other) may be designated as a clump of trees, with the
predominant species, estimated numbers, and average diameter or circumference
indicated.
         (b)   All tree surveys for lots larger than one acre in size shall be
prepared by a licensed landscape architect, surveyor, arborist, registered
forester, or engineer registered in the state and shall have an accuracy of
plus or minus three feet.
         (c)   For a parcel or site that is greater than five acres, an aerial
photograph, or a print of equal quality, may be substituted instead of the
inventory if it provides essentially the same information as the tree survey
provided species, composition, and size are consistent.
      (2)   Tree preservation/protection plan required. A tree preservation/
protection plan shall accompany all preliminary plat and construction plan
submissions for multi-family and RPUD developments. Such plans must be reviewed
and approved by the Zoning Administrator, Planning Board, and Board of
Adjustment prior to any land disturbing activities. All site developments must
adhere to the tree preservation/protection plan and all tree preservation/
protection plans must include a description of the following:
         (a)   Boundaries of the required tree save area;
         (b)   Protected trees and/or stands of trees within the tree save
area, including type and size as well as a general assessment of the health of
existing trees with special notice of the presence of any harmful insects or
any indications of health problems with the trees (e.g., canopy cover or
density);
         (c)   A tree protection zone established and maintained on site for
all trees that are to be preserved;
         (d)   Identification of where and how existing trees are to be
protected during the clearing and construction of the site; and
         (e)   If the applicant is removing existing stands of trees or
heritage trees and such removal means the project falls below the tree save
requirement, then the applicant must provide within the preservation plan an
explanation why it is impractical to save the trees.
      (3)   Tree planting plan. A tree planting plan shall accompany all
preliminary site and construction plan submissions. The tree planting plan
shall adhere to the following.
         (a)   The tree planting plan shall be drawn to scale, including
dimensions and distances, and it will identify the location of building sites,
utilities, and clearly delineate all proposed parking spaces or other vehicle
areas, access drives, and driveways.
         (b)   The proposed location, size, and species of mitigation or
replacement trees shall be indicated on the tree planting plan.
      (4)   Combined plans. Applicants may combine the tree preservation/
protection plan with the tree planting plan when it would more clearly convey
their vision for the site, aiding the village in the review process.
   (J)   Modifications, denials.
      (1)   Modifications. Alternate tree protection/planting plans, plant
materials, planting standards, or reforestation may be used where it would be
unreasonable or impractical to strictly apply the tree protection/planting
requirements. Such situations may be the result of streams, natural rock
formations, topography, or other physical conditions; utility easements, a
unified development design, or unusual site conditions. An alternate plan may
be approved when:
         (a)   The Zoning Administrator makes a recommendation to the Board of
Adjustment regarding all alternate tree protection/planting plans, plant
materials, planting standards, or reforestations;
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator, Planning Board, or the Board of
Adjustment approves an alternate plan that proposes different plant materials
or methods provided that the quality, effectiveness, durability, and
performance are equivalent to that required by this chapter. This determination
shall take into account the land use classification of adjacent property,
number of plantings, species, arrangement, coverage, location of planting on
the lot, and the level of screening, height, spread, and canopy of the
plantings at maturity;
         (c)   In order to allow planting to occur at the optimal time, the
Zoning Administrator may allow for a delay in the installation of the required
plantings after the approval of a tree protection or planting plan provided the
applicant provides an acceptable form of performance bond, letter of credit, or
other type of surety that will insure future installation of the required
trees; and
         (d)   Any decision of the Zoning Administrator regarding alternate
methods of compliance may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   Denial of zoning and subdivision approval. If after the effective
date of this chapter, the timber is harvested from all or any substantial
portion of any lot or tract such that the harvest results in the removal of all
or substantially all of the trees within such harvested area that would
otherwise have been protected under this chapter, and an applicant seeks site
plan or subdivision approval for such lot or tract, then:
         (a)   The village may deny such site plan or subdivision approval for
a period of up to three years after completion of such timber harvest if the
trees were lawfully removed under either of the exemptions to the provisions of
this chapter specified in divisions (B) and (C) above, or were removed in
violation of the provisions of this chapter but a violation that was not
willful;
         (b)   The village may deny such site plan or subdivision approval for
a period of up to five years after completion of such timber harvest if the
trees were removed in willful violation of the provisions of this chapter; and
         (c)   All violations of this sections shall be presented to the Board
of Adjustment for their recommendations to the Zoning Administrator of an
appropriate amount of time for the village to deny subdivision or site plan
approval.
   (K)   Hearings and appeals.
      (1)   Variances. A request for a variance from the Board of Adjustment
shall be made by filing a copy of the completed application with the Planning
Department. A variance may be granted by the Board of Adjustment after a
evidentiary hearing has been held in a quasi-judicial manner and advertised in
accordance with
Chapter 154, and only if it concludes that the strict enforcement of the
chapter would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships for the
applicant and that, by granting the variance, the spirit of the chapter will be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
      (2)   Appeals. An appeal from any final order or decision by the Zoning
Administrator may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any person aggrieved.
An appeal is taken by filing with the Zoning Administrator a written notice of
appeal specifying the grounds therefor. An appeal must be taken within 30 days
after the date of the decision or order appealed from.

HILLSIDE SUBDIVISION STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
§ 151.090 GENERAL.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the term HILLSIDE SUBDIVISION shall be
construed to mean a subdivision in which land proposed to be subdivided has at
least a 16% slope as defined in this subchapter. All provisions of this chapter
as set forth herein shall apply to hillside subdivisions except as superseded
by this subchapter, which is hereby made expressly applicable to hillside
subdivisions only.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. V § 501)
§ 151.091 CALCULATION OF SLOPE.
   (A)   The calculation of slope used in determining whether an area is to be
classified as a hillside subdivision shall be determined in accordance with the
following criteria and formula.
   (B)   The proposed subdivision, or portion thereof, seeking classification
as a hillside subdivision shall be delineated on a preliminary plat of the
property. The plat shall contain contour lines of the property at intervals not
exceeding five feet. The plat and contour lines shall be prepared by a
registered surveyor or registered engineer.
   (C)   The formula for determining the percent of slope is as follows.
        S = .0023 x I x L
          A
   (D)   In the equation, “S” is the percent of slope, “.0023” is a conversion
factor of square feet to acres, “I” is the contour interval (or the distance
between adjacent contour lines within the subject parcel), and “A” is the area
in acres of the subject parcel.
      (1)   Step 1. Determine “I”, the contour interval, by examining the map
or measuring the interval, using the key on the map.
      (2)   Step 2. Determine “L”, the total length of the contour lines within
the subject area, by tracing each line with a planimeter and converting to feet
on the basis of the map’s scale.
      (3)   Step 3. Determine “A”, area (in acres) from the development plans
or permit application.
      (4)   Step 4. Determine the slope, “S”, by inserting the appropriate
numbers in the equation.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. V § 502)
§ 151.092 LOTS.
   (A)   Minimum lot sizes. When a proposed subdivision is classified as a
hillside subdivision in accordance with §
151.091, the minimum lot size of all lots in a hillside subdivision shall be
increased from the minimum lot requirements established in §
151.068(B). The increase in minimum lot size shall be made in accordance with a
formula which increases the minimum lot size by 8% for every 1% (or fraction
thereof) increase in the average slope above the 16% base slope established in
this subchapter. The formula for determining minimum lot sizes in a hillside
subdivision is as follows.
   Minimum lot size of subject tract = (Average slope of subject tract in % -
16% x .08 + 1.00 x minimum lot size in §
151.068(B))
   (B)   Panhandle lots. The Village Council may approve panhandle lots in
exceptional cases within hillside subdivisions where it is impractical to serve
an isolated lot by a public street. The frontage of the panhandle lot shall
have a minimum width at the street line of 25 feet, providing an access strip
between two regular lots to the isolated building site. The area of such strip
shall be excluded in computing the lot area, and the length of said strip shall
not exceed 300 feet.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. V § 503)
§ 151.093 STREET DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
   All streets in a hillside subdivision shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with §
151.069.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. V § 504)
DEFINITIONS
§ 151.105 SUBDIVISION DEFINED.
   (A)   As used in this chapter, the definition of the word SUBDIVISION is
defined in G.S. § 160D-802, as now or hereafter amended.
   (B)   The definition is as follows: A SUBDIVISION means all divisions of a
tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other
divisions, when any one or more of those divisions is created for the purpose
of sale or building development (whether immediate or future) and includes all
divisions of land involving the dedication of a new street or a change in
existing streets; however, the following is not included within this definition
and is not subject to any regulations enacted pursuant to this chapter:
      (1)   The combination or recombination of portions of previously
subdivided and recorded lots if the total number of lots is not increased and
the resultant lots are equal to or exceed the standards of the village as shown
in its subdivision regulations;
      (2)   The division of land into parcels greater than ten acres if no
street right-of-way dedication is involved;
      (3)   The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for widening
or opening streets; and
      (4)   The division of a tract in single ownership the entire area of
which is not greater than two acres into not more than three lots, if no street
right-of-way dedication is involved and if the resultant lots are equal to or
exceed the standards of the village as shown by its subdivision regulations.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. VI § 601) (Res. R-2021.9, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 151.106 TYPES OF SUBDIVISIONS.
   For all subdivisions of land, as defined in §
151.105, the following categories of subdivisions shall be used to determine
the procedures required for review.
   (A)   Major subdivision. A subdivision of land by a property owner into more
than ten lots or parcels for the purpose of sale or development (whether
immediate or future).
   (B)   Minor subdivision. A subdivision of land by a property owner into not
more than ten nor less than three lots or parcels for the purpose of sale or
development (whether immediate or future).
   (C)   Special subdivision. Other divisions of land for specific uses not
otherwise specified by this chapter (which may include such examples as
cemeteries, boundary disputes, and the like); subdivision of property into two
lots; and the subdivision of land within a residential planned unit development
(RPUD), provided subdivisions in these developments conform with the
requirements of §
154.129.
   (D)   Cluster subdivisions. The subdivision of land which permits the
reduction of the required minimum lot sizes and dimensional requirements,
subject to the dedication of required open space. Cluster subdivisions may be
permitted in the R-1 and R-2 zoning districts in accordance with requirements
and standards in §
154.130. Additionally, the cluster subdivision shall be reviewed in accordance
with the procedures and requirements for a major subdivision.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. VI § 602)

required pursuant to G.S. § 160D-403 and § 160D-1108 may be denied for lots
that have been illegally subdivided. In addition to other remedies, the village
may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent the unlawful
subdivision of land, to restrain, correct, or abate the violation, or to
prevent any illegal act or conduct. Further, this chapter shall be subject to
enforcement as provided in §
10.99. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the use of remedies
available to the village. The village may seek to enforce this chapter by using
any one, all, or a combination of remedies.
      (2)   The provisions of this section shall not prohibit any owner or its
agent from entering into contracts to sell or lease land by reference to an
approved preliminary plat for which a final plat has not yet been properly
approved under the subdivision regulations or recorded with the Register of
Deeds, provided such is done in compliance with G.S. § 160D-807, as amended.
(Prior Code, Ch. 12 Art. II § 203)
   (B)   Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter, or
rules of orders adopted or issued pursuant of this chapter, shall be subject to
any one or all of the combination of penalties authorized by this chapter or
Chapter 154. If a party continues to fail to comply with a particular
provision, the party shall continue to remain subject to the penalties
prescribed by this section for the period of the continued violation of the
particular provision. Penalties assessed under this section are in addition to,
and not in lieu of, the compliance requirements of
Chapter 154. The village may employ any of the remedies authorized for a
municipality pursuant to G.S. § 160A-175. Civil penalties for violation of this
chapter will be one or more of the following.
      (1)   Destruction or removal of trees greater than 12 inches DBH without
approval of the village will incur a civil penalty equal to the amount of the
value of trees listed in the most recent edition of The Guide for Plant
Appraisal published by the Council of Trees and Landscape Appraisers. The
amount of the civil penalty shall include any cost incurred by the village in
appraising the value of the trees removed or destroyed in violation of this
chapter.
      (2)   For purposes of this chapter, a separate offense shall be deemed to
have occurred for each tree greater than 12 inches in DBH that has been
destroyed or removed without the approval of the Village Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   If the Zoning Administrator or designee has determined that a
violation of this chapter has occurred, no certificate of compliance shall be
issued until compliance has been achieved.
   (C)   Upon the issuance of a notice of violation or citation, the Village
Manager may suspend any other permits or approvals issued to the violator,
including the issuance of a stop-work order, until such time as the violation
is cured and any civil penalty paid. An active appeal of the violation to the
appropriate village authority shall operate as a stay of the suspension of the
permits and approvals, unless the Village Manager determines that allowing the
work to continue would constitute a danger to health, life, safety, or
property.
   (D)   In the event there is an outstanding penalty amount or unresolved
violation of this chapter, the village may require the violation to be remedied
as a condition for the issuance of any subsequent permit or approval.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has in G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 21, Part 6; G.S. Ch.
160D, Art. 2; and G.S. Ch. 160D, Art. 7, 9, 11 and 13, delegated to local
governmental units the responsibility units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Village
Council does ordain as follows.
(Ord. passed 4-23-2007; Res. R-2021.9, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the village are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health,
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 4-23-2007)
§ 153.03 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 4-23-2007)
§ 153.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges)
that are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.
(Ord. passed 4-23-2007)

improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not
however, include either:
      (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.

permit.
         (b)   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is required after the
reference level is established. Within seven calendar days of establishment of
the reference level elevation, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the
reference level, in relation to mean sea level. Any work done within the seven-
day calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at
the permit holder’s risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
certificate data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be
corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further work being
permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
         (c)   A final as-built elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is
required after construction is completed and prior to certificate of
compliance/occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of final as-built
construction of the elevation of the reference level and all attendant
utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (2)   Floodproofing certificate. If nonresidential floodproofing is used
to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a floodproofing
certificate (FEMA Form 81-65), with supporting data, an operational plan, and
an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start of
any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the floodproofed design
elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to
mean sea level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by
same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data, the
operational plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit
approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required
corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to
construct in accordance with the certified design shall be cause to withhold
the issuance of a certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (3)   Foundation certification. If a manufactured home is placed within
Zone A, AO, AE, or A1-30 and the elevation of the chassis is more than 36
inches in height above grade, an engineered foundation certification is
required in accordance with the provisions of §
153.41(C)(2).
      (4)   Altering watercourse. If a watercourse is to be altered or
relocated, a description of the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation,
a professional engineer’s certified report on the effects of the proposed
project on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the effects to
properties located both upstream and downstream, and a map showing the location
of the proposed watercourse alteration or relocation shall all be submitted by
the permit applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit.
      (5)   Certification exemptions. The following structures, if located
within Zone A, AO, AE or A1-30, are exempt from the elevation/floodproofing
certification requirements specified in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above:
         (a)   Recreational vehicles meeting requirements of §
153.41(F)(1);
         (b)   Temporary structures meeting requirements of §
153.41(G); and
         (c)   Accessory structures less than 150 square feet meeting

chapter.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25
per $100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a
record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the state upon request.

flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation shall apply.
(Ord. passed 4-23-2007)
§ 153.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in §§
153.07 or
153.42, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
153.40, are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
153.05.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
153.05. Structures located in A, AE, AO, and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with §
153.45(B)(2). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such certification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in §
153.26(C), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
153.05.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the state’s Regulations for Manufactured Homes adopted by
the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15. Additionally, when
the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less
above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers
or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches
in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) below.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of flood waters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow flood waters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters
in both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more
nonconforming than the existing structure; or
         (b) A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction; or
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or
      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
   (G)   Temporary nonresidential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood, or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, and the like) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the
following criteria shall be met:
      (1)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas);
      (2)   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
      (3)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
      (4)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood
waters;
      (5)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
the provisions of §
153.40(A);
      (6)   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of §
153.40(D); and
      (7)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in
conformance with the provisions of division (D)(3) above.
   (I)   Small accessory structures. An accessory structure with a footprint
less than 150 square feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not
require an elevation or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing
certifications are required for all other accessory structures in accordance
with §
153.26(C).
(Ord. passed 4-23-2007)
§ 153.42 STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS.
   Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Approximate Zone A and
established in §
153.07, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the
following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
153.40, shall apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20
feet each side from the top of bank or five times the width of the stream,
whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined based on the following criteria.
      (1)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in §§
153.40 and
153.41.
      (2)   When floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other
source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway areas
shall also comply with the requirements of §§
153.41 and
153.44.
      (3)   All subdivision, manufactured home park, and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such
base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance
with §
153.07 and utilized in implementing this chapter.
      (4)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be
elevated or floodproofed (nonresidential to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
153.05). All other applicable provisions of §
153.41 shall also apply.
(Ord. passed 4-23-2007)
§ 153.43 STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS WITH BFE BUT WITHOUT ESTABLISHED
FLOODWAYS OR NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available
from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are
identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report,
the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   Standards of §§
153.40 and
153.41; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.
(Ord. passed 4-23-2007)
§ 153.44 FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   (A)   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located
within the special flood hazard areas established in §
153.07. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of flood waters that have erosion potential and carry
debris and potential projectiles.
   (B)   The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in §§
153.40 and
153.41, shall apply to all development within such areas.
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         (b)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion
of the proposed encroachment.
      (2)   If division (B)(1) above is satisfied, all development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
provided the following provisions are met:
         (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
153.41(C); and
         (b)   The no encroachment standard of division (B)(1) above.
(Ord. passed 4-23-2007)
§ 153.45 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO).
   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
153.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate.
   (B)   In addition to §§
153.40 and
153.41, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements.
      (1)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of four feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   Nonresidential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in division (B)(1) above so that the
structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that
level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is
required in accordance with §§
153.26(C) and
153.41(B).
      (3)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.

SPECIAL USE PERMIT STANDARDS
§ 154.085 SPECIAL USE PERMIT STANDARDS.
   This subchapter is hereby established to provide specific standards and
reviews for certain uses requiring special use permits in this chapter. The
standards and review procedures required in this section are in addition to the
basic requirements in §
31.06.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. VIII § 800)
§ 154.086 RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (RPUD).
   (A)   Intent. The residential planned unit development is established to
provide medium density residential development in areas of the village’s
jurisdiction which are suited for some increased population and development
densities. It is the intent and purpose of this section that the residential
planned unit development compatibly blend with the existing character of the
village in areas where existing utilities and community services are available
and sufficient to accommodate an increased population density. The development
as a special use provides for flexibility by encouraging a diversity in housing
and controlled site plan review and approval process by the Board of
Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall have the discretion to determine
whether a proposed development is compatible with the character of the
neighborhood in which it is located, and that certain reasonable conditions and
modifications may be required by the Board of Adjustment.
   (B)   Location. A residential planned unit development may be issued a
special use permit in the R-3 Multi-Family Residential District.
   (C)   Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted in a residential
planned unit development:
      (1)   Single-family dwellings, excluding manufactured homes;
      (2)   Multi-family dwellings, including condominiums, townhouses, and
individual units or clusters of detached units located on lots or tracts in
single ownership or held in common ownership under a condominium agreement;
      (3)   Customary accessory building, including garages and storage

            2.   Administrative offices for the residential planned unit
development; and
            3.   Property management offices exclusively for the planned unit
development.
         (b)   The above listed accessory uses may be permitted subject to the
following conditions:
            1.   The residential planned unit development shall have a minimum
of seven acres;
            2.   All sales and rentals shall be for the use and convenience of
the owners, residents, or guests of the residential planned unit development;
            3.   All accessory uses listed in this division (C)(5) shall not
occupy more than 10% of the total floor area of the residential planned unit
development, except that in no case shall the accessory uses exceed a maximum
of 10,000 square feet. No individual accessory use permitted in this division
(C)(5) shall occupy more than 5% of the total floor area of the development,
except that in no case shall the accessory use exceed a maximum of 30,000
square feet; and
            4.   Any accessory use permitted in this division (C)(5) shall be
designed in a manner compatible with the architectural style and function of
the RPUD and development on adjacent properties.
      (6)   (a)   The following accessory commercial uses may be permitted in a
residential planned unit development which contains 150 or more dwelling units
with certificates of occupancy, subject to the provisions of this section:
            1.   Retail sales for RPUD residents and guests, excluding

         (b)   The above listed accessory uses may be permitted subject to the
following conditions:
            1.   The residential planned unit development shall have a minimum
of seven acres;
            2.   All sales and rentals shall be for the use and convenience of
the owners, residents, and guests of the planned unit development;
            3.   All accessory uses listed in this division (C)(6) shall not
occupy more than 10% of the total floor area of the residential planned unit
development, except that in no case shall the accessory uses exceed a maximum
of 30,000 square feet. No individual accessory use permitted in this division
(C)(6) shall occupy more than 5% of the total floor area of the development,
except that in no case shall the accessory use exceed a maximum of 6,000 square
feet; and
            4.   Any accessory use permitted in this division (C)(6) shall be
designed in a manner compatible with the architectural style and function of
the RPUD and development on adjacent properties.
   (D)   Design requirements. The residential planned unit development shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with the standards of this section,
other applicable sections of this chapter, and such other conditions as may be
required by the Board of Adjustment.
      (1)   Minimum size and ownership. The minimum lot area required for a
residential planned unit development shall be at least two contiguous acres.
The required two acres shall not be divided by, nor shall include any portion
of an existing public street or right-of-way. Furthermore, no existing public
rights-of-way or bodies of water shall qualify as a portion of the required
minimum lot area. All of the land area within the proposed residential planned
unit development shall be under single ownership or control of the applicant at
the time the application is submitted.
      (2)   Density.
         (a)   The maximum residential density permitted in a residential
planned unit development shall be eight units per acre, based upon the net lot
area.
         (b)   In calculating the project density, the property acreage in any
road rights-of-way and bodies of water shall be excluded from the total project
acreage in order to determine the net lot area. The number of dwelling units
permitted shall be rounded to the lowest whole number, not to exceed eight
dwelling units per acre.
         (c)   In reviewing the site plans, the Board of Adjustment may
determine that a lower density is required because of an adjacent neighborhood,
the capacity of existing streets, water and sewer facilities, or the adequacy
of fire protection and municipal services in the area where the project is
proposed for development.
      (3)   Dimensional requirements and building coverage.
         (a)   The required yards and setbacks for individual structures of the
R-3 District shall not apply to the residential planned unit development
(RPUD). Within the development, no dwelling building shall be located closer
than 30 feet from any adjacent street right-of-way line or 25 feet from any
exterior property line. Non-dwelling accessory buildings, structures, or
facilities such as, but not limited to, covered information areas and private
security booths may be allowed within an adequate proximity to any adjacent
street right-of-way located in the RPUD. Non-dwelling accessory buildings,
structures, or facilities such as, but not limited to, covered informational
areas and private security booths shall be located no closer than 25 feet from
any exterior property line of the RPUD. There shall be a minimum of 20 feet
between structures in the RPUD. The total building coverage area, including
non-dwelling accessory buildings, structures, or facilities, but excluding
roads, parking and service areas, and recreational facilities, shall not exceed
20% of the net lot area.
         (b)   All of the aforestated dimensional requirements and building
coverage requirements shall be reviewed by the Village Planning Board and
approved by the Village Board of Adjustment during the initial application
process for a special use permit concerning the overall site plan as provided
in division (E) below and
Chapter 31.
         (c)   If a special use permit for the overall project or a specific
phase has been approved as prescribed in this chapter and the developer later
encounters a difficulty or hardship in relation to the street setbacks of non-
dwelling accessory buildings, structures, or facilities, the Zoning
Administrator is authorized to adjust only said setbacks to within an adequate
proximity of the relevant street right-of-way in the RPUD. Said adjustment
shall only be performed if the developer can prove the necessity for the
requested change. Such factors as aesthetics, public safety, public
information, traffic flow, and parking shall be considered in determining the
necessity.
      (4)   Building requirements. All buildings in a RPUD shall conform to the
following requirements.
         (a)   Building height. No building or structure erected as a part of a
RPUD shall have a maximum height which exceeds 35 feet, as defined in §
154.021.
         (b)   Square foot minimum requirements. No residential buildings in a
RPUD containing one or more dwelling units shall contain less than 1,600 square
feet or heated floor space.
         (c)   Square foot minimum requirements per dwelling unit. No
residential dwelling unit within a RPUD shall contain less than 800 square feet
of heated floor space.
      (5)   Utilities. The residential planned unit development shall have all
utility lines located underground. Further, the utilities shall conform to the
following requirements.
         (a)   Water systems. Adequate water volume and pressure for domestic
use and fire protection shall be available to the proposed project from the
Carolina Water Service water system. The water system shall be designed by a
registered engineer, and approved by the appropriate state and local agencies.
         (b)   Sewer systems. The project shall have access to the Carolina
Water Service sewerage system. The project’s system shall be designed by a
registered engineer, and approved by the appropriate state and local agencies.
         (c)   Storm water drainage. Storm water runoff shall be collected,
channeled, or piped to discharge into natural drainage ways in a manner which
will not cause erosion problems on adjacent public or private property. The
system shall be designed by a registered engineer or other competent
professional. The system shall meet village standards for a 25-year storm
capacity. The design shall incorporate requirements of the erosion and
sedimentation control plan during the construction phase, as well as the
required facilities and design standards for the completed project.
      (6)   Street design and access. All residential planned unit developments
shall have at least 200 feet of continuous frontage on a public road or
highway. All public or private streets or roads within a residential planned
unit development shall be designed and built to the public street standards in
§
151.069. The village reserves the right to accept streets offered to it for
dedication to the public. Compliance with the village street standards as
defined in
Chapter 151 and other applicable village ordinances shall be prerequisite for
acceptance by the village.
      (7)   Exterior lighting. A residential planned unit development shall be
provided with an exterior lighting system for the safety of access drives,
service areas, and pedestrian walks. The lighting should incorporate lighting
for pedestrian and vehicular safety and for crime prevention within the
development. The lighting fixtures shall be designed in keeping with the scale
and architectural harmony of the project. The fixtures shall be oriented, to
the degree possible, to reduce glare within the project and on adjacent
properties.

§ 154.087 COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (CPUD).
   (A)   Intent and purpose. The commercial planned unit development (CPUD) is
established to encourage a more creative, aesthetic approach to land and
building site planning for commercial uses. It is the intent and purpose of
this section that a CPUD compatibly blend with the existing character of the
village in areas where existing utilities and community services are available
and sufficient to accommodate an increased intensity of commercial development.
The development of a CPUD as a special use provides a broader range of
flexibility in site design, while providing for the installation of adequate
parking and access, utilities, landscaping, and screening within a unified and
controlled site plan review and approval process by the Board of Adjustment.
The Board of Adjustment shall have the authority to determine whether a
proposed development is compatible with the character of the community and the
neighborhood in which it is located. The Board of Adjustment shall require that
the proposed CPUD comply with provisions of this section and other applicable
sections of this chapter and that certain reasonable conditions and
modifications may be required by the Board of Adjustment in order to ensure the
safety, property values, and aesthetic environment of the development for its
patrons and adjacent properties.

CPUD shall be the minimum lot area required in the district in which the
development is to be located. The required minimum lot area shall not include
any portion of an existing public street or road right-of-way. Furthermore, no
existing public rights-of-way or bodies of water shall qualify as a portion of
the required minimum lot area. All of the land area within the proposed CPUD
shall be under single ownership or control of the applicant at the time the
application is submitted.
      (2)   Dimensional requirements and building coverage.
         (a)   The Planning Board and the Board of Adjustment shall evaluate
the site plan in order to determine that the proposed design of the project is
acceptable with regard to the health, safety, and general welfare of the
commercial development, the patrons, and adjacent properties. All buildings and
structures with the exception of signs permitted by
Chapter 150 shall be located to conform to the minimum yard requirements for
the district in which the development is to be located along the exterior
boundaries of the project property. The total building coverage area shall not
exceed 30% of the net lot area of the project site. Common wall construction
may be permitted in a CPUD.
         (b)   All of the aforestated dimensional requirements and building

   (N)   Construction codes. Developer must comply with all applicable state
and local construction codes and requirements.
   (O)   Changes to approved plans.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to approve minor
changes requested by the developer to the approved final site plan when site
conditions present hardships or when minor changes can protect environmental
features of the site. All other changes shall require a review and approval
from the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   The village shall have the authority to require changes to the
approved preliminary plan and subsequent final site plans which reflect changes
in officially adopted maps, village policy, or programs established to enhance
the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (P)   Failure to comply. Construction and use of the CPUD shall be as set
forth in the plans and applications approved by the Board of Adjustment.

§ 154.104 INCOMPATIBLE USES IN THE VILLAGE.
   The Village Council finds that heavy industry, manufacturing, outdoor
storage facilities, junkyards, power plants and similar uses are incompatible
with the residential nature of the village and heavy dependence on tourism and
travel related industries. Such uses are therefore prohibited in the
territorial jurisdiction of the village. It is the intent of this subchapter
that if any use or class of use is not specifically permitted in a district as
set forth in the sections below, it shall be prohibited in that district unless
similar uses are described in the ordinance. Should an applicant petition the
village for approval of a use not covered specifically in this subchapter, the
application may be considered as a special use. Factors to be considered to
determine if the use is in harmony with the keeping of the public health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of Sugar Mountain are the impacts of
anticipated amounts of traffic, noise, light, density, vibration, odor, and the
bearing these may have on adjoining neighbors and the community.

specified in the agreement granted by either the Village Manager or the Village
Council.
   (C)   Alcoholic beverages may be served in the outdoor dining area if the
establishment has an approved license for alcohol sales. Alcohol sales require
the outdoor dining area to be secured to prevent access to the public right-of-
way with alcoholic beverages.
   (D)   Any outdoor dining area shall be surfaced with bricks, wood decking,
exposed aggregate, paves, or similar material effectively treated to facilitate

         (b)   Grading shall blend gently with contours of adjacent properties.
         (c)   Buildings at the ends of streets, or at street corners, shall
serve as visual terminals serving to both unify and conclude the architectural
statement made on the street.
         (d)   Proposed recreation areas or uses shall complement nearby
existing uses. The extension of existing parks or recreation areas into a
proposed development is a highly desirable design feature.
         (e)   Buildings or projects located near or adjacent to a greenway
shall provide safe and efficient pedestrian connection to that greenway, and
also to adjacent properties that might include pedestrian systems in the
future.
         (f)   Buffer zones shall separate and protect the greenway, while at
the same time connect it to the building site.
         (g)   Natural drainage patterns shall be preserved where possible.
Changing the natural drainage areas will affect the drainage onto adjoining
areas.
         (h)   Innovative building and site design can capitalize on natural
drainage ways and transform steep slopes into major site amenities.
         (i)   Design shall insure that drainage occurs only in areas designed
to serve a drainage function. Storm water should not flow over sidewalks, paths
or streets.
      (3)   Streetscape.
         (a)   Scale is a major factor in creating a sense of community and a
sense of place.
         (b)   The ratio between the width of the street corridor (as measured
between opposing building facades) and the height of the walls of that corridor
(the foundation-to-eaves dimension) plays an important role in creating a human
scale in the streetscape. If the width exceeds the height more than four times,
the sense of the enclosure is diminished.
         (c)   The village shall be focused on people rather than on vehicles.
Streets shall be connections not separations.
         (d)   Reference Illustration A for explanation of zones and transition
areas that shall be addressed in the design of new streets.
      (4)   Streets.
         (a)   Difficult topography shall be avoided when locating and
designing roads. For instance, roads are best placed along the contours of a
site if the site is hilly or steep. This minimizes fuel consumption and noise
in automobiles and provides a more comfortable access for pedestrians and
bicycle riders. Consideration shall also be given to fire protection and
emergency vehicles in order to facilitate access to any structure in case of
any emergency.
         (b)   Roadways shall focus attention on interesting views and should
not interfere with natural drainage patterns.
         (c)   The site plan should incorporate a hierarchy of roadways and
walkways that provide for safe, smooth and pleasant movement of people and
vehicles. Special attention shall be paid to points and which pedestrian,
bicycle, and automobile movements are in conflict. Clearly marked crosswalks or
routing of pedestrian paths away from main automobile traffic areas can reduce
hazards in these areas.
         (d)   Whenever there is a design choice between access from the
development to a street of a higher classification and access to a street or a
lower classification, access should be to the street of lower classification.
         (e)   On large streets, landscaped median islands are encouraged and
crosswalks shall be included.
         (f)   Trees, shrubs and other plants shall be planted along the
streets in accordance to the setbacks established.
      (5)   Sidewalks.
         (a)   Building sites shall accommodate pedestrians and shall be
centered around pedestrian traffic rather than vehicular traffic.
         (b)   Access must be safe and convenient within a site. Sidewalks must
be clearly separated from driving areas and must connect buildings to each
other, to parking areas and to adjacent pedestrian paths.
         (c)   Handicapped accessibility along walkways at street/driveway
intersections shall be provided whenever possible, per North Carolina Building
Code specifications.
         (d)   Sidewalk construction standards (including curb and gutter)
shall follow the North Carolina Department of Transportation subdivision roads
minimum construction standards.
         (e)   Walkways or sidewalks shall be provided along all public streets
for commercial developments. Where intersections occur, pedestrian walkways
shall be clearly marked with paint or contrasting surface material.
         (f)   The separation of sidewalks from the roadway for pedestrians’
safety will be achieved by:
            1.   Curbside planting strips;
            2.   Depressing or raising the walkway in relation to street level;
and
            3.   Providing parking adjacent to the walkway (on-street parking)
as an additional barrier.
         (g)   Especially around areas with interesting natural contours.
         (h)   Major commercial developments shall include a system for
internal pedestrian movement. These internal walkways shall also be linked with
the village walkways, particularly to greenways and park.
      (6)   Bicycles.
         (a)   Bike lanes or sufficient room on the streets for bicyclists are
very desirable. However, bike lanes do not have to parallel the street. Like
sidewalks or walkways, they should follow natural patterns.
         (b)   Businesses and organizations should recognize the needs of
cyclists who may bicycle to work. These cyclists need convenient use of a
bicycle rack.
   (B)   Building design.  The following elements of building design shall be
incorporated in new construction and renovations as noted in this section.
      (1)   Scale. Scale and proportion should reflect local traditions of
mountain buildings. They should be oriented to the characteristic, simple
residential buildings of the village. Texture of roof and wall finishes shall
provide a scale or reference point for the pedestrian in proximity to the
structure. In the R-3, C-B, M-U, and R-C Districts, where structures already
exist on a subject property, the maximum wall height of any new structure
connected to existing structures shall not exceed the highest wall of the
existing structure.

            6.   Pedestrian-oriented scale to village landscaping; and
            7.   Planned residential and commercial developments in the R-3 and
M-U with connections to existing tall buildings (over 35 feet) allow for the
principal building to be 60% of the footprint and any additional interconnected
buildings cannot exceed the footprint by 40%, making the total footprint 100%.
         (b)   Prohibited:
            1.    Square or rectangular buildings in excess of 50,000 square
feet of gross floor area, when constructed on an individual lot(s) and not a
part of a planned commercial or planned residential development containing less
than three buildings in the R-3, C-B, M-U, or R-C Zoning District;
            2.   Continuous flat facades; and
            3.   Round buildings.
      (2)   Exterior materials. Exterior materials shall be selected for
suitability to architectural style. For the mountain character of the village,
this means using natural traditional materials such as wood and native stone.
All sides of building should relate to each other. The front should not look
substantially different from the other sides. The number of different materials
on exterior finished should be limited.

            13.   Stucco, for two feet above grade only, or allowed as an
accent for areas of detail;
            14.   All SSTM-approved cement board, at the discretion of the
Zoning Administrator or per requirement of the North Carolina Fire Code; and
            15.   ASTM-approved commercial grade vinyl siding in the C-B Zoning
District only. (Siding must be a minimum of .044" grade and must be installed
by someone who is certified by VSI or by a similar institution, manufacturer or
supplier.)
         (b)   Prohibited:
            1.   Stucco, as an entire wall exterior finish;
            2.   Mix of materials unrelated to architectural form/structure;
            3.   Pre-form metal siding;
            4.   Exposed or painted concrete block;
            5.   Vinyl siding;

            10.   Split face block; and
            11.   Non-ASTM approved cement board.
      (3)   Roofs. Roofs are a major visible element and shall be compatible
with both buildings and neighboring buildings architectural style. Similarities
in roof type create a visual continuity in the streetscape and neighborhood.
Roof shape, color and texture should be coordinated with the treatment of the
buildings perimeter walls. Roofs with more than one place, and containing
dormers, add variety to a building and break-up its size.
         (a)   Allowed:
            1.   Any pitched room must be 6/12 to 12/12 slope;
            2.   Large overhangs (minimum one foot);
            3.   Fascia eight inches minimum and/or exposed rater tails;
            4.   Gable or hip roofs;
            5.   Large roof areas should have more than one place and be broken
up with dormers;

            6.   Brightly colored and unnatural looking roof material;
            7.   Roll felt roofing; and
            8.   Corrugated plastic sheet material.
      (4)   Windows. Windows are the most important architectural element to
unify a facade. They reflect the character of a building. However, windows not
only add to the aesthetics of a building but also have to provide light and
ventilation.
         (a)   Allowed:
            1.   Traditional shapes (forms of square, arches or rectangle);
            2.   Forms of residential scale;
            3.   Multi-pane windows (use of muntins to divide glass into
unified sections);
            4.   Vertical windows;

entryways should be clearly expressed with changes of texture or color. Trim
color shall refer to any or all building’s trim elements (such as, eaves,
soffits, overhangs, fasciae, windows, sills, gutters). Principal building and
trim colors are subject to review, also for repainting and existing building.
If the color for repainting matches the existing, then no permit will be
required.
         (b)   Prohibited:
            1.   High gloss finishes;

§ 154.112 TREE PROTECTION/PRESERVATION.
   (A)   Purpose. The regulations of this section are intended to reduce tree
canopy loss and implement urban forest improvements through requirements for
tree protection, tree preservation, and planting or replanting of trees, and
the maintenance of existing trees within the village. The tree preservation
requirements are intended to enhance the quality of life through sustainable
urban forest practices and increase benefits that trees provide, including, but
not limited to the following:
      (1)   Preservation, protection and enhancement of the natural
environment;
      (2)   Provision of habitat for wildlife;
      (3)   Maintenance and improvement of the village appearance and
aesthetics;
      (4)   Improvement of storm water runoff;
      (5)   Screening of noise, dust and glare;
      (6)   Provision of shade for cooling;
      (7)   Reduction of soil erosion and the increase of rainwater
infiltration; and
      (8)   Absorption of carbon dioxide and returning oxygen.
   (B)   Administration. To carry out the provisions of the section, the Zoning
Administrator shall have the responsibility and control over all trees and
shrubbery planted or growing in or upon village property.
   (C)   Definitions.    For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DIAMETER AT BREAST-HEIGHT (DBH). A tree trunk diameter measured in inches
at a height of four and one-half feet above the ground. If a tree splits into
multiple trunks below four and one- half feet, then each trunk is measured as a
separate tree. A tree that splits into multiple trunks above four and one-half
feet is measured as a single tree at four and one-half feet. Diameter can be
determined by dividing the circumference of the tree trunk at four and one half
feet above the ground by 3.14.
      HISTORIC TREE. A tree with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 24 inches
or greater. Every effort should be made to retain healthy historic trees.
      PROTECTED TREE. A live tree measuring in excess of six inches in diameter
at four and one-half feet above ground.
      REMOVAL OF TREES. Any intentional or negligent act that shall cause a
tree to decline and die, including but not limited to:
      (1)   Pruning;
      (2)   Cutting; and
      (3)   Damage inflicted upon the root system of a tree by application of a
toxic substance, operation of machinery, change of natural grade by excavation
or filling about the root system or around the trunk of a tree, or injury by
fire that result in or permit pest infestation.
      SIGNIFICANT TREE. A tree with a DBH of six inches or greater.
      TREE REMOVAL/PRUNING PERMIT. A permit for tree removal and/or pruning
issued under the provision of this section.
   (D)   Tree protection requirements.
      (1)   Jurisdiction. The regulations set forth in this section shall apply
to all real property within the village limits and extra territorial
jurisdiction, subject to the following exceptions: utility companies, electric
suppliers, and governmental agencies in the course of construction or
maintaining easements for water, sewer, electricity, gas, drainage, telephone
or television transmissions, or rights-of-way.
      (2)   Tree removal prohibited. No person firm, organization, society,
association, corporation, or any agent or representative thereof shall directly
or indirectly destroy or remove any trees in excess of six inches DBH within
any zoning district without permission under the provisions of this section.
      (3)   Application and scope. The process for applying the tree protection
of this section shall be as follows:
         (a)   All personas desiring to prune, crop, scale or shape a protected
tree(s) shall apply for a tree removal/pruning permit through the Zoning
Administrator. Tree limbs of three inches or less in diameter may be pruned
without a permit.
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator or his or her designee may issue and
approve a tree removal/pruning permit.
         (c)   Lots that contain a majority of trees less than six inches DBH
shall not be clear-cut. No more than 50% of the natural vegetation, equally
balanced on the lot, can be cut regardless of the size of the vegetation. The
Zoning Administrator shall base approval on the criteria listed in this
subchapter.
         (d)   Trees shall not be topped. However, limbs may be removed for
improving views as long as the health of the tree is not damaged. Detrimental
trimming is prohibited. Property owners are encouraged to use an ISA certified
arborist to prune and remove trees and utilize the drop/crotch pruning
technique.
         (e)   Public property trees: In determining whether a permit shall be
issued for the cutting of trees on public property, the Zoning Administrator
shall consider the following:
            1.   The condition of the tree with respect to disease, danger of
falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interference with
utility services.
            2.   The necessity to remove trees in order to construct proposed
improvements to allow economic development of property adjacent to public
property.
            3.   The topography of land and the effect of tree removal on
erosion, soil retention, and the diversion or increased flow of surface waters,
and coordination with the village’s drainage patterns.
            4.   The effects of tree removal regarding property values in the
area.
   (E)   General standards for removal and retention. It is the desire of the
village to preserve all existing trees to the greatest extent possible. Permits
for removal of protected trees may be approved and issued where one or more of
the following conditions are found to exist:
      (1)   Said trees are within ten feet of an area designated for the
construction of an approved primary or accessory structure on a lot, including
designated walkways, driveways and parking area;
      (2)   Said trees are within five feet of an approved septic tank or
septic drain field;
      (3)   Said trees pose a hazard to the property owner, adjacent property,
utility lines or public health and safety;
      (4)   Selective cutting of said trees, observing property trunk spacing
in accordance with best managements practices, promotes the growth and
development of other trees on the lot;
      (5)   Said trees are diseased or damaged; or
      (6)   Removal of said tree(s) is the only reasonable means by which
building, zoning, subdivisions, healthy, public safety or other village
requirements can be met.
   (F)   General considerations.
      (1)   Emergency conditions. In the event that any tree shall be
determined to be an imminent hazard or danger to the public health, safety, or
general welfare by the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee, that tree can
be removed regardless of the size of the tree.
      (2)   Violations.
         (a)   Defined.
            1.   Lacking a valid tree removal/pruning permit, any intentional
or negligent act resulting in the death of a protected tree, including but not
limited to those defined in this section.
            2.   Lacking a valid tree removal/pruning permit, the pruning of
any protected tree, except as allowed under the provisions of this section.
            3.   All waste from tree removal and/or tree pruning activities
that accumulate on public property shall be removed at the end of each day of
tree removal or pruning. All waste from tree removal and/or tree pruning
activities that accumulate on private property shall be removed within three
working days after the day of completion if the work has been contracted out.
If the homeowner does the removal/pruning, they must remove the debris or put
the debris in a place accessible by the village and the village will remove no
more than one truckload. Additional truck loads will be removed at a cost of
$75 per load. The homeowner must notify the town within three days. Failure to
comply with these stipulations shall constitute a violation.
         (b)   Actions. If violations are noted during the course of a project
or at final inspection, the Zoning Administrator may take appropriate actions
including, but not limited to:
            1.   Requiring replacement of illegally removed trees with trees no
smaller than six feet high and of the same type (evergreen or deciduous) as the
trees removed.
            2.   Replacement of protected trees that are damaged, dying or dead
with trees no smaller than six feet high and of the same type (evergreen or
deciduous) as the trees damaged.
            3.   Remedial actions to protect trees during construction.
   (G)   Penalties defined. Pursuant to G.S. § 160A-175(b), a violation of any
provision of this section shall subject the offender to a civil penalty in the
amount of $500 per tree to be recovered by the village. Violators shall be
issued a written citation, which must be paid within ten days after receipt of
the written citation. If the violator does not pay the penalty within ten days
after receipt of the written citation, the village may recover such penalty in
a civil action in the nature of a debt. In addition, trees removed without
approval are subject to a requirement that they shall be replaced with two six-
foot tall, two-inch in caliper trees for each tree illegally cut. Such
replacement trees shall include but not be limited to the following list:
Botanical Name Common Name
Botanical Name           Common Name
Acer Rubrum              Red Maple
Acer Saccharum           Sugar Maple
Betula nigra             River Birch
Betula papyrifera        White Paper Birch
Sorbus aucuparia         Mountain Ash
Cornus Kousa – varietieKousa Dogwoods
Picea abies              Norway Spruce
Tsuga Canadensis         Canadia Hemlock
Picea pungens            Blue Spruce
Oxydendrum               Sourwood, native
 
   (H)   Enforcement. In the case of a tree removal/pruning permit issued for a
new construction site, the Zoning Administrator, prior to the issuing of a
certificate of zoning compliance, shall ensure the inspection of the site to
determine if all not-to-be removed, protected trees are still standing and
healthy. If such is not the case, the certificate of zoning compliance will not
be issued until appropriate enforcement of this section has taken place.
   (I)   Upon the issuance of a notice of violation or citation, the Village
Manager may suspend any other permits or approvals issued to the violator,
including the issuance of a stop-work order, until such time as the violation
is cured and any civil penalty paid. An active appeal of the violation to the
appropriate village authority shall operate as a stay of the suspension of the
permits and approvals, unless the Village Manager determines that allowing the
work to continue would constitute a danger to health, life, safety, or
property.
   (J)   In the event there is an outstanding penalty amount or unresolved
violation of this chapter, the village may require the violation to be remedied
as a condition for the issuance of any subsequent permit or approval.

§ 154.113 SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   (A)   Purpose and findings.
      (1)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the village, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the village. The provisions of this section have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
      (2)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the village, and on findings incorporated in the cases of
City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v.
American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,
501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not
limited to, Horry County and Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Richland County, S.C.;
Charlotte- Mecklenburg County, N.C.; Winston Salem-Forsyth County, N.C.;
Broward County, Florida; St. Johns County, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; and
also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The
Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota),
the village finds:
         (a)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities, the control of which elsewhere presents
challenges to the operators of such establishments. Further, there is presently
no mechanism in the village to make the owners of such establishments
responsible for the activities that would occur on their premises.
         (b)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in
this section as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
         (c)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex,
occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide poorly
lit, overly crowded private or semiprivate areas, booths or cubicles for
viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
         (d)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions.
         (e)   Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and
other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within
the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
         (f)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
         (g)   The surgeon general of the United States in his report of
October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection
may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
         (h)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.
         (i)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
         (j)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult"
oriented films.
         (k)   The findings noted in paragraphs number one through ten raise
substantial governmental concerns.
         (l)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
         (m)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
village. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee
is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession
and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
         (n)   Prohibition of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental
interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in
adult theatres.
         (o)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
         (p)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons
ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to
the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid
in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
         (q)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding employees who may
engage in the conduct which this section is designed to prevent or who are
likely to be witnesses to such activity.
         (r)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational concern that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this section.
         (s)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult
uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which
leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
         (t)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens
of the village will be promoted by the enactment of this section.
   (B)   Definitions.

   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the intent of this section to define
practical and effective measures by which the obtrusive aspects of excessive
and/or careless outdoor light usage can be minimized, while preserving safety,
security and the nighttime use and enjoyment of property. These measures will
reasonably curtail the degradation of the nighttime visual environment by
encouraging lighting practices that direct appropriate amounts of light where
and when it is needed, increasing the use of energy-efficient sources, and
decreasing the wastage of light, sky glow, and glare resulting from over-
lighting and poorly shielded or inappropriately directed lighting fixtures.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

the horizontal as determined by a photometric test or certified by the
manufacturer. Any structural part of the light fixture providing this shielding
must be permanently affixed.
      GLARE. The sensation produced by a bright source within the visual field
that is sufficiently brighter than the level to which the eyes have adapted to
cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility. The
magnitude of glare depends on such factors as the size, position, brightness of
the source, and on the brightness level to which the eyes have become adapted.
      INSTALLED. The attachment or assembly fixed in place, whether or not
connected to a power source, of any outdoor light fixture.
      LIGHT POLLUTION. Any adverse effect of manmade light.
      LUMEN. A unit for measuring the amount of light produced by a lamp; watt

§ 154.115 LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING STEEP SLOPES.
   (A)   The intent of these regulations is to provide special measures for
land development activities in areas requiring land disturbance of steep and
very steep slopes, to facilitate the identification of land are subject to
possible slope failure and to require investigation and remediation of such
conditions, if necessary, when such land is proposed to be developed. All land
disturbing activities require submittal of a site plan with a scale of 1

being five feet or less.
         (b)   L = Total length of the contour lines within the parcel in feet.
         (c)   A = Area of the parcel in acres.
         (d)   0.0023 = The constant that converts square feet into acres.
      (3)   The above formula for calculating the percentage of average slope
is used for determining very steep slopes and steep slopes. The maximum
impervious surface allowed upon very steep slopes is limited to no more than
60% of the total surface area of the property. The maximum impervious surface
allowed upon steep slopes is limited to no more than 70% of the total surface
area of the property.
      (4)   Building height is limited upon very steep slopes to no more than
30 feet. Building height is limited upon steep slopes to no more than 35 feet.
For purposes of determining building height of this section, once the placement
of the footprint of a structure has been identified, the height of the building
shall be determined by the midpoint of each wall of the smallest rectangle that
can be made with the entire footprint, to determine a midpoint in the center of
that rectangle to be used for a measuring point to determine the height of the
building.
   (C)   Development requirements for both steep and very steep slopes shall be
as follows:
      (1)   All stream crossings, culverts and disturbance of riparian zones
are to comply with appropriate state and federal regulations;
      (2)   Should the Zoning Administrator believe that geological hazard
indicators are present he or she may employ and/or contract with a licensed
engineer whose practice includes geotechnical engineering to evaluate plans for
development, as necessary, with the cost for this technical review to be borne
by the person(s) requesting development of the property. Such an evaluation may
include, but not be limited to all driveways, roads, retaining walls, and other
cut and fill upon the property. Once the analysis is performed, the Zoning
Administrator shall cause it to become a part of the public record.
      (3)   Developers of property, where the development plan requires land
disturbing activity on very steep slopes, shall make reasonable effort to
preserve and protect features of the slope, such as trees and other plant
material, which may help stabilize the slope.
      (4)   The owner of any property whose development plan will include the
disturbance of a steep or very steep slope, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, may challenge this determination by appeal to the Board of
Adjustment as provided in §
31.07.
   (D)   The requirements for land disturbing activities on very steep slopes
shall be as follows:
      (1)   Plans for the development of any property must be accompanied by a
site-specific geologic analysis of the very steep slope portion of the site to
be disturbed by the proposed development plan, paid for by the applicant, and
conducted by a licensed engineer whose practice includes geotechnical
engineering, to determine whether the proposed development plan can be
implemented without jeopardizing the slope stability on the site itself or/and
on properties surrounding the site.
      (2)   If the property is determined to be safe for development and
requires remedial measures to ensure slope stability, a licensed engineer whose
practice include geotechnical engineering must develop and present a plan to
the Zoning Administrator that will preserve slope stability on the site during
and after completion of grading and construction for the site, as well as for
surrounding properties to the extent that the contemplated development
activities on the site affects surrounding properties.

proposed amendment or repeal of this chapter as provided by law, and the review
and approval or disapproval of certain matters as specifically stated in this
chapter.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XI § 1100) (Res. R-2021.9, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 154.146 ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
   The office of the Zoning Administrator is hereby established. The Village
Manager shall appoint some suitable person to such office. It shall be the duty
of the duly appointed Zoning Administrator to render such counsel and advice to
the Planning Board as may be reasonably be requested by the said Board, and to
perform such duties in connection with this chapter and the planning and
enforcement thereof as may be required by the Village Council.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XI § 1101)
§ 154.147 PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Permits. The village coordinates the enforcement of this chapter with
the county inspections and building permit system. The village enforces this
chapter through the issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance and a
certificate of occupancy, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The
County Inspections Department is authorized to issue building permits and
enforce all applicable state building codes in the village.
   (B)   Permit expiration. Zoning compliance and building permits expire six
months after issuance unless work under the permit has commenced. Permits also
expire if work is discontinued for a period of 12 months after work has
commenced.
   (C)   Permit choice. If a development permit applicant submits a permit
application for any type of development and a rule or ordinance is amended,
including an amendment to any applicable land development regulation, between
the time the development permit application was submitted and a development
permit decision is made, the development permit applicant may choose which
adopted version of the rule or ordinance will apply to the permit and use of
the building, structure, or land indicated on the permit application.
   (D)   Permit choice expiration. The permit choice rule may expire if an
applicant delays. If an applicant puts a permit application on hold for six
consecutive months or more, or if an applicant fails to respond to the Planning
Board and/or Board of Adjustments requests for additional information for six
consecutive months or more, then the application is discontinued. If the permit
application is resumed, it will be reviewed under the rules in effect at that
time.
   (E)   Subsequent development permits. If an applicant obtains an initial
development permit, that permit triggers permit choice for subsequent
development permits under the rules applicable at the time of application for
the initial development permit. That protection continues for 18 months after
the approval of the initial development permit. The applicant must be actively
pursuing that original application to maintain the permit choice rights for
other development regulations. The initial development permit under this
section shall not include a sign permit or erosion and sedimentation control
permit.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1 Art. XI § 1102) (Res. R-2021.9, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 154.148 CERTIFICATE OF ZONING COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   Prior to both the issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance by
the Village Zoning Administrator and the issuance of a building permit by the
County Inspections Department, no building or other structure may be erected,
moved, extended, enlarged, or structurally altered, or any excavation or
filling of any lot for the construction of any building be commenced until the
Village Zoning Administrator has issued a certificate of zoning compliance for
such work. The Zoning Administrator shall not grant a certificate of zoning
compliance for the construction or alteration of any building or structure of
the building or structure as proposed to be constructed or altered would be in
violation of any provision of this chapter. The Zoning Administrator shall
verify that the proposed building or structure meets all dimensional

the application and on inspection of the site. Recognizing that the
preservation of existing trees provides numerous benefits to the community, the
Village Council is implementing tree preservation regulations.
   (B)   The primary goal is to preserve, at a minimum, 20% of the existing
tree canopy on properties targeted for development. To achieve the village's
tree preservation goals, elected officials need the support of the citizens in
the community. For all practical purposes, the preservation and care of these
privately owned trees is up to the residents of the community. No person,
directly or indirectly, shall remove any tree greater than four inches in
diameter from applicable public or private property until the Zoning
Administrator has issued a zoning compliance permit for the construction of any
dwelling unit. Trees may be removed for areas designated as driveways, or those
necessary for installing utilities.
      (1)   Application for certificate of zoning compliance. All applicants
for certificates of zoning compliance shall be accompanied by plans, submitted
in duplicate to the Zoning Administrator. The application and supporting; plans
and documentation shall include site plans drawn to scale, accurately showing
the following information:
         (a)   Property lines and corners;
         (b)   Building setback lines and required yard areas;
         (c)   Existing building and structures;
         (d)   Utility easements, rights-of-way, culverts, and drainage ways;
         (e)   Location of all utility lines and facilities on the lot;
         (f)   Shape, size, use, and location of proposed buildings and
structured to be erected or altered on the lot;
         (g)   Other information required or necessary to provide for the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter;
         (h)   Location of any land clearing, or tree removal associated with
structures and other improvements, such as dwellings, parking areas, paths,
walkways, driveways, water lines, sewer lines, or other utilities, garden
areas, and the like;
         (i)   Location of additional areas proposed for clearing or thinning
for the purpose of grading, patios, views, and the like;
         (j)   Location of trees to be saved and/or the locations where trees
will be planted; and
         (k)   If no substantial construction progress has been made within six
months of the date of issuance of the certificate of zoning compliance, the
Village Zoning Administrator may require the owner to replant tree(s) that have
been removed, consistent with the village tree protection and preservation
ordinance.
      (2)   Issuance of certificate of zoning compliance. The Zoning
Administrator shall review the application and all supporting documentation for
conformance with the provisions of this chapter and shall inspect the site,
during a pre-construction conference with the developer, contractor, and
project engineer, as applicable, to verify that the building or structure will
meet all area and dimensional requirements. In order to perform this
verification, it will be necessary that:
         (a)   Property corners shall be permanently marked with iron pins or
concrete monuments by a surveyor licensed in the state. The corners shall be
flagged or marked for easy identification and verification of the building
location by the Zoning Administrator; and
         (b)   The location of the proposed structure shall be marked by means
acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. Once the Zoning Administrator has
verified the application and the site meets all requirements, he or she shall
issue a certificate of zoning compliance. One copy of all documents shall be
retained by the Zoning Administrator.
         (c)   Requirements during construction:
            1.   Contractors are required to maintain a neat and orderly
construction site, see § 90.10 Nuisances.
            2.   Contractors will be allowed to perform work Monday through
Saturday, beginning at 7:00 a.m. and ending by 8:00 p.m. There will be no work
performed on deliveries made on Sundays or holidays.
            3.   Employees of the Village of Sugar Mountain and other
authorized inspecting entities with whom the village may contract shall have
access to the site at all times.
            4.   Prior to commencing any land disturbing activities, all
erosion control devices shall be installed and a graveled access for
construction shall be constructed.
            5.   Prior to making any open cut of village roads, the contractor
shall have all underground utilities located and a road cut permit obtained
from the Village Zoning Administrator.
            6.   Any utilities installed under a village street shall be placed
within a carrier pipe with the trench being no less than 18 inches deep. After
placement of the carrier pipe, the area around the pipe shall be backfilled to
a depth of six inches above the crown of the pipe. This backfill shall be
compacted to 95% of modified proctor. The remainder of the trench shall be
backfilled and compacted in eight-inch lifts to 95% modified proctor. The top
eight inches shall be asphalt binder course Type H or HE and the surface shall
be inches of asphalt, Type I-1 or I-2.
            7.   An engineer licensed in the State of North Carolina shall
design any retaining walls as required by Avery County Planning and Inspections
and/or the State of NC building code. All areas that are to be graded or have
the vegetation removed and that are not covered with a building or gravel must
be permanently seeded and mulched prior to receiving a certificate of zoning
compliance, unless the builder or owner has made other arrangements for
landscaping with the Zoning Administrator.
            8.   No construction vehicles or vehicles belonging to construction
workers shall be parked on the pavement of any public road unless arranged in
advance with the Public Works Department. Only materials and equipment that are
to be used to build a portion of the project shall be stored on the
construction site. If the construction site is inactive for a period of 30 days
or more, all materials shall be neatly stacked and secured from movement by
wind, and all equipment shall be removed from the site. Ground areas that are
disturbed more than ten feet outside the footprint of the structure shall be
temporarily seeded and mulched, graveled, or adequately mulched.
            9.   No vehicle equipped with tracks shall be permitted to travel
on village streets without the approval of the village.
            10.   If, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator or the Public
Works Department, the material tracked on to the road creates a hazard, the
developer shall immediately remove the material and take steps to continuously
clean the road.
            11.   Vehicles are not allowed to damage roads. Any damage by a
developer to a village street, embankment, shoulder, or pavement during
construction shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator
or his or her designee within 72 hours after the developer is notified in
writing to make the repairs. If said damage creates a public safety hazard, the
village shall require immediate correction.
            12.   Any vehicle with a combination of dimensions over eight and
one-half feet in width, 13.5 feet in height, and 60 feet in length is consider
an oversized vehicle and will require a permit to travel on village streets.
            13.   Before a certificate of zoning compliance may be issued, all
