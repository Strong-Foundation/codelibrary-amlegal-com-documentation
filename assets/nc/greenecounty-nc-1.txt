expeditiously clear debris from all roads, including roads in private
communities. This is necessary to eliminate an imminent threat to the public
health, safety and welfare.
   (D)   The county is hereby authorized to remove debris from private roads,
rights-of-way, and ingress/ egress easements in private communities. Such
debris removal is restricted to streets and rights-of-ways and ingress and
egress easements, in order to clear them for emergency vehicle travel and
delivery of services essential to the public health and safety. No other
property will be cleared in a private community. This provision shall apply
only to streets where the county regularly provides access for emergency
vehicles and the enforcement of county regulations, as well as access for
municipal and other public service vehicles. Debris will be removed from
private streets, rights-of-ways and ingress/egress easements only when there is

emergency as provided herein.
   (E)   The county shall conduct similar operations on public streets.

private property under the following conditions: Upon a finding by the Greene
County Manager or his designee that Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
criteria have been met for eligibility of debris removal work from private
property under the Public Assistance Program, he may authorize such work if it
is necessary to: (1) eliminate immediate threats to life, public health, and
safety; or (2) eliminate immediate threats of significant damage to improved
public or private property; or (3) ensure economic recovery of the affected
community to the benefit of the community-at-large. Greene County shall have
the legal responsibility to take action where there is an immediate threat to
life, public health, and safety regardless of whether there is any expectation
or request that FEMA will reimburse costs incurred for private property debris
removal. Where debris is removed from private property to eliminate immediate
threats of significant damage to improved public or private property; or to
ensure economic recovery of the affected community to the benefit of the
community-at-large, Greene County shall make a reasonable effort to locate the
property owner or tenant of the property and obtain his or her signed
permission to remove the debris. In the event of a large-scale disaster, Greene
County recognizes that it may not be able to locate the property owner or
tenant in a timely manner, and in that event it may proceed with the debris
removal if reasonable efforts to locate him or her are unsuccessful after 24
hours.

for determining volume must be negotiated between Greene County and the user.
In the event there is no mutually acceptable alternate means, Greene County
shall determine the method of measurement.
   (B)   The volume or quantity of industrial waste discharged by any person
into the sanitary sewerage system shall be measured by one or more of the
following methods.
      (1)   If the volume of water used by any person in his or her industrial
or process operations is substantially the same as the volume secured from the
municipal waterworks system, then the volume of water purchased shall be
considered to be the volume of waste discharged.
      (2)   If, on the premises of any person discharging industrial waste into
the sanitary sewerage system, a substantial portion of the water secured from
the municipal waterworks system is not used for industrial purposes, or if not
returned to the sanitary sewerage system, the quantity of industrial waste
shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   By a meter (or meters) on the water supply line (or lines) to
the industrial and/or process operations;
         (b)   By a meter (or meters) on the waste line (or waste lines) from
the industrial and/or process operations; and
         (c)   If meters, as required under divisions (B)(2)(a) and (b) above
have not been installed, by an estimate made by the Chairperson of the
proportion of the water purchased which is used for industrial purposes and
returned to the sanitary sewerage system.
      (3)   If any person now discharging or proposing to discharge industrial
wastes into the sanitary sewerage system does not secure his or her entire
water supply requirements from the Municipal Water Works System, such person
shall install and maintain a meter (or meters) on the waste line (or waste
lines) from his or her industrial and/or process operations, or shall install
such additional meters on the private water supply as required to permit
determination of the total quantity discharged to the sewers from both sources
under procedures comparable to divisions (B)(2)(a) and (b) above.

inspection. A determination of character and strength of the wastes may be made
annually, or more often as may be deemed necessary by Greene County.
   (B)   Samples shall be collected manually or mechanically over such period
of time and composited in such a manner as to be representative of the wastes
being discharged. The laboratory methods followed in the examination of the
wastes shall be those as set forth in the latest edition of Standard Methods as
defined in §
51.01.
   (C)   The determination of the character, strength, or quantity of the
wastes as made by Greene County shall be binding as a basis for computation of
charges, or for actions by the Board of Commissioners.
      (1)   When requested by the person discharging, the samples may be split
to permit analysis by the discharger, or a qualified independent laboratory,
for the discharger’s information.
      (2)   The person discharging wastes may request additional sampling and
analyses which will be performed as soon as practical with all costs, as
determined by Greene County, being borne by the discharger.

§ 51.16  INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER CHARGES.
   (A)   Industrial wastewater charges or “surcharges” shall be applied to
“Industrial Users”, defined as follows.
      (1)   (a)   INDUSTRIAL USER.  Any non-governmental non-residential user
of the sewerage system that discharges more than the equivalent of 25,000
gallons per day (gpd) of sanitary wastewater and is identified in the Standard
Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, Office of Management and Budget, as
amended and supplemented under one of the following divisions:
            1.   Division A - Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing;
            2.   Division B - Mining;
            3.   Division D - Manufacturing;
            4.   Division E - Transportation, Communications, Electric, Gas,
and Sanitary Services; and
            5.   Division I - Services.
         (b)   In determining the amount of a user’s discharge for purposes of
classification, domestic wastewater discharges from sanitary conveniences shall
be excluded. After applying the sanitary waste exclusion, discharges in the
above divisions that have a volume exceeding 25,000 gpd or the weight of
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or Suspended Solids (SS) equivalent to that
weight found in 25,000 gpd of sanitary wastes are considered industrial users.
Sanitary wastes, for purposes of this calculation of equivalency, are the
wastes discharged from residential users.
      (2)   INDUSTRIAL USER shall also mean any other industrial, commercial,
or institutional user of the sanitary sewerage system that discharges
wastewater to the treatment works which contain toxic pollutants, poisonous
solids, liquids, or gases in sufficient quantity either singly or by
interaction with other wastes, of contaminate the sludge at the treatment
works, or to injure or to interfere with any sewage treatment process, or which
constitutes a hazard to humans or animals, creates a public nuisance, or
creates any hazard in or has an adverse effect on the waters receiving any
discharge from the treatment works.
      (3)   INDUSTRIAL USER shall also mean any person discharging wastewater
with concentrations in excess of 350 mg/l for BOD or Suspended Solids or 30 mg/
l for Ammonia Nitrogen.
   (B)   The industrial wastewater charges shall be established not less than
one time per year and at the same time domestic user charges are established.
Industrial wastewater charges shall be based on the actual costs for providing
sewer services during the preceding fiscal year. The charges so computed along
with projected increases in costs shall be the basis for estimating the monthly
billings to each such customer for the following fiscal year. The charges
collected shall be adjusted to actual costs at the end of each fiscal year and
appropriate credits given against billings in the ensuing year, or additional
billings made to each such customer, using the actual wastewater quantities and
characteristics discharged by that customer during the preceding fiscal year as
the basis for computing the adjusted charges. The actual costs shall be
determined as soon after the end of each fiscal year as possible and until such
time the charges for the current year shall be based on either the rates for
the prior year or on estimated rates for the current year.
   (C)   The costs included in the computation of actual charges for the
preceding fiscal year, or of estimated charges for an ensuing fiscal year,
shall include the following:
      (1)   Operation and maintenance expenses; and
      (2)   Interest and principal on outstanding sewer bond issues.
   (D)   (1)   Industrial wastewater surcharges, in addition to the normal
charges calculated in accordance with §
51.17(B), will be established for each of the following parameters:
         (a)   BOD, per pound;
         (b)   Suspended Solids, per pound; and
         (c)   Other parameters as applicable, per pound.
      (2)   The surcharges will be calculated by the following formula:
      Surcharge =   [O&M cost/unit of BOD + O&M cost/unit of Suspended Solids +
O&M cost/unit of any pollutant] volume contribution of user/time
      (3)   Industrial wastewater charges shall become effective on the first
regular meter reading date for each user after the user is connected to the
system, and after written notice from Greene County of classification as an
industrial user. Interim monthly charges based on domestic user charges shall
be invoiced and collected during the period equitable industrial rates are
being developed. At the time of adoption of these regulations, there were no
industrial dischargers on the sewerage system.
   (E)   The Board of Commissioners may establish classes of industrial users
and assign representative strengths of wastewater to each. Such class
wastewater characteristics may recognize analyses of representative users of
each class based on typical data from other sources. To the extent practical,
actual data for each industrial user’s wastewater shall be used. Industrial
users assigned standard strength parameters may request sample analyses of
wastewater. Upon determination of the characteristics on samples representative
of the wastewater on not less than three working days, such characteristics
shall be used in determining the charges until the wastewater may again be
sampled.
   (F)   The Board of Commissioners may consolidate the component charges of
the industrial wastewater charges into a single volume charge which includes
the characteristic charges computed for a unit volume of 1,000 gallons. Such a
weighted volume charge may be applicable to a class of users or to each user
where his or her actual wastewater characteristics are known.
   (G)   Industrial users exhibiting marked, seasonal load variations shall pay
charges which recognize the dedication or reservation of capacity for the
treatment of their seasonal peak operating loads, and any unusual operation and
maintenance costs directly related to such seasonal loads. This provision shall
apply only to those industrial users whose peak loads exceed 10%of any capacity
parameter and are at least twice its off season loads.
   (H)   The user charge system herein enacted shall take precedence over any
pre-existing agreements concerning the charges to be collected for providing
wastewater treatment services or reserving capacity.
(Ord. passed 2-21-05)
§ 51.17  BILLING AND COLLECTING.
   (A)   Sewer user bills shall be rendered monthly and shall be due and
payable within ten days of the date of billing. The service may be discontinued
without further notice for non-payment. Greene County reserves the right to
vary the dates or length of period covered, temporarily or permanently if
necessary or desirable.
   (B)   Bills for sewer service will be calculated in accordance with the
published rate schedule then in effect and will be based on the amount consumed
for the period covered by meter readings.
   (C)   Charges for services commence when the sewer tap is installed and
connection made, whether used or not. Sixty days may be allowed for hookup on
initial installation of a sewer line.
   (D)   Failure to receive bills shall not prevent such bills from becoming
delinquent or relieve the consumer from payment.
   (E)   Sewer connections that have been plugged or severed due to delinquent
accounts shall be unplugged or reconnected to the sewer system upon the payment
of all outstanding sewer user bills and collection costs and payment of a
reconnection fee of $50.
(Ord. passed 2-21-05)
§ 51.18  USER BILL COMPLAINTS AND ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   If a user believes a bill to be in error, the user shall present a
claim, in person or in writing, at the Water Department’s office before the
bill becomes delinquent. Such claims, if made after the bill has become
delinquent, shall not be effective to prevent discontinuance of service as
heretofore provided. The user may pay such bill under protest and payment under
protest shall not prejudice his or her claim.
   (B)   A user’s sewer bill shall be adjusted automatically in the event of a
similar adjustment of a water bill, provided the basis for adjustment was based
on circumstances which also affected the sewer bill.
   (C)   The Board of Commissioners shall be the final reviewing authority for
all appeals.

(Ord. passed 6-21-04)
§ 51.46  CHANGE IN NATURE OF USE.
   The Public Works Director or designee shall be notified by the consumer the
nature of use of the property changes so as to change the hazard classification
of that property, as set forth in §§
51.41 and
51.42.
(Ord. passed 6-21-04)
§ 51.47  CONSUMER RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   The consumer shall, upon notification, as defined in §
51.45, install the hazard containment device(s) as required within 90 days from
the date of notification.
   (B)   If, after expiration of 90 days, the containment device(s) has not
been installed in conformance with standards set by the Public Works Director
or designee, in a proper working condition, the Public Works Director or
designee may discontinue the public water supply service at that premises, and
service shall not be restored until such devices have been installed. The
Public Works Director or designee may permit an extension of up to 90 
additional days if compliance efforts are underway and the existence of
hardship can be demonstrated.
   (C)   The GCRWS shall bear no liability for direct or consequential damages
proximately caused by the discontinuance of service pursuant to this section.
(Ord. passed 6-21-04)
§ 51.48  TESTING AND MAINTENANCE OF DEVICES.
   The consumer at each property at which containment and/or confinement device
(s) have been installed, except those with devices installed in accordance with
§
51.42(A) of this code, shall have each containment and/or confinement device(s)
tested on an annual basis, and perform any routine maintenance to such device
as recommended by the manufacturer, and provide the Cross-Connection
Coordinator with a report of that inspection and work. The consumer shall cause
such maintenance, or repairs to be made, rendering the device fully
operational. Failure of the consumer to perform that testing and maintenance
shall be cause for the premises to be deemed an immediate public health hazard.
The Public Works Director or designee may immediately thereafter discontinue
public water supply service to that premises and service shall not be restored
until such devices have been rendered operational. Where the use of water is
critical to the continuance of normal operations or protection of life,
property, or equipment, duplicated containment or confinement devices shall be
provided by the property owner to avoid the necessity of discontinuing water
service to test or repair the device or devices.
(Ord. passed 6-21-04)
§ 51.49  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
   The GCRWS shall not be held liable, for any cause, for failure to detect any
unit failing to operate adequately, or failure to identify any specific hazard,
which may result in contamination of its public water supply, nor shall this
subchapter diminish the responsibility of any property owner from whose
property a contamination of the public water supply may originate.
(Ord. passed 6-21-04)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.01  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be officially known as "Greene County Phase II Stormwater
Ordinance" and referred to hereinafter as "this chapter."
(Ord. passed 6-29-16)
§ 52.02  AUTHORITY.
   The Board of Commissioners of Greene County is authorized to adopt this
chapter pursuant to North Carolina law, including but not limited to Article
14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; G.S. § 143-214.7 and rules
promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder; Session Law
2004-163; G.S. §§ 160A-174 and 160A-185.
(Ord. passed 6-29-16)
§ 52.03  FINDINGS.
   It is hereby determined that:
   (A)   Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil
erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and
sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
   (B)   These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities
of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to
public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and
   (C)   These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design
and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites.
   (D)   Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water
Act") and federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as
rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in
response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas,
including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those
included in this chapter.
   (E)   Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Greene County establishes
this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of
state and federal law and regulation regarding control of stormwater runoff and
discharge.
(Ord. passed 6-29-16)
§ 52.04  PURPOSE.
   (A)   General. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and
enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by
establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects
of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non point and point source
pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been
determined that proper management of construction- related and post-development
stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and
infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and
protect water and aquatic resources.
   (B)   Specific. This chapter seeks to meet its general purpose through the
following specific objectives and means:
      (1)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect
the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
      (2)   Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as
practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, streambank
erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream
temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic
habitats;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the
minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices,
such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of
greenspace, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent
practicable;
      (6)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they
continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no
threat to public safety;
      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of stormwater management plan, for the inspection of
approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance;
      (8)   Coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural
areas with Greene County Ordinances.
(Ord. passed 6-29-16)
§ 52.05  APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   General. Beginning with and subsequent to its effective date, this
chapter shall be applicable to all development and redevelopment, including,

not part of a larger common plan of development or sale is exempt from the
provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Development and redevelopment that disturb less than one acre are
not exempt if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development
or sale, even though multiple, separate or distinct activities take place at
different times on different schedules.
      (4)   Activities that are exempt from permit requirements of Section 404
of the federal Clean Water Act as specified in 40 CFR 232 (primarily, ongoing
farming and forestry activities) are exempt from the provisions of this
chapter.
      (5)   Underground utility projects are allowed under general permits and
are exempt from provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   No development or redevelopment until compliance and permit. No
development or redevelopment shall occur except in compliance with the

rainfall depth used to calculate runoff shall be 3.13".
   BUILT-UPON AREA (BUA). That portion of a development project that is covered
by impervious or partially impervious surface including, but not limited to,
buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots, and paths;
and recreation facilities such as tennis courts. BUILT-UPON AREA does not
include a wooden slatted deck, the water area of a swimming pool, or pervious
or partially pervious paving material to the extent that the paving material
absorbs water or allows water to infiltrate through the paving material.
   DEPARTMENT. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality or
successor.
   DESIGN MANUAL. The stormwater design manual approved for use in Phase II
jurisdictions by the Department. All references herein to the Design Manual are

built-upon area or that otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation
into the soil.
   DIVISION. The Division of Water Energy, Mineral and Land in the Department
or successor.
   HIGH-DENSITY PROJECT. Any project that exceeds the low-density threshold for
dwelling units per acre or built-upon area.
   LARGER COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT OR SALE. Any area where multiple separate
and distinct construction or land-disturbing activities will occur under one
plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not
limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan
application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design)
or physical demarcation (including but not limited to boundary signs, lot
stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur
on a specific plot.
   LOW-DENSITY PROJECT.
      (1)   A project is a low-density project if it has no more than two
dwelling units per acre for residential development or no more than 24% BUA for
all residential and non-residential development.
      (2)   A project with an overall density at or below the relevant low-
density threshold, but containing areas with a density greater than the overall
project density, may be considered low density as long as the project meets or
exceeds the post-construction model practices for low-density projects and
locates the higher density in upland areas and away from surface waters and
drainage ways to the maximum extent practicable.
   OWNER. The legal or beneficial owner of land, including but not limited to a
mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, or long-term or
commercial lessee, or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights in
the property or having legal power of management and control of the property.
OWNER shall include long-term commercial tenants; management entities, such as
those charged with or engaged in the management of properties for profit; and
every person or entity having joint ownership of the property. A secured lender
not in possession of the property does not constitute an owner, unless the
secured lender is included within the meaning of "owner" under another
description in this definition, such as a management entity.
   REDEVELOPMENT. Any development on previously-developed land, other than a
rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and
provides equal or greater stormwater control than the previous development.
   STRUCTURAL BMP. A physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter
pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff
velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-
development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of
these goals. STRUCTURAL BMP includes physical practices such as constructed
wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other
methods installed or created on real property. STRUCTURAL BMP is synonymous
with "structural practice," "stormwater control facility," "stormwater control
practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater management practice,"
"stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater treatment systems," and
similar terms used in this chapter.
   SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS. For the purposes of determining whether sufficient
progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following
construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan
shall occur: obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a
continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; or installation
and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the
construction and approval of a building foundation. SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS for
purposes of determining whether an approved plan is null and void is not
necessarily the same as "substantial expenditures" used for determining vested
rights pursuant to applicable law.

used to meet this requirement shall control and treat runoff from the first one
inch of rainfall. Runoff volume drawdown time shall be a minimum of 48 hours,
but not more than 120 hours.
   (B)   Peak runoff control.
      (1)   All new development is required to control peak discharge rate from
the site. All structural stormwater treatment systems used to meet this
requirement shall control and treat runoff for the 1-year, 24-hour storm to
predevelopment levels to avoid contributing to erosion to the stream channel.
      (2)   Peak flow control is not required for developments that meet one or
more of the following requirements:
         (a)   The increase in peak flow between pre- and post-development does
not exceed 10%, or
         (b)   The proposed new development meets all of the following criteria
overall impervious surface is less than 15% and the remaining pervious portions
of the site are utilized to the maximum extent practical to convey and control
the stormwater runoff, or
         (c)   Greene County may exempt development in specific locations if
such locations are prone to flooding and controlling peak flow will aggravate
the flooding problems.
   (C)   Total suspended solids (TSS) removal. All structural stormwater
treatment systems used to meet the requirements of this program shall be
designed to have a minimum of 85% average annual removal for total suspended
solids (TSS).
   (D)   General engineering design criteria. General engineering design
criteria for all projects shall be in accordance with 15A NACA 2H .1008(c), as
explained in the Design Manual.
   (E)   Minimum separation from perennial and intermittent surface waters. All

survey map prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the most recent version of the 1:
24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the United
States Geologic Survey (USGS). An exception to this requirement may be allowed
when surface waters are not present in accordance with the provisions of 15A
NCAC 2B .0233 (3) (a) or similar site-specific determination made using
division-approved methodology.
   (F)   Restrictions on property. The approval of the stormwater permit shall
require an enforceable restriction on property usage that runs with the land,
such as recorded deed restrictions or protective covenants, to ensure that
future development and redevelopment maintains the site consistent with the
approved project plans.
(Ord. passed 6-29-16)
§ 52.38  STANDARDS FOR STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   (A)   Evaluation according to contents of Design Manual. All stormwater
control measures and stormwater treatment practices (also referred to as Best
Management Practices, or BMPs) required under this chapter shall be evaluated
by the Stormwater Administrator according to the policies, criteria, and

design criteria for each stormwater practice, in the Design Manual. The
Stormwater Administrator shall determine whether proposed BMPs will be adequate
to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Determination of adequacy; presumptions and alternatives. Stormwater
treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained in
accordance with the criteria and specifications in the Design Manual will be
presumed to meet the minimum water quality and quantity performance standards
of this chapter. Whenever an applicant proposes to utilize a practice or
practices not designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria and
specifications in the Design Manual, the applicant shall have the burden of
demonstrating that the practice(s) will satisfy the minimum water quality and
quantity performance standards of this chapter. The Stormwater Administrator
may require the applicant to provide the documentation, calculations, and
examples necessary for the Stormwater Administrator to determine whether such
an affirmative showing is made.
   (C)   Separation from seasonal high water table. For BMPs that require a
separation from the seasonal high-water table, the separation shall be provided
by at least 12 inches of naturally occurring soil above the seasonal high-water
table.

§ 52.39  VARIANCES.
   (A)   Any person may petition the Greene County Board of Commissioners for a
variance granting permission to use the person's land in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this chapter. To qualify for a variance, the petitioner must show
all of the following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardships would result from strict application of this
chapter.
      (2)   The hardships result from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as the location, size, or topography of the property.
      (3)   The hardships did not result from actions taken by the petitioner.
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of this chapter; will secure public safety and welfare; and will
preserve substantial justice.

safeguards upon any variance it grants.
   (C)   Statutory exceptions. Notwithstanding division (A) of this section,
exceptions from the 30-foot landward location of built-upon area requirement as
well as the deed restrictions and protective covenants requirements shall be
granted in any of the following instances:
      (1)   When there is a lack of practical alternatives for a road crossing,
railroad crossing, bridge, airport facility, or utility crossing as long as it
is located, designed, constructed, and maintained to minimize disturbance,
provide maximum nutrient removal, protect against erosion and sedimentation,
have the least adverse effects on aquatic life and habitat, and protect water
quality to the maximum extent practicable through the use of BMPs.
      (2)   When there is a lack of practical alternatives for a stormwater
management facility; a stormwater management pond; or a utility, including, but
not limited to, water, sewer, or gas construction and maintenance corridor, as
long as it is located 15 feet landward of all perennial and intermittent
surface waters and as long as it is located, designed, constructed, and
maintained to minimize disturbance, provide maximum nutrient removal, protect
against erosion and sedimentation, have the least adverse effects on aquatic
life and habitat, and protect water quality to the maximum extent practicable
through the use of BMPs.
      (3)   A lack of practical alternatives may be shown by demonstrating
that, considering the potential for a reduction in size, configuration, or
density of the proposed activity and all alternative designs, the basic project
purpose cannot be practically accomplished in a manner which would avoid or
result in less adverse impact to surface waters.

      (2)   All inspection reports shall be on forms supplied by the Stormwater
Administrator. An original inspection report shall be provided to the
Stormwater Administrator beginning one year from the date of as-built
certification/final plat approval and each year thereafter on or before the
date of the as-built certification.
(Ord. passed 6-29-16)
§ 52.51  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.
   (A)   In general.
      (1)   Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to
be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this chapter, and prior to issuance
of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP
pursuant to this chapter, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an
operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent
owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the
structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served
by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary
responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement.
      (2)   The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or
owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP,
and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the
structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to Greene County a right of entry
in the event that the Stormwater Administrator has reason to believe it has
become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the
structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer
an obligation on Greene County to assume responsibility for the structural BMP.
      (3)   The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the
Stormwater Administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on
the final plat and shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds upon
final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be
given to the Stormwater Administrator within 14 days following its recordation.
   (B)   Special requirement for homeowners' and other associations. For all
structural BMPs required pursuant to this chapter and that are to be or are
owned and maintained by a homeowners' association, property owners'
association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance
agreement shall include all of the following provisions:
      (1)   Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and
maintain the stormwater control and management facilities.
      (2)   Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for
sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major
repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs.
         If structural BMPs are not performing adequately or as intended or are
not properly maintained, Greene County, in its sole discretion, may remedy the
situation, and in such instances Greene County shall be fully reimbursed from
the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment
removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and
reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that Greene County shall first
consent to the expenditure.
      (3)   Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the
escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits,
whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an
amount equal to 15% of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs.
Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into
the escrow account within the first five years and the full amount shall be
deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural
BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of
the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the
escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced
in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking
fund budget.
      (4)   The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund
the escrow account may be varied by Greene County depending on the design and
materials of the stormwater control and management facility.
      (5)   Granting to Greene County a right of entry to inspect, monitor,
maintain, repair, and reconstruct structural BMPs.
      (6)   Allowing Greene County to recover from the association and its
member's any and all costs Greene County expends to maintain or repair the
structural BMPs or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay all
of its expended costs, after 45 days written notice, shall constitute a breach
of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, Greene County shall thereafter be
entitled to bring an action against the association and its members to pay, or
foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement against the
property, or both. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees shall be added
to the recovery.

provisions of this section in order to reclaim an animal that has been
impounded pursuant to state law or this chapter.
(Ord. passed 1-21-20)
§ 90.63  DESTRUCTION OR ADOPTION OF UNREDEEMED ANIMALS GENERALLY.
   (A)   If an impounded animal is not redeemed by the owner within the period
prescribed in §
90.61, it may be destroyed in a humane matter or shall become the property of
the animal shelter and offered for adoption. A new adult owner who agrees to
comply with this chapter may acquire an impounded animal; however, any
prospective new owner shall not be an animal dealer who acquires animals for
resale. The prospective new owner must pay any required fees.  The county will
not purposefully release for adoption any animal that has previously bitten a
person, is aggressive or is potentially dangerous. Fees may be waived at the
discretion of the County Manager or designee for rescue groups and other animal
welfare groups that apply in writing to the section. The placement of animals
with these organizations will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
   (B)   All unsterilized dogs and cats five months of age or older adopted
from the Greene County Animal Shelter shall be either spayed or neutered within
30 days of their adoption. All animals adopted under five months of age shall
be spayed or neutered at six months of age. The adopter shall promptly provide
written proof of the sterilization to the Animal Control Section. The adoption
of any animal not sterilized pursuant to this section shall be deemed to
violate the provision of this section and must be returned by the applicant for
re-adoption to the Greene County Animal Shelter. The Animal Control Section is
authorized to obtain an adoption agreement from an applicant to implement the
provisions of this section.
   (C)   The adopter of any un-neutered dog or cat shall purchase a spay/neuter
certificate at the time of adoption. If the adopter chooses to use a
veterinarian for whom a certificate is not available, the animal shelter shall
require from the adopter a sterilization deposit fee established by the Board
of Commissioners to insure that sterilization is obtained in addition to the
established adoption fee if the animal has not been sterilized prior to its
being adopted.
   When written proof that a licensed veterinarian has performed the required
sterilization is returned to the Animal Control Section, a fee equal to the
sterilization portion of the deposit will be reimbursed to the adopter. A
person who fails within the specified time to arrange for the sterilization of
an unsterilized cat or dog adopted from the animal shelter forfeits the
sterilization deposit fee and shall surrender the cat or dog to the animal
shelter.
   (D)   No animal which has been impounded by reason of its being a stray and
unclaimed shall be allowed to be adopted from the animal shelter during a
period of emergency rabies quarantine invoked pursuant to § 90.65 except by
special authorization of the Health Director.
   (E)   Any animal that exhibits fierce, dangerous or aggressive behavior will
not be offered for adoption.
(Ord. passed 1-21-20)
§ 90.64  PROCEDURE WITH RESPECT TO REDEMPTION OR ADOPTION OF UNVACCINATED DOG
OR CAT.
   (A)   Unless proof of a current rabies vaccination can be furnished, every
person who either adopts or redeems a dog or cat at the animal shelter shall
have his animal vaccinated for rabies. A one-year vaccination may be obtained
at the time of reclaim or adoption at the Greene County Animal Shelter. For
puppies and kittens under four months, the County Manager or his designee will
determine the time limit according to their age within 72 hours of the
designated date.
   (B)   The "proof of rabies vaccination card" will be completed and returned
to the animal shelter by the veterinarian. If this card is not returned to the
animal shelter within the time limit specified on the card, an animal control
officer will be dispatched to retrieve the dog or cat.
   (C)   Payment for the rabies vaccination provided for in this section will
be the responsibility of the person redeeming or adopting the animal.
   (D)   he adoption agreement will be completed at the time of adoption. If
the adopter fails to comply with the agreement, an animal control officer may
be dispatched to retrieve the dog or cat if corrective action has not been
taken by the animal's owner.
(Ord. passed 1-21-20)
§ 90.65  SUSPECTED RABID ANIMALS NOT TO BE REDEEMED OR ADOPTED.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, animals impounded
which appear to be suffering from rabies shall not be redeemed or adopted, but
shall be dealt with in accordance with §§
90.35 through
90.44.
(Ord. passed 1-21-20)
§ 90.66  DESTRUCTION OF WOUNDED OR DISEASED ANIMALS.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, any animal
impounded, which is seriously wounded or diseased (not a rabies suspect) and
has no identification shall be destroyed immediately. If the animal has
identification, the Animal Control Section shall attempt to notify the owner
before disposing of such, but if the owner cannot be reached readily, and the
animal is suffering, the Animal Control Section may destroy the animal at its
discretion in a humane manner. The Animal Control Section has the authority to
humanely destroy severely injured livestock upon the owner's request or when
the owner is unknown.
(Ord. passed 1-21-20)
§ 90.67  IMMEDIATE PLACEMENT FOR ADOPTION OR DESTRUCTION OF ANIMAL SURRENDERED
BY OWNER.
   An animal surrendered by its owner to the Animal Control Section may be
immediately placed for adoption or humanely destroyed at the discretion of the
County Manager or designee or the designee without compliance with §
90.60 when the owner:
   (A)   Affirmatively represents in writing that he is the legal owner of said
animal;
   (B)   Agrees to hold the county and its officials and employees harmless
from any liability, claims, or damages that may be sustained by reason of the
adoption or destruction of said animal; and
   (C)   Transfers ownership of said animal to the Animal Control Section.
(Ord. passed 1-21-20)
§ 90.99  PENALTY.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided, any person who violates any provision of
this chapter, shall be fined a civil penalty of $200. A warning may be issued
for a first violation. If the violation is continued, each day's violation
shall constitute a separate offense. Payment of said penalties shall be made
within 30 days. Civil penalties may be assessed by citation and recovered by
Greene County in a civil action in the nature of a debt.
   (B)   If any dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog, when unprovoked,
attacks, assaults, wounds, bites or otherwise injures or kills a human, the
owner shall pay a $500 civil penalty and, after a ten day waiting period
exclusive of Sundays and holidays, said dog shall be destroyed by the Animal
Control Section. For owner's subsequent violation said owner shall pay a $1,500
civil penalty for owning or keeping a dangerous dog which attacks, assaults,
wounds, bites or otherwise injures or kills a human. Owners who have a
subsequent violation of this section will be banned from future ownership of
any dogs or canid.
   (C)   If any dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog shall, when
unprovoked, kills, wounds or assists in killing or wounding any domestic
animals or pets, the owner of the dog shall pay a $250 civil penalty. The
Animal Control Section shall confiscate and, after the expiration of a ten day
waiting period exclusive of Sundays and holidays, destroy said dangerous dog.
For each subsequent violation, said owner shall pay a civil penalty of $500.
   (D)   Violation of this chapter may subject the violator to criminal as well
as civil action. In addition to the civil penalties or fees imposed under this
chapter, violation of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor for which a criminal
summons may be issued. Each day's violation of this section is a separate
offense. Payment of a fine imposed in criminal proceedings pursuant to this
division does not relieve a person of his liability for taxes, civil penalties
or fees imposed under this chapter.
   (E)   In addition, enforcement of this chapter may be by appropriate
equitable remedy, injunction or order of abatement issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (F)   General penalties unless specified in this chapter, owners cited for

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 110.001  PURPOSE.
   (A)   The county finds that the development of cable television and
communications systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact
upon the people of the county.  Because of the complex and rapidly changing
technology associated with cable television, the county further finds that the
public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by
establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the county or such
persons as the county shall designate.  It is the intent of this chapter and
subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best
possible public interest and public purpose in these matters, and any franchise
issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an
integral part thereof.
   (B)   Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the
capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the
county's residents but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive
communications services to institutions and individuals.  Many of these
services involve county agencies and other public institutions by providing
governmental, educational, or health care communications.
   (C)   For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations
contained herein:
      (1)   Communications services should be provided to the maximum number of
county residents.
      (2)   The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and
reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the county.
      (3)   The system should be improved and upgraded during the franchise
term so that the new facilities necessary for the operation of this system
shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible with existing facilities.
      (4)   The communications system authorized by this chapter shall be
responsive to the needs and interests of the local community and shall provide
the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the
public.
      (5)   Each of the goals enumerated in divisions (C)(1) through (4) above
shall be sought taking into account the costs and benefits to the residents of
the county.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)

passage for the grant of any new franchise or renewal of any franchise existing
at the time of adoption.

GRANT OF FRANCHISE
§ 110.015  GRANT.
   (A)   Authorization.  In the event that county shall grant to the grantee a
nonexclusive, revocable for cause franchise to construct, operate, and maintain
a cable communications system within the county, said franchise shall
constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a cable
communications system as regulated by the provisions of this chapter and the
franchise.  The franchise shall include by reference those provisions of the
grantee's “application for franchise” that are finally negotiated and accepted
by the county and grantee.  By acceptance of the franchise, the grantee agrees
to abide by all regulations thereof, herein, and as may be amended from time to
time.
   (B)   Event of conflict.  The franchise shall be granted under the terms and
conditions contained herein consistent with and subject to all applicable
statutory requirements. In the event of conflict between the terms and
conditions of this chapter, the franchise, or the terms and conditions on which
the county can grant a franchise, statutory requirements shall control.
   (C)   Generally applicable ordinances.  Any franchise granted by the county
is hereby made subject to the general ordinance provisions now in effect and
hereafter made effective.  Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive

a cable communications system in the county, the grantee may erect, install,
construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon,
across, and along the public streets and ways within the county such wires,
cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
pedestals, attachments, and other property and equipment as are necessary to
the operation of the cable communications systems, provided, however, that
grantee complies with all design, construction, safety, and performance
provisions contained in this chapter, the franchise agreement, and other
applicable local ordinances.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.018  USE OF COUNTY FACILITIES.
   At the county's option, the county may require a grantee to utilize county-
owned conduit or other facilities for any portion of its cable communications
system.  The consideration for the use of county conduit or other facilities

owned, leased, or controlled facilities shall be established in the franchise
and may be adjusted at the periodic performance evaluations.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.019  USE OF GRANTEE FACILITIES.
   No poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the
county, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, with regard to location,
height, type, and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole
of the grantee shall be a vested right, and such poles shall be removed or
modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the county reasonably
determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby.  Grantee
shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible.  The county shall
have the right, during the life of the franchise, to install and maintain free
of charge upon the poles owned by the grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that
do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of the grantee.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.020  FRANCHISE REQUIRED.

of the county or be allowed to operate without a franchise.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.021  TERM OF FRANCHISE.
   The term of any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be stated
in the franchise.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.022  FRANCHISE NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The franchise discussed herein is nonexclusive.  The county specifically
reserves the right to grant at any time such additional franchises for a cable
communications system as it deems appropriate.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.023  TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE TO THIS AGREEMENT.
   Whenever the agreement shall set forth any time for an act to be performed
by or on behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence and
any failure of the grantee to perform within the time allotted shall always be
sufficient grounds for the county to invoke an appropriate penalty, including
possible revocation of the franchise.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.024  LAW GOVERNS.
   In any controversy or dispute under this chapter, the law of the state of
North Carolina shall apply and venue shall be in Greene County, North Carolina.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.025  SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
chapter or the franchise is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court of competent jurisdiction, or by any federal, state, or local statute
or regulation, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions thereof.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.026  TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (A)   Transfer of franchise.  Any franchise granted hereunder cannot in any
event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned, or disposed of, including but not
limited to by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership, or
other means without the prior consent of the county, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and then only under such conditions as the county may
establish from time to time, which shall include, at a minimum, a public
hearing and franchise application provided for in §
110.152.
   (B)   Transfer threshold.  The grantee shall promptly notify the county of
any actual or proposed change in or transfer of or acquisition by any other
party of control of the grantee.  CONTROL as used herein is not limited to
major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner
exercised.  A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred
shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, directly, or indirectly, by gift,
assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise of 15% or more,
at one time, of the ownership or controlling interest in the system, or 20%
cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interest to a corporation,
partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or person or group of
persons acting in concert.  The county shall exercise its power to approve a
transfer of ownership or control in a manner consistent with Section 617 of the
Communications Act (47 USC 537).
   (C)   Process.  Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the
grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the
county shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.  For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the county may inquire into the
legal, financial, character, technical, and other public interest
qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall
assist the county in any such inquiry.  Failure to provide all information
reasonably requested by the county as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for
denial of the proposed change, transfer, or acquisition of control.
   (D)   Assumption of control.  The county agrees that any financial
institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement
of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the
right to notify the county that it or its designee satisfactory to the county
will take control and operate the cable television system.  Further, said
financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will
insure continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations during
the term the financial institution exercises control over the system.  The
financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period
exceeding one year, unless extended by the county at its discretion, and during
said period of time it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the
franchise to another grantee.  In the event that the FCC adopts a definition as
to CONTROL which differs from the definition herein, the FCC definition shall
govern.  If the county finds that such transfer, after considering the legal,
financial, character, technical, and other public interest qualifications of
the applicant is satisfactory, the county will transfer and assign the rights
and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest.  The consent of
the county to such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   (E)   Regulation of transfer.  The consent or approval of the county to any
transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights
of the county in and to the streets, rights-of-way, or pertinent thereto, and
any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and
conditions of this chapter and the franchise.
   (F)   Construction requirement.  In the absence of extraordinary
circumstances, the county will not approve any transfer or assignment of the
franchise prior to completion of construction of the proposed system.
   (G)   Right to review purchase.  The county reserves the right to review the
purchase of any transfer or assignment of the cable system.  Any assignee to
this chapter or the franchise expressly agrees that any negotiated sale which
the county deems unreasonable may not be considered in the rate base by the
county for any subsequent request for rate increases, if applicable under
federal or state law.
   (H)   Signatory requirement.  Any approval by the county of transfer of
ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective controlling party
becoming a signatory to the franchise.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.027  FRANCHISE RENEWAL.
   The grantee shall own the cable communication system but shall have no right
to use of public rights- of-way upon the completion of the franchise term.  The
county shall grant or deny renewal of the franchise of a grantee in accordance
with Section 626 of the Communications Act (47 USC 546) or other applicable
law.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.028  POLICE POWERS.
   (A)   Acknowledgments.  In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges
that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the county to
adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the
public, and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances
enacted by the county pursuant to such power.
   (B)   Conflict.  Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter or the
franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the county's
general police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any
such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies
exclusively to grantee or cable communications systems which contains
provisions inconsistent with this chapter shall prevail only if, upon such
exercise, the county finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health,

§ 110.029  FRANCHISE FEES.
   (A)   Imposition.  Because the County finds that:
      (1)   The streets of the county and state to be used by the grantee in
the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise area are
valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the county and state at
great expense to its taxpayers; and
      (2)   The grant to the grantee of the said streets is a valuable property
right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital
in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and
      (3)   The administration of this chapter or the franchise imposes upon
the county additional regulatory responsibility and expense, grantee of any
franchise hereunder shall pay to the county a franchise fee in an amount as
designated in the franchise, but in no event less than 5% of the gross annual
revenues, or upon notification by the county, the maximum amount permitted
under applicable federal, state, or local law, if such maximum is greater than
5%.  This annual franchise payment shall be in addition to any other fee and
commence as of the effective date of the franchise.  The county shall be
furnished a statement of said payment by a Certified Public Accountant,
reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenues and computations for the
period covered by the payment.  The grantee shall provide an audited statement
to the county every three years from the date of the grant of franchise.
   (B)   Franchise fee in addition to other tax.  This payment shall be in
addition to any other tax or payment of general applicability owed by the
grantee to governments or other taxing jurisdiction.  Payment of the franchise
fee made by grantee to the county shall be in addition to any and all taxes of
general applicability which are now or may be required hereafter to be paid by
any federal, state, or local law.
   (C)   Acceptance by the county.  No acceptance of any payment by the county
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim
the county may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee
under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the
grantee.
   (D)   Failure to make required payment.  In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified
herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge,
computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime
interest rate of the county's primary depository bank during the period that
such unpaid amount is owed.
   (E)   Quarterly payments.  The franchise fee and any other costs, charges,
or damages assessed shall be payable quarterly to the county.  The grantee
shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenue
within the franchise area during the period for which said quarterly payment is
made, and said payment shall be made to the county not later than 45 days after
the expiration of each calendar quarter.  Quarterly computation dates are the
last day in the months of March, June, September and December.
   (F)   Audits.  The county shall have the right to inspect the grantee's
income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined
to be payable under this chapter.  Audits shall be at the expense of the
grantee if the additional amount due is greater than two percent (2%) of the
amount paid. Any additional amount due to the county as a result of the audit
shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the grantee by the
county, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
(Ord. passed 12-2-96)
§ 110.030  FORFEITURE OR REVOCATION.
   (A)   Grounds for revocation.  The county reserves the right to revoke any
franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated
with the franchise in accordance with the Communications Act and with the
procedures set forth herein in the following circumstances, each of which shall
represent a default and breach under this chapter and the franchise grant:

material obligations under this chapter or under such documents, contracts, and
other terms and provisions entered into by and between the county and the
grantee.

effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond as
required herein.

deceptive act or practice with regard to the county or cable subscribers under
the laws of this state.

county.
      (6)   The grantee becomes insolvent or unable or unwilling to pay its
debts or is adjudged bankrupt.
      (7)   Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
interrupted service, except when written approval of such interruption is
obtained from the county.
      (8)   Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or
negotiation of the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof.
      (9)   If the grantee ceases to provide services for any reason that is
within the control of the grantee over the cable communications system.

comply with a pole use agreement or other appropriate agreement with
appropriate agencies and/or any other necessary parties for usage of poles or
other appropriate facilities necessary to the satisfactory operation of the
cable television system.
   (B)   Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee.  The grantee shall
not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of
this chapter in any case in which performance of any such provision is
prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's control.  A fault shall not be
deemed to be beyond the grantee's control if committed by a corporation or
other business entity in which the grantee holds a controlling interest,
whether held directly or indirectly.
   (C)   Court order.  Grantor and grantee will abide by the terms of any stay
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   Procedure prior to revocation.
      (1)   The county shall make written demand that the grantee comply with
any such material requirement, limitation, term condition, rule, or regulation
or correct any action deemed cause for revocation.  If the failure, refusal, or
neglect of the grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such written
demands, the county shall place its request for termination of the franchise
upon a regular Commission meeting agenda.  The county shall cause to be served
upon such grantee at least ten days prior to the date of such Commission
meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination and the
reason therefor, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall
be published by the Clerk to the Board of Commissioners at least once, ten days

      (2)   The Commission shall hear any persons interested therein and shall
determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal, or neglect
by the grantee was with just cause.
      (3)   If such failure, refusal, or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, as reasonably defined by the county, the Commission shall direct the
grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and
conditions as are reasonable.
      (4)   If the Commission shall determine such failure, refusal, or neglect
by the grantee was without just cause, then the Commission shall, by
resolution, declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated and
bond forfeited unless there be compliance by the grantee within 90 days.
      (5)   Evidence admitted shall be in any reliable form so long as it is
relevant, material, and not unduly repetitious.

condition or better as that existing prior to the grantee's removal of its
equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical telephone cable,
wires, or attachments.  The owners shall inspect and approve the condition of
the public ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments, and poles
after removal.  The liability, indemnity, insurance, and performance bond as
provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of
removal and until grantee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of
this division, this chapter, and the franchise.
   (G)   Restoration by county; reimbursement of costs.  In the event of a
failure by the grantee to complete any work required by the county by
resolution, law, or ordinance within the time as may be established by the
county and to the satisfaction of the county, the county may cause such work to
be done and the grantee shall reimburse the county the cost thereof within 30
days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs, or the county may at its
option recover such costs through the performance bond provided by grantee. 
The county shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the
provisions of this section.
   (H)   Extended operation.  Upon either the expiration or revocation of a
franchise, the county may require the grantee to continue to operate the system
for a period of six months from the date of such expiration or revocation, or
until such time beyond six months as is mutually agreed upon.  The grantee
shall, as trustee for its successor in interest, continue to operate the cable
communications system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the
franchise and provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the
services that may be provided at the time.  The county shall be permitted to

with regard to cable communications.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary,

§ 150.52  ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   In accordance with G.S. § 160D-1125, whenever any violation is
denominated a misdemeanor under the provisions of this chapter, Greene County,
either in addition to or in lieu of other remedies, may initiate any
appropriate action or proceedings to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate the
violation or to prevent the occupancy of the building or structure involved.
   (B)   Removal of building. In the case of a building or structure declared
unsafe under G.S. § 160D-1119 or an ordinance adopted pursuant to G.S. § 160D-
1119, Greene County may, in lieu of taking action under division (A) of this
section, cause the building or structure to be removed or demolished. The
amounts incurred by Greene County in connection with the removal or demolition
are a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred. The lien
shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected in the same manner as
liens for special assessments provided in Article 10 of Chapter 160A of the
General Statutes. If the building or structure is removed or demolished by
Greene County, Greene County shall sell the usable materials of the building
and any personal property, fixtures, or appurtenances found in or attached to
the building. Greene County shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the
cost of the removal or demolition. Any balance remaining from the sale shall be
deposited with the clerk of superior court of the county where the property is
located and shall be disbursed by the court to the person found to be entitled
thereto by final order or decree of the court.
   (C)   Additional lien. The amounts incurred by Greene County in connection
with the removal or demolition are also a lien against any other real property
owned by the owner of the building or structure and located within Greene
County's planning and development regulation jurisdiction, and for cities
without extraterritorial planning and development jurisdiction, within one mile
of the city limits, except for the owner's primary residence. The provisions of
division (B) of this section apply to this additional lien, except that this
additional lien is inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a
money judgment.
   (D)   Nonexclusive remedy. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
impair or limit the power of Greene County to define and declare nuisances and
to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001  AUTHORITY.
   This chapter is adopted under the authority of Chapter 160D of the North
Carolina General Statutes.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.002  JURISDICTION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply throughout the county except in
areas subject to municipal planning and development regulation jurisdiction.
This chapter may be exercised within the planning and development regulation
jurisdiction of a municipality, upon adoption of a formal resolution by the
municipality's governing board requesting same and upon adoption of a formal
resolution of the Board of County Commissioners agreeing to such exercise. The
Board of County Commissioners reserves the right to decline, for any or no
reason, the exercise of this chapter within the planning and development
regulation jurisdiction of a municipality and further reserves the right to
revoke such exercise at any time upon adoption of a formal resolution to such
effect, provided that notice of such revocation shall be provided to the
relevant municipality upon two years' written notice.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.003  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Greene County
Subdivision Ordinance, and may be referred to as the Subdivision Ordinance.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.004  APPROVAL REQUIRED PRIOR TO SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   No subdivision within the county's planning and development regulation
jurisdiction shall be filed or recorded until it shall have been submitted to
and approved by the county as herein provided, and until  this approval shall
have been entered on the face of the plat in writing by an authorized
representative of the county. No person shall commence or proceed with a
subdivision of land without first securing approval under this chapter from the
county.
   (B)   The review officer, pursuant to G.S. § 47-30.2, shall not certify a
subdivision plat that has not been approved in accordance with this chapter nor
shall the clerk of superior court order or direct the recording of a plat if
the recording would be in conflict with this chapter.
   (C)   A plat shall be prepared, approved and recorded pursuant to this
chapter whenever a subdivision of land takes place.
   (D)   No street shall be recommended for acceptance for maintenance by the
state nor shall any building permit be issued for the construction of any
building or other improvement requiring a permit, upon any land concerning
which a plat is required to be approved, unless and until the requirements set
forth in this chapter have been met.
   (E)   Proposed subdivisions must comply in all respects with the
requirements of any other ordinances of the county.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.005  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to support and guide the proper subdivision
of land within the jurisdiction of the county in order to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of the citizens. This chapter is designed to
promote the orderly development of the county, the coordination of streets and
highways within proposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and
highways with other public facilities, the dedication or reservation of right-
of-way or easements for street and utility purposes, and the distribution of
population and traffic, in a manner that will avoid congestion and overcrowding
and which will create conditions essential to public health, safety, and
general welfare. This chapter is designed to facilitate adequate  provision of
water, sewage, parks, schools, and playgrounds, and to facilitate the further
resubdivision of large tracts into smaller parcels of land.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.006  CONFORMANCE WITH OFFICIAL PLANS.
   All subdivisions shall comply with the principles, regulations and
objectives of the Greene County Code of Ordinances, as amended from time to
time, the Greene County Comprehensive Plan and all other officially adopted
plans and policies of the county. Proposed subdivisions must also comply with
the land usage regulations of the county. It is not intended that this chapter
repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements,
covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations, or permits,
previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. Wherever the provisions of any
other law, ordinance, or regulation impose higher standards than are required
by the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of such law, ordinance or
regulation shall govern. However, where this chapter imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)

LEGAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.020  EFFECT OF PLAT APPROVAL ON DEDICATIONS.

the county or public of the dedication of any street or other ground, public

Commissioners may by resolution accept any dedication made to the public of
lands or facilities for streets, parks, public utility lines, or other public
purposes, when the lands or  facilities are located within the county's
planning and development regulation jurisdiction.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.021  ENFORCEMENT OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   Notices of violation. When the Subdivision Administrator determines
work or activity has been undertaken in violation of this chapter or any
approval issued hereunder, a written notice of violation may be issued. The
notice of violation shall be delivered to the holder of the approval and to the
landowner of the property involved, if the landowner is not the holder of the
approval, by personal delivery, electronic delivery, or first-class mail and
may be provided by similar means to the occupant of the property or the person
undertaking the work or activity. The notice of violation may be posted on the
property. The person providing the notice of violation shall certify to the
county that the notice was provided, and the certificate shall be deemed
conclusive in the absence of fraud. A notice of violation may be appealed to
the Planning Board, and the Planning Board shall follow quasi-judicial
processes as set forth in §
151.026.
   (B)   Stop work orders. Whenever any work or activity subject to regulation
pursuant to this chapter is undertaken in substantial violation of any state or
local law, or in a manner that endangers life or property, the Subdivision
Administrator may order the specific part of the work or activity that is in
violation or presents such a hazard to be immediately stopped. The order shall
be in writing, directed to the person doing the work or activity, and shall
state the specific work or activity to be stopped, the reasons therefor, and
the conditions under which the work or activity may be resumed. A copy of the
order shall be delivered to the holder of the subdivision approval and to the
owner of the property involved (if that person is not the holder of the
subdivision approval) by personal delivery, electronic delivery, or first-class
mail. The person or persons delivering the stop work order shall certify to the
county that the order was delivered, and that certificate shall be deemed
conclusive in the absence of fraud. A stop work order may be appealed to the
Planning Board, and the Planning Board shall follow quasi-judicial processes as
set forth in §
151.026. No further work or activity shall take place in violation of a stop
work order pending a ruling on the appeal. Violation of a stop work order shall
constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (C)   Remedies.
      (1)   This chapter may be enforced by any remedy provided by G.S. § 153A-
123. If a building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or
land is used or developed in violation of this chapter, the county, in addition
to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to
prevent the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair, conversion, maintenance, use, or development; to restrain, correct or
abate the violation; to prevent occupancy of the building, structure, or land;
or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about the
premises.
      (2)   In addition to the foregoing, any person who, being the owner or
agent of the owner of any land located within the planning and development
regulation jurisdiction of the county, thereafter subdivides the land in
violation of this chapter or transfers or sells land by reference to,
exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land
before the plat has been properly approved under this chapter and recorded in
the office of the Greene County Register of Deeds, is guilty of a Class 1
misdemeanor. The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer
or other document used in the process of selling or transferring land does not
exempt the transaction from this penalty.
      (3)   The county may bring an action for injunction of any illegal
subdivision, transfer, conveyance, or sale of land, and the court shall, upon
appropriate findings, issue an injunction and order requiring the offending
party to comply with the subdivision regulation. Building permits required
pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1110 may be denied for lots that have been illegally
subdivided. In addition to other remedies, the county may institute any
appropriate action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful subdivision of land,
to restrain, correct, or abate the violation, or to prevent any illegal act or
conduct.
   (D)   Revocation of subdivision approvals. Subdivision approvals given under
this chapter may be revoked by the county by notifying the holder in writing
stating the reason for the revocation. The county shall follow the same
subdivision review and approval process required for issuance of the
subdivision approval, including any required notice or hearing, in the review
and approval of any revocation of that approval. Subdivision approvals shall be
revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or
specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of any
applicable local development regulation or any state law delegated to the
county for enforcement purposes in lieu of the state; or for false statements
or misrepresentations made in securing the approval. Any development approval
mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be
revoked. The revocation of a subdivision approval by the Subdivision
Administrator may be appealed pursuant to §
151.027.
   (E)   Continuing violations. Each day's continuing violation of this chapter
shall be considered a separate and distinct offense.
   (F)   Inspections. The Subdivision Administrator and his/her staff may
inspect work undertaken pursuant to a development approval to assure that the
work is being done in accordance with applicable state and local laws and of
the terms of the approval. In exercising this power, staff are authorized to
enter any premises within the jurisdiction of the county at all reasonable
hours for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action, upon
presentation of proper credentials; provided, however, that the appropriate
consent has been given for inspection of areas not open to the public or that
an appropriate inspection warrant has been secured.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.022  PROCEDURE FOR VARIANCES AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict
letter of a requirement of this chapter, the Planning Board and the Board of
Commissioners shall vary the requirement of this chapter upon a showing of all
of the following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the requirement. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence
of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability.
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.

§ 151.026  QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Process required. The Planning Board and the Board of Commissioners
shall follow quasi-judicial procedures as directed in this chapter, and in any
event in determining appeals of administrative decisions and variances. As used
in this section "board" shall be construed to mean either the Planning Board or
the Board of Commissioners, as the context and procedural posture of the matter
may require.
   (B)   Notice of hearing. Notice of evidentiary hearings conducted pursuant
to this section shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal,
application, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the
property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the
hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that
is the subject of the hearing; and to any other persons entitled to receive
notice as provided by this chapter. In the absence of evidence to the contrary,
the county may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of property
entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least
ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within
that same time period, the county shall also prominently post a notice of the
hearing on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street
or highway right-of-way. The board may continue an evidentiary hearing that has
been convened without further advertisement. If an evidentiary hearing is set
for a given date and a quorum of the board is not then present, the hearing
shall be continued until the next regular meeting of the board without further
advertisement.
   (C)   Administrative materials. The Subdivision Administrator shall transmit
to the board all applications, reports, and written materials relevant to the
matter being considered. The administrative materials may be distributed to the
members of the board prior to the hearing if at the same time they are
distributed to the board a copy is also provided to the appellant or applicant
and to the landowner if that person is not the appellant or applicant. The
administrative materials shall become a part of the hearing record. The
administrative materials may be provided in written or electronic form.
Objections to inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials may be made
before or during the hearing. Rulings on unresolved objections shall be made by
the board at the hearing.
   (D)   Presentation of evidence. The applicant, the county, and any person
who would have standing to appeal the decision shall have the right to
participate as a party at the evidentiary hearing. Other witnesses may present
competent, material, and substantial evidence that is not repetitive as allowed
by the board.
   (E)   Objections. Objections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary
issues, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal or the
standing of a party, may be made to the board. The board chair shall rule on
any objections, and the chair's rulings may be appealed to the full board.
These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1402.
Objections based on jurisdictional issues may be raised for the first time on
judicial review.
   (F)   Appearance of official new issues. The official who made the decision
or the person currently occupying that position, if the decision maker is no
longer employed by the county, shall be present at the evidentiary hearing as a
witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in
a notice of appeal. If any party or the county would be unduly prejudiced by
the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the board
shall continue the hearing.
   (G)   Oaths. The chair of the board or any member acting as chair and the
clerk to the board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any
matter coming before the board. Any person who, while under oath during a
proceeding before the board determining a quasi-judicial matter, willfully
swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (H)   Subpoenas. The board making a quasi-judicial decision under this
section through the chair or, in the chair's absence, anyone acting as chair
may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request
issuance of a subpoena, the applicant, the county, and any person with standing
may make a written request to the chair explaining why it is necessary for
certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The chair shall issue requested
subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope,
and not oppressive. The chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a
subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the chair may be immediately
appealed to the full board. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena
issued pursuant to this division, the board or the party seeking the subpoena
may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order requiring that its
subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders
after notice to all proper parties.
   (I)   Voting. The concurring vote of four-fifths of the board shall be
necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to
decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the
nature of certiorari. For the purposes of this division, vacant positions on
the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial
matter under §
151.028 shall not be considered members of the board for calculation of the
requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the
place of such members.
   (J)   Decisions. The board shall determine contested facts and make its
decision within a reasonable time. When hearing an appeal, the board may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from
and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to
be made. The board shall have all the powers of the official who made the
decision. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent,
material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision
shall be reduced to writing, reflect the board's determination of contested
facts and their application to the applicable standards, and be approved by the
board and signed by the chair or other duly authorized member of the board. A
quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the
clerk to the board. The decision of the board shall be delivered within a
reasonable time by personal delivery, electronic mail, or first-class mail to
the applicant, landowner, and any person who has submitted a written request
for a copy prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person
required to provide notice shall certify to the county that proper notice has
been made, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of
fraud.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.027  APPEALS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
   (A)   Appeals. Appeals of decisions made by staff under this chapter shall
be made to the Planning Board. Appeals of decisions made by the Planning Board
under this chapter shall be made to the Board of Commissioners. Appeals shall
be heard by the relevant board using the quasi-judicial processes set forth
below.
   (B)   Standing. Any person who has standing or the county may appeal an
administrative decision. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with
the clerk to the relevant board. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds
for the appeal.
   (C)   Time to appeal. The owner or other party shall have 30 days from
receipt of the written notice
of the determination within which to file an appeal. Any other person with
standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or
constructive notice of the determination within which to file an appeal. In the
absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given by first-class mail shall be
deemed received on the third business day following deposit of the notice for
mailing with the United States Postal Service.
   (D)   Record of decision. The official who made the decision shall transmit
to the relevant board all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon
which the decision appealed from is taken. The official shall also provide a
copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is
the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
   (E)   Stays. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order
stays enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed
unless the official who made the decision certifies to the board after notice
of appeal has been filed that, because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or, because the violation
is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of
the development regulation. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be
stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If
enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the
official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board shall
meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a development
approval or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent
with the development regulation shall not stay the further review of an
application for development approvals to use such property; in these
situations, the appellant or county may request and the relevant board may
grant a stay of a final decision of development approval applications,
including building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.028  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   (A)   Board of County Commissioners. A County Commissioner shall not vote on

direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the
Commissioner.
   (B)   Planning Board. Members of the Planning Board shall not vote on any
advisory or legislative decision regarding a development regulation under this

   (C)   Administrative staff. No staff member shall make a final decision on
an administrative decision regarding a development regulation under this
chapter if the outcome of that decision would have a direct, substantial, and
readily identifiable financial impact on the staff member or if the applicant
or other person subject to that decision is a person with whom the staff member
has a close familial, business, or other associational relationship. If a staff
member has a conflict of interest under this section, the decision shall be
assigned to the supervisor of the staff person or to such other staff person as

that is inconsistent with his or her duties or with the interest of the county,
as determined by the county.
   (E)   Quasi-judicial decisions. When the Board of Commissioners or Planning
Board is exercising quasi-judicial functions pursuant to this chapter, Board
members shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter in a
manner that would violate affected persons' constitutional rights to an
impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations of due process include, but

to change;
      (2)   Undisclosed ex parte communications;

participation at or prior to the hearing or vote on a particular matter and
that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members of the
Board shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
   (G)   Familial relationship. For purposes of this section, a "close familial
relationship" means a spouse, parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, or
grandchild. The term includes the step, half, and in-law relationships.

approved preliminary plat, the applicant may submit a final plat for approval.
All improvements must adhere to the standards and specifications outlined in §§
151.065 and
151.066. If a final plat of a subdivision is not submitted within one year of
the date of the preliminary plat approval, the preliminary plat approval shall
expire if the work authorized by the preliminary plat approval has not been
substantially commenced. However, the Planning Board may grant in writing an
extension of that time limit for all or any part of the subdivision if
requested to do so prior to the expiration of the one-year period. On
application for final plat processing, the subdivider shall pay the subdivision
processing fee to the Subdivision Administrator. The subdivider shall submit
eight copies of the final plat to the Subdivision Administrator, who shall
review the plat for compliance with the preliminary plat and this chapter. The
Subdivision Administrator shall then transmit the final plat to the Planning
Board with his or her recommendations.

   (B)   Final plat review. The Planning Board shall review the final plat for
compliance with the preliminary plat and that all improvements meet the
standards and specifications of §§
151.065 and
151.066. The Planning Board may appoint an engineer or registered land surveyor
to check the final plat against the subdivision's actual layout for
correctness, charging the costs to the subdivider if the plat is found to be in
error. The Planning Board shall approve, approve conditionally upon
modifications to bring the plat into compliance, or disapprove of the final
plat within 60 days of the receipt of the final plat by the Subdivision
Administrator. If no recommendation is made by the Planning Board within 60
days, the subdivider may apply directly to the Board of Commissioners for
approval.
      (1)   Approval. If the Planning Board approves of the final plat, such
approval shall be entered on the face of the plat in writing by an authorized
representative of the county. The Planning Board shall retain one copy of the
proposed plat and one copy of its approval for recording in its minutes.
      (2)   Approval with conditions. If the Planning Board approves of the
final plat on the condition that modifications be made prior to the final plat
approval, such approval shall be entered on the face of the plat in writing by
an authorized representative of the county. The Planning Board shall retain one
copy of the plat for its minutes, return to the subdivider one copy of the plat
and its written recommendation.
      (3)   Disapproval. If the Planning Board disapproves of the final plat,
it shall return to the subdivider one copy of the plat and its written reasons
for disapproval and shall retain one copy of each for its minutes. It shall
also instruct the subdivider concerning resubmission of a revised plat. The
subdivider may then make such changes as will bring the plat into compliance,
re-submit the revised plat for reconsideration by the Planning Board, or the
subdivider may appeal the decision to the Board of Commissioners. If the
subdivider decides to re-submit the final plat with changes that revised plat
shall be treated as an original final plat submission. If the subdivider
decides to appeal the decision to the Board of Commissioners, the subdivider
shall follow, and the appeal shall be governed by, the provisions of §
151.027.
      (4)   If the subdivider appeals a recommendation of disapproval, the

recommendation. In its consideration of such appeal, the Board of Commissioners
shall use quasi-judicial procedures as set forth in §
151.026.
         (a)   Approval. If the Board of Commissioners approves the final plat,
such approval shall be entered on the face of the plat in writing by an
authorized representative of the county as provided in the Appendix (1.10.2) at
the end of this chapter. The subdivider shall receive the original signed plat
and one copy. The Board of Commissioners shall retain one copy for its records
and one copy shall be remitted to the Planning Board for its records.
         (b)   Disapproval. If the Board of Commissioners disapproves the final
plat, the reasons for such disapproval shall be stated in writing, specifying
the provisions of this chapter with which the final plat does not comply. One
copy of the written reasons for disapproval and two copies of the plat shall be
returned to subdivider. One copy of the plat and written reasons shall be kept
by the Board of Commissioners for its records and one copy of the plat and
reasons shall be remitted to the Planning Board for its records. An appeal of a
disapproval made by the Board of Commissioners hereunder may be appealed
pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1403.
         (c)   Resubmission. Upon disapproval of a final plat, the Board of
Commissioners may allow resubmission of the final plat upon correction of
errors resulting in the initial disapproval. In that event, the Board of
Commissioners may require that the plat be treated as if it were an initial
submission, or it may allow deletion of some steps in the final plat review
process. The Board's determination of the proper procedure for each
resubmission shall be made at the time of disapproval.

§ 151.079  GUARANTEES OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Final plats of a subdivision shall be approved by the Planning Board
after the subdivider has installed all required improvements in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter or provided a performance guarantee in
accordance with division (B) of this section.
   (B)   Performance guarantees. Final plats of a subdivision shall be approved
by the Planning Department upon posting of a performance guarantee to assure
successful completion of required improvements. For purposes of this section,
all of the following apply with respect to performance guarantees:
      (1)   Type. The type of performance guarantee shall be at the election of
the developer. The term "performance guarantee" means any of the following
forms of guarantee:
         (a)   Surety bond issued by any company authorized to do business in
this state.
         (b)   Letter of credit issued by any financial institution licensed to
do business in this state.
         (c)   Other form of guarantee that provides equivalent security to a
surety bond or letter of credit.
      (2)   Duration. The duration of the performance guarantee shall initially
be one year,
unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the required
improvements necessitates a longer duration. In the case of a bonded
obligation, the completion date shall be set one year from the date the bond is
issued, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the required
improvements necessitates a longer duration.
      (3)   Extension. A developer shall demonstrate reasonable, good-faith
progress toward completion of the required improvements that are secured by the
performance guarantee or any extension. If the improvements are not completed
to the specifications of the county, and the current performance guarantee is
likely to expire prior to completion of the required improvements, the
performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance guarantee issued,
for an additional period. An extension under this subdivision shall only be for
a duration necessary to complete the required improvements. If a new
performance guarantee is issued, the amount shall be determined by the
procedure provided in division (B)(5) of this section and shall include the
total cost of all incomplete improvements.
      (4)   Release. The performance guarantee shall be returned or released,
as appropriate, in a timely manner upon the acknowledgment by the county that
the improvements for which the performance guarantee is being required are
complete. The county shall return letters of credit or escrowed funds upon
completion of the required improvements to its specifications or upon
acceptance of the required improvements, if the required improvements are
subject to county acceptance. When required improvements that are secured by a
bond are completed to the specifications of the county, or are accepted by the
county, if subject to its acceptance, upon request by the developer, the county
shall timely provide written acknowledgment that the required improvements have
been completed.
      (5)   Amount. The amount of the performance guarantee shall not exceed
125% of the reasonably estimated cost of completion at the time the performance
guarantee is issued. The county may determine the amount of the performance
guarantee or use a cost estimate determined by the developer. The reasonably
estimated cost of completion shall include 100% of the costs for labor and
materials necessary for completion of the required improvements. Where
applicable, the costs shall be based on unit pricing. The additional 25%
allowed under this subdivision includes inflation and all costs of
administration regardless of how such fees or charges are denominated. The
amount of any extension of any performance guarantee shall be determined
according to the procedures for determining the initial guarantee and shall not
exceed 125% of the reasonably estimated cost of completion of the remaining
incomplete improvements still outstanding at the time the extension is
obtained.
      (6)   Timing. A performance guarantee required under this section shall
be posted at the time the plat is recorded.
      (7)   Coverage. The performance guarantee shall only be used for
completion of the required improvements and not for repairs or maintenance
after completion.
      (8)   Legal responsibilities. No person shall have or may claim any
rights under or to any performance guarantee provided pursuant to this division
or in the proceeds of any such performance guarantee other than the following:
         (a)   The county.
         (b)   The developer at whose request or for whose benefit the
performance guarantee is given.
         (c)   The person or entity issuing or providing the performance
guarantee at the request of or for the benefit of the developer.
      (9)   Multiple guarantees. The developer shall have the option to post
one type of a performance guarantee as provided for in division (B)(1) of this
section, in lieu of multiple bonds, letters of credit, or other equivalent
security, for all development matters related to the same project requiring
performance guarantees.
      (10)   Performance guarantees associated with erosion control and storm
water control measures are not subject to the provision of this section.
   (C)   Certificate of dedication and maintenance. The certificate of
dedication and maintenance shall be submitted with the final plat and forwarded
to the Register of Deeds to be recorded with the approved final plat; it shall
stipulate the following:
      (1)   That all property and improvements are owned by the subdivider and
free of any encumbrance or lien except as enumerated.
      (2)   That the subdivider has freely dedicated or reserved all required
right-of-way easements, streets, utilities, open spaces, or other improvements
to public or private use as required by the approved preliminary plat and has
established minimum building setback lines.
      (3)   That the subdivider shall be responsible for the maintenance of all
improvements until the improvements are taken over by the appropriate public
agency, home/property owner's association, or arrangements satisfactory to the
Planning Board have been made for maintenance of such improvements.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.080  STREET REQUIREMENTS.
   Except as listed below, all streets must be constructed in accordance with
the North Carolina Department of Transportation requirements for public
streets.
   (A)   Cul-de-sacs. Every permanent dead-end street shall be developed as a
cul-de-sac and shall not exceed 1,500 feet in length, except where the shape of
the tract of land being developed makes this requirement impractical. The
length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured from the centerline of the nearest
intersecting through street to the center of the turnaround. All North Carolina
Department of Transportation design options for cul-de-sacs are allowed within
subdivisions.
   (B)   Temporary turnarounds. In cases where streets are proposed to be
extended, the Planning Board may permit a temporary turnaround for a period not
to exceed two years. Such turnarounds must be designed as a cul-de-sac bulb and
constructed to North Carolina Department of Transportation base standards, but
not necessarily paved.
   (C)   Street offsets. Whenever possible, proposed intersections on one side
of a street, or road, or highway shall coincide with existing or proposed
intersections on the opposite side of such street, road, or highway. In any
event, however, street offsets, as measured between the center lines of
intersecting streets, shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Street offsets within developments shall be at least 125 feet
apart.
      (2)   Street offsets created by streets intersecting with primary
highways or secondary roads shall be at least 250 feet apart.
   (D)   Homeowners’ association. When a homeowners’ association is established
to provide for the maintenance of private subdivision streets, it shall be
incorporated in accordance with Chapter 55 of the North Carolina General
Statutes. As required, appropriate bylaws shall be prepared, and proposed
covenants or deed restrictions which address maintenance, apportionment of
financial responsibility, and enforcement shall be provided. The County
Attorney shall approve the adequacy of these materials prior to final plat
review. These materials shall be recorded at the same time as the final plat
and shall be appropriately cross-referenced in the Greene County Register of
Deeds Office.
   (E)   Subdivision street disclosure statement. The streets shown on the
preliminary and final plats shall be designated in accordance with G.S. § 136-
102.6 and designation as public on the final plat shall be conclusively
presumed an offer of dedication to the public. Where streets are dedicated to
the public but not accepted into a municipal or state system, before lots are
sold, a statement explaining the status of the street shall be included with
the final plat.
      (1)   Pursuant to §
151.020, the approval of a plat does not constitute or effect the acceptance by
the county, any other governmental entity or the public of the dedication of
any street or other ground, public utility line, or other public facility shown
on the plat, and shall not be construed to do so. If dedication to the county,
the public or any other governmental entity is intended, the subdivider must
include a statement identifying the party responsible for maintaining the
required streets, grounds, utilities, or facilities until such time as the
offer of dedication is accepted by the appropriate public entity.
   (F)   Restrictive covenants. Restrictive covenants shall be recorded along
with the deed of each lot fronting on a subdivision road. The covenants shall
embody the restrictions in this chapter in reference to roads serving
subdivisions. The restrictive covenants dealing with the road shall be approved
by the Planning Board and the County Attorney and shall be a condition upon
which approval of a final plat will be based.
   (G)   Street names and street signs. Street names for all subdivision plats
shall be subject to approval of the Planning Board. New street names shall not
duplicate or be similar to existing street names and existing street names
shall be projected wherever possible. It shall be the responsibility of the
developer to install street signs at the intersection of streets within his or

   (H)   Access roads. Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins a federal
or state highway, the subdivider may be required to provide a marginal access
street parallel to the highway or reverse frontage on an interior street for
the lots to be developed adjacent to the highway. If reverse frontage is
required, then the subdivider shall be required to create a ten-foot buffer
strip parallel and adjacent to the right-of-way of the highway as a part of
those lots whose rear yards are adjacent to the highway. The buffer strip shall
be conveyed in the deeds to the affected lots and shall be restricted to the
planting of trees or shrubs for screening purposes by the lot
owners. This buffer strip shall be in addition to all other setbacks or
easements required by this section.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 151.081  LOTS, BUILDING SETBACKS, BLOCKS, AND BUFFER STRIPS.
   (A)   Lots. Lot sizes, shapes and locations shall be made with due regard to
topographic conditions, contemplated use, and the surrounding area. Land
subject to flooding and land deemed by the Board of Commissioners to be
uninhabitable for other reasons shall not be platted for residential occupancy,
nor for such other uses as may increase danger to health, life, or property, or
aggravate the flood hazard; but such land may be set aside for such uses as
will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation, or will not
produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
      (1)   Public or private lot frontage. Each lot with sanitary sewer must
have a minimum road or street frontage of 80 feet and a minimum width of 60
feet at the building setback line. Each lot with septic tank sewer must have a
minimum road or street frontage of 100 feet and a minimum width of 80 feet at
the building setback line. Additional frontage or width may be required
pursuant to the county's zoning ordinance. Road frontage requirements may be
waived by the Planning Board if the proposed lots are accessed by permanent
private easements. See division (A)(8) of this section.
      (2)   Lot sizes in subdivisions shall comply with the requirements of the
Greene County Health Department.
      (3)   Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra width of 15
feet to permit adequate building setback from side streets.
      (4)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided, except
where required to separate residential development from through traffic.
      (5)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines except at the end of cul de sacs.
      (6)   Access. Except as provided in division (A)(8) of this section, each
lot shall have access to a public or private street. No lot shall be created
that blocks access to any other lot. This applies to both platted and
functional access (i.e., the lot has platted road access but uses an easement
instead of the platted access).
      (7)   Lot size and width. Except in the case of a major subdivision,
pending approval of the Greene County Planning Board and Board of
Commissioners, each lot shall meet the minimum area and lot width requirements
outlined in the table below. Notwithstanding these standards, the subdivider
shall provide sufficient area on each lot to ensure that all other requirements
of this section or other applicable development regulations can be met. Lot
width shall be measured at the property line. Flag lots shall provide
sufficient width at the right-of-way line so that driveways can be at least ten
feet from any lot boundary line, but in no case be less than 40 feet in width.
Lot width for lots on the bulb of a cul-de-sac may be reduced to 50 feet, as
measured along the right-of-way.
      (8)   Permanent private easements. The Planning Board may allow the
subdivision of lots whose only means of access to a public or private street is
a permanent private easement subject to the following limitations:
         (a)   They shall in no case be less than 30 feet in width.
         (b)   Any permanent private easement that serves more than one lot
shall be at least 50 feet in width.
         (c)   Multiple permanent private easements may not run side by side.
         (d)   Easements shall only be considered in subdivisions containing
four or fewer residential lots, provided that one of the four lots must have
access to a public or private road and must use said access rather than the
easement
         (e)   No commercial or industrial use may be accessed solely by a
permanent private easement.

(Ord. passed 8-4-03)
§ 152.027  ISSUANCE OF CONSTRUCTION PERMIT.
   Upon approval of the Park Plan by the Planning Board or by the full Board of
Commissioners, the enforcement officer shall issue to the developer a
construction permit, allowing the developer to make those improvements shown on
the approved Park Plan. The construction permit shall expire one year from its
date of issue unless it is extended as set out in §
152.040.
(Ord. passed 8-4-03)
PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING
AN OPERATING PERMIT
§ 152.040  OPERATING PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Before a developer may offer spaces for rent or lease, or otherwise operate
a manufactured home park, he or she must make application for and receive a
manufactured home park operating permit. The application for an operating
permit must be submitted within 12 months after the issuance of a construction
permit, unless the developer goes before the Greene County Planning Board and
receives an extension of time prior to the expiration of the 12 months of the
issuance of the construction permit and the developer does not receive an
extension of time prior to the expiration of the 12-month period, the developer
must resubmit the Park Plan to the Planning Board for approval. The developer
must comply with the ordinance then in effect. Having received prior approval
gives the developer no vested rights under the re-submission.
(Ord. passed 8-4-03)
§ 152.041  SUBMISSION OF CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION.
   To obtain an operating permit, the owner or operator must submit a
certificate of completion, supplied by the Greene County Planning Board. The
certificate of completion must be signed by a professional engineer or land
surveyor.
(Ord. passed 8-4-03)
§ 152.042  ON-SITE INSPECTION.
   Prior to issuing the operating permit, the enforcement officer shall make an
on-site inspection in order to detect any discrepancies between the actual
improvements and the manufactured home park plan.  The enforcement officer may
request assistance in making the on-site inspection from the county Health
Department, District Highway Engineer, Building Inspector, or other
professional, when he or she cannot make a clear determination of compliance
based on the certificate of completion and his or her own examination.
(Ord. passed 8-4-03)
§ 152.043  ISSUANCE OF THE OPERATING PERMIT.
   (A)   If the enforcement officer finds that the manufactured home park has
been constructed in substantial compliance with the approved manufactured home
park plan, the enforcement officer shall issue an operating permit, which
constitutes authorization to lease or rent spaces in the manufactured home
park.
   (B)   If the enforcement officer finds that the manufactured home park has
not been constructed according to the previously approved park plan, he or she
shall notify the developer in writing that an operating permit cannot be
issued, stating the reasons therefor.
(Ord. passed 8-4-03)
§ 152.044  DEVELOPER’S RESPONSE TO DENIAL OF OPERATING PERMIT.
   In the circumstances where the enforcement officer cannot issue an operating
permit, the developer may either:
   (A)   Withdraw his or her application and certificate of completion with the
option to submit revised documents within the next 60 calendar days, or before
the original 12-month period for submitting the application for an operating
permit has expired, whichever is later; or
   (B)   Appeal the decision of the enforcement officer to the Board of
Commissioners by filing a written notice of appeal with the enforcement officer
within five working days after the decision of the enforcement officer. The
enforcement officer shall place the hearing of the appeal on the agenda of the
next regularly scheduled Board of County Commissioner’s meeting taking place
more than ten continuous days after the receipt of the notice of appeal by the
enforcement officer.
(Ord. passed 8-4-03)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization.
      (1)   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. Ch.
143,  Art. 21, Part 6; G.S. Ch. 153A, Art. 6; and G.S.  Ch. 160A, Art. 8; and
G.S. Ch. 160D, Art. 7, 9, and 11, delegated to local governmental units the
authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare.
      (2)   Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Greene County, North
Carolina, does ordain as follows.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Greene County are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood prone areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development which
may increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (D)   Objectives.  The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a special flood hazard.

Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths determined to be from one to
three feet. These areas are located where a clearly defined channel does not
exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where
velocity flow may be evident.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.  See SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).
   BASE FLOOD.  The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).  A determination as published in the Flood
Insurance Study of the water surface elevations of the base flood.

   (L)   When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is provided but no floodway nor
non-encroachment area data has been provided in accordance with §
153.04, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any floodway data, and/or non-
encroachment area data available from a federal, state, or other source in
order to administer the provisions of this chapter;
   (M)   When the exact location of boundaries of the special flood hazard
areas conflict with the current, natural topography information at the site,
the property owner may apply and be approved for a Letter of Map Amendment
(LOMA) by FEMA. A copy of the Letter of Map Amendment issued from FEMA will be
maintained by the Floodplain Administrator in the Floodplain Development Permit
file;
   (N)   Permanently maintain all records that pertain to the administration of
this chapter and make these records available for public inspection;
   (O)   Make on-site inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to
a Floodplain Development Permit progresses, the Floodplain Administrator shall
make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the
work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the
terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the Floodplain Administrator has
a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises
within the jurisdiction of the community at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action;
   (P)   Issue stop-work orders as required. Whenever a building or part
thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation
of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator may order the work to be
immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to
the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to
be stopped, the specific reason(s) for the stoppage, and the condition(s) under
which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a
misdemeanor;
   (Q)   Revocation of Floodplain Development Permits as required. The
Floodplain Administrator may revoke and require the return of the Floodplain
Development Permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason
(s) for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure
from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure
to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements
or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any Floodplain Development
Permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may
also be revoked;
   (R)   Make periodic inspections throughout all special flood hazard areas
within the jurisdiction of the community. The Floodplain Administrator and each
member of his or her inspections department shall have a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action; and
   (S)   Follow through with corrective procedures of §
153.28.
(Ord. passed 12-1-03)
§ 153.28  CORRECTIVE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Violations to be corrected.  When the Floodplain Administrator finds
violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his or her duty to
notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law pertaining to
his or her property.
   (B)   Actions in event of failure to take corrective action.  If the owner
of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
Floodplain Administrator shall give the owner written notice, by certified or
registered mail to the owner’s last known address or by personal service,
stating:
      (1)   That the building or property is in violation of the Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance;
      (2)   A hearing will be held before the Floodplain Administrator at a
designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the
notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by
counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
      (3)   Following the hearing, the Floodplain Administrator may issue such
order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears
appropriate.
   (C)   Order to take corrective action.  If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of the Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance, he or she shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the
owner to remedy the violation within a specified time period, not less than 60
days. Where the Floodplain Administrator finds that there is imminent danger to
life or other property, he or she may order that corrective action be taken in
such lesser period as may be feasible.
   (D)   Appeal.  Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice of
appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the Clerk within ten days
following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order
of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall
hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or
revoke the order.
   (E)   Failure to comply with order.  If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal
has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body
following an appeal, he or she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
punished in the discretion of the court.

variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (G)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or non-
encroachment area if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (H)   Conditions for variances:
      (1)   Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced reference level elevation. Such notification shall
be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
      (5)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the State of North Carolina upon request.

   (H)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure
which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the
requirements of “new construction” as contained in this chapter.
   (I)   Non-conforming structures or other development may not be enlarged,
replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished
in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Provided, however, nothing
in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of a
building or structure existing on the effective date of this chapter and
located totally or partially within the floodway, non-encroachment area, or
stream setback, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below the

flood hazard area only if the structure or tank is either elevated or flood-
proofed to at least the regulatory flood protection elevation and certified
according to §
153.26(C) of this code. This section is not subject to the variance procedures
outlined in §§
153.25 through
153.29.
(Ord. passed 12-1-03)
§ 153.46  SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in §
153.04 or §
153.27(K) and (L), the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction.  New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
   (B)   Non-residential construction.  New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation. Structures located in A, AO, AE and A1-
30 zones may be flood-proofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in
lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required
flood protection elevation are water-tight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards
of this section are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the
official as set forth in §
153.26(C).
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New or replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the
reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement in
accordance with the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured/Mobile
Homes, 1995 Edition, and any revision thereto adopted by the Commissioner of
Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15 or a certified engineered foundation.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength.
When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering
certification is required.
      (3)   All foundation enclosures or skirting shall be in accordance with
division (D) below.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings.  New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are below the
regulatory flood protection elevation shall not be designed to be used for
human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of
vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in
connection with the premises, be constructed entirely of flood resistant
materials below the regulatory flood protection level in A, AO, AE, and A1-30
Zones and meet the following design criteria:
      (1)   Measures for complying with this requirement shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood waters. To meet this requirement, the
foundation must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
meet the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings must be at least one square
inch for each square foot of each enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area must
have openings on exterior walls to allow flood water to directly enter;
         (d)   The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one
foot above the adjacent grade;
         (e)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other opening
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Foundation enclosures:
            1.   Vinyl or sheet metal skirting is not considered an enclosure
for regulatory and flood insurance rating purposes. Therefore such skirting
does not require hydrostatic openings as outlined above; and
            2.   Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status,
is considered an enclosure and requires hydrostatic openings as outlined above
to comply with this chapter.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such
enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except
to enclose storage areas.
   (E)     Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures whereas the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure:
         (a)   Are not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more non-conforming than the existing structure; and
         (b)   Are a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure shall require only the addition to comply with the standards
for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures whereas the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure:
         (a)   Are not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; and
         (b)   Are a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Where a fire wall or independent perimeter load-bearing wall is
provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall
be considered a separate building and only the addition must comply with the
standards for new construction.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles.  Recreation vehicles placed on sites within a
special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on-site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and has no permanently attached additions); or
      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring
and elevation requirements of §§
153.26 and
153.45, and division (C) above.

shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(Ord. passed 12-1-03)
§ 153.49  STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITH BFE BUT WITHOUT ESTABLISHED FLOODWAYS
OR NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   Along rivers and streams where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is provided
but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are identified for a special
flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, shall be
permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community.
(Ord. passed 12-1-03)
§ 153.50  FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
153.04 are areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas.
   (B)   The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles.
   (C)   The following provisions shall apply to all development within such
areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator prior to issuance of Floodplain Development Permit.
      (2)   If division (C)(1) above is satisfied, all development shall comply

§ 153.51  STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO ZONES).
   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
153.04, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas.
   (B)   These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood
depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and
where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate.
   (C)   The following provisions shall apply within such areas:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of all structures
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above the highest
adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated at least to the regulatory flood protection
elevation as defined for the special flood hazard areas where no BFE has been
established.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall have the option to, in lieu of elevation, be
completely flood-proofed together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities to or above that level so that any space below that level is water-
tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as per §§
153.26(C) and
153.46(B).
(Ord. passed 12-1-03)
§ 153.52  CRITICAL FACILITIES.
   New construction or substantial improvement of any critical facility is
prohibited in all areas of special flood hazard and in all 500-year flood
plains, unless all of the following provisions are met.
   (A)   No feasible alternative site exists for construction of an equivalent
facility within the jurisdiction boundaries of Greene County.
   (B)   The facility has the lowest floor, including basement, of all

Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure,
openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall
be provided. Structures may be flood-proofed to the flood protection level in
lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required
elevation are water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this
section are satisfied. If the 500-year flood plain is not identified on the
FIRM and the facility is located within 1,000 feet of the boundary of an area
of special flood hazard where no base flood data is provided, certification
with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer shall be
provided that the facility is elevated or flood-proofed no lower than one foot
above the 500-year flood elevation, unless it is certified that the facility
located outside the 500-year flood plain.
   (C)   The facility has at least one access road connected to land outside
the 500-year flood plain that is capable of supporting a 4,000-pound vehicle.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Greene County Zoning
Code" and may be referred to hereinafter as the "Code".
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.002  AUTHORITY.
   This chapter is adopted under the authority of Chapter 160D of the North
Carolina General Statutes.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.003  PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of Greene County. The intent of this chapter is
more specifically to:
      (1)   To preserve and improve the character of development in the county;
      (2)   Ensure the viability of agricultural uses by protecting them from
encroachment by incompatible land uses;
      (3)   Maintain and guide the growth of economically vibrant and
attractive commercial areas;
      (4)   Protect the character and quality of established residential areas;
      (5)   Promote economic development and expand the range of employment
opportunities for the citizens of Greene County;
      (6)   Protect life and property from harm by regulating development;
      (7)   Provide for a wide range of housing opportunities for the citizens
of Greene County;
      (8)   Ensure that adequate infrastructure is constructed to support
future development; and
      (9)   Coordinate land use and development decisions with transportation
improvements to reduce congestion and ensure the safety of the roads in Greene
County.
   (B)   The zoning regulations in this chapter have been made with reasonable
consideration, among other things, as to the character of Greene County's
jurisdiction and the suitability for particular uses, and with a view of
conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of
land throughout the jurisdiction.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.004  APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   General applicability.
      (1)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the use and
development of all land within the unincorporated area of Greene County, North
Carolina unless such use or development is expressly exempted by a specific
section of this chapter, or by state or federal law. No person shall commence
or proceed with development without first securing approval from the county as
herein provided. As defined in G.S. § 160D-102(12), "development" means any of
the following:
         (a)   The construction, erection, alteration, enlargement, renovation,
substantial repair, movement to another site, or demolition of any structure.
         (b)   The excavation, grading, filling, clearing, or alteration of
land.
         (c)   The subdivision of land as defined in G.S. § 160D-802.
         (d)   The initiation or substantial change in the use of land or the
intensity of use of land.
      (2)   A development approval shall be in writing and may contain a
provision requiring the development to comply with all applicable state and
local laws. A local government may issue development approvals in print or
electronic form. Any development approval issued exclusively in electronic form
shall be protected from further editing once issued. Applications for
development approvals may be made by the landowner, a lessee or person holding
an option or contract to purchase or lease land, or an authorized agent of the
landowner. An easement holder may also apply for development approval for such
development as is authorized by the easement.
      (3)   An approval made pursuant to this chapter attaches to and runs with
the land.
      (4)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply throughout the county
except in areas subject to municipal planning and development regulation
jurisdiction. This chapter may be exercised within the planning and development
regulation jurisdiction of a municipality, upon adoption of a formal resolution
by the municipality's governing board requesting same and upon adoption of a
formal resolution of the Board of County Commissioners agreeing to such
exercise. The Board of County Commissioners reserves the right to decline, for
any or no reason, the exercise of any section of this chapter within the
planning and development regulation jurisdiction of a municipality and further
reserves the right to revoke such exercise at any time upon adoption of a
formal resolution to such effect, provided that notice of such revocation shall
be provided to the relevant municipality upon two years' written notice.
   (B)   Bona fide farm exemption. The provisions of this chapter shall not
affect property used for bona fide farm purposes; provided, however, that this
chapter shall apply to the use of farm property for nonfarm purposes. The
provisions of G.S. § 160D-903 shall control whether the use of property is for
"bona fide farm purposes," and the provisions of such section are incorporated
herein by reference as if set forth herein verbatim.
   (C)   Density credits or severable development rights. Density credits or
severable development rights for dedicated rights-of-way shall be provided to a
developer pursuant to G.S. § 136-66.10 or 136-66.11. The county reserves the
right to determine whether density credits or severable development rights
shall be provided in any particular case.

   (A)   Process required. The Board of Adjustment or Planning Board (if duties
are delegated to same by the Board of Commissioners) shall follow quasi-
judicial procedures as directed in this chapter, and in any event in
determining appeals of administrative decisions and variances.
   (B)   Notice of hearing. Notice of evidentiary hearings conducted pursuant
to this chapter shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal,
application, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the
property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the
hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that
is the subject of the hearing; and to any other persons entitled to receive
notice as provided by this chapter. In the absence of evidence to the contrary,
the county may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of property
entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least
ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within
that same time period, the county shall also prominently post a notice of the
hearing on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street
or highway right-of-way. The Board may continue an evidentiary hearing that has
been convened without further advertisement. If an evidentiary hearing is set
for a given date and a quorum of the Board is not then present, the hearing
shall be continued until the next regular meeting of the Board without further
advertisement.
   (C)   Administrative materials. The Zoning Administrator shall transmit to
the Board all applications, reports, and written materials relevant to the
matter being considered. The administrative materials may be distributed to the
members of the Board prior to the hearing if at the same time they are
distributed to the Board a copy is also provided to the appellant or applicant
and to the landowner if that person is not the appellant or applicant. The
administrative materials shall become a part of the hearing record. The
administrative materials may be provided in written or electronic form.
Objections to inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials may be made
before or during the hearing. Rulings on unresolved objections shall be made by
the Board at the hearing.
   (D)   Presentation of evidence. The applicant, the county, and any person
who would have standing to appeal the decision shall have the right to
participate as a party at the evidentiary hearing. Other witnesses may present
competent, material, and substantial evidence that is not repetitive as allowed
by the Board.
   (E)   Objections. Objections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary
issues, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal or the
standing of a party, may be made to the Board. The Board chair shall rule on
any objections, and the chair's rulings may be appealed to the full Board.
These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1402.
Objections based on jurisdictional issues may be raised for the first time on
judicial review.
   (F)   Appearance of official new issues. The official who made the decision
or the person currently occupying that position, if the decision maker is no
longer employed by the county, shall be present at the evidentiary hearing as a
witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in
a notice of appeal. If any party or the county would be unduly prejudiced by
the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board
shall continue the hearing.
   (G)   Oaths. The chair of the Board or any member acting as chair and the
clerk to the Board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any
matter coming before the Board. Any person who, while under oath during a
proceeding before the Board determining a quasi-judicial matter, willfully
swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (H)   Subpoenas. The Board making a quasi-judicial decision under this
chapter through the chair or, in the chair's absence, anyone acting as chair
may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request
issuance of a subpoena, the applicant, the county, and any person with standing
may make a written  request to the chair explaining why it is necessary for
certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The chair shall issue requested
subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope,
and not oppressive. The chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a
subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the chair may be immediately
appealed to the full Board. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena
issued pursuant to this division, the Board or the party seeking the subpoena
may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order requiring that its
subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders
after notice to all proper parties.
   (I)   Voting. The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board shall be
necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to
decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the
nature of certiorari. For the purposes of this division, vacant positions on
the Board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial
matter under §
154.025 shall not be considered members of the Board for calculation of the
requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the
place of such members.
   (J)   Decisions. The Board shall determine contested facts and make its
decision within a reasonable time. When hearing an appeal, the Board may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from
and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to
be made. The Board shall have all the powers of the official who made the
decision. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent,
material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision
shall be reduced to writing, reflect the Board's determination of contested
facts and their application to the applicable standards, and be approved by the
Board and signed by the chair or other duly authorized member of the Board. A
quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the
clerk to the Board. The decision of the Board shall be delivered within a
reasonable time by personal delivery, electronic mail, or first-class mail to
the applicant, landowner, and any person who has submitted a written request
for a copy prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person
required to provide notice shall certify to the county that proper notice has
been made, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of
fraud.

   (B)   Planning Board and Board of Adjustment. Members of the Planning Board
and Board of Adjustment shall not vote on any advisory or legislative decision
regarding a development regulation under this chapter where the outcome of the
matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and

readily identifiable financial impact on the staff member or if the applicant
or other person subject to that decision is a person with whom the staff member
has a close familial, business, or other associational relationship. If a staff
member has a conflict of interest under this section, the decision shall be
assigned to the supervisor of the staff person or such other staff person as

as determined by the county.
   (E)   Quasi-judicial decisions. When the Board of Adjustment or Planning
Board is exercising quasi-judicial functions pursuant to this chapter, Board

to change;
      (2)   Undisclosed ex parte communications;
      (3)   A close familial, business, or other associational relationship

      (4)   A financial interest in the outcome of the matter.
   (F)   Resolution of objection. If an objection is raised to a Board member's
participation at or prior to the hearing or vote on a particular matter and
that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members of the
Board shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
   (G)   Familial relationship. For purposes of this section, a "close familial
relationship" means a spouse, parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, or
grandchild. The term includes the step, half, and in-law relationships.

      (2)   A special use permit shall be required for all special uses as set
forth in §
154.082, Table of Uses.
   (B)   Pre-application conference. Prior to submitting a formal application,
a pre-application consultation may be conducted at the applicant's request. It
is recommended that the applicant prepare a sketch plan or some depiction of
the proposed development concept for a pre-application meeting with the Zoning
Administrator to be sure the project will meet all requirements.
Notwithstanding any provision contained in this chapter to the contrary,
neither the Zoning Administrator's review of the plan submitted for review nor
the Zoning Administrator's comments to the applicant relating thereto shall be
considered a denial, approval or decision concerning the application.
   (C)   Application submittal.

chapter.
      (3)   The report, site plan and any related application materials shall
be presented to the Board of Adjustment during its hearing on the application.
   (F)   Action by the Board of Adjustment. Following public notification and
the scheduling of an evidentiary hearing in accordance with §
154.036(E) and §§
154.035 through
154.044, the Board of Adjustment shall conduct an evidentiary hearing on the
application in accordance with §
154.024.
   (G)   Findings of fact. No special use permit shall be approved unless the
following findings are made concerning the application:
      (1)   The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if
located where proposed and developed according to plan;
      (2)   The use will meet all required conditions and specifications if
used as permitted;
      (3)   The use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining
property or be a public nuisance; and
      (4)   The location and character of the use, if developed according to
the plan as submitted and approved, will be in harmony with the area in which
it is to be located.
   (H)   Conditions.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment may impose additional reasonable and
appropriate conditions and safeguards on the special use permit approval in
accordance with G.S. § 160D-705(c).
      (2)   All such additional conditions shall be entered in the minutes of
the meeting at which the special use permit is granted, on the special use
permit itself, and on or attached to the approved plans submitted therewith.
   (I)   Modifications to approved special use permit. If a proposed
modification deviates from the approved special use permit, the applicant shall
seek an amendment of the special use permit in accordance with §
154.038, Special Use Permit.
   (J)   Effect of decision.
      (1)   If the application for a special use permit is denied by the Board
of Adjustment, there may be no subsequent application for the same or similar
use submitted by any party for any part of the subject property until six
months have elapsed from the date of denial.
      (2)   The special use permit and additional conditions, if applicable,
shall run with the land and shall be binding on the original applicant as well
as any successors, assigns, and heirs.
   (K)   Expiration.
      (1)   A special use permit shall expire one year after the date of
issuance if the work authorized by the approval has not been substantially
commenced. If after commencement the work or activity allowed under a special
use permit is discontinued for a period of 12 months after commencement, the
special use permit shall immediately expire. The time periods set out in this
division shall be tolled during the pendency of any appeal. No work or activity
authorized by a special ise permit that has expired shall thereafter be
performed until a new development approval has been secured.
      (2)   Upon written application, submitted at least 30 days prior to the
expiration of the permit by the applicant, and upon a showing of good cause,
the Zoning Administrator may grant one extension to the special use permit for
a period not to exceed six months. Failure to submit an application for an
extension within the time limits established by this section shall result in
the expiration of the special use permit.
   (L)   Revocation of special use permit.
      (1)   In the event of failure to comply with the plans or any other
conditions imposed upon the special use permit and approved by the Board of
Adjustment, the enforcement provisions of §§
154.110 through
154.113 shall apply.
      (2)   Before revoking a permit or other authorization pursuant to §
154.113, the Zoning Administrator must give the holder of the permit ten days
written notice of intent to revoke the permit and include the reasons for the
intended revocation.
      (3)   On revoking a permit, the Zoning Administrator must give the holder
of the permit a written notice, including specific reasons for, the revocation.
      (4)   If revoked, no building permits for further construction or
certificates of occupancy under this special use permit shall be issued, and
all completed structures shall be regarded as nonconforming uses subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (5)   In such cases, the owner of the property and to the person who
sought the determination, if different from the owner, shall be notified that
the special use permit is no longer in effect in accordance with §
154.113.
   (M)   Notice. In addition to any other requirements of this subchapter
regarding the approval or disapproval of an application for a special use
permit, the approvals and disapprovals set forth in this section shall be
communicated by the officer or board making the determination who shall in turn
give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the
determination and to the party who sought the determination, if different from
the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery,
electronic mail, or by first-class mail. The notice shall be delivered to the
last address listed for the owner of the affected property on the county tax
abstract and to the address provided in the application or request for a
determination if the party seeking the determination is different from the
owner.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.039  VARIANCES.
   (A)   Applicability. The purpose of a variance is to allow certain
deviations from the standards of this chapter (such as yard setback or similar
numeric standards), when the landowner demonstrates that, owing to special
circumstances or conditions beyond the landowner's control (such as exceptional
topographical conditions, narrowness, shallowness, or the shape of a specific
parcel of land), the literal application of the standards would result in undue
and unique hardship to the landowner and the deviation would not be contrary to
the public interest.
   (B)   Application requirements. All applications for a variance shall be
submitted in accordance with §
154.036, Common Review Procedures.
   (C)   Notice and evidentiary hearings.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall hold a required evidentiary hearing
and give notice in accordance with §§
154.024(B) and
154.036(E). The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the standards set
forth in §
154.024, Quasi-Judicial Procedures.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a date for hearing the variance
request, to be held within 45 days of the date a complete application was
submitted, giving notice to the applicant by certified mail.
   (D)   Burden of proof. The applicant seeking the variance shall have the
burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the Board of Adjustment to
reach the conclusions set forth below as well as the burden of persuasion on
those issues.
   (E)   Action by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall
provide the Board of Adjustment with a copy of the application and all relevant
materials pertaining to the request.
   (F)   Action by the Board of Adjustment.
      (1)   Following public notification and the scheduling of an evidentiary
hearing in accordance with §§
154.024(B) and
154.036(E), the Board of Adjustment shall follow the quasi-judicial processes
as set forth in §
154.024, Quasi-Judicial Procedures.
      (2)   The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board of Adjustment shall
be necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required
to decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the
nature of certiorari. For the purposes of this division, vacant positions on
the Board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial
matter under §
154.024 shall not be considered members of the Board for calculation of the
requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the
place of such members.
   (F)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the
strict letter of a requirement of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment shall
vary the requirement of this chapter upon a showing of all of the following:
         (a)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the requirement. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence
of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
         (b)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability.
         (c)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant
or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
         (d)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose,
and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and
substantial justice is achieved.
      (2)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
   (H)   Conditions. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance,
provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Conditions
may be imposed by the Board of Adjustment regarding the location, character,
and other features of the proposed building or use as may be deemed by the
Board of Adjustment to protect property values and general welfare of the area.
Nonconformance with such conditions and safeguards, when part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter.
   (I)   Reapplication of variance request. The Board of Adjustment shall not
hear an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there
have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the
application.
   (J)   Subsequent development. Development authorized by the variance shall
not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other permits required
by this chapter. A variance does not ensure that the use shall receive
subsequent approval for other applications for permit approval unless the
relevant and applicable portions of this chapter are met.
   (K)   Variance runs with the land. Pursuant to §
154.004(A), variance is not a personal right, but runs perpetually with the
land.
   (L)   Decisions and notice. The decision of the Board of Adjustment and
notice of same shall be made in accordance with the provisions of §
154.024(J).
   (M)   Appeals. All appeals from a decision of the Board of Adjustment shall
follow the process and procedure set forth in §
154.042(F).
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.040  TEXT AMENDMENT.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   The Board of County Commissioners may, on its own motion, upon
recommendation of the Planning Board, or upon petition by an interested person,
amend, supplement, change, modify or repeal the regulations established by this
chapter.
      (2)   No amendment to this chapter that down-zones property shall be
initiated nor is it enforceable without the written consent of all property
owners whose property is the subject of the down-zoning amendment, unless the
down-zoning amendment is initiated by the county. For purposes of this
prohibition, "down-zoning" means a zoning ordinance that affects an area of
land in one of the following ways: (a) by decreasing the development density of
the land to be less dense than was allowed under its previous usage, or (b) by
reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in the ordinance to
fewer uses than were allowed under its previous usage.
   (B)   Initiation of amendments. A request to amend the text of this chapter
may be initiated by the Board of Commissioners, Board of Adjustment, Planning
Board, Zoning Administrator, or the general public.
   (C)   Application submittal.
      (1)   Applications for proposed amendments to this chapter must be
submitted to the Greene County Planning Department at least 30 days prior to
the Planning Board meeting at which it is to be considered.
      (2)   All applications for a text amendment shall be submitted in
accordance with §
154.036, Common Review Procedures.
   (D)   Notice and legislative hearings.
      (1)   Before adopting, amending, or repealing any provision of this
chapter, the Board of Commissioners shall hold a legislative hearing. A notice
of the hearing shall be given once a week for two successive calendar weeks in
a newspaper having general circulation in the area. The notice shall be
published the first time not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before
the date scheduled for the hearing. In computing such period, the day of
publication is not to be included but the day of the hearing shall be included.
      (2)   Notice to military bases. If the adoption or modification would
result in changes to the zoning map or would change or affect the permitted
uses of land located five miles or less from the perimeter boundary of a
military base, the county shall provide written notice of the proposed changes
by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the commander of the military
base not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the
hearing. If the commander of the military base provides comments or analysis
regarding the compatibility of the proposed development regulation or amendment
with military operations at the base, the Board of Commissioners shall take the
comments and analysis into consideration before making a final determination on
the ordinance.
   (E)   Action by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall
draft the appropriate amendment and prepare a staff report that reviews the
proposed text amendment request. Following completion of technical review by
staff, the Zoning Administrator shall forward the completed request and any
related materials to the Planning Board for a recommendation.
   (F)   Action by the Planning Board.
      (1)   Zoning amendments. All proposed amendments to this chapter shall be
submitted to the Planning Board for review and comment. If no written report is
received from the Planning Board within 30 days of referral of the amendment to
that Board, the Board of Commissioners may act on the amendment without the
Planning Board report. The Board of Commissioners are not bound by the
recommendations, if any, of the Planning Board.
      (2)   Plan consistency. When conducting a review of proposed zoning text
pursuant to this section, the Planning Board shall advise and comment on
whether the proposed action is consistent with the Greene County Comprehensive
Plan and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning
Board shall provide a written recommendation to the Board of Commissioners that
addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the
Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment
is inconsistent with the Greene County Comprehensive Plan shall not preclude
consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the county.
      (3)   Separate board required. Notwith- standing the authority to assign
duties of the Planning Board to the Board of County Commissioners as provided
by G.S. Ch. 160D, the review and comment required by this section shall not be
assigned to the Board of County Commissioners and must be performed by a
separate board.
   Following Planning Board review, the Zoning Administrator shall forward the
completed request and any related materials, including the Planning Board
recommendation (if applicable), to the Board of Commissioners for final action.
   (G)   Citizen comments. If any resident or property owner in the county
submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or
repeal to a zoning regulation, including a text or map amendment, to the clerk
to the Board of Commissioners at least two business days prior to the proposed
vote on such change, the clerk to the Board shall deliver such written
statement to the Board of Commissioners. If the proposed change is the subject
of a quasi-judicial proceeding under G.S. § 160D-705 or any other statute, the
clerk shall provide only the names and addresses of the individuals providing
written comment, and the provision of such names and addresses to all members
of the Board shall not disqualify any member of the Board from voting.
   (H)   Action by the Board of Commissioners.
      (1)   Following the receipt of a recommendation from the Planning Board,
the Board of Commissioners shall conduct a legislative hearing, in accordance
with §
154.036(F), to review and consider the application, the relevant supporting
materials, the Zoning Administrator's report and recommendation (if given), the
recommendation of the Planning Board, and any comments submitted by the public
pursuant to division (G) of this section or made during the hearing. Following
the close of the legislative hearing, the Board of Commissioners shall take one
of the following actions:
         (a)   Approve the amendment as proposed;
         (b)   Approve a revised amendment;
         (c)   Remand the application back to the Planning Board for further
consideration; or
         (d)   Take no action on the proposed amendment.
      (2)   Board of Commissioners statement; plan consistency. When adopting
or rejecting any zoning text amendment, the Board of County Commissioners shall
approve a brief statement describing whether its action is consistent or
inconsistent with the Greene County Comprehensive Plan. The requirement for a
plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear indication in the minutes
of the Board of County Commissioners that at the time of action on the
amendment the Board of County Commissioners was aware of and considered the
Planning Board's recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted
comprehensive plan. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered
concurrently. The plan consistency statement is not subject to judicial review.
   (I)   Approval criteria. In evaluating any proposed amendment of the text of
this chapter, the Planning Board and the Board of Commissioners shall consider
the following:
      (1)   The extent to which the proposed text amendment is consistent with
the remainder of the chapter, including, specifically, any purpose and intent
statements;
      (2)   The extent to which the proposed text amendment represents a new
idea not considered in the existing ordinance, or represents a revision
necessitated by changing circumstances over time;
      (3)   Whether or not the proposed text amendment corrects an error in the
ordinance;
      (4)   Whether or not the proposed text amendment revises the ordinance to
comply with state or federal statutes or case law;
      (5)   The proposed text amendment will advance the public health, safety
and welfare of Greene County;
      (6)   Whether the proposed amendment is consistent with any comprehensive
plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is
applicable based on G.S. § 160D-501.
   (J)   Withdrawal of application.
      (1)   Any application submitted in accordance with the provisions of this
section for the purpose of amending the regulations of this chapter may be
withdrawn at any time, but fees are nonrefundable.
      (2)   Any application that has been withdrawn shall be reconsidered only
as a new petition and must comply with the submission and review requirements
of this section.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.041  ZONING MAP AMENDMENT (REZONING).
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   Amendments to the Official Zoning Map shall be made in accordance
with the provisions of this section. The Board of Commissioners shall consider
amendments to the Official Zoning Map, as may be required from time to time.
      (2)   Rezonings should correspond with the boundary lines of existing
platted lots or parcels. Where the boundaries of a rezoning request stop short
of an exterior property line, it must be possible to subdivide and develop that
portion of the property outside the proposed rezoning boundary in accordance
with the existing zoning and other requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   All zoning requirements shall be met within the boundaries of the
area being rezoned. If all of the requirements cannot be met on the site being
rezoned, prior to advertisement of the legislative hearing, the rezoning shall
be expanded to include all property necessary to meet zoning requirements.
      (4)   No amendment to the Official Zoning Map of Greene County that down-
zones property shall be initiated nor is it enforceable without the written
consent of all property owners whose property is the subject of the down-zoning
amendment, unless the down-zoning amendment is initiated by the county. For
purposes of this prohibition, "down-zoning" means a zoning ordinance that
affects an area of land in one of the following ways: (a) by decreasing the
development density of the land to be less dense than was allowed under its
previous usage, or (b) by reducing the permitted uses of the land that are
specified in the Zoning Code to fewer uses than were allowed under its previous
usage.
   (B)   Initiation of amendment. A request for a rezoning may be initiated by
the Board of Commissioners, the Planning Board, or the Zoning Administrator. An
owner of land within the jurisdiction of the county (or a duly authorized agent
or representative) may petition the Board of Commissioners for a rezoning.
   (C)   Pre-application conference.
      (1)   Prior to submitting a formal application, a pre-application
consultation may be conducted at the applicant's request. It is recommended
that the applicant prepare a sketch plan or some depiction of the proposed
development concept to a pre-application meeting with the Zoning Administrator
to be sure the project will meet all requirements.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any provision contained in this chapter to the
contrary, neither the staff's review of the plan submitted for review nor
staff's comments to the applicant relating thereto shall be considered a
denial, approval or decision concerning the application.
   (D)   Application submittal.
      (1)   All applications for a zoning map amendment (rezoning) shall be
submitted in accordance with §
154.036, Common Review Procedures.
      (2)   Application shall include a description and statement of the
present and proposed zoning regulation or district boundary, and the names and
addresses of the owner or owners of the property involved.
      (3)   An application for a rezoning should be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator no later than 30 days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered.
      (4)   A separate application must be submitted for each parcel of land
that has different ownership.
   (E)   Notice of hearing on proposed zoning map amendments.
      (1)   Mailed notice. The owners of affected parcels of land and the
owners of all parcels of land abutting that parcel of land shall be mailed a
notice of the hearing on a proposed zoning map amendment by first-class mail at
the last addresses listed for such owners on the county tax abstracts. For the
purpose of this section, properties are "abutting" even if separated by a
street, railroad, or other transportation corridor. This notice must be
deposited in the mail at least ten but not more than 25 days prior to the date
of the hearing.
      (2)   Optional notice for large-scale zoning map amendments. The first-
class mail notice required under division (E)(1) of this section shall not be
required if the zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning designation
of more than 50 properties, owned by at least 50 different property owners, and
the county elects to use the expanded published notice provided for in this
division. In this instance, the county may elect to make the mailed notice
provided for in division (E)(1) of this section or, as an alternative, elect to
publish notice of the hearing as required by G.S. § 160D-601, provided that
each advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size.
The advertisement shall only be effective for property owners who reside in the
area of general circulation of the newspaper that publishes the notice.
Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation area, according
to the address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected
property, shall be notified according to the provisions of division (E)(1) of
this section.
      (3)   Posted notice. When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the county
shall prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site proposed for the
amendment or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. The notice
shall be posted within the same time period specified for mailed notices of the
hearing. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning map
amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not required but the county
shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested
persons.
   (F)   Action by the Zoning Administrator.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall prepare a staff report that reviews
the rezoning request in accordance with any adopted plans and policies of the
county and the general requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Following completion of technical review by staff, the Zoning
Administrator shall forward the completed request and any related materials to
the Planning Board for a recommendation.
   (G)   Action by the Planning Board.
      (1)   Zoning amendments. All proposed amendments to the zoning map shall
be submitted to the Planning Board for review and comment. If no written report
is received from the Planning Board within 30 days of referral of the amendment
to that Board, the Board of Commissioners may act on the amendment without the
Planning Board report. The Board of Commissioners are not bound by the
recommendations, if any, of the Planning Board.
      (2)   Plan consistency. When conducting a review of proposed map
amendments pursuant to this section, the Planning Board shall advise and
comment on whether the proposed action is consistent with the Greene County
Comprehensive Plan and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable.
The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the Board of
Commissioners that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed
appropriate by the Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board that a
proposed amendment is inconsistent with the Greene County Comprehensive Plan
shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the
county. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under
G.S. § 160D-602(b), the Planning Board statement describing plan consistency
may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in
the relevant adopted plans were considered in the recommendation made.
      (3)   Separate board required. Notwithstanding the authority to assign
duties of the Planning Board to the Board of County Commissioners as provided
by G.S. Ch. 160D, the review and comment required by this section shall not be
assigned to the Board of County Commissioners and must be performed by a
separate board.
      (4)   Following Planning Board review, the Zoning Administrator shall
forward the completed request and any related materials, including the Planning
Board recommendation (if applicable), to the Board of Commissioners for final
action.
   (H)   Citizen comments. If any resident or property owner in the county
submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or
repeal to a zoning regulation, including a map amendment, to the clerk to the
Board of Commissioners at least two business days prior to the proposed vote on
such change, the clerk to the Board shall deliver such written statement to the
Board of Commissioners. If the proposed change is the subject of a quasi-
judicial proceeding under G.S. § 160D-705 or any other statute, the clerk shall
provide only the names and addresses of the individuals providing written
comment, and the provision of such names and addresses to all members of the
Board shall not disqualify any member of the Board from voting.
   (I)   Action by the Board of Commissioners.
      (1)   Following the receipt of a recommendation from the Planning Board,
the Board of Commissioners shall conduct a legislative hearing, in accordance
with §
154.036(F), Quasi-Judicial and Legislative Hearings, to review and consider the
application, the relevant supporting materials, the Zoning Administrator's
report and recommendation (if given), the recommendation of the Planning Board,
and the comments given during the hearing (if any), or pursuant to division (H)
of this section. Following the close of the legislative hearing, the Board of
Commissioners shall take one of the following actions:
         (a)   Approve the application for amendment to the Official Zoning Map
as submitted;
         (b)   Approve the application for amendment to the Official Zoning Map
with a reduction in the size of the area requested in the application;
         (c)   Deny the application for amendment to the Official Zoning Map;
or
         (d)   Remand any application back to the Planning Board for further
consideration.
      (2)   Board of Commissioners' statement.
         (a)   Plan consistency. When adopting or rejecting any zoning map
amendment, the Board of County Commissioners shall approve a brief statement
describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with the Greene
County Comprehensive Plan. The requirement for a plan consistency statement may
also be met by a clear indication in the minutes of the Board of County
Commissioners that at the time of action on the amendment the Board of County
Commissioners was aware of and considered the Planning Board's recommendations
and any relevant portions of the Greene County Comprehensive Plan. If a zoning
map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the Plan,
the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending any future land-use
map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for a plan
amendment shall be required. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be
considered concurrently. The plan consistency statement is not subject to
judicial review. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale
rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the Board of County Commissioners statement
describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how
the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the
action taken.
         (b)   Additional reasonableness statement for rezonings. When adopting
or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, a statement analyzing the
reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be approved by the Board of
Commissioners. This statement of reasonableness may consider, among other
factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the area
proposed to be rezoned, (ii) the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the
neighbors, and the surrounding community, (iii) the relationship between the
current actual and permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas and
the development that would be permissible under the proposed amendment; (iv)
why the action taken is in the public interest; and (v) any changed conditions
warranting the amendment. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale
rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the Board of County Commissioners statement
on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.
         (c)   Single statement permissible. The statement of reasonableness
and the plan consistency statement required by this section may be approved as
a single statement.
   (J)   Approval criteria. In evaluating any proposed map amendment, the
Planning Board and the Board of Commissioners shall consider the following:
      (1)   Whether, and to the extent, which the proposed amendment is
consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other
officially adopted plan;
      (2)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment addresses
a demonstrated community need;
      (3)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment is
compatible with existing and proposed uses surrounding the land subject to the
amendment;
      (4)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment would
result in a logical and orderly pattern of development;
      (5)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment would
encourage premature development in the area subject to the amendment;
      (6)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment would
result in adverse impacts to property values in the area surrounding the land
subject to the amendment;
      (7)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment would
result in significantly adverse impacts on the natural environment.
   (K)   Modification of application. An applicant in a rezoning matter may
reduce the geographic scope from that requested in the application by filing a
statement of modification with the Zoning Administrator.
   (L)   Reapplication for zoning map amendment. If the application for a
zoning map amendment is denied by the Board of Commissioners, applicants must
wait one full year before applying for the rezoning of the same property.
Exceptions to this limitation include requests originating from the Planning
Board, Board of Adjustment or County Administration. The Board of
Commissioners, by 80% affirmative vote of its total membership, may waive this
restriction.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.042  APPEAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
   (A)   Applicability. Appeals of decisions made by the Zoning Administrator
or his/her deputy or staff under this chapter shall be made to the Board of
Adjustment. Appeals shall be heard by the Board of Adjustment, in compliance
with the quasi-judicial processes set forth in §
154.024.
   (B)   Standing. Any person who has standing or the county may appeal an
administrative decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by
filing a notice of appeal with the Clerk to the Board. The notice of appeal
shall state the grounds for the appeal.
   (C)   Time to appeal. The owner or other party shall have 30 days from
receipt of the written notice of the determination within which to file an
appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from
receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the determination
within which to file an appeal. The written notice of appeal shall specify the
grounds for the appeal, a statement of the decision or interpretation alleged
to be improper, the date of that decision or interpretation, and all supporting
materials related to the decision. In the absence of evidence to the contrary,
notice given pursuant to §
154.020(F) by first class mail shall be deemed received on the third business
day following deposit of the notice for mailing with the United States Postal
Service.
   (D)   Record of decision. The official who made the decision shall transmit
to the Board of Adjustment all documents and exhibits constituting the record
upon which the decision appealed from is taken. The official shall also provide
a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is
the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
   (E)   Stays. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order
stays enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed
unless the official who made the decision certifies to the Board after notice
of appeal has been filed that, because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or, because the violation
is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of
the development regulation. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be
stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If
enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the
official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board shall
meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a development
approval or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent
with the development regulation shall not stay the further review of an
application for development approvals to use such property; in these
situations, the appellant or county may request and the Board may grant a stay
of a final decision of development approval applications, including building
permits affected by the issue being appealed.
   (F)   Appeal of decision. Any appeal from the decision of the Board of
Adjustment shall be to the Superior Court for Greene County by petition for a
writ of certiorari. Any such petition to the Superior Court shall be filed with
the Clerk of Court in accordance with the provisions of G.S. § 160D-1402.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.043  PERMIT CHOICE AND VESTED RIGHTS.
   (A)   Applicability. County approval of development typically follows
significant investment in site evaluation, planning, development costs,
consultant fees, and related expenses. It is necessary and desirable to provide
for the establishment of certain vested rights in order to ensure reasonable
certainty, stability, and fairness in the development regulation process, to
secure the reasonable expectations of landowners, and to foster cooperation
between the public and private sectors in land-use planning and development
regulation.
   (B)   Permit choice. If the ordinance is amended between the time a
development permit application was submitted and a development permit decision
is made or if a land development regulation is amended after a development
permit decision has been challenged and found to be wrongfully denied or
illegal, G.S. § 143-755 applies.
   (C)   Vested rights.
      (1)   Amendments in land development regulations are not applicable or
enforceable without the written consent of the owner with regard to any of the
following:
         (a)   Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development
permit application has been submitted and subsequently issued in accordance
with G.S. § 143-755.
         (b)   Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application
authorizing the subdivision has been submitted and subsequently issued in
accordance with G.S. § 143-755.
         (c)   A site-specific vesting plan.
         (d)   A multi-phased development.
         (e)   A vested right established by the terms of a development
agreement authorized by Article 10 of Chapter 160D of the North Carolina
General Statutes.
      (2)   The establishment of a vested right under any subdivision of this
division does not preclude vesting under one or more other subdivisions of this
division or vesting by application of common law principles. A vested right,
once established as provided for in this section or by common law, precludes
any action by the county that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish,
or otherwise delay the development or use of the property allowed by the
applicable land development regulation or regulations, except where a change in
state or federal law mandating county enforcement occurs after the development
application is submitted that has a fundamental and retroactive effect on the
development or use.
   (D)   Duration of vesting.
      (1)   Upon issuance of a development permit, the statutory vesting
granted by division (C) of this section for a development project is effective
upon filing of the application in accordance with G.S. § 143-755, for so long
as the permit remains valid pursuant to law. Unless otherwise specified by this
section or other statute, local development permits expire one year after
issuance unless work authorized by the permit has substantially commenced. For
the purposes of this section, a permit is issued either in the ordinary course
of business of the county or by the applicable governmental agency as a court
directive.
      (2)   Except where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or this
chapter, the statutory vesting granted by this section, once established,
expires for an uncompleted development project if development work is
intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24
consecutive months, and the statutory vesting period granted by this section
for a nonconforming use of property expires if the use is intentionally and
voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months.
The 24-month discontinuance period is automatically tolled during the pendency
of any Board of Adjustment proceeding or civil action in a state or federal
trial or appellate court regarding the validity of a development permit, the
use of the property, or the existence of the statutory vesting period granted
by this section. The 24-month discontinuance period is also tolled during the
pendency of any litigation involving the development project or property that
is the subject of the vesting.
   (E)   Multiple permits for development project. Subject to division (D) of
this section, where multiple county development permits are required to
complete a development project, the development permit applicant may choose the
version of each of the county land development regulations applicable to the
project upon submittal of the application for the initial development permit.
This provision is applicable only for those subsequent development permit
applications filed within 18 months of the date following the approval of an
initial permit. For purposes of the vesting protections of this division, an
erosion and sedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial
development permit.
   (F)   Multi-phased development. A multi-phased development is vested for the
entire development with the land development regulations then in place at the
time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased
development. A right which has been vested as provided for in this division
remains vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval
is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development.
   (G)   Continuing review. Following issuance of a development permit, the
county may make subsequent inspections and reviews to ensure compliance with
the applicable land development regulations in effect at the time of the
original application.
   (H)   Process to claim vested rights. A person claiming a statutory or
common law vested right may submit information to substantiate that claim to
the Zoning Administrator who shall make an initial determination as to the
existence of the vested right. The decision of the Zoning Administrator may be
appealed to the Board of Adjustment under §
154.042. On appeal, the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo.
In lieu of seeking such a determination or pursuing an appeal under §
154.042, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as
provided by G.S. § 160D-1403.1.
   (I)   Miscellaneous provisions. The vested rights granted by this section
run with the land except for the use of land for outdoor advertising governed
by G.S. § 136-131.1 and G.S. § 136-131.2 in which case the rights granted by
this section run with the owner of a permit issued by the North Carolina
Department of Transportation. Nothing in this section precludes judicial
determination, based on common law principles or other statutory provisions,
that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable taking
has occurred. Except as expressly provided in this section, nothing in this
section shall be construed to alter the existing common law.
   (J)   Definitions. As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
      (1)   DEVELOPMENT. As defined in G.S. § 143-755(e)(1).
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. As defined in G.S. § 143-755(e)(2).
      (3)   LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATION. As defined in G.S. § 143-755(e)(3).
      (4)   MULTI-PHASED DEVELOPMENT. A development containing 25 acres or more
that is both of the following:
         (a)   Submitted for development permit approval to occur in more than
one phase.
         (b)   Subject to a master development plan with committed elements
showing the type and intensity of use of each phase. (2019-111, s. 2.4; 2020-3,
s. 4.33(a); 2020-25, ss. 5(a), 50(b), 51(a), (b), (d).)
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.044  CONDITIONAL ZONING (CZ).
   Conditional zoning is a legislative process in which an applicant proposes,
and the county considers, a zoning map amendment that includes additional
conditions. Conventional zoning map amendments change the zoning district
applicable to a piece of property, but do not include any standards beyond the
base standards of the Zoning Code. Conditional zoning allows the county and the
applicant to agree on additional conditions that may be appropriate for a
particular project within the context of a legislative rezoning.
   (A)   Conditional zoning. A legislative zoning map amendment with site-
specific conditions incorporated into the zoning map amendment.
   (B)   Purpose. This section authorizes the creation of conditional zoning
districts proposed by the property owners and customized to the context of a
particular development project or land use on a particular site. Each
conditional zoning district includes one or more conditions of approval that
help the project conform to Greene County's adopted ordinances and plans, and
mitigate the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or
use of the site.
   (C)   Applicability. CZ districts are intended only for voluntary proposals
submitted in the names of the owners of all property included in the petition/
application. Once a property has been rezoned to a CZ, it shall be referenced
with the letters "CZ" behind the name of the applicable general zoning
district. Thus, a property rezoned to a Conditional District in the "AR"
(Agricultural/Rural District) shall appear on the zoning map as "ARCZ."
   (D)   Development standards. Any proposed development within a conditional
district must meet all requirements of the corresponding general use district,
as modified by any conditions of approval.
   (E)   Procedure. The Agricultural/Rural District AR may only be considered
by the Greene County Board of Commissioners for conditional zoning through a
legislative decision-making process, following the procedures for zoning map
amendments outlined in this chapter.
      (1)   Submittal application and site plan. Application by the owner or
owners of the property must be made with the Zoning Administrator. Each project
must include a site plan that meets the site plan requirements listed in this
chapter.
      (2)   Staff review and action. The Planning Director shall review the
application, prepare a staff report, and provide a recommendation.
      (3)   Planning Board review. The Planning Board shall review the
application of conditional zoning and make a recommendation to the Board of
Commissioners. Planning Board members may propose additional conditions and
requirements beyond those proposed by the applicant.
      (4)   Board of Commissioners review and action. The Board of
Commissioners shall conduct a legislative hearing on the application. One or
more Commissioners may propose additional conditions or requirements beyond
those proposed by the applicant. After the legislative hearing on the
application is concluded, the Board of Commissioners shall make a decision on
the application. The decision of the Board of Commissioners shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   Approve the application as submitted, subject to conditions of
approval;
         (b)   Approve the application, subject to revised conditions of
approval;
         (c)   Remand the application to the Planning Board for further
consideration; or
         (d)   Deny the application.
   (F)   Expiration. Conditional zoning shall expire two years after the date
of approval if the work authorized by the zoning has not been substantially
commenced. If after commencement the work or activity allowed under a
conditional zoning is discontinued for a period of 180 days after commencement,
the conditional zoning shall become null and void, and the zoning map shall be
updated to reflect the tract's original zoning designation.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
NONCONFORMITIES
§ 154.055  GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   A "nonconformity" is any use, building, structure, or lot which
lawfully existed prior to the adoption of this chapter on June 5, 2017 and
which fails to comply with one or more of the applicable regulations or
standards established herein.
      (2)   A nonconformity is also any use, building, structure, or lot which
was lawfully created, or constructed, under this chapter but which was
subsequently rendered nonconforming due to circumstances that were not self-
created.
   (B)   Purpose and scope.
      (1)   The purpose and intent of this section is to regulate and limit the
continued existence of those uses, structures, lots of record, and signs that
do not conform to the provisions of this chapter, or any subsequent amendments.
      (2)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit most of these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
continuance except under the limited circumstances established in this section.
The provisions of this section are designed to curtail substantial investment
in nonconformities.
   (C)   Authority to continue. Nonconformities are allowed to continue in
accordance with the requirements of this section, and are encouraged to receive
routine maintenance as a means of preserving safety and appearance.
   (D)   Determination of nonconforming status. In all cases, the burden of
establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be the responsibility
of the owner of the land on which the alleged nonconformity is located.
   (E)   Minor repairs and maintenance. Minor repairs and normal maintenance
that are required to keep nonconforming uses, structures, and lots of record in
a safe condition are permitted, provided the minor repair or maintenance does
not extend, expand, or enlarge the nonconforming use, structure, or lot of
record.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.056  NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   General. Nonconforming uses are declared generally incompatible with
the permitted uses in the zoning district in which they are located and with
the provisions of this chapter. Nonconforming uses shall be subject to the
standards in this section.
   (B)   Change of use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other
nonconforming use. Once a nonconforming use has ceased operation or has been
discontinued for a period of 180 days or longer, it shall only be replaced with
a conforming use.
   (C)   Expansion and enlargement. Except in accordance with this section, a
nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, expanded in area occupied or
intensified. An existing nonconforming use may be enlarged into any portion of
the structure where it is located provided the area proposed for expansion was
designed and intended for such use prior to the date the use became a
nonconformity.
   (D)   Discontinuance. A nonconforming use shall not be reestablished after
discontinuance for a period of 180 consecutive calendar days or more. An effort
to renovate the structure housing the use is not considered a vacancy,
abandonment, or discontinuance, provided all appropriate development approvals
are obtained, and provided the renovation is completed within 180 days from its
commencement, and the use is re-established within 30 days from the time the
renovation is completed. Failure to complete the renovation within 180 days or
reestablish the use within 30 days following renovation shall constitute
discontinuance, and a nonconforming use shall not be reestablished in the
structure.
   (E)   Accessory uses. Once a nonconforming principal use is discontinued,
all associated accessory uses shall cease operation within 180 days.
      (1)   Reestablishment after casualty damage; destruction or damage beyond
60% of value. If a structure housing a nonconforming use is destroyed or
damaged, by any means, to an extent greater than 60% of its current assessed
tax value, the nonconforming use may not be reestablished following
reconstruction.
      (2)   Damage of 60% of value or less. If the amount of damage is 60% or
less of the current assessed tax value, the nonconforming use may be
reestablished if a building permit is obtained within 180 days following the
casualty damage and the restoration of the structure housing the nonconforming
use is completed within one year of obtaining the building permit.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.057  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Continuation. Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow
the continued use of nonconforming structures.
   (B)   Expansion and enlargement. A nonconforming structure shall not be
enlarged or expanded in any way that increases the degree of nonconformity.
Expansion of the structure in a way that complies with applicable dimensional
standards or that decreases the degree of nonconformity is permitted.
   (C)   Relocation. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, in whole or
in part, to another location within the county's jurisdiction, on or off the
parcel of land on which it is presently located, unless upon relocation it
conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   Reconstruction after casualty damage.
      (1)   Destruction or damage beyond 60% of value.
         (a)   In the event a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed,
by any means, to an extent more than 60% of its assessed tax value at the time
of damage or destruction, it shall only be restored in a manner that conforms
with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   New construction shall be in accordance with the requirements of
this chapter.
      (2)   Damage of 60% of value or less.
         (a)   In the event a nonconforming structure is damaged, by any means,
to an extent of 60% or less of its assessed tax value at the time of damage or
destruction, it may be rebuilt to its previous form if a building permit for
such repair or restoration is obtained within 180 days of the casualty damage,
and repair or restoration is completed within one year of obtaining the
building permit.
         (b)   In no event shall the repair or restoration increase the degree
of nonconformity.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.058  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   General. No use or structure shall be established on a nonconforming
lot of record except in accordance with the standards in this section.
   (B)   Status of nonconforming lots.
      (1)   Conforming structures legally established on nonconforming lots of
record prior to the effective date of this chapter may be continued, enlarged,
extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered in any way that is in
conformance with the standards of this chapter.
      (2)   Nonconforming structures legally established on a nonconforming lot
prior to the effective date of this chapter may be continued, enlarged, or
redeveloped only in accordance with the standards in §
154.057, Nonconforming Structures.
   (C)   Development of unimproved lots. When an undeveloped lot has an area or
width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the zoning
district where located, but such lot was approved and of record at the time of
adoption of this chapter or any subsequent amendment which renders such lot
nonconforming, then such lot may be used for a use permitted in the zoning
district where located, provided that the setback dimensions and other
requirements, except area or width, are in compliance with this chapter.
   (D)   Redevelopment of improved lots in residential districts after
casualty. If a legally established single-family detached dwelling is destroyed
by casualty on a nonconforming lot in the Agriculture/Rural (AR) or Residential
(R) zoning districts that was part of a subdivision or division of land
evidenced by plat or deed, or both, recorded prior to June 5, 2017, an
identical replacement structure may be reconstructed within the same footprint
as the dwelling destroyed by casualty even though the lot does not meet the
minimum lot area or lot width requirements.
   (E)   Yard requirements modifications.
      (1)   For any lot in any zoning district which was recorded with the
Greene County Register of Deeds Office prior to the effective date of zoning by
Greene County that has a width or depth less than that required in the zoning
district in which it is located, the Zoning Administrator shall be authorized
to reduce the yard and setback requirements for such lot of record by not more
than 30%.
      (2)   Additional or other forms of yard modification may be permitted
with a variance granted by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with §
154.039, Variances.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 154.070  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Zoning districts established. For the purposes of this chapter, the
County of Greene is hereby dividing the county zoning jurisdiction into the
following zoning districts (G.S. § 160D-703):
 
AR  Agriculture/Rural
R   Residential
C   Commercial
I   Industrial
GTP Global TransPark Overlay
 
   (B)   Compliance with district standards. No land within the county's zoning
jurisdiction shall be developed except in accordance with the standards set
forth in this section, and all other applicable regulations contained in this
chapter.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.071  ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of the districts set forth in this
section is to ensure the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of
Greene County. More specifically, it is the intent of the Board of
Commissioners in establishing these districts to:
      (1)   Preserve the county's rural and agricultural character while
accommodating new development consistent with the county's land use goals and
objectives;
      (2)   Ensure that new development does not impair the ability of existing
agricultural uses to continue operation;
      (3)   Protect and preserve the natural environment within the county;
      (4)   Provide for residential housing choice and nonresidential services
as may be compatible with such development;
      (5)   Minimize any negative impacts of nonresidential development on
residential uses;
      (6)   Create suitable environments for various types of commercial and
industrial uses, and protect them from the adverse effects of incompatible
uses.
   (B)   Agriculture/Rural (AR) District. The Agriculture/Rural (AR) District
is intended to accommodate low density residential and agricultural-related
uses, as well as public, institutional, and low intensity commercial uses. The
purpose of this district is to preserve and encourage the continued use of land
for agricultural and open space purposes. This district is established to
preserve and protect rural agricultural area of the county from dense
residential development and intensive commercial development that is
inconsistent with the character of these rural areas.
   (C)   Residential (R) District. The Residential (R) District is established
as a district in which the principal use of land is for residential uses. The
specific intent of this district is to encourage the construction of and the
continued use of the land for residential purposes by prohibiting commercial
and industrial use of land and other uses which would substantially interfere
with the development of residential dwellings in these districts.
   (D)   Commercial (C) District. The Commercial (C) District is established as
a district in which the principal use of land is for professional office,
institutional, retail, and wholesale uses that serve the residential districts
and rural areas of the county, as well as travelers and the region surrounding
the county.
   (E)   Industrial (I) District. The Industrial (I) District is established as
a district in which the principal use of land is for industrial, manufacturing,
warehousing, wholesale, and related commercial and service uses that have
access to major thoroughfares. This district is specifically designed to
accommodate those uses which, by their nature, are wholly incompatible with
residential land uses and require separation from those areas to ensure that
the operations taking place do not interfere with the use of adjoining or
nearby properties. It is also the intention of this district to allow uses that
will not generate health and safety hazards to county residents.
   (F)   Global TransPark (GTP) Overlay District. The Global TransPark (GTP)
Overlay District is established as a district where commercial, storage,
warehousing, and industrial uses which support the presence and growth of the
NC Global TransPark will be promoted. The NC Global TransPark is an industrial
park and airport in Lenoir County which supports the manufacturing, logistics,
and research and development needs of the aerospace, defense, emergency
response and disaster relief industries. Where lands are classified within the
GPT Overlay District in addition to a general zoning district, the regulations
governing development in the GTP Overlay District shall apply in addition to
the regulations governing in the underlying base zoning district.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
TABLE OF USES
§ 154.080  EXPLANATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE TABLE OF USES.
   The table of uses is subject to the explanation as set forth below:
   (A)   A "P" indicates that a use is permitted by right in the respective
zoning district, subject to compliance with any specific use standards in §§
154.100 through
154.103. Such uses are also subject to all other applicable requirements of
this chapter.
   (B)   A "S" indicates that a use is allowed in the respective zoning
district only upon the issuance of a special use permit by the Board of
Adjustment in accordance with §
154.038, Special Use Permit. Special uses are subject to all other applicable
requirements of this chapter, including the specific use standards contained in
§§
154.100 through
154.103.
   (C)   The "Use Standard" column on the table is a cross-reference to any
specific use standard listed in §§
154.100 through
154.103. Where no cross-reference is shown, no additional use standard shall
apply.
   (D)   A blank cell in the use table indicates that a use is not permitted in
the respective zoning district.
(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.081  USES NOT LISTED.
   (A)   When a particular use is not specifically listed in the table of uses,
the Zoning Administrator may permit the use upon finding that the proposed use
has an impact that is similar in nature, function, and duration to other
existing, listed, uses that are permitted in the specific zoning district. In
making such a finding, the Zoning Administrator shall also take into account
the purpose and intent of this chapter and the purpose and intent of the zoning
district in which the unlisted use is to be established, along with any
relevant definitions that exist in §
154.010, Definitions.
   (B)   If the Zoning Administrator believes that requests for such a use will
become common, or that adding the use to the table of uses is beneficial, he/
she shall initiate a text amendment to insert the use into the table of uses.
   (C)   If the Zoning Administrator denies a zoning permit for the
establishment of an unlisted use, the decision may be appealed to the Board of
Adjustment as an appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision pursuant to §
154.042.

§ 154.090  GENERAL LOT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Compliance with this chapter required. No person shall commence or
proceed with development without first securing approval from the county as
herein provided. An approval made pursuant to this chapter attaches to and runs

required to meet the minimum setback provisions for the zoning district in
which they are located, and shall be exempt from the other minimum lot size or
lot width requirements.
   (C)   Reduction prohibited. Except as required through the establishment of
new public rights-of-way (such as roadway widening) or approved as a variance,
no yard or lot existing on June 5, 2017 shall be reduced in size or area below
the minimum requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
   (D)   Setback determination on irregular lots. The location of required
front, side, and rear yard setbacks on irregularly shaped lots shall be
determined by the Zoning Administrator. Such determination shall be based on
the spirit and intent of this chapter in order to achieve an appropriate
spacing and location of buildings and structures on individual lots.
   (E)   Allowable yard encroachments. Architectural extensions including, but
not limited to, bay windows, chimneys, open porches and decks, roof overhangs,
and balconies may encroach into required yard setbacks not more than three

(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.112  VIOLATIONS AND VIOLATORS.
   (A)   Violation.
      (1)   No person shall commence or proceed with development without first

engage in any construction, land development activity, or use without all
approvals and authorizations required by this chapter.
      (3)   When a use constituting a violation of this chapter is in existence
prior to adoption of the chapter creating the violation, and that the use is
grandfathered and subsequently terminated for any reason, the county shall
bring an enforcement action pursuant to §
154.113 and/or G.S. § 153A-123.
   (B)   Violators.
      (1)   Violators include any person who owns, leases, occupies, manages,
designs or builds any structure or land development activity in violation of
this chapter and any person who owns, leases, or occupies a use in violation of
this chapter.
      (2)   A violation may be charged against more than one violator.
   (C)   Complaints regarding violations. When a violation of this chapter
occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written or verbal
complaint with the Zoning Administrator. Such complaint shall state fully the
cause and basis thereof and shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, or
his authorized agent. An investigation should be made within ten days. Actions
as provided in these regulations shall be in accordance with §

Adjustment by making a written request for an administrative appeal as
described in §
154.042, Appeal of Administrative Decisions.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear the appeal and render its

(Ord. passed 6-21-21)
§ 154.113  ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND REMEDIES.
   A violation of this chapter may be enforced as follows:
   (A)   Notice of violation. When staff determines work or activity has been
undertaken in violation of this chapter or any approval issued hereunder, a
written notice of violation may be issued. The notice of violation shall be
delivered to the holder of the approval and to the landowner of the property
involved, if the landowner is not the holder of the approval, by personal
delivery, electronic delivery, or first-class mail and may be provided by
similar means to the occupant of the property or the person undertaking the
work or activity. The notice of violation may be posted on the property. The
person providing the notice of violation shall certify to the county that the
notice was provided, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the
absence of fraud. A notice of violation may be appealed to the Board of
Adjustment, and the Board of Adjustment shall follow quasi-judicial processes
as set forth in §
154.024.
   (B)   Stop work orders. Whenever any work or activity subject to regulation
pursuant to this chapter is undertaken in substantial violation of any state or
local law, or in a manner that endangers life or property, staff may order the
specific part of the work or activity that is in violation or presents such a
hazard to be immediately stopped. The order shall be in writing, directed to
the person doing the work or activity, and shall state the specific work or
activity to be stopped, the reasons therefor, and the conditions under which
the work or activity may be resumed. A copy of the order shall be delivered to
the holder of the subdivision approval and to the owner of the property
involved (if that person is not the holder of the subdivision approval) by
personal delivery, electronic delivery, or first-class mail. The person or
persons delivering the stop work order shall certify to the county that the
order was delivered, and that certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the
absence of fraud. A stop work order may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment,
and the Board of Adjustment shall follow quasi-judicial processes as set forth
in §
154.024. No further work or activity shall take place in violation of a stop
work order pending a ruling on the appeal. Violation of a stop work order shall
constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (C)   Remedies. This chapter may be enforced by any remedy provided by G.S.
§ 153A-123. A violation may be corrected by any appropriate equitable remedy, a
mandatory or prohibitory injunction, or an order of abatement as authorized by
G.S. § 153A-123. If a building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure, or land is used or developed in violation of this chapter, the
county, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or
proceedings to prevent the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, use, or development; to restrain,
correct or abate the violation; to prevent occupancy of the building,
structure, or land; or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in
or about the premises. The county may commence a civil action in the
appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for enforcement in
accordance with G.S. § 153A-123.
   (D)   Revocation of development approvals. Development approvals may be
revoked by the county by notifying the holder in writing stating the reason for
the revocation. The county shall follow the same development review and
approval process required for issuance of the development approval, including
any required notice or hearing, in the review and approval of any revocation of
that approval. Development approvals shall be revoked for any substantial
departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal
or failure to comply with the requirements of any applicable local development
regulation or any state law delegated to the county for enforcement purposes in
lieu of the state; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in
securing the approval. Any development approval mistakenly issued in violation
of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. The revocation of a
development approval by a staff member may be appealed pursuant to §
154.042. If an appeal is filed regarding a development regulation adopted by
the county pursuant to G.S. Ch. 160D, the provisions of §
154.042 regarding stays apply.
   (E)   Criminal penalties.
      (1)   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any section or provision
of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
fined not more than $500 and/or imprisoned not more than 20 days for each
violation (G.S. § 153A-123).
      (2)   Each day such violation continues, however, shall be a separate and
distinct offense, punishable as herein before provided.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator may refer a violation to the proper
authority for possible criminal prosecution.
   (F)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Violation of this chapter subjects the violator to a civil penalty
in the amount of $100 for each violation (G.S. § 153A-123(c)).
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may impose a civil penalty by giving the
violator a written citation, either in person or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested. The Zoning Administrator shall have the
discretion to stay the accrual of civil penalties pending reasonable efforts by
the violator to correct the violation.
      (3)   The citation shall describe the nature of the violation, specify
the amount of the civil penalty being imposed, and direct the violator to pay
the civil penalty to the county finance office within ten days of the date the
citation is received. If the violator fails to either pay the civil penalty or
correct the violation within this time limit, the Zoning Administrator may
institute a civil action in the nature of a debt in a court of competent
jurisdiction to recover the civil penalty.
      (4)   For purposes of assessing the amount of a civil penalty, each day
the violation remains uncorrected after receipt of the written citation shall
constitute a separate violation that subjects the violator to additional civil
penalty.
