in accordance with the statutes of the State of North Carolina. The authority

major part of the system, unless such transaction is approved by the Board of
Commissioners of the Town by ordinance.

Commissioners pursuant to the then applicable general or special statutes
authorizing the issuance and sale thereof, and shall be issued in such amounts
and at such times, and shall bear such maturity dates, as the Power Board shall
direct, and it shall be the duty of the Board of Commissioners to provide for
the issuance of such bonds pursuant to any such general or special statutes as
directed by the Power Board; Provided, however, that the Board of Commissioners
shall not be required to issue any such bonds without its approval if the bonds
to be issued are payable out of the Town’s general income and revenue, it being
the intention hereof that the Power Board be empowered to direct the issuance
of such bonds only when the bonds are to be payable solely from the revenues of
the electric system.

and enforce all necessary and desirable rules and regulations for the efficient
use, operation and management of the system.

been appointed by the Power Board.

not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per year to help provide wholesome

separate and apart from all other funds, books and accounts of the Town or any
of the departments thereof. The funds of the system, including revenues from
the operation thereof, shall be deposited in the name of the Power Board. Such
funds shall be disbursed only on voucher signed by the superintendent of the
system issued pursuant to resolution or order of the Power Board, a certified
copy of which shall be filed in the office of the fiscal agent of the Power
Board.
   (b)   The Power Board shall make and file with the Board of Commissioners on
the first day of January and the first day of July each year a financial
statement showing the financial operations of the system during the preceding
six months and the financial condition of the system.
   (c)   The Power Board shall cause to be paid all obligations for which the
Town may now be or hereafter become liable because of the ownership and
operation of the system. All such obligations which are general obligations of
the Town may be paid either directly to those to whom the obligations are owed
to the Treasurer of the Town for payment over to those entitled to such
payments. This Article shall not in any way impair any obligations heretofore
entered into by the Town and shall not change or alter the obligations of any
existing contracts, all of which, insofar as they apply to the system, shall be
binding on the Power Board.
   (d)   The Power Board shall dispose of its gross revenues from system
operations in the following manner:
      (1)   Revenues shall first be used for the payment of all current system
operating expenses, including salaries, wages, cost of materials, supplies and
services, power at wholesale, and insurance.
      (2)   Next, provisions shall be made for payment of interest on and
retirement of indebtedness incurred by the Power Board or the Town for system
purposes, including amortization and/ or sinking fund payments thereon.
      (3)   Thereafter, revenues shall be used to establish and maintain
reasonable reserves for replacement, new construction and contingencies, and to
provide a reasonable amount of cash working capital.
      (4)   Thereafter, the Power Board shall pay into the general fund of the
Town an amount in lieu of ad valorem taxes on the property of the system not to
exceed the amount of taxes payable on private property of a similar nature.
      (5)   All revenues remaining after making provision for items above
enumerated in the order in which they are stated shall be considered surplus
revenues to be used solely for system purposes and primarily as a basis for
reduction of rates to the electric consumers.
Section 5.6 Purpose.
   It is the intent and purpose of this Article to create the Power Board as a
separate and independent unit of government insofar as control, management and
operation of the system are concerned and this Article shall be liberally
construed to accomplish such intent and purpose.

   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. Part 261. The notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of the waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent the
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of the constituents in the waste stream discharge during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under §
57.074. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to Categorical Pretreatment
Standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
57.070,
57.072, and
57.073.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in
40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a
one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulation under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW Director, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the effective
date of the regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.079 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40
C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.080 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Samples to be representative of discharge. All wastewater samples must
be representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow
measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained
in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to
claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
   (B)   Grab samples. Grab Samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other
pollutants as required by 40 C.F.R. 136. The POTW shall determine the number of
grabs necessary to be representative of the user’s discharge. See 40 C.F.R.
403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90 Day
Compliance Reports. Additionally, the POTW Director may allow collection of
multiple grabs during a 24 hour period which are composited prior to analysis
as allowed under 40 C.F.R. 136.
   (C)   Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected
with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a
discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow
proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Director. When
authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be
representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.081 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.082 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of the requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples, the dates analyses were performed, who performed the
analyses, the analytical techniques or methods used, and the results of the
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the town, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the POTW Director.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.083 ELECTRONIC REPORTING.
   The POTW Director may develop procedures for receipt of electronic reports
for any reporting requirements of this chapter. The procedures shall comply
with 40 C.F.R. Part 3. These procedures shall be enforceable under §§
57.110 through
57.112.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 57.095 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The town requires the user to provide and operate at the user’s own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near the sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of
the town and all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification
by the town.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.096 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The town will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the town, approval authority and the EPA or their
representative, ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, and
copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The town, approval
authority, and the EPA shall have the right to set up on the user’s property
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance
monitoring, and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in
force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into
his or her premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with his or her
security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel
from the town, approval authority, and the EPA will be permitted to enter,
without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
Denial of the POTW Director’s approval authority’s, or EPA’s access to the
user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may
constitute denial of access.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.097 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the POTW Director, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to
a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the POTW Director,
approval authority, or the EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the
court having jurisdiction within the town.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
ENFORCEMENT
§ 57.110 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW Director finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, wastewater permit,
or any prohibition, limitation, or requirements contained therein or any other
pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the
date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the town by the user.
Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
The orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to division (D) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this chapter or is in
noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW Director
determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for the action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be
made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §
57.111 nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director under this
section subject to an administrative appeal under §
57.056(C)(8).
   (D)   Administrative orders. When the POTW Director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter, permits, or orders
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may
issue an order to cease and desist all violations and direct those persons in
noncompliance to do any of the following:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
the order;
      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation; and
      (4)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/
or wastewater permit when the suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the POTW Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW Director
shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon
proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user
shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the
POTW Director prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit or permission to discharge.
      (1)   The POTW Director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or
permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the
following reasons:
         (a)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his or her discharge;
         (b)   Failure to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
         (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
         (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to
discharge, conditions of this chapter, or any applicable state and federal
regulations.
      (2)   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to
show cause under this section why the proposed action should not be taken.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.111 OTHER AVAILABLE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Remedies, in addition to those previously mentioned in this chapter,
are available to the POTW Director who may use any single one or combination
against a noncompliant user.
   (B)   Additional available remedies include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Criminal violations. The District Attorney for the applicable
Judicial District may, at the request of the town, prosecute noncompliant users
who violate the provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B. [Note: Under North Carolina
law, it is a crime to negligently violate any term, condition, or requirement
of a pretreatment permit, or negligently fail to apply for a pretreatment
permit, issued by local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B(f)), to knowingly and
willfully violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit,
or knowingly and willfully fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by
local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B(g)), to knowingly violate any term,
condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit issued by local governments,
or knowingly fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that
a person is placed in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, (G.S.
§ 143-215.6B(h)), and to falsify information required under (G.S. § 143-215.6B
(i). G.S. Chapter 143, Article 21).]
      (2)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user is in violation of the
provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, the POTW
Director, through the Town Attorney, may petition the Superior Court of Justice
for the issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent
injunction which restrains or compels the activities in question.
      (3)   Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user is in violation
of the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, water
service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence,
at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated ability to
comply.
      (4)   Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent
limitations of this chapter or of a permit or order issued hereunder, is hereby
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the
POTW Director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions of the appropriate ordinances of the town governing the nuisances,
including reimbursing the POTW for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or
remedying the nuisance.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.112 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The POTW
Director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the town’s enforcement response plan. However, the POTW
Director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the POTW Director is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 57.125 UPSET.
   (A)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements
of division (B) below are met.
   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW
Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days]:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (C)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (D)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
   (E)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.126 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS DEFENSE.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
57.020(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
57.020(B)(2), (3) and (5) through (7) if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the town was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008)
§ 57.127 BYPASS.
   (A)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (B) and (C) below.
   (B)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW Director, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of this time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue, and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW Director may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) above.
      (2)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Director determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(1) above.

APPENDIX A: LOCAL ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE PLAN (ERP)
1. Introduction.
It is the responsibility of the Town of Murphy to enforce all applicable
federal, state, and local pretreatment regulations. These regulations are
outlined in federal regulation 40 C.F.R. 403 and state regulation 15A NCAC
2H.0900, and the local SUO. This Enforcement Response Plan (ERP) has been
established as an element of the POTW’s pretreatment program. The purpose of
the ERP is to provide for fair and equitable treatment of all users for
anticipated situations. In general, enforcement actions will be taken in
accordance with this Enforcement Response Plan. However, the enforcement
actions available are not exclusive as discussed in SUO §
57.112 (NC Model SUO §
57.112). Therefore, any combination of the enforcement actions can be taken
against a non-compliant user.
2. Enforcement actions available to the town.
The Director of the POTW is empowered through G.S § 143-215.6A and the local
Sewer Use Ordinance (SUO) to take a wide variety of enforcement actions. The
following is a list of those actions and the corresponding sections of the
local SUO that describes each. Corresponding sections from the NC model SUO are
listed as well.

In addition to the actions listed above, a user who violates the provisions of
G.S. § 143-215.6B may be referred by the Director to the District Attorney for
possible criminal prosecution.
In determining the amount of civil penalties for a particular violation, the
Director shall consider the following factors (local model SUO, §
57.999 )
   1.   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to the
public health, or to public or private property resulting from the violation;
   2.   The duration and gravity of the violation;
   3    The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or on air
quality;
   4.   The cost of rectifying the damage;
   5.   The amount of money saved by noncompliance;
   6.   Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally;
   7.   The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply; and
   8.   The costs of enforcement to the POTW.
Adjudicatory hearing procedures regarding permit decisions, civil penalties,
and administrative orders may be found in the SUO (local model SUO §
57.056(C)(8)).
3. Investigation of noncompliance.
The staff of the POTW will generally investigate user compliance with permits
or the provisions of the SUO in three ways:
   1.   On-site inspections of the user to include scheduled and unscheduled
visits;
   2.   Scheduled and unscheduled sampling of the users effluent; and
   3.   Review of self-monitoring data, if required, from the user.
The compliance status of Significant Industrial Users will be evaluated at a
minimum once every six months.
4. Types of violation.
The following is a list of different types of violations by category. This list
is not inclusive, but serves as a general list of anticipated types of
noncompliance. The user’s permit, local SUO, and state and federal regulations
serve as additional references for pretreatment requirements.
Un-permitted discharges. Users are responsible for obtaining and renewing
permits, if required.
Permit limits. Users are responsible for maintaining compliance with all
effluent limits. The POTW will evaluate the extent of the limits violations. In
determining the extent of violation(s), Significant Noncompliance (SNC) as
defined by state and EPA regulations will be determined.
Self-monitoring violations. A user who fails to adequately conduct all the
monitoring required in the permit, including monitoring frequencies and
sampling methods specified, is in violation. This includes a user who does not
resample per his or her permit when a limit violation occurs.
Reporting violations. A user who fails to provide information (e.g. self-
monitoring reports) required in his or her permit or the SUO in the required
time frame is in violation. Late or incomplete reports will also be considered
violations. A SIU who submits a report more than 30 days late is considered in
SNC.
Permit conditions. Failure to apply or reapply for a permit is considered a
violation. Users who violate the general or other conditions (e.g. slug
loading, dilution prohibition) outlined in their permits or the SUO shall be
considered to be in violation.
Enforcement orders. Failure to meet the requirements of an order (e.g. interim
limits, milestone dates), whether the order was entered into voluntarily or
mandated by the POTW, shall be considered a violation. Missing a scheduled
compliance milestone by more than 90 days is considered SNC.
5. Responses: Time Frames, Responsible Officials, Escalated Actions.
Appendix B further outlines types of violations and specifies POTW actions
(initial and escalated), time frames, and the officials responsible for
completing the actions. This chart shall be considered a part of the
Enforcement Response Plan.
Responses to violations affecting the operation of the POTW, resulting in POTW
NPDES violations, or resulting in environmental harm or endangerment to human
health will be taken immediately or as soon as possible following discovery.
A user may be sent a notice of violation (NOV) or notice of noncompliance (NNC)
for each individual violation. Alternatively, the violations may be summarized
over a period of time not to exceed six months. In general, NOVs in response to
violations of permit limits will be taken within 30 days of discovery of the
violations. Users found to be in SNC for two consecutive six month periods will
be issued an enforceable order to return to compliance. In all cases, escalated
or continuing enforcement action will be taken against users who do not return
to compliance in a timely manner.
Cases of falsifying reports, tampering with monitoring or sampling equipment,
or otherwise preventing the collection of representative data may be referred
to the District Attorney for possible criminal investigation.
Show cause hearings may be held at the Director’s discretion prior to taking
enforcement actions.

the legal, financial, character, technical, and other public interest

control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control
over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the town at
its discretion, and during the period of time it shall have the right to
petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the town finds
that the transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character,

satisfactory, the town will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of
the franchise as are in the public interest. The consent of the town to the
transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   (E)   The consent or approval of the town to any transfer of the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the town in and to
the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to

      (1)   In the event the town revokes the franchise pursuant to provisions
of this chapter, or at the normal expiration of the franchise term, the town
shall have the right, directly or as an intermediary, to purchase the cable
communications system. The purchase price shall be based upon the value of the

to another person, be paid any consideration by any party for the activities.
      (2)   The date of valuation shall be no earlier than the day following
the date of expiration or revocation and no later than the date the town makes
an appropriate offer for the system.
      (3)   The value of the cable system shall be determined by a qualified
appraiser appointed by the town and in accordance with the Cable Act. The
appraiser shall determine the worth of the assets as follows:
         (a)   If a franchise held by the grantee is revoked for cause and the
town acquires ownership of the system or effects a transfer of ownership of the
system to another person, any such acquisition shall be at an equitable price;
or
         (b)   If a renewal of a franchise held by the grantee is denied and
the town acquires ownership of the system or effects a transfer of ownership of
the system to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair
market value.
      (4)   Upon receipt of reasonable notice of the town’s intent to purchase
the system at the value established above, the grantee shall have 30 days
within which to accept that valuation as the purchase price of the system. In
the event that purchase price is not acceptable, the parties shall have 120
days in which to negotiate an acceptable purchase price.
      (5)   Upon exercise of this option and the payment of the agreed upon sum
by the town and its service of reasonable notice of the action upon the
grantee, the grantee shall immediately transfer to the town possession and
title to all facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable
communications system, free from any and all liens and encumbrances not agreed
to be assumed by the town in lieu of some portion of the purchase price set
forth above; and the grantee shall execute the warranty, deeds, or other
instruments of conveyance to the town as shall be necessary for this purpose.
      (6)   In the event the town and the grantee are unable to agree upon the
value of the cable communications system within the time limits set forth
above, either party may require by reasonable notice to the other that the
value of the cable communications system be submitted to arbitration in the
following manner.
         (a)   The town and the grantee shall each, within 15 days after the
notice, select an arbitrator who shall be a disinterested person with
reasonable knowledge and experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated.

arbitrator who shall likewise be a disinterested person having reasonable
knowledge and experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated.
         (b)   Within 30 days after appointment of all arbitrators and upon ten
days’ written notice to the parties, the panel of arbitrators shall commence a
hearing on the issue of valuation and shall receive all relevant information
from the parties. The value of the system as determined by the arbitration
panel shall be in accordance with division (A)(3) above.
         (c)   The hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the
request of either party. All hearing proceedings, debate and deliberations
shall be open to the public and at the times and places as contained in the
notice or as thereafter publicly stated, except that, at the request of either
of the parties, debate and deliberations may be held in closed session.
         (d)   Within 30 days after the close of the hearing, the panel of
arbitrators shall prepare findings and a decision agreed upon by a majority of
the panel, which shall be filed with the town and served by mail immediately
upon the grantee. Should there be no majority decision, the proceedings shall
become null and void and shall be started anew, unless the parties extend by
mutual agreement the time in which the panel of arbitrators may make a
decision.
         (e)   Either party may seek judicial relief in the following
circumstances:
            1.   A party fails to select an arbitrator;
            2.   The arbitrators fail to select a third arbitrator;
            3.   One or more arbitrators is unqualified in either party’s
opinion;
            4.   Designated time limits have been exceeded;
            5.   The decision was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue
means;
            6.   There was evident partiality on the part of the independent
arbitrator who represents neither the grantee nor the town;
            7.   The arbitration panel exceeded the authority granted
hereunder; and/or
            8.   Based upon the record, the panel abused its discretion.
         (f)   In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
judicial relief is appropriate to the circumstances set forth above, the court
in its discretion may order the arbitration procedure repeated and issue
findings, orders, and directions.
         (g)   The expenses of the arbitrators selected by each party shall be
borne by that party, and the expenses of the third arbitrator and those
expenses incurred by the panel as a whole shall be borne equally by the
parties.
         (h)   Upon receipt of the decision of the arbitration panel, the town
shall have 30 days in which to notify the grantee of its intent to exercise its
option to purchase the system. The purchase price shall be the value of the
system as determined by the arbitration panel in accordance with division (A)
(3) above.
      (7)   At any time prior to the actual transfer to the town of possession
and title of the system hereunder, the grantee may operate the system, using
its good faith judgment in all matters, and be compensated therefor in an
amount appropriate to be paid to an independent party providing the same
management services. Revenues collected by the grantee during such a period
shall be considered revenues of the town or other person to whom the town
intends to transfer ownership.
   (B)   Right of town to inspect. The town shall have the right, at its

§ 111.073 EXTENSION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The grantee shall provide service to any new residential dwelling

cost-sharing arrangement with residents. The cost-sharing arrangement shall
consist of the following.
      (1)   On the request of five or more potential subscribers desiring
service, the grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost
analysis to determine the cost of plant extension required to provide service
to each subscriber from the closest point where available quality signals
exist.
      (2)   The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following
formula: If a request for extension of service into a residential area requires
the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least 50 potential
subscribers per strand or trench mile, the grantee and subscribers will each
bear their proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if there are
25 subscribers per strand mile or trench mile, the grantee’s share will equal
25/50 or 1/2 of construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by
each subscriber. After completion of the project, should additional subscribers

those facilities are required to be placed underground by the town or are
placed underground, the grantee shall likewise place its services underground
without additional cost to the town or to the individual subscriber so served.
Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this chapter or the
franchise agreement, the grantee’s system shall be located underground at the
request of the adjacent property owner, provided that the excess cost over the

cost and expense and in a manner approved by the town, replace and restore all
paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping, or surface of any street or alley
disturbed, in as good a condition as, or better than, before the work was

trimming may be done by it, or under its supervision and direction, at the
expense of the grantee.
   (G)   Easements. All necessary easements over and under private property
shall be arranged for by the grantee.
   (H)   Work within right-of-way. Consistent with the town’s policy for

street or right-of-way must be approved by the town manager. During repairs or
improvements, traffic on streets must be maintained. Where full closing of the

However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall
give rise to a vested interest, and the poles or structures shall be removed or
modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the town determines that
the public convenience would be enhanced thereby.
   (B)   Where poles already in existence for use in serving the town are
available for use by the grantee, the town may require the grantee to use the

reasonable.
   (C)   Where a public utility serving the town desires to make use of the
poles or other wire-holding structures of the grantee, but agreement thereof
with the grantee cannot be reached, the town may require the grantee to permit
the use for the consideration and upon the terms as the town shall determine to
be just anc reasonable, if the town determines that the use would enhance the
public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee’s operation.

§ 150.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Murphy
are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property,
health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008; Am. Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 150.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008; Am. Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 150.04 OBJECTIVES.

projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and

the reference level elevation, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the
reference level, in relation to mean sea level prior to the required foundation
wall and floor framing inspection. Any work done within the seven-day calendar
period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit
holder's risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by the review shall be corrected by the permit
holder immediately and prior to further work being permitted to proceed.
Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required corrections
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
         (c)   A final as-built elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is
required after construction is completed and prior to Certificate of

construction of the elevation of the reference level and all attendant
utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by the review shall be corrected by the permit
holder immediately and prior to Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy issuance.
In some instances, another certification may be required to certify corrected
as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a Certificate
of Compliance/Occupancy.
      (2)   Floodproofing certificate. If non-residential floodproofing is used
to meet the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation requirements, a floodproofing
certificate (FEMA Form 81-65), with supporting data, an operational plan, and
an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start of
any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the floodproofed design
elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to
mean sea level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by
same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data, the
operational plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies
detected by the review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit
approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required
corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to
construct in accordance with the certified design shall be cause to withhold
the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy.
      (3)   Manufactured home. If a manufactured home is placed within Zone A,
AO, or AE, or A1- 30 and the elevation of the chassis is more than 36 inches in
height above grade, an engineered foundation certification is required in
accordance with the provisions of §
150.41 (C)(2).
      (4)   Watercourse. If a watercourse is to be altered or relocated, a
description of the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation; a
professional engineer's certified report on the effects of the proposed project
on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the effects to properties
located both upstream and downstream; and a map showing the location of the
proposed watercourse alteration or relocation shall all be submitted by the
permit applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit.
      (5)   Certification exemptions. The following structures, if located
within Zone A, AO, or AE or A1-30, are exempt from the elevation/floodproofing
certification requirements specified in divisions (C)(1) and (2) above:
         (a)   Recreational vehicles meeting requirements of §

flood hazard risk zone with multiple Base Flood Elevations (BFEs), the
provisions for the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest BFE
shall apply.
(Ord. passed 11-3-2008; Am. Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 150.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data have
been provided, as set forth in §
150.07 or §
150.42, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
150.40 are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation, as defined in §
150.05.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation, as defined in §
150.05. Structures located in A, AE, AD, and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed to
the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AD Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with §
150.45(C)(2). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the floodproofing standards of this section are satisfied. The
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in
§
150.26(C), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation, as defined in §
150.05.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. §143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is
above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) below.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of the enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation; and
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
      (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures
for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry
or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an
enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure; and
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction; and
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions);
and/or
      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction of divisions (H)(1)
through (5) below.
   (G)   Recreational vehicle parks of subdivisions.
      (1)   Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for a
recreational vehicle park:
         (a)   RV park developers, owners, and operators shall prepare and
maintain a current comprehensive Emergency Evacuation Plan defining how, when,
and where all vehicles are to be removed to a safe location during approaching
storm, flood, or hazard events. The Emergency Evacuation Plan shall be
submitted to the Cherokee County Emergency Management Department and approved
prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit.
         (b)   All RV park emergency evacuation plans must be updated annually
and submitted to the Cherokee County Emergency Department for approval.
         (c)   The Emergency Evacuation Plan for each RV Park having property
in the special flood hazard area shall be implemented and supported by a
written set of park regulations. The park regulations shall be submitted for
review and approval along with the Emergency Evacuation Plan prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit.
         (d)   Approval of the Emergency Evacuation Plan and the park
regulations does not relieve the RV park owner or land owner of any
responsibility or liability for providing the maximum practical extent of
protection against downstream loss of life or property when RVs are resident on
the site. Neither does the approval of the Emergency Evacuation Plan and the
park regulations create or transfer any liability to the Town of Murphy and any
of its employees or agents.
      (2)   The park regulations shall include at a minimum the following
requirements.
         (a)   A set of keys to the RV and a current contact telephone number
must be in the possession of the RV park owner or operator at all times the RV
is parked on a site in the special flood hazard area.
         (b)   The owner of the RV must sign a release of liability available
from the RV park owner giving the RV park owner or operator the right to
evacuate the owner's RV(s) to a safe location or to anchor/tether the RV(s) in
case of flood warning and the owner is away from the site. The release form
shall notify the RV owner that under flooding conditions, the RV may be damaged
or destroyed.
      (3)   Known hazards disclosure. The RV park owner is responsible for
posting a sign at the utility connection station on each RV parking site
advising the RV owner that the site is located within a FEMA-designated special
flood hazard area and is subject to damage or loss of property and life during
a flood event. Further, the sign on each site shall advise the RV owner of the
potential water depth at the site during a Base Flood Event (Base Flood
Elevation minus the local grade elevation where the RV is parked). If the RV
park owner elects to state a single water depth to standardize the maximum
water depth on the entire RV park shall be listed.
      (4)   Inspections.
         (a)   The Town of Murphy has the right to access all RV parks and RV
parking sites at any time for the purpose of a compliance inspection. A

§ 151.04 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is
filed with the Public Officer by a public authority or by at least five
residents of the town, charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for
human habitation, or whenever it appears to the Public Officer (on his own
motion) , that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, the
Public Officer shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for
such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in
interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit a complaint stating the charges and
containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the Public Officer (or
his designated agent) at a place fixed in the notice, not less than ten nor
more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint. The owner or any party in
interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear
in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the
complaint. Notice of the hearing shall also be given to at least one of the
persons signing a petition relating to the dwelling. Any person desiring to do
so may attend the hearing and give evidence. The rules of evidence prevailing
in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the
Public Officer.
   (B)   Procedure after hearing. If after notice and hearing the Public
Officer determines that the dwelling under consideration is unfit for human
habitation, he or she shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of
that determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner
thereof an order.
      (1)   Deteriorated dwelling, dwelling unit. If the Public Officer
determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he or she shall
state in writing his or her findings of fact in support of that determination,
and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner an order directing and
requiring the owner to repair, alter or improve the dwelling or dwelling unit
in order to render it fit for human habitation within a specified period of
time, not to exceed 90 days. The order may require that the property be vacated
and closed only if continued occupancy during the time allowed for repair will
present a significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of
the necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current state of the
property; and any additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors
under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. The
order shall state that the failure to make timely repairs as directed in the
order shall make the dwelling subject to the issuance of an unfit order under
division (C)(1) of this section.
      (2)   Dilapidated dwelling. If the Public Officer determines that the
dwelling is dilapidated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings
of fact to support that determination, and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner an order directing and requiring the owner either to repair,
alter or improve the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation or to
remove or demolish such dwelling within a specified period of time not to
exceed 90 days.
      (3)   Vacated and closed dwellings.
         (a)   If the Board of Commissioners shall have adopted an ordinance as
described in division (C) below, ordering a dwelling to be repaired, altered or
improved pursuant to the findings of the Public Officer pursuant to divisions
(B)(1) or (2) above or division (C) below, and if the owner has vacated and
closed such dwelling and kept such dwelling vacated and closed for a period of
one year pursuant to the ordinance or order, then if the Board of Commissioners
shall find that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter
or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation and that
the continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be
inimical to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the city in that the
dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard,
would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on
criminal activities, would cause and contribute to blight and the deterioration
of property values in the area, and would render unavailable property and a
dwelling which might otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent
shortage of decent and affordable housing in this state, then in such
circumstances, the Board of Commissioners, may, after the expiration of such
one year period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner,
setting forth the following:
            1.   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render
it fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish the dwelling within 90 days; or
            2.   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render
it fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the
then current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
         (b)   An ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall be recorded
in the office of the Register of Deeds of Cherokee County, North Carolina, and
shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the
owner fails to comply with this section, the Public Officer shall effectuate
the purpose of the ordinance.
         (c)   For the purpose of this section, the current value of a dwelling
or structure shall be defined as the fair market value as determined by a
certified appraiser or the current tax value on record with the Cherokee County
Tax Office, whichever is less.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or
dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the Public Officer to
repair, alter or improve, or to vacate and close the dwelling or dwelling unit
within the time specified, or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling or
dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the Public Officer to
repair, alter or improve, or to vacate and close and remove or demolish the
dwelling or dwelling unit within the time specified, the Public Officer may
submit to the Board of Commissioners at its next regular meeting a resolution
directing the Town Attorney to institute appropriate action in the General
Court of Justice of Cherokee County, North Carolina, for an order directing
that owner comply with the order of the Public Officer, as authorized by G.S.
§160D-1208(e).
      (2)   In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated or
dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with an order of the Public
Officer within the time specified, if injunctive relief has not been sought or
has not been granted as provided in division (C)(1) above, the Public Officer
shall submit to the Board of Commissioners an ordinance ordering the Public
Officer to cause that dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered,
improved, vacated, closed, removed or demolished, as provided in the original
order of the Public Officer, and pending removal or demolition, to place a
placard on that dwelling as provided by G.S. § 160D-1203 and §
155.14.
   (D)   Appeals from orders of the Public Officer.
      (1)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Public Officer may be
taken by any aggrieved person. Any appeal from the Public Officer shall be
taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the
order and shall be taken by filing with the Public Officer and with the Housing
Appeals Board a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the
appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the Public Officer
shall forthwith transmit to the Housing Appeals Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an
appeal is from a decision of the Public Officer refusing to allow the aggrieved
person to do any act, his or her decision shall remain in force until modified
or reversed. When an appeal is from a decision of the Public Officer requiring
the aggrieved person to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of
suspending the requirement until the hearing by the Housing Appeals Board
unless the Public Officer certifies to the Housing Appeals Board, after the
notice of appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason of the facts stated
in the certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant, a
suspension of this requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property,
in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except for due cause shown
upon not less than one day's written notice to the Public Officer, by the
Housing Appeals Board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to
G.S. §160D-1208(d) and division (E) of this section.
      (2)   The Housing Appeals Board shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall
render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or
by agent or attorney. The Housing Appeals Board may reverse or affirm, wholly
or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such
decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to
that end shall have all the powers of the Public Officer; but the concurring
vote of four members of the Housing Appeals Board shall be necessary to reverse
or modify any decision or order of the Public Officer. The Housing Appeals
Board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there
are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out
the strict letter of this chapter, to adapt the application of this chapter to
the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
      (3)   Every decision of the Housing Appeals Board shall be subject to
review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of
the decision of the Board, but not otherwise.
   (E)   Petition to superior court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the Public Officer or a decision rendered by the Board shall have the
right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision,
to petition the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the
Public Officer pending a final disposition of the cause, as provided by G.S.
§160D-1208.
(Ord. passed 8-10-1987; Am. Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 151.05 STANDARDS.
   The public officer may determine that an abandoned structure is a health or
safety hazard if he or she finds that conditions exist in the abandoned
structure that render it dangerous or injurious to the health, safety, or
morals of the occupants or users of the structure, the occupants of neighboring
structures, or other residents of the city. Defective conditions may include
the following (without limiting the generality of the foregoing): defects
therein increasing the hazards of fire, accident, or other calamities; lack of
adequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities; dilapidation, disrepair,

§ 151.06 SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   Complaints or orders issued by a public officer pursuant to this subchapter
shall be served upon persons either personally or by registered or certified
mail. If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are unknown
and cannot be ascertained by the public officer in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, and the public officer makes an affidavit to that effect, then the
serving of the complaint or order upon the unknown owners or other persons may
be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at
least once no later than the time at which personal service would be required
under the provisions of this subchapter. When service is made by publication, a
notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
premises thereby affected.

Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the
decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the
public officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act,
his or her decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any
appeal is from a decision of the public officer requiring the person aggrieved
to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement
until the hearing by the Zoning Board of Adjustment unless the public officer
certifies to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal is
filed with him or her, that because of facts stated in the certificate (a copy
of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his or her
requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case the
requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be
granted for due cause shown upon not less than one-day's written notice to the
public officer, by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, or by a court of record upon
petition.
   (C)   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing
appeals, shall give due notice to the parties, and shall render its decision
within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make any
decision and order that in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to
that end it shall have all the powers of the public officer, but the concurring
vote of four-fifths of the members of the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be
necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the public officer. The
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have power also in passing upon appeals, when
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out
the strict letter of this chapter, to adapt the application of the chapter to
the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the chapter shall be
observed, public health and safety secured, and substantial justice done.

dedication of any street or other ground, public utility line, or other public
facility shown on the plat. However, the Subdivision Administrator may by
resolution accept any dedication made to the public of lands or facilities for
streets, parks, public utility lines, or other public purposes, when the lands
or facilities are located within its subdivision regulation jurisdiction.
Acceptance of dedication of lands or facilities located within the subdivision
regulation jurisdiction but outside the corporate limits of the municipality
shall not place on the town any duty to open, operate, repair, or maintain any
street, utility line, or other land or facility, and the municipality shall in
no event be held to answer in any civil action or proceeding for failure to
open, repair, or maintain any street located outside its corporate limits.

§ 152.51 FINAL PLAT SUBMISSION AND REVIEW FOR MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Preparation of final plat and installation of improvements. Upon
approval of the preliminary plat by the Subdivision Administrator, the
subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the final plat, and the
installation of or arrangement for required improvements in accordance with the
approved preliminary plat and the requirements of this chapter. Prior to
approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall have installed the improvements
specified in this chapter or guaranteed their installation as provided herein.
No final plat will be accepted for review by the Planning Board or the
Subdivision Administrator unless accompanied by written notice by the Town
Manager acknowledging compliance with the improvement and guarantee standards
of this chapter. The final plat shall constitute only that portion of the
preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at that
time; the portion shall conform to all requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Improvements guarantees.
      (1)   Agreement and security required. In lieu of requiring the
completion, installation, and dedication of all improvements prior to final
plat approval, the Town of Murphy may enter into an agreement with the
subdivider whereby the subdivider shall agree to complete all required
improvements. Once the agreement is signed by both parties and the security
required herein is provided, the final plat may be approved by the Planning
Board and Subdivision Administrator if all other requirements of this chapter
are met. To secure this agreement, the subdivider shall provide, subject to the
approval of the Subdivision Administrator, either one, or a combination of the
following guarantees not exceeding 1.25 times the entire cost as provided
herein. For any specific development, the type of performance guarantee from
the range specified by the town shall be at the election of the developer.
         (a)   Duration. The duration of the performance guarantee shall
initially be one year, unless the developer determines that the scope of work
for the required improvements necessitates a longer duration. In the case of a
bonded obligation, the completion date shall be set one year from the date the
bond is issued, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the
required improvements necessitates a longer duration.
         (b)   Surety performance bond(s). The subdivider shall obtain a
performance bond(s) from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in
North Carolina. The bonds shall be payable to the Town of Murphy, and shall be
in an amount equal to 1.25 times the entire cost, as estimated by the
subdivider and approved by the Subdivision Administrator, of installing all
required improvements. The duration of the bond(s) shall be until the time as
the improvements are accepted by the Subdivision Administrator.
         (c)   Cash or equivalent security.
            1.   The subdivider shall deposit cash, an irrevocable letter of
credit, or other instrument readily convertible into cash at face value, either
with the town or in escrow with a financial institution designated as an
official depository of the town. The use of any instrument other than cash
shall be subject to the approval of the Subdivision Administrator. The amount
of deposit shall be equal to 1.25 times the cost, as estimated by the
subdivider and approved by the Subdivision Administrator, of installing all
required improvements.
            2.   If cash or other instrument is deposited in escrow with a
financial institution as provided above, then the subdivider shall file with
the Subdivision Administrator an agreement between the financial institution
and himself guaranteeing the following:
               a.   That the escrow account shall be held in trust until
released by the Subdivision Administrator and may not be used or pledged by the
subdivider in any other matter during the term of the escrow; and
               b.   That in the case of a failure on the part of the subdivider

§ 152.68 SUBDIVISION DESIGN.
   (A)   Blocks.
      (1)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to: provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the type of use contemplated; zoning requirements; needs for vehicular
and pedestrian circulation; control and safety of street traffic; limitations
and opportunities of topography; and convenient access to water areas.
      (2)   Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet or more than 1,800 feet.
      (3)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth except where single-tier lots are required to separate
residential development from through vehicular traffic or another type of use,
in nonresidential subdivisions, or where abutting a water area.
      (4)   Where deemed necessary by the Subdivision Administrator, a
pedestrian crosswalk at least 15 feet in width may be required to provide
convenient public access to a public area such as a park or school, to a water
area, or to areas such as shopping centers, religious or transportation
facilities.
      (5)   Block numbers shall conform to the town street numbering system, if
applicable.
   (B)   Lots.
      (1)   All lots in new subdivisions shall conform to the zoning
requirements of the district in which the subdivision is located. Conformance
to zoning requirements means, among other things, that the smallest lot in the
subdivision must meet all dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance. It
is not sufficient merely for the average lot to meet zoning requirements.
      (2)   Within hillside subdivisions, the minimum lot area and minimum lot
width, specified in the zoning requirements of the district in which the
subdivision is located, shall be increased by 5% for each 1% by which the
average slope of the subdivision exceeds 15%.
      (3)   Lots shall meet any applicable Cherokee County Health Department
requirements, including minimum lot areas and dimensions required for on-site
water supply and/or wastewater disposal.
      (4)   Double frontage lots shall be avoided wherever possible.
      (5)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to or radial
to street lines.
   (C)   Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows.
      (1)   Utility easements. Easements for underground or above ground
utilities shall be provided, where necessary, across lots or centered on rear
or side lot lines and shall be at least 20-feet wide for water and sanitary
sewer lines and as required by the companies involved, for telephone, gas, and
power lines. The Subdivision Administrator will determine whether one easement
is sufficient or whether several easements are necessary to accommodate the
various facilities and the subdivider shall provide the required easements.
      (2)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a stream or
drainage-way, an easement shall be provided conforming with the lines of the
stream and of sufficient width as will be adequate for the purpose.

§ 152.69 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   Type of street required. All subdivision lots shall abut at least 35
feet on a public street, with the exception of lots which abut a cul-de-sac, in
which case the required abutment shall be 20 feet. All public streets shall be
dedicated to the Town of Murphy, the State of North Carolina, or the public as
determined appropriate by the Subdivision Administrator. All public streets
shall be built to the standards of this chapter and all other applicable
standards of the Town of Murphy and the N.C. Department of Transportation.
Public streets not dedicated to the town which are eligible for acceptance into
the State Highway System shall be constructed to the standards necessary to be
put on the State Highway System or the standards in this chapter, whichever is
stricter, in regard to each particular item and shall be put on the system.
Streets not dedicated to the town which are not eligible to be put on the State
Highway System because there are too few lots or residences shall,
nevertheless, be dedicated to the public and shall be in accordance with the
standards in this chapter or the standards necessary to be put on the State
Highway System, whichever is stricter in regard to each particular item, so as
to be eligible to be put on the system at a later date. A written maintenance
agreement with provisions for maintenance of the street until it is put on the
state system shall be included with the final plat.
   (B)   Subdivision street disclosure statement. All streets shown on the
final plat shall be designated in accordance with G.S. § 136-102.6, and
designation as public shall be conclusively presumed an offer of dedication to
the public. Where streets are dedicated to the public but not accepted into a
municipal or the state system, before lots are sold, a statement explaining the
status of the street shall be included with the final plat.
   (C)   Street classification. In all new subdivisions, streets that are
dedicated to public use shall be classified as provided in herein. The
classification shall be based upon the projected volume of traffic to be
carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day. The
number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a useful
indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive. Whenever a subdivision
street continues an existing street that formerly terminated outside the
subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street will be continued
beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the street
will be based upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the
subdivision. The classification of streets shall be as follows.
      (1)   Minor. A street whose sole function is to provide access to
abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve not more than nine
dwelling units and is expected to or does handle up to 75 trips per day.
      (2)   Local. A street whose sole function is to provide access to
abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve at least ten but not
more than 25 dwelling units and is expected to or does handle between 75 and
200 trips per day.
      (3)   Cul-de-sac. A street that terminates in a vehicular turn-around.
      (4)   Subcollector. A street whose sole principal function is to provide
access to abutting properties but is also designed to be used or is used to
connect minor and local streets with collector or arterial streets. Including
residences indirectly served through connecting streets, it serves or is
designed to serve at least 26 but not more than 100 dwelling units and is
expected to or does handle between 200 and 800 trips per day.
      (5)   Collector. A street whose principal function is to carry traffic
between minor, local, and subcollector streets and arterial streets but that
may also provide direct access to abutting properties. It serves or is designed
to serve, directly or indirectly, more than 100 dwelling units and is designed
to be used or is used to carry more than 800 trips per day.
      (6)   Arterial. A major street in the town’s street system that serves as
an avenue for the circulation of traffic into, out, or around the town and
carries high volumes of traffic.
      (7)   Marginal access street. A street that is parallel to and adjacent
to an arterial street and that is designed to provide access to abutting
properties so that these properties are somewhat sheltered from the effects of
the through traffic on the arterial not impeded by direct driveway access from
a large number of abutting properties.
   (D)   Access to public streets in general. Every lot shall have either
direct or indirect access to a public street. A lot has direct access to a
public street if a sufficient portion of a boundary of the lot abuts the public
street right-of-way so that an access way meeting the criteria set forth herein
can be established. A lot has indirect access if it connects to a public street
by means of one or more private roads that are of sufficient size to meet the
criteria set forth herein.
      (1)   Standard for access. The access provided must be adequate to afford
a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well as for
all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its intended use.
      (2)   Access to arterial streets. Whenever a major subdivision that
involves the creation of one or more new streets borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, no direct driveway access may be provided
from the lots within this subdivision onto this street.
   (E)   Entrances to streets. All driveway entrances and other openings onto
streets within the town’s planning jurisdiction shall be constructed so that
(a) vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any
substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles traveling in
abutting streets, and (b) interference with the free and convenient flow of
traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized.
   (F)   Coordination with surrounding streets. The street system of a
subdivision shall be coordinated with existing, proposed and anticipated
streets outside the development or outside the portion of a single tract that
is being divided into lots (hereinafter, “surrounding streets”) as provided in
this section.
      (1)   Collector streets shall intersect with surrounding collector or
arterial streets at safe and convenient locations.
      (2)   Subcollector, local, and minor residential streets shall connect
with surrounding streets where necessary to permit the convenient movement of
traffic between residential neighborhoods or to facilitate access to
neighborhoods by emergency service vehicles or for other sufficient reasons,
but connections shall not be permitted where the effect would be to encourage
the use of such streets by substantial through-traffic.
      (3)   Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets
are required by this section, the street right-of-way shall be extended and the
street developed to the property line of the subdivided property (or to the
edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract) at the point where
the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. In addition,
the permit issuing authority may require temporary turn-arounds to be
constructed at the end of such streets pending their extension when such
turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate
emergency vehicles. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no
temporary dead-end street in excess of 1,000 feet may be created unless no
other practicable alternative is available.
   (G)   Street width and drainage requirements in subdivisions. Street rights-
of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: (1) to carry
motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking; (2) to
provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian and bicycle traffic;
and; and (3) to serve as an important link in the town's drainage system. All
streets shall be constructed with curb and gutter and shall conform to the
other requirements of this section. Any style of curb and gutter design, if
designed as approved by the North Carolina Department of Transportation for use
on residential streets, may be used, subject to the prior approval of the
Subdivision Administrator. Street pavement width shall be measured from the
outer edge of each curb.
 
Type Street  Minimum Right-of-Way Minimum Pavement Width
Minor        30'                  18'
Local        40'                  22'
Subcollector 50'                  34'
Collector    50'                  34'
 
   (H)   General layout of streets.
      (1)   Subcollector, local, and minor residential streets shall be curved
whenever practicable to the extent necessary to avoid conformity of lot
appearance.
      (2)   To the extent practicable, driveway access to collector streets
shall be minimized to facilitate the free flow of traffic and avoid traffic
hazards.
      (3)   All permanent dead-end streets shall be developed as cul-de-sacs in
accordance with the standards set forth in division H(4) unless approved by the
Subdivision Administrator to aid in future connectivity between neighborhoods
or developments. Except where no other practicable alternative is available,
such streets may not extend more than 500 feet (measured to the center of the
turnaround).
      (4)   The right-of-way of a cul-de-sac shall have a radius of 30 feet.
The radius of the paved portion of the turn-around (measured to the outer edge
of the pavement) shall be 30 feet. The entire cul-de-sac shall be paved. No
parking shall be permitted on the cul-de-sac.
      (5)   Alleys.
         (a)   Alleys shall be required to serve lots used for commercial and
industrial purposes except that this requirement may be waived where other
definite and assured provision is made for service access. Alleys shall not be
provided in residential subdivisions unless necessitated by unusual
circumstances.
         (b)   The width of an alley shall be at least 20 feet.
         (c)   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if
unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turn around facilities at the dead
end as may be approved by the Subdivision Administrator.
         (d)   Sharp changes in alignment and grade shall be avoided.
         (e)   All alleys shall be designed in accordance with N.C. Department
of Transportation standards.
      (6)   Half streets (i.e., streets of less than the full required right-
of-way and pavement width) shall not be permitted except where such streets,
when combined with a similar street (developed previously or simultaneously) on
property adjacent to the subdivision, creates or comprises a street that meets
the right-of-way and pavement requirements of this chapter.
      (7)   Streets shall be laid out so that residential blocks do not exceed
1,000 feet, unless no other practicable alternative is available.
      (8)   Streets shall be designed or walkways dedicated to assure
convenient access to parks, playgrounds, schools, or other places of public
assembly. If convenient access to parks, playgrounds, schools, or other places
of public assembly is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to
streets in the subdivision, the subdivider shall reserve and provide an
unobstructed, clear and graded easement having a width of at least 15 feet to
provide such access.
      (9)   Poles for overhead utilities should be located clear of roadway
shoulders. On streets with curb and gutter, utility poles should be set back a
minimum distance of six feet from the face of curb.
   (I)   Street intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and
no two streets may intersect at less than 60 degrees. No more than two streets
shall intersect at any one point, unless the public works director certifies to
the permit issuing authority that such an intersection can be constructed with
no extraordinary danger to public safety.
      (2)   Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a
street shall coincide with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite
side of such street. In any event, where a center line offset (jog) occurs at
an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets
shall be not less than 200 feet.
      (3)   No two streets may intersect with any other street on the same side
at a distance of less than 400 feet measured from centerline to centerline of
the intersecting street. When the intersected street is an arterial, the
distance between intersecting streets shall be at least 1,000 feet.
   (J)   Construction standards and specifications. Except as modified herein,
streets shall be designed to comply with the design and construction standards
of the North Carolina Department of Transportation. These standards shall apply
to all streets and road, whether public or private and whether the streets and
roads are to be placed on the municipal or state highway system.
   (K)   Road and sidewalk requirements in unsubdivided developments. Within
unsubdivided developments, all private roads and access ways shall be designed
and constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor
vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic. Width of roads, use of curb and
gutter, and paving specifications shall be determined by the provisions of this
chapter. To the extent not otherwise covered in the foregoing subchapters, and
to the extent that the requirements set forth in this section for subdivision
streets may be relevant to the roads in unsubdivided developments, the
requirements of this section may be applied to satisfy the standard set forth
in the first sentence of this division.
      (1)   Whenever a road in an unsubdivided development connects two or more
subcollector, collector, or arterial streets in such a manner that any
substantial volume of through traffic is likely to make use of this road, such
road shall be constructed in accordance with the standards applicable to
subdivision streets and shall be dedicated. In other cases when roads in
unsubdivided developments within the town are constructed in accordance with
the specifications for subdivision streets, the town may accept an offer of
dedication of such streets.
      (2)   In all unsubdivided multi-family residential developments,
sidewalks shall be provided linking dwelling units with other dwelling units,
the public street, and on-site activity centers such as parking areas, laundry
facilities, and recreational areas and facilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, sidewalks shall not be required where pedestrians have access to a
road that serves not more than nine dwelling units.
      (3)   Whenever the permit issuing authority finds that a means of
pedestrian access is necessary from an unsubdivided development to schools,
parks, playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that such access is not
conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the developer may be
required to reserve and provide an unobstructed clear and graded easement
having a width of at least 15 feet to provide such access.
      (4)   In unsubdivided nonresidential developments that abut a public
street, sidewalks shall be constructed adjacent to such street if a sidewalk in
that location is necessary to continue a pre-existing sidewalk. Whenever
possible, such sidewalk shall be constructed within the public right-of-way. If
construction of such sidewalk within the public right-of-way is not possible,
the developer may be required to reserve and provide an unobstructed clear and
graded easement having a width of at least 15 feet to provide such access.
      (5)   The sidewalks required by this section shall be five feet wide, or
at the width currently required by the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990
as amended, whichever is wider, and otherwise shall be constructed according to
the specifications for the construction of concrete sidewalks as provided in
the most recent edition of the Construction Manual of the North Carolina
Department of Transportation, except that the permit issuing authority may
permit the installation of walkways constructed with other suitable materials
when it concludes that (a) such walkways would serve the residents of the
development as adequately as concrete sidewalks and (b) such walkways could be
more environmentally desirable or more in keeping with the overall design of
the development. Variances of the width requirement in this section shall be
considered pursuant to applicable law, based on geographical obstacles or
structural obstacles. In the event that the sidewalk is permitted to be
constructed less than five feet width requirement, then a 60-inch passing space
must be located at least every 200 feet. Bus transit stops, driveways and
building entrances may be counted as passing spaces. The Subdivision
Administrator may approve an alternate plan that proposes different pedestrian
amenities provided that the intent of this section is fulfilled.
      (6)   Street and sidewalk construction to provide handicapped access.
Whenever curb and gutter construction is used on public streets, wheelchair
ramps for the handicapped shall be provided at intersections and other major
points of pedestrian flow. Wheelchair ramps and depressed curbs shall be
constructed in accordance with published standards of the North Carolina
Department of Transportation, Di vision of Highways. In unsubdivided
developments, sidewalk construction for the handicapped shall conform to the
requirements of the North Carolina State Building Code.
      (7)   Street names and house numbers.
         (a)   Street names shall be assigned by the developer subject to the
approval of the Board of Commissioners. Proposed streets that are obviously in
alignment with existing streets shall be given the same name. Newly created
streets shall be given names that neither duplicate nor are phonetically
similar to existing streets within the town’s planning jurisdiction, regardless
of the use of different suffixes (such as those set forth in herein). Street
names shall include a suffix such as the following:
            1.   Circle: A short street that returns to itself.
            2.   Court or place: A cul-de-sac or dead-end street.
            3.   Loop: A street that begins at the intersection with one street
and circles back to end at another intersection with the same street.
            4.   Street: All public streets not designated by another suffix.
         (b)   Building numbers shall be assigned by the town in coordination
with the Cherokee County 911 addressing program.
   (L)   Bridges. All bridges in subdivided and unsubdivided developments shall
be constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications of the North
Carolina Department of Transportation, except that bridges on roads not
intended for public dedication in unsubdivided developments may be approved if
designed by a licensed architect or engineer.
   (M)   Sidewalk requirements. All new development or redevelopment shall have
sidewalks, with curb and gutter and necessary storm sewer, along each public
street abutting the development in accordance with the standards of the town,
including without limitation the standards for sidewalks contained in division
(K) above.
      (1)   The sidewalks shall be constructed to a minimum width of five feet
and shall otherwise be constructed according to the specifications for the
construction of concrete sidewalks as provided in the most recent edition of
the Construction Manual of the North Carolina Department of Transportation. All
sidewalks shall be placed in the right-of-way unless the development is platted
as a planned unit or group development.
      (2)   All costs associated with the sidewalk, curb and gutter, and storm
sewer shall be borne by the developer.
      (3)   All sidewalk, curb and gutter, and storm sewer shall be dedicated
to the town for perpetual maintenance. All such dedicated improvements shall be
guaranteed for one year following the date of acceptance by the town. Any
defects in material and/or workmanship during the one-year period shall be
immediately corrected by the developer.
      (4)   Payment of fee in lieu of construction of sidewalks. When site
characteristics and/or traffic patterns are such that the construction of
sidewalks in accordance with this section would be a hardship and would not
result in useful pedestrian walkways, the Town Administrator may allow the
applicant to pay the cost of constructing such sidewalks into the Town Sidewalk
Fund in lieu of requiring construction of the sidewalks.

Transportation, as reflected in Handbook for the Design of Highway Surface
Drainage Structures, 1973, subject to review by the town consulting engineer.
      (1)   No surface water shall be channeled or directed into a sanitary
sewer.
      (2)   Where feasible, the subdivider shall connect to an existing storm
drainage system.
      (3)   Where an existing storm drainage system cannot feasibly be extended
to the subdivision, a surface drainage system shall be designed to protect the
proposed development from water damage.
      (4)   Surface drainage courses shall have side slopes of at least three
feet of horizontal distance for each one foot of vertical distance, and courses
shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the drainage area without flooding,

§ 152.71 BUFFERING, RECREATION, AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Buffering. Whenever a residential subdivision is located adjacent to
an office, institutional, commercial, or industrial use which does not have a
buffer, or property zoned for these uses, and a buffer is not required between
these and the subdivision, the subdivider shall provide a buffer as defined in
§152.10. The width of the buffer shall be in addition to the lot area required
by the zoning ordinance. The buffer shall become part of the lot on which it is
located, or in the case of commonly owned property, shall be deeded to the
homeowners' association.
   (B)   Recreation and open space.
      (1)   Every person or corporation who subdivides land into 25 or more
lots for residential purposes shall be required to dedicate a portion of the
land, as set forth in this chapter for the purposes of park, recreation, and
open space sites to serve the residents of the neighborhood in which the
subdivision is located. The amount of land required to be dedicated by a
subdivider shall be determined as follows: The minimum amount of land that
shall be dedicated for recreation, parks, or open space in all subdivisions of
25 lots or more shall be one-half acre for each subdivision, or 5% of the gross
acreage, whichever is greatest.
      (2)   Criteria for evaluating suitability of proposed recreation, parks,
and open space areas shall include, but not be limited to, the following as
determined by the Subdivision Administrator in consultation with the Murphy
Recreation Commission, and, if needed, the town consulting engineer.
         (a)   Unity. The dedicated land shall be a single parcel except where
it is determined that two or more parcels would be in the public interest. The
Subdivision Administrator may require that parcels be connected, and may
require the dedication of a connecting path of up to 60 feet, and in no case
less than 30 feet in width in addition to the land required in division (B)(1)
above.
         (b)   Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to serve the
recreation needs of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision.
         (c)   Accessibility. Public access to the dedicated land shall be
provided either by an abutting street or public easement. The easement may be
required to be up to 60 feet in width and shall in no case be less than 30 feet
in width.
         (d)   Usability. The dedicated land shall be usable for active
recreation (play areas, ballfields, tennis courts, or similar recreation uses).

cases, the sign owner and/or the property owner shall have 30 days to remedy
all violations set forth in the notice of violation. The 30-day period shall

civil penalty of $50. In the case of a continuing violation, each 24-hour
period during which the violation continues to exist shall constitute a
separate violation. Where multiple violations are located upon a single
property, each shall constitute a separate violation, with each violation
subject to separate fines pursuant to this subsection. The citation shall be
served upon the person(s) described in division (D)(1) of this section by the
means set forth therein. In the event the offender does not pay the penalty
within ten days of service of the citation, the civil penalty shall be
collected by the town in a civil action in the nature of debt, which shall not

issuance of the remove order, including specific reference to the provisions of
the code that have been violated; and
         (c)   In addition to or in lieu of the other remedies set forth in
this section, the Zoning Administrator may seek injunctive relief in the
appropriate court.
      (5)   Removal and recovery expense. If a sign owner or property owner
fails to comply with the requirements of a remove order, the Zoning
Administrator may cause such sign to be removed. The sign owner and property
owner shall be jointly and severally liable for the expense of removal. Notice
of the cost of removal shall be served upon the person(s) described in division
(D)(1) by the means set forth therein. If the sum is not paid within 30 days
thereafter, the sum shall be a lien upon the land or premises where the sign

Administrator shall have the authority to summarily remove, abate, or remedy a
sign which is dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or safety. The
expense of the action shall be paid by the sign owner, or if the sign owner

§ 153.096 INTERPRETATION.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to interpret zoning maps and
pass upon disputed questions of district boundary lines in the administration
of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 6-2-2014; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.097 SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide Special Use
Permits in accordance with §§
153.075 through
153.080.
(Ord. passed 6-2-2014; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.098 APPEALS.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals of decisions of
administrative officials charged with enforcement of the zoning ordinance and
may hear appeals arising out of any other ordinance that regulates land use or
development. As used in this section, the term DECISION includes any final and
binding order, requirement, or determination. Any such appeal shall be heard
pursuant to all of the following:
      (1)   Any person who has standing under G.S. §160D-1402 or the town may
appeal a decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a
notice of appeal with the Town Clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the
grounds for the appeal.
      (2)   The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the
owner of the property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who
sought the decision, if different from the owner. The written notice shall be
delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail.
      (3)   The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the
written notice within which to file an appeal in accordance with G.S. §160D-405
(d). If the written notice is sent by mail only, the town shall presume it is
received on the third business day after it is sent. Any other person with
standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or
constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.
      (4)   It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to
appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing
the words "Zoning Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" in letters at least six
inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information
about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of
the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least ten days.
Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting
shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the
posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Absent an
ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall not be required.
      (5)   The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the
appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if
the appellant is not the owner.
      (6)   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays
enforcement of the action appealed, including fines, from unless the official
who made the decision certifies to the Board of Adjustment after notice of
appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay
would cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is
transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the
ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by
a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement
proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request
for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet
to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or
otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the
ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or
permissions to use such property; in these situations the appellant may request
and the Board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or
building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
      (7)   Subject to the provisions of division (A)(6) above, the Board of
Adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
      (8)   The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing
as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters
stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the city would be unduly
prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of
appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing. The Board of Adjustment may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from
and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to
be made. The Board shall have all the powers of the official who made the
decision.
      (9)   When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. §160D-947 or any other
appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record
below and the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. §160D-1402.
      (10)   The parties to an appeal that has been made under this section may
agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. The
chapter may set standards and procedures to facilitate and manage such
voluntary alternative dispute resolution.

§ 153.099 VARIANCES.
   (A)   When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict
letter of a zoning ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the
provisions of the ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability.
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial
justice is achieved.
   (B)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Any other
ordinance that regulates land use or development may provide for variances
consistent with the provisions of this section.
      (1)   Application for a variance may be made by the landowner, a lessee
or person holding an option or contract to purchase or lease land, or an
authorized agent of the landowner. An easement holder may also apply for a
variance as is authorized by the easement. Approval of a variance runs with the
land.
      (2)   All applications for variances shall be addressed and submitted to
the Board of Adjustment and shall be delivered to the office of the Zoning
Administrator. Upon receipt of an application for a variance, the Board of
Adjustment shall call a public hearing and give notice as specified by §
153.100(B) required by law. Applications for a variance shall be made on the
proper form obtainable from the Zoning Administrator. Some application
requirements may be waived, such as for changes of use in existing buildings
involving no expansions in building or parking areas, and the like.
      (3)   The Board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so
would alter the essential character of the neighborhood, materially diminish or
impair established property values within the surrounding area, or in any other
respect impair the public health or general welfare.
      (4)   Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided
that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.
      (5)   The Board of Adjustment shall refuse to hear an appeal or an
application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been
no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or
application.
      (6)   A variance issued in accordance with this section shall expire if a
zoning certificate or certificate of compliance for such use is not obtained by
the applicant within six months from the date of the decision.
(Ord. passed 6-2-2014; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.100 PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall follow quasi-judicial procedures in
accordance with G.S. §160D-406 when deciding appeals and requests for variances
and special use permits. The Board shall hear and decide all matters upon which
it is required to pass under any statute or ordinance that regulates land use
or development.
   (B)   Notice of hearings conducted pursuant to this section shall be mailed
to the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request is the subject of
the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if
the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land
abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to any
other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by the zoning or unified
development ordinance. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the town may
rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of property entitled to
mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten days, but
not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time
period, the town shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the
site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway
right-of-way.
   (C)   The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board shall be necessary to
grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any
other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of
certiorari. For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the Board and
members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not
be considered members of the Board for calculation of the requisite majority if
there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such members.
   (D)   A member of any board exercising quasi-judicial functions pursuant to
this section shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter in a
manner that would violate affected persons' constitutional rights to an
impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations of due process include, but
are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter
that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close
familial, business, or other associational relationship with an affected
person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection
is raised to a member's participation and that member does not recuse himself
or herself, the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
   (E)   The Chair of the Board or any member acting as Chair and the Clerk (or
substitute "Secretary") to the Board are authorized to administer oaths to
witnesses in any matter coming before the Board. Any person who, while under
oath during a proceeding before the Board of Adjustment, willfully swears
falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (F)   The Board of Adjustment through the Chair, or in the Chair's absence
anyone acting as Chair, may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of
evidence. To request issuance of a subpoena, persons with standing under G.S.
§160D-1402 may make a written request to the Chair explaining why it is
necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The Chair shall
issue requested subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in
nature and scope, and not oppressive. The Chair shall rule on any motion to
quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the Chair may
be appealed to the full Board of Adjustment. If a person fails or refuses to
obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this section, the Board of Adjustment or the
party seeking the subpoena may apply to the General Court of Justice for an
order requiring that its subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have
jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all proper parties.
   (G)   The Board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within
a reasonable time. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent,
material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision
shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Board's determination of contested
facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision
shall be signed by the Chair or other duly authorized member of the Board. A
quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the
Clerk (or "Secretary") to the Board or such other office or official as the
ordinance specifies. The decision of the Board shall be delivered by personal
delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property
owner, and to any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior
to the date the decision becomes effective. The person required to provide
notice shall certify that proper notice has been made.
   (H)   The applicant, the local government, and any person who would have
standing to appeal the decision under G.S. §160D-1402(c) shall have the right
to participate as a party at the evidentiary hearing. Other witnesses may
present competent, material, and substantial evidence that is not repetitive as
allowed by the Board. Objections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary
issues, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal or the
standing of a party, may be made to the Board. The Board Chair shall rule on
any objections, and the Chair's rulings may be appealed to the full Board.
These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to G.S. §160D-1402.
Objections based on jurisdictional issues may be raised for the first time on
judicial review.

necessary to evaluate compliance of the applicant's proposal with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator shall review each element of the application
and if satisfied that the work described therein complies with this chapter,
issue a zoning certificate. After a zoning certificate has been issued, no
changes or deviations from the terms of the application, plans or permit shall
be made until specific written approval has been obtained from the Zoning
Administrator. If the Zoning Administrator finds the application to be

(Ord. passed 4-1993; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.123 MORATORIA.
   (A)    Per G.S. §160D-107, the Board of Commissioners may adopt temporary
moratoria on any Town of Murphy development approval required by law. The
duration of any moratorium shall be reasonable in light of the specific
conditions that warrant imposition of the moratorium and may not exceed the
period of time necessary to correct, modify, or resolve such conditions. Except
in cases of imminent and substantial threat to public health or safety, before
adopting an ordinance imposing a development moratorium with a duration of 60
days or any shorter period, the Board of Aldermen shall hold a public hearing
and shall publish a notice of the hearing in a newspaper having general
circulation in the area not less than seven days before the date set for the
hearing. A development moratorium with a duration of 61 days or longer and an
extension of a moratorium so that the total duration is 61days or longer, is
subject to the notice and hearing requirements of G.S.§160D-601. Absent an
imminent threat to public health or safety, a development moratorium adopted
pursuant to this section shall not apply to any project for which a valid
building permit issued pursuant to G.S. §160D-1110 is outstanding, to any
project for which a special use application has been accepted under this
chapter, to development set forth in a site-specific development plan approved
pursuant to G.S. §160D-108.1 and this chapter, to development for which
substantial expenditures have already been made in good faith reliance on a
prior valid administrative or quasi-judicial permit or approval, or to
preliminary or final subdivision plats that have been accepted for review by
the Town of Murphy prior to the call for public hearing to adopt the
moratorium. Any preliminary subdivision plat accepted for review by, the town
prior to the call for public hearing, if subsequently approved, shall be
allowed to proceed to final plat approval without being subject to the
moratorium.
   (B)   Any ordinance establishing a development moratorium must expressly
include at the time of adoption each of the following:
      (1)   A clear statement of the problems or conditions necessitating the
moratorium and what courses of action, alternative to a moratorium, were
considered by the town and why those alternative courses of action were not
deemed adequate.
      (2)   A clear statement of the development approvals subject to the
moratorium and how a moratorium on those approvals will address the problems or
conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
      (3)   An express date for termination of the moratorium and a statement
setting forth why that duration is reasonably necessary to address the problems
or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
      (4)   A clear statement of the actions, and the schedule for those
actions, proposed to be taken by the town during the duration of the moratorium
to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
   (C)   No moratorium may be subsequently renewed or extended for any
additional period unless the town shall have taken all reasonable and feasible
steps proposed to be taken by the town in this chapter to address the problems
or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium and unless new facts and
conditions warrant an extension. Any ordinance renewing or extending a
development moratorium must expressly include at the time of adoption, the
findings set forth in division (B) of this section, including what new facts or
conditions warrant the extension.
   (D)   Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a moratorium on development
approvals required by law may apply to the appropriate division of the General
Court of Justice for an order enjoining the enforcement of the moratorium and
the court shall have jurisdiction to issue that order. Actions brought pursuant
to this chapter shall be set down for immediate hearing, and subsequent
proceedings in those actions shall be accorded priority by the trial and
appellate courts. In any such action the town shall have the burden of showing
compliance with the procedural requirements of this section.
(Ord. passed 4-1993; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
ORDINANCE AND MAP AMENDMENTS
§ 153.135 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)    This zoning chapter, including the zoning map, may be amended by the
Board Of Commissioners in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Proposed changes or amendments may be initiated by the Board of
Commissioners, the Board of Adjustment, Planning Board, or one or more
interested individuals. All proposed amendments shall be referred to the
Planning Board for its review and recommendation to the Town Board of
Commissioners.
   (C)   A statement analyzing the reasonableness of any proposed rezoning
shall be approved by the Board of Commissioners. This statement of
reasonableness may consider, among other factors: the size, physical
conditions, and other attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned; the
benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding
community; the relationship between the current actual and permissible
development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be
permissible under the proposed amendment; why the action taken is in the public
interest; and any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a zoning map
amendment qualifies as a large-scale rezoning under G.S. §160D-602(b), the
Board of Commissioners' statement on reasonableness may address the overall
rezoning.
   (D)   No amendment to zoning regulations or a zoning map that down-zones
property shall be initiated nor is it enforceable without the written consent
of all property owners whose property is the subject of the down-zoning
amendment, unless the down-zoning amendment is initiated by the local
government. For purposes of this section, "down-zoning" means a zoning
ordinance that affects an area of land in one of the following ways: by
decreasing the development density of the land to be less dense than was
allowed under its previous usage; or, by reducing the permitted uses of the
land that are specified in a zoning ordinance or land development. regulation
to fewer uses than were allowed under its previous usage.
   (E)   If applicable, the future land use map is deemed amended when an
inconsistent rezoning is approved.
(Ord. passed 4-1993; Am. Ord. passed 9-4-2007; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.136 APPLICATION.
   (A)    Before any action on a proposed change or amendment, an application
for an amendment shall be submitted to the office of the Zoning Administrator
at least ten days prior to the Planning Board's meeting at which the
application is to be considered. The application shall contain the name and
address of the owner of the property in question, the location of the property,
and a description and/or statement of the present and proposed zoning
regulation or district as shown on the application forms supplied by the town.
   (B)   In no instance shall action be initiated for a zoning amendment
affecting the same parcel of property, or any part thereof, more often than
once every 12 months. Any communication purporting to be an application for a
change shall be regarded as mere notice to seek relief until sit is made in the
form required.
(Ord. passed 4-1993; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.137 PLANNING BOARD ACTION.
   Before taking any action on a proposed amendment to the chapter, the
Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is
consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other
officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Board shall provide a written
recommendation to the governing board that addresses plan consistency and other
matters as deemed appropriate by the Board. The Board of Commissioners shall
consider the Planning Board's recommendations on each proposed amendment. The
Planning Board shall have 30 days after the first consideration of the
application within which to submit its recommendations to the Board of
Commissioners. Failure of the Planning Board to submit recommendations within
the 30-day period shall constitute a favorable recommendation. If no written
report is received from the Planning Board within 30 days of referral of the
amendment to that board, the Board of Commissioners may proceed in its
consideration of the amendment without the Planning Board report. The governing
board is not bound by the recommendations, if any, of the Planning Board.
(Ord. passed 4-1993; Am. Ord. passed 9-4-2007; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.138 PUBLIC HEARING.
    Before enacting any amendment to this chapter, the Board of Commissioners
shall hold a public hearing. Notice of public hearings in a newspaper of
general circulation in Cherokee County, by on-site posting and/or by mail shall
be in accordance with G.S. §160D-601 and §160D-602 as provided below.
   (A)   Newspaper notice. A notice of a public hearing shall be given once a
week for two successive calendar weeks in a newspaper having general
circulation in the Town of Murphy, the notices to be published the first time
not less than ten days and not more than 25 days before the date fixed for the
public hearing.
   (B)   Mailed notice. When an amendment to the official zoning map (zoning
map amendment) is proposed, the owner of that parcel of land, as shown on the
county tax listing, that is the subject of a proposed zoning amendment, and the
owners of all parcels of land abutting that parcel of land as shown on the
county tax listing, shall be mailed a notice of a public hearing on the
proposed amendment by first class mail at the last addresses listed for the
owners on the county tax abstracts. For the purpose of this section, properties
are 'abutting' even if separated by a street, railroad, or other transportation
corridor. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten but not more
than 25 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The person or persons
mailing the notices shall certify to the Town Council that fact, and that
certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.
   (C)   Alternative to mailed notice. The first-class mail notice required in
division (B), above, shall not be required if the zoning map amendment directly
affects more than 50 properties, owned by a total of at least 50 different
property owners, and the town elects to use the expanded published notice
provided for in this division (C). In this instance the town may elect to
either make the mailed notice provided for in division (B), above, or may as an
alternative elect to publish notice of the hearing as required by G.S. §160D-
601 (and enumerated in division (A), above), but provided that each
advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size. The
advertisement shall only be effective for property owners who reside in the
area of general circulation of the newspaper which publishes the notice.
Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation area, according
to the address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected
property, shall be notified according to the provisions of division (B), above.
   (D)   Posted notice. When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the town shall
prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the site proposed for
rezoning or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. The notice
shall be posted within the same time period specified for mailed notices of the
hearing. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning map
amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not required, but the town
shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested
persons.
(Ord. passed 4-1993; Am. Ord. passed 9-4-2007; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.139 PROTESTS.
   (A)    In the case of a qualified protest petition against any change in or
amendment to a zoning map, a qualified protest shall be:
      (1)   Signed by the owners or 20% or more of the area included in the
proposed change; or
      (2)   Five percent of a 100-foot wide buffer existing along the entire
boundary of each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned.
   (B)   Such amendment shall not become effective except by a favorable vote
of three-fourths of all members of the Board of Commissioners. Seats that are
vacant and members who are recused from voting are not considered in
calculation of the three-fourths majority. A petitioner may withdraw the
protest at any time up to the vote on rezoning.
(Ord. passed 4-1993; Am. Ord. passed 9-4-2007; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.140 DECISION.
   Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the governing board
shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an
adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the Board considers the action
taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. A Board of Commissioners
member shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of
the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial,
and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. The Board of
Commissioners shall make a decision on the proposed amendment within 60 days
after the public hearing.
(Ord. passed 4-1993; Am. Ord. passed 9-4-2007; Am. Ord. passed 6-7-2021)
§ 153.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Violations. Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter, the
performance of any act is prohibited, or whenever any regulation, dimension or
limitation is imposed on the use of any land, or on the erection or alterations
or the use or change of use of a structure, or the uses within such structure,
a failure to comply with such provisions of this chapter shall constitute a
separate violation and a separate offense.
   (B)   Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who violates the provisions
of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
fined an amount not exceeding $50 and/or imprisoned for a period of time not
exceeding 30 days. Each day of violation shall be considered a separate

§ 154.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and cited as the Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities Siting Ordinance for the Town of Murphy.
(Ord. passed 7-9-2019; Am. Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 154.02 PURPOSE.
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the town's authority concerning
the placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications
facilities. The town finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose
significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and
environment of the town and its inhabitants. The town also recognizes that
facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic
development asset to the town and of significant benefit to the town and its
residents. In order to ensure that the placement, construction or modification
of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with the town's land
use policies, the town is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless
telecommunications facilities application and permit process. The intent of
this chapter is to minimize the negative impact of wireless telecommunications
facilities, establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of
applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review of environmental
impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the
town.

review and permitting process. A pre-application meeting shall also include a
site visit if there has not been a prior site visit for the requested site.
   (X)   The holder of a special use permit shall notify the town of any
intended modification of a wireless telecommunication facility and shall apply
to the town to modify, relocate or rebuild a wireless telecommunications
facility.
   (Y)   In order to better inform the public, in the case of a new
telecommunication tower, the applicant shall, prior to the public hearing on
the application, hold a "balloon test." The applicant shall arrange to fly, or
raise upon a temporary mast, a minimum of a three-foot in diameter brightly
colored balloon at the maximum height of the proposed new tower. The dates,
(including a second date, in case of poor visibility on the initial date) times
and location of this balloon test shall be advertised by the applicant seven
and 14 days in advance of the first test date in a newspaper with a general
circulation in the town. The applicant shall inform the town, in writing, of
the dates and times of the test, at least 14 days in advance. The balloon shall
be flown for at least four consecutive hours sometime between 7:00 a.m. and 4:

case of poor weather on the initial date, the secondary date may be on a
weekday.
   (Z)   The applicant will provide a written copy of an analysis, completed by
a qualified individual or organization, to determine if the tower or existing
structure intended to support wireless facilities requires lighting under
Federal Aviation Administration Regulation Part 77. This requirement shall be
for any new tower or for an existing structure or building where the
application increases the height of the structure or building. If this analysis
determines that the FAA must be contacted, then all filings with the FAA, all
responses from the FAA and any related correspondence shall be provided in a
timely manner.

granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the
applicant if the permit were not granted for the proposed site.
   (C)   An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating the
site proposed is the only site leased or selected. An application shall address
co-location as an option. If such option is not proposed, the applicant must
explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the town why co-location is
commercially or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting
or prohibiting co-location shall not be a valid basis for any claim of
commercial impracticability or hardship.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the above, the town may approve any site located
within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the town finds
that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and
welfare of the town and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect
on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood.
   (E)   The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the
applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority, demonstrating
the technological reason for the site selection. If appropriate, based on
selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why
sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the
application.
   (F)   Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of
highest priority or highest available priority, the town may disapprove an
application for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
      (2)   Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or
historical district;
      (3)   The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities
which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use
designation;
      (4)   The placement and location of wireless telecommunications
facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable
probability of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the
town, or employees of the service provider or other service providers;
      (5)   Conflicts with the provisions of this chapter.

§ 154.07 SHARED USE.
   (A)    Locating on existing towers or other structures without increasing
the height, shall be preferred by the town, as opposed to the construction of a
new tower. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying
existing towers and other suitable structures within the search ring of any
proposed new tower, unless the applicant can show that some other distance is
more reasonable and demonstrate conclusively why an existing tower or other
suitable structure cannot be used.
   (B)   An applicant intending to locate on an existing tower or other
suitable structure shall be required to document the intent of the existing
owner to permit its use by the applicant.
   (C)   Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum antenna array
technologically required to provide service primarily and essentially within
the town, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.

§ 154.08 ELIGIBLE FACILITIES REQUESTS.
   (A)   In the case of an application for an eligible facilities request, the
town's Zoning Administrator shall review the preliminary application and
determine whether the request is eligible. The Zoning Administrator may require
from the applicant such other information pursuant to this chapter, as is
needed to make this determination; alternatively, if the Zoning Administrator
is given sufficient proof that the request is eligible, he or she may relax
such requirements of a completed application described in §
154.05 as he or she shall deem unnecessary. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that the application constitutes an eligible facilities request, he
or she shall certify such eligibility to the Board of Adjustment, and the Board
of Adjustment shall approve the special use permit, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. §
1455(a), and no hearing shall be required.
   (B)   If the Zoning Administrator determines, after reviewing the
application pursuant to division (A) of this section, that there is substantial
evidence that the application constitutes a substantial modification, then a
hearing shall be required pursuant to this chapter. At the hearing, the Zoning
Administrator shall first present the evidence of a substantial modification,
which the applicant or any other interested party may be cross-examined. The
applicant and any other interested party shall present evidence of an eligible
facilities request, which may also be cross-examined. The Board of Adjustment
shall make findings of fact as to the question, and shall decide whether:
      (1)   The application is for an eligible facilities request, in which
case it shall approve the special use permit without further hearing; or
      (2)   That the application is for a substantial modification, in which
case it shall conduct the hearing pursuant to §§
154.16 and
154.17.
   (C)   The town shall issue a written decision approving an eligible

(Ord. passed 10-7-2019; Am. Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 155.12 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is
filed with the Public Officer by a public authority or by at least five
residents of the town, charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for
human habitation, or whenever it appears to the Public Officer (on his or her
own motion), that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation,
the Public Officer shall, if his or her preliminary investigation discloses a
basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and
parties in interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit a complaint stating the
charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the Public
Officer (or his or her designated agent) at a place fixed in the notice, not
less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint. The
owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the
complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the
place and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of the hearing shall also be
given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating to the
dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend the hearing and give
evidence. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not
be controlling in hearings before the Public Officer.
   (B)   Procedure after hearing. If after notice and hearing the Public
Officer determines that the dwelling under consideration is unfit for human
habitation, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact in
support of that determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the
owner thereof an order.
      (1)   Deteriorated dwelling, dwelling unit. If the Public Officer
determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he or she shall
state in writing his or her findings of fact in support of that determination,
and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner an order directing and
requiring the owner to repair, alter or improve the dwelling or dwelling unit
in order to render it fit for human habitation within a specified period of
time, not to exceed 90 days. The order may require that the property be vacated
and closed only if continued occupancy during the time allowed for repair will
present a significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of
the necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current state of the
property; and any additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors
under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. The
order shall state that the failure to make timely repairs as directed in the
order shall make the dwelling subject to the issuance of an unfit order under
division (C)(1) of this section.
      (2)   Dilapidated dwelling. If the Public Officer determines that the
dwelling is dilapidated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings
of fact to support that determination, and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner an order directing and requiring the owner either to repair,
alter or improve the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation or to
remove or demolish such dwelling within a specified period of time not to
exceed 90 days.
      (3)   Vacated and closed dwellings.
         (a)   If the Board of Commissioners shall have adopted an ordinance as
described in division (C) below, ordering a dwelling to be repaired, altered or
improved pursuant to the findings of the Public Officer pursuant to divisions
(B)(1) or (2) above or division (C) below, and if the owner has vacated and
closed such dwelling and kept such dwelling vacated and closed for a period of
one year pursuant to the ordinance or order, then if the Board of Commissioners
shall find that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter
or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation and that
the continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be
inimical to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the city in that the
dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard,
would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on
criminal activities, would cause and contribute to blight and the deterioration
of property values in the area, and would render unavailable property and a
dwelling which might otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent
shortage of decent and affordable housing in this state, then in such
circumstances, the Board of Commissioners, may, after the expiration of such
one-year period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner,
setting forth the following:
            1.   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render
it fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish the dwelling within 90 days; or
            2.   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render
it fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the
then current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
         (b)   An ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall be recorded
in the office of the Register of Deeds of Cherokee County, North Carolina, and
shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the
owner fails to comply with this section, the Public Officer shall effectuate
the purpose of the ordinance.
         (c)   For the purpose of this section, the current value of a dwelling
or structure shall be defined as the fair market value as determined by a
certified appraiser or the current tax value on record with the Cherokee County
Tax Office, whichever is less.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or
dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the Public Officer to
repair, alter or improve, or to vacate and close the dwelling or dwelling unit
within the time specified, or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling or
dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the Public Officer to
repair, alter or improve, or to vacate and close and remove or demolish the
dwelling or dwelling unit within the time specified, the Public Officer may
submit to the Board of Commissioners at its next regular meeting a resolution
directing the Town Attorney to institute appropriate action in the General
Court of Justice of Cherokee County, North Carolina, for an order directing
that owner comply with the order of the Public Officer, as authorized by G.S. §
160D-1208(e).
      (2)   In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated or
dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with an order of the Public
Officer within the time specified, if injunctive relief has not been sought or
has not been granted as provided in division (C)(1) above, the Public Officer
shall submit to the Board of Commissioners an ordinance ordering the Public
Officer to cause that dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered,
improved, vacated, closed, removed or demolished, as provided in the original
order of the Public Officer, and pending removal or demolition, to place a
placard on that dwelling as provided by G.S. § 160D-1203 and §
155.14.
   (D)   Appeals from orders of the Public Officer.
      (1)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Public Officer may be
taken by any aggrieved person. Any appeal from the Public Officer shall be
taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the
order and shall be taken by filing with the Public Officer and with the Housing
Appeals Board a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the
appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the Public Officer
shall forthwith transmit to the Housing Appeals Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an
appeal is from a decision of the Public Officer refusing to allow the aggrieved
person to do any act, his or her decision shall remain in force until modified
or reversed. When an appeal is from a decision of the Public Officer requiring
the aggrieved person to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of
suspending the requirement until the hearing by the Housing Appeals Board
unless the Public Officer certifies to the Housing Appeals Board, after the
notice of appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason of the facts stated
in the certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant, a
suspension of this requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property,
in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except for due cause shown
upon not less than one day's written notice to the Public Officer, by the
Housing Appeals Board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to
G.S. §160D-1208(d) and division (E) of this section.
      (2)   The Housing Appeals Board shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall
render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or
by agent or attorney. The Housing Appeals Board may reverse or affirm, wholly
or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such
decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to
that end shall have all the powers of the Public Officer; but the concurring
vote of four members of the Housing Appeals Board shall be necessary to reverse
or modify any decision or order of the Public Officer. The Housing Appeals
Board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there
are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out
the strict letter of this chapter, to adapt the application of this chapter to
the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
      (3)   Every decision of the Housing Appeals Board shall be subject to
review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of
the decision of the Board, but not otherwise.
   (E)   Petition to superior court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the Public Officer or a decision rendered by the Board shall have the
right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision,
to petition the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the
Public Officer pending a final disposition of the cause, as provided by G.S. §
160D-1208.

   Complaints or, orders issued by the Public Officer shall be served upon
persons either personally or by registered or certified mail. When service is
made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also

or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned
by the post office within ten days after the mailing. If regular mail is used,
a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on
the premises affected. If the whereabouts of such persons are unknown and
cannot be ascertained by the Public Officer in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, or, if the owners are known but have refused to accept service by
registered or certified mail, the Public Officer shall make an affidavit to
that effect; and the serving of the complaint or order upon that person may be
made by publishing the complaint or order at least once no later than the time
at which personal service would be required under the provisions of this
chapter in a newspaper having general circulation in the town. Where service is
made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises affected by the complaint or order.
