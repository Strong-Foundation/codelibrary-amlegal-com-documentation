at an emergency meeting. The Council may add items to the proposed agenda of a
special meeting only if it determines in good faith at the meeting that it is
essential to discuss or act on the item immediately.
         (b)   The Council may designate certain agenda items “for discussion
and possible action.” Such designation means that the Council intends to
discuss the general subject area of that agenda item before making any motion
concerning that item.
      (3)   Consent agenda. The Council may designate a part of the agenda as
the “consent agenda.” Items shall be placed on the consent agenda by those
preparing the proposed agenda if they are judged to be noncontroversial and
routine. Any member may remove an item from the consent agenda and place it on
the regular agenda while the agenda is being discussed and revised prior to its
adoption at the beginning of the meeting. All items on the consent agenda shall
be voted on and adopted by a single motion, with the minutes reflecting the
motion and vote on each item.
      (4)   Open meetings requirements. The Council shall not deliberate, vote
or otherwise take action on any matter by reference to a letter, number or
other designation, or other secret device or method, with the intention of
making it impossible for persons attending a meeting of the Council to
understand what is being deliberated, voted or acted on. The Council may,
however, deliberate, vote or otherwise take action by reference to an agenda,
if copies of the agenda (sufficiently worded to enable the public to understand
what is being deliberated, voted or acted on) are available for public
inspection at the meeting.
   (E)   Rule 5. Public address to the Council. Any individual or group who
wishes to address the Council shall make a request to be on the agenda to the
Village Clerk. However, the Council shall determine at the meeting whether it
will hear the individual or group.
   (F)   Rule 6. Order of business.
      (1)   Items shall be placed on the agenda according to the order of
business. The order of business for each regular meeting shall be as follows:
         (a)   Discussion and revision of the proposed agenda, including
consent agenda; adoption of an agenda;
         (b)   Approval of the minutes;
         (c)   Consent agenda;
         (d)   Public hearings;
         (e)   Public comment;
         (f)   Administrative reports;
         (g)   Committee reports;
         (h)   Unfinished business;

      (2)   By general consent of the Council, items may be considered out of
order.
   (G)   Rule 7. Office of Mayor.
      (1)   The Council shall, at the organizational meeting described in Rule
3, elect one of its members to serve as Mayor at the pleasure of the Council.
The Mayor shall preside at all meetings of the Council and may vote in all
cases. In order to address the Council, a member must be recognized by the
Mayor.
      (2)   The Mayor or other presiding officer shall have the following
powers:
         (a)   To rule motions in or out of order, including any motion
patently offered for obstructive or dilatory purposes;
         (b)   To determine whether a speaker has gone beyond reasonable
standards of courtesy in his or her remarks and to entertain and rule on
objections from other members on this ground;
         (c)   To entertain and answer questions of parliamentary law or
procedure;
         (d)   To call a brief recess at any time;
         (e)   To adjourn in an emergency.
      (3)   A decision by the presiding officer under (a), (b) or (c) may be
appealed to the Council upon motion of any member, pursuant to Rule 18, Motion
1 (see division (R)(2)(a)). Such a motion is in order immediately after a
decision under (a), (b) or (c) is announced and at no other time. The member
making the motion need not be recognized by the presiding officer, and the
motion if timely made may not be ruled out of order.
   (H)   Rule 8. Office of Mayor Pro Tempore.
      (1)   At the organizational meeting, the Council shall elect from among
its members a Mayor Pro Tempore to serve at the Council's pleasure. A Council
member who serves as Mayor Pro Tempore shall be entitled to vote on all matters
and shall be considered a Council member for all purposes, including the
determination of whether a quorum is present.
      (2)   In the Mayor's absence, the Council may confer on the Mayor Pro
Tempore any of the Mayor's powers and duties. If the Mayor should become
physically or mentally unable to perform the duties of his or her office, the
Council may by unanimous vote declare that the Mayor is incapacitated and
confer any of the Mayor's powers and duties on the Mayor Pro Tempore.
      (3)   When a Mayor declares that he or she is no longer incapacitated,
and a majority of the Council concurs, the Mayor shall resume the exercise of
his or her powers and duties.
      (4)   If both the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tempore are absent from a meeting,
the Council may elect from among its members a temporary chairman to preside at
the meeting.
   (I)   Rule 9. When the presiding officer is in active debate.
      (1)   If the Mayor or the presiding officer becomes actively engaged in
debate on a particular proposal, he or she may, at his or her discretion,
designate another Council member to preside over the debate.
      (2)   The Mayor or other presiding officer shall resume presiding as soon
as action on the matter is concluded.
   (J)   Rule 10. Action by the Council. The Council shall proceed by motion,
except as otherwise provided for in Rule 4 and in Rule 31. Any member may make
a motion.
   (K)   Rule 11. Second not required. A motion shall not require a second.
   (L)   Rule 12. One motion at a time. A member may make only one motion at a
time.
   (M)   Rule 13. Substantive motions. A substantive motion is out of order
while another substantive motion is pending.
   (N)   Rule 14. Adoption by majority vote. A motion shall be adopted by a
majority of the votes cast, a quorum as defined in Rule 26 being present,
unless otherwise required by these rules or the laws of North Carolina. A
majority is more than half.
   (O)   Rule 15. Voting by written ballot. The Council may choose by majority
vote to use written ballots in voting on a motion. Such ballots shall be
signed, and the minutes of the Council shall show the vote of each member
voting. The ballots shall be available for public inspection in the Office of
the Village Clerk immediately following the meeting at which the vote took
place and until the minutes of that meeting are approved, at which time the
ballots may be destroyed.
   (P)   Rule 16. Debate.
      (1)   The Mayor shall state the motion and then open the floor to debate
on it.
      (2)   The Mayor shall preside over the debate according to the following
general principles:
         (a)   The maker of the motion is entitled to speak first;
         (b)   A member who has not spoken on the issue shall be recognized
before someone who has already spoken;
         (c)   To the extent possible, the debate shall alternate between
proponents and opponents of the measure.
   (Q)   Rule 17. Ratification of actions. To the extent permitted by law, the
Council may ratify actions taken on its behalf but without its prior approval.
A motion to ratify is a substantive motion.
   (R)   Rule 18. Procedural motions.
      (1)   Certain motions allowed. In addition to substantive proposals, only
the following procedural motions, and no others, are in order. Unless otherwise
noted, each motion is debatable, may be amended, and requires a majority of the
votes cast, a quorum being present, for adoption. Procedural motions are in
order while a substantive motion is pending and at other times, except as
otherwise noted.
      (2)   Order of priority of motions. In order of priority (if applicable),
the procedural motions are:
         (a)   Motion 1. To appeal a procedural ruling of the presiding
officer. A decision of the presiding officer ruling a motion in or out of
order, determining whether a speaker has gone beyond reasonable standards of
courtesy in his or her remarks, or entertaining and answering a question of
parliamentary law or procedure may be appealed to the Council, as specified in
Rule 7. This appeal is in order immediately after such a decision is announced
and at no other time. The member making the motion need not be recognized by
the presiding officer and the motion, if timely made, may not be ruled out of
order.
         (b)   Motion 2. To adjourn or to recess. This motion may be made only
at the conclusion of Council consideration of a pending substantive matter; it
may not interrupt deliberation of a pending matter. A motion to recess to a
time and place certain shall also comply with the requirements of Rule 2 for
recessed meeting (see division (B)(3)).
         (c)   Motion 3. To take a brief recess.
         (d)   Motion 4. Call to follow the agenda. The motion must be made at
the first reasonable opportunity, or the right to make it is waived for the
out-of-order item in question.
         (e)   Motion 5. To suspend the rules. The Council may not suspend
provisions of the rules that state requirements imposed by law on the Council.
For adoption, the motion requires a vote equal to two-thirds of the actual
membership of the Council, and vacant seats.
         (f)   Motion 6. To go into closed session. The Council may go into
closed session only for one or more of the permissible purposes listed in G.S.
§ 143-318.11(a). The motion to go into closed session shall cite one or more of
these purposes and shall be adopted at an open meeting. A motion based on G.S.
§ 143-318.11(a)(1) shall also state the name or citation of the law that
renders the information to be discussed privileged or confidential. A motion
based on G.S. § 143-318(a)(3) shall identify the parties in each existing
lawsuit concerning which the Council expects to receive advice during the
closed session, if in fact such advice is to be received.
         (g)   Motion 7. To leave closed session.
         (h)   Motion 8. To divide a complex motion and consider it by
paragraph. The motion is in order whenever a member wishes to consider and vote
on subparts of a complex motion separately.
         (i)   Motion 9. To defer consideration. The Council may defer a
substantive motion for later consideration at an unspecified time. A
substantive motion, the consideration of which has been deferred, expires 100
days thereafter unless a motion to revive consideration is adopted. If
consideration of a motion has been deferred, a new motion with the same effect
cannot be introduced while the deferred motion remains pending (has not
expired). A member who wishes to revisit the matter during that time must take
action to revive consideration of the original motion [Rule 18, Motion 14 (see
division (R)(2)(n))], or else move to suspend the rules [Rule 18, Motion 5 (see
division (R)(2)(e))].
         (j)   Motion 10. Motion for the previous question. The motion is not
in order until there have been at least 20 minutes of debate, and every member
has had an opportunity to speak once.
         (k)   Motion 11. To postpone to a certain time or day. If
consideration of a motion has been postponed, a new motion with the same effect
cannot be introduced while the postponed motion remains pending. A member who
wishes to revisit the matter must either wait until the specified time, or move
to suspend the rules [Rule 18, Motion 5 (see division (R)(2)(e))].
         (l)   Motion 12. To refer a motion to a committee. The Council may
vote to refer a substantive motion to a committee for its study and
recommendations. Sixty days or more after a substantive motion has been
referred to a committee, the introducer of the substantive motion may compel
consideration of the measure by the entire Council, whether or not the
committee has reported the matter to the Council.
         (m)   Motion 13. To amend.
            1.   An amendment to a motion must be pertinent to the subject
matter of the motion. An amendment is improper if adoption of the motion with
that amendment added would have the same effect as rejection of the original
motion. A proposal to substitute completely different wording for a motion or
an amendment shall be treated as a motion to amend.
            2.   A motion may be amended, and that amendment may be amended,
but no further amendments may be made until the last-offered amendment is
disposed of by a vote.
            3.   Any amendment to a proposed ordinance shall be reduced to
writing before the vote on the amendment.
         (n)   Motion 14. To revive consideration. The Board may vote to revive
consideration of any substantive motion earlier deferred by adoption of Motion
9 of Rule 18 (see division (R)(2)(i)). The motion is in order at any time
within 100 days after the day of a vote to defer consideration. A substantive
motion on which consideration has been deferred expires 100 days after the
deferral unless a motion to revive consideration is adopted.
         (o)   Motion 15. To reconsider. The Council may vote to reconsider its
action on a matter. The motion to do so must be made by a member who voted with
the prevailing side (the majority side, except in the case of a tie; in that
case the “nos” prevail) and at the meeting during which the original vote was
taken, including any continuation of that meeting through recess or adjournment
to a time and place certain. The motion cannot interrupt deliberation on a
pending matter, but is in order at any time before final adjournment of the
meeting.
         (p)   Motion 16. To rescind or repeal. The Council may vote to rescind
actions it has previously taken or to repeal items that it has previously
adopted. The motion is not in order if rescission or repeal of an action is
forbidden by law.
         (q)   Motion 17. To prevent reintroduction for six months. The motion
shall be in order immediately following the defeat of a substantive motion and
at no other time. The motion requires for adoption a vote equal to two-thirds
of the actual membership of the Council. If adopted, the restriction imposed by
the motion remains in effect for six months or until the next organizational
meeting of the Council, whichever occurs first.
   (S)   Rule 19. Renewal of motion. A motion that is defeated may be renewed
at any later meeting, unless a motion to prevent reintroduction has been
adopted.
   (T)   Rule 20. Withdrawal of motion. A motion may be withdrawn by the
introducer at any time before it is amended or before the presiding officer
puts the motion to a vote, whichever occurs first.
   (U)   Rule 21. Duty to vote. Every member must vote unless excused by the
remaining members according to law. A member who wishes to be excused from
voting shall so inform the presiding officer, who shall take a vote of the
remaining members. No member shall be excused from voting except upon matters
involving the consideration of his or her own financial interest or official
conduct. In all other cases, a failure to vote by a member who is physically
present in the Council chamber, or who has withdrawn without being excused by a
majority vote of the remaining members present, shall be recorded as an
affirmative vote.
   (V)   Rule 22. Introduction of ordinances. A proposed ordinance shall be
deemed to be introduced on the date the subject matter is first voted on by the
Council.
   (W)   Rule 23. Adoption of ordinances and approval of contracts.
      (1)   Generally. An affirmative vote equal to a majority of all the
members of the Council not excused from voting on the question in issue shall
be required to adopt an ordinance, to take any action that has the effect of an
ordinance, or to make, ratify or authorize any contract on behalf of the city.
In addition, no ordinance or action that has the effect of an ordinance may be
finally adopted on the date on which it is introduced except by an affirmative
vote equal to or greater than two-thirds of all the actual membership of the
Council, excluding vacant seats. No ordinance shall be adopted unless it has
been reduced to writing before a vote on adoption is taken.
      (2)   Zoning protest petitions. An affirmative vote equal to three-
fourths of all the members of the City Council shall be required for an
ordinance making a change in a zoning regulation, restriction or boundary to
become effective, if a valid protest petition is received in accordance with
the requirements set out in North Carolina General Statutes. This rule shall
not apply in those cases excepted by state law.
   (X)   Rule 24. Adoption of the budget ordinance.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of any city charter, general law or
local act:
         (a)   Any action with respect to the adoption or amendment of the
budget ordinance may be taken at any regular or special meeting of the Council
by a simple majority of those present and voting, a quorum being present;
         (b)   No action taken with respect to the adoption or amendment of the
budget ordinance need be published or is subject to any other procedural
requirement governing the adoption of ordinances or resolutions by the Council;
and
         (c)   The adoption and amendment of the budget ordinance and the levy
of taxes in the budget ordinance are not subject to the provisions of any city
charter or local act concerning initiative or referendum.
      (2)   During the period beginning with the submission of the budget to
the Council and ending with the adoption of the budget ordinance, the Council
may hold any special meetings that may be necessary to complete its work on the
budget ordinance.
         (a)   Except for the notice requirements of the open meetings law,
which continue to apply, no provision of law concerning the call of special
meetings applies during that period so long as:
            1.   Each member of the Board has actual notice of each special
meeting called for the purpose of considering the budget; and
            2.   No business other than consideration of the budget is taken
up.
         (b)   This rule does not allow, and may not be construed to allow, the
holding of closed meetings or executive sessions by the Council if it is
otherwise prohibited by law from holding such a meeting or session.
   (Y)   Rule 25. Closed sessions.
      (1)   The Council may hold closed sessions as provided by law. The
Council shall only commence a closed session after a motion to go into closed
session has been made and adopted during an open meeting.
         (a)   The motion shall state the purpose of the closed session.
            1.   If the motion is based on G.S. § 143-318.11(a)(1) (closed
session to prevent the disclosure of privileged or confidential information or
information that is not considered a public record), it must also state the
name or citation of the law that renders the information to be discussed
privileged or confidential.
            2.   If the motion is based on G.S. § 143-318.11(a)(3)
(consultation with attorney; handling or settlement of claims, judicial
actions, or administrative procedures), it must identify the parties in any
existing lawsuits concerning which the public body expects to receive advice
during the closed session.
         (b)   The motion to go into closed session must be approved by the
vote of a majority of those present and voting.
         (c)   The Council shall terminate the closed session by a majority
vote.
      (2)   Only those actions authorized by statute may be taken in closed
session. A motion to adjourn or recess shall not be in order during a closed
session.
   (Z)   Rule 26. Quorum. A majority of the actual membership of the Council,
excluding vacant seats, shall constitute a quorum. A majority is more than
half. A member who has withdrawn from a meeting without being excused by
majority vote of the remaining members present shall be counted as present for
purposes of determining whether or not a quorum is present.
   (AA)   Rule 27. Public hearings.
      (1)   Public hearings required by law or deemed advisable by the Council
shall be organized by a special order (adopted by a majority vote) that sets
forth the subject, date, place and time of the hearing, as well as any rules
regarding the length of time allotted for each speaker, and other pertinent
matters.
         (a)   Except in cases where the Council itself is required by law to
call, schedule or give notice of the hearing, the Village Administrator shall
have the authority to schedule, call and give notice of public hearings
required by law or the Council.
         (b)   The rules may include, but are not limited to, rules:
            1.   Fixing the maximum time allotted to each speaker;
            2.   Providing for the designation of spokespersons for groups of
persons supporting or opposing the same positions;
            3.   Providing for the selection of delegates from groups of
persons supporting or opposing the same positions when the number of persons
wishing to attend the hearing exceeds the capacity of the hall (so long as
arrangements are made, in the case of hearings subject to the open meetings
law, for those excluded from the hall to listen to the hearing); and
            4.   Providing for the maintenance of order and decorum in the
conduct of the hearing.
      (2)   All notice and other requirements of the open meetings law
applicable to Council meetings shall also apply to public hearings at which a
majority of the Council is present; such a hearing is considered to be part of
a regular or special meeting of the Council.
         (a)   These requirements also apply to hearings conducted by appointed
or elected committees of the Council, if a majority of the committee is
present.
         (b)   A public hearing for which any notices required by the open
meetings law or other provisions of law have been given may be continued to a
time and place certain without further advertisement.
         (c)   The requirements of Rule 2 for recessed meetings (see division
(B)(3)) shall be followed in continuing a hearing at which a majority of the
Council is present.
      (3)   At the time appointed for the hearing, the Mayor or his or her
designee shall call the hearing to order and then preside over it. When the
allotted time expires or when no one wishes to speak who has not done so, the
presiding officer shall declare the hearing ended.
   (BB)   Rule 28. Quorum at public hearings. A quorum of the Council shall be
required at all public hearings required by state law. If a quorum is not
present at such a hearing, the hearing shall be continued until the next
regular Council meeting without further advertisement.
   (CC)   Rule 29. Minutes.
      (1)   Full and accurate minutes of the Council proceedings, including
closed sessions, shall be kept. The Board shall also keep a general account of
any closed session so that a person not in attendance would have a reasonable
understanding of what transpired. These minutes and general accounts shall be
open to inspection of the public, except as otherwise provided in this rule.
The exact wording of each motion and the results of each vote shall be recorded
in the minutes, and on the request of any member of the Council, the “ayes” and
“nos” upon any question shall be taken. Members' and other persons' comments
may be included in the minutes if the Council approves.
      (2)   Minutes and general accounts of closed sessions may be sealed by
action of the Council. Such sealed minutes and general accounts may be withheld
from public inspection so long as public inspection would frustrate the purpose
of the closed session.
   (DD)   Rule 30. Appointments.
      (1)   When making appointments, the Council shall use the following
procedure: The Mayor shall make appointment recommendations. The Mayor shall
then open the floor for nominations, whereupon the names of other possible
appointees may be put forward by the Council members. The names submitted shall
be debated. When the debate ends, the Mayor shall call the roll of the members,
and each member shall cast his or her vote.
      (2)   The voting shall continue until one nominee receives a majority of
the votes cast, whereupon he or she shall be appointed. If more than one
appointee is to be selected, then each member shall have as many votes in each
balloting as there are slots to be filled, and votes from a majority of the
members voting shall be required for appointment. During each balloting, a
member may cast all of his or her votes or fewer than all of them, but he or
she shall not cast more than one vote for a single candidate.
   (EE)   Rule 31. Committees and boards.
      (1)   Establishment and appointment. The Council shall appoint the
Planning Board and the lake committee. The Mayor, under the general direction
of the Council, may establish and appoint members for such other temporary and
standing city committees and boards as are needed to help carry on the work of
city government. Any specific provisions of law relating to particular
committees and boards shall be followed.
      (2)   Open meetings law. The requirements of the open meetings law shall
apply to all elected or appointed authorities, boards, commissions, councils,
or other bodies of the city that are composed of two or more members, and that
exercise or are authorized to exercise legislative, policy-making, quasi-
judicial, administrative or advisory functions. However, the law's requirements
shall not apply to a meeting solely among the city's professional staff.
   (FF)   Rule 32. Amendment of the rules. These rules may be amended at any
regular meeting or at any properly called special meeting that includes
amendment of the rules as one of the stated purposes of the meeting, so long as
the amendment is consistent with the Village Charter, general law, and
generally accepted principles of parliamentary procedure. Adoption of an
amendment shall require an affirmative vote equal to or greater than two-thirds
of all the actual membership of the Council, excluding vacant seats.
   (GG)   Rule 33. Reference to Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised. To the
extent not provided for in these rules, and to the extent it does not conflict
with North Carolina law or with the spirit of these rules, the Council shall
refer to Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised to answer unresolved procedural
questions.

   (A)   The rates and charges for water service shall be established by
periodic resolution of the Village Council. Said rates may be higher than
standard WWD rates to fund improvements, repairs, or expansion of the village
owned utility system. Rates are established on a scale which requires increased
per gallon rate for higher usage amounts.
   (B)   Bills for water usage shall be rendered monthly on or about the first
Thursday of the month. Failure to make payment by the last Monday of the month
shall result in a late fee being added to the outstanding bill. Failure to make
full payment of the previous month’s bill including the late fee by the
fifteenth of the following month will result in severance of water services.
Water service shall not be restored until the person applying for reinstatement
has paid the outstanding bill, late fee, and re-connect fee as established by
resolution of the Village Council. Additionally, residents who do not have a
utility deposit on file and have had their water turned off for non-payment
will be required to pay a deposit as established by resolution of the Village
Council.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21)
§ 50.19 WATER DEPOSITS.
   Each consumer applying for water service to a residence shall make a deposit
via check or money order as established by resolution of the Village Council

required should water be disconnected for cause and a request for restoration
made.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21)
§ 50.20 METER READINGS.
   Although meters will normally be read and bills rendered monthly, the
village may vary dates or the length of period covered, temporarily or
permanently, if necessary or desirable. Bills for water will be figured in
accordance with the rate schedule then in effect and will be based on the
amount consumed for the period covered by the meter readings, but the amount
payable for each billing period shall not be less than the minimum charge
described in the schedule of rates.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21)
§ 50.21 TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   When water service is discontinued and all bills are paid, including
penalties, the deposit, if one was collected, will be refunded.
   (B)   On discontinuance of service for nonpayment of final bills, the
deposit will be applied toward settlement of the account. Any balance will be
refunded to the consumer, but if the deposit is not sufficient to cover the
amount due, the village may proceed to collect the balance in any way provided
by law for the collection of debts.
   (C)   Service discontinued for nonpayment of bills will be restored only
after bills are paid in full, re-deposit or initial deposit is made, and a
reconnect fee as established by resolution of the Village Council is paid. If a
consumer does not have a deposit on file, one will be required prior to service
reconnection.
   (D)   The village reserves the right to discontinue water service without
notice for any one or more of the following additional reasons:
      (1)   To prevent fraud or abuse;
      (2)   Consumer’s willful disregard of the village’s rules and
regulations;
      (3)   Emergency repairs or possible contamination of supply;
      (4)   Insufficiency of supply due to circumstances beyond the village’s
control;
      (5)   Legal process;
      (6)   Direction of public authorities;
      (7)   Strike, riot, fire, flood, accident, or any unavoidable cause; or
      (8)   As directed by WWD due to emergency shortages or contingencies.
   (E)   In addition to pursuing a civil penalty, the village may permanently
refuse service to any consumer who tampers with a meter or other measuring
device.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.22 USE OF IRRIGATION SYSTEMS PROHIBITED.
   The village water system shall not be connected to any permanently installed
irrigation system. No person may use water from the water system of the village
for the purpose of watering lawns or shrubs other than by a hand-held device or
portable sprinkler. Standard water and sewer rates will apply.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21) Penalty, see §  
50.99
§ 50.23 UNUSUALLY HIGH WATER METER READING.
   (A)   Consumers may experience a large swing in water usage as documented by
water meter readings. This increase in consumption may be due to a number of
reasons, but if the consumer believes there is an error, it must be reported to
the village staff within ten days of bill close-out. This allows the village
staff time to research the issue and provide consumers with analysis and
suggestions prior to the billing due date.
   (B)   In the event a consumer feels the current water meeting reading is
incorrect, the following procedure will be employed:
      (1)   The consumer may be asked to prove that water sources and/or well
permits are in compliance with existing ordinances.
      (2)   In the event of a validated water leak, the consumer may apply in
writing for a reduction of a portion of the invoiced amount. The village staff
will research historical data to determine average usage which will be the
baseline for calculating a possible reduction. Each case will be reviewed based
on the circumstances.
      (3)   A reduction request requires written documentation describing the
problem along with proof that a repair or correction has been completed. Proof
is an itemized bill from a professional service listing the completed repairs.
Should the repair or correction be completed by the resident, additional
certification may be required on a case-by-case basis.
      (4)   Upon receipt of a request for a reduction, the Water & Sewer
Commissioner will review the request and render a decision. In the event the
decision is not acceptable to the consumer, a formal request may be made to the
Village Council at a regular Council meeting.
      (5)   A request to test a meter for inaccurate readings does not absolve
the requirement to pay what is due. In the event the meter is found to be in
proper working condition and the bill is paid after the due date, the consumer
may be responsible for the late fee. If credits are justified and documented,
they will be applied to the account.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21)
§ 50.24 VILLAGE WATER SHORTAGE RESPONSE PLAN.
   The purpose of this plan is to provide for the declaration of official
phases of water supply shortage situations and implementation of voluntary and
mandatory water conservation measures throughout the village system in the
event a shortage is declared. Decision to invoke these procedures will be made
by the Mayor after consulting with the Village Council and WWD. However, the
Mayor may unilaterally invoke these procedures if deemed necessary and prudent.

§ 50.26 DECLARATION OF VOLUNTARY CONSERVATION.
   Whenever the Mayor is informed by the Director of Public Utilities or WWD
that a potential shortage of water supply is indicated, the Mayor shall be
empowered to declare by adoption of this section that voluntary conservation
conditions exist. The Director of Public Utilities shall monitor the supply and
demand upon that supply. In addition, the Mayor is authorized to call upon all
water customers to employ voluntary water conservation measures as outlined in
the Village Water Shortage Response Plan to limit water use (especially
Category 3: Non-Essential Uses) and eliminate the waste of water. The
declaration of voluntary conservation shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation in the area that qualifies under G.S. 1-597, and may be
publicized through the village web site, Facebook page, e-mail, general news
media, radio, cable TV, or any other appropriate method for making such
information public.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21)
§ 50.27 DECLARATION OF MANDATORY CONSERVATION.
   (A)   Whenever the Mayor is informed by the Director of Public Utilities or
WWD that raw water supplies are consistently below seasonal averages, and if
this supply continues to decline, it may not be adequate to meet the village’s
normal needs, the Mayor is empowered to declare by adoption of this section
that mandatory conservation conditions exist. In addition, the Mayor is
authorized to call upon all water customers to employ mandatory water
conservation measures as outlined in the Village Water Shortage Response Plan.
The village shall continue to encourage voluntary water conservation measures
defined under the voluntary conservation declaration, and further shall impose
a ban on water uses for the duration of the shortage as defined in Village
Water Shortage Response Plan. These restrictions shall continue until it is
ended by announcement of return-to-normal conditions by the village. The
declaration of mandatory conservation shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation in the area that qualifies under G.S. 1-597, and may be
publicized through the village web site, Facebook page, e-mail, general news
media, radio, cable TV, or any other appropriate method for making such
information public.

§ 50.28 DECLARATION OF WATER SHORTAGE CRISIS.
   (A)   Whenever the Mayor is informed by the Director of Public Utilities or
WWD that water supplies are below the level necessary to meet normal needs and
that serious shortages exist, the Mayor is empowered to declare by this section
that a water shortage crisis exists. In addition, the Mayor is authorized to
call upon all water customers to employ water shortage crisis measures as
outlined in the Village Water Shortage Response Plan. These restrictions shall
continue until the emergency is ended by announcement of return-to-normal
conditions by the village. Under a water shortage crisis, the village will
provide for the equitable distribution of critically-limited water supplies, in
order to balance demand and limited available supplies, and to ensure that
sufficient water is available to preserve public health and safety.
   (B)   To meet the objectives of the declaration of a water shortage crisis:
      (1)   It is imperative that water customers achieve an immediate further
reduction in water use in order to extend existing water supplies and, at the
same time, ensure that sufficient water is available to preserve the public
health and sanitation and to provide fire protection service.
      (2)   The immediate further reduction in water usage is another step
along a continuum of responses to the present water supply shortage. Should the
shortage continue, further reductions in usage may be required. It must be
emphasized that the additional usage reduction in the rationed area is a valid
and attainable goal reflective of the conditions that currently exist.
      (3)   The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage and for
equal sacrifice on the part of each water consumer. The success of this chapter
depends on the cooperation of all water customers in the emergency area.
   (C)   Commercial water customers shall reduce water usage by 15% to 20%.
   (D)   Non-commercial water customers shall reduce water usage by 15% to 20%,
based on the annual average.
      (1)   It is the primary responsibility of each non-commercial water
consumer to meet the mandated water usage reduction goal in whatever manner
possible.
      (2)   Each non-commercial water user shall provide access to village
personnel for purposes of meter reading and monitoring of compliance with this
section. All reasonable efforts will be made to contact customers to arrange
for access.
      (3)   The village will provide each non-commercial customer with
suggested means to reduce usage levels.
   (E)   The village has responsibility for monitoring of compliance during the
water crisis.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.29 DECLARATION OF WATER SHORTAGE INTERRUPTIONS.
   (A)   Whenever the Mayor is informed by the Director of Public Utilities or
WWD that raw water supplies are well below the level necessary to meet basic
water needs and that serious shortages exist, the Mayor is empowered to declare
by this section that a water shortage interruptions situation exists. Under a
water shortage interruption situation, the village will provide critically-
limited water supplies, in order to preserve public health and safety of its
citizens. In addition, the Mayor is authorized to call upon all water customers
to employ water shortage interruption measures as outlined in the Village Water
Shortage Response Plan. These restrictions shall continue until this phase is
ended by announcement by the village that water service interruptions
conditions no longer exist.
   (B)   If the water shortage crisis indicates that, despite conservation
measures in effect, the water supply cannot meet the village’s water
consumption, broader water main interruptions may be required that will affect
water users. The following provisions shall govern the implementation of
temporary service interruptions:
      (1)   In order to affect compliance with this section, the Village
Council is authorized and required to plan and implement temporary service
interruptions to all or part of its water supply system, as may be deemed
appropriate, when any and/or all of the following conditions are determined to
exist:
         (a)   The mandated reduction in system-wide usage has not been
achieved; and/or
         (b)   The mandated reduction in system-wide water usage has been
achieved, but has failed to have a significant impact in extending limited
water supplies; and/or
         (c)   Temporary service interruptions are necessary in order to
further extend limited and/or dwindling water supplies.
      (2)   In the event it is determined that temporary service interruptions
are necessary, the village shall notify its customers through the public media
(internet, e-mail, newspapers, radio and television), at least one day prior to
the temporary service interruptions, that a planned, temporary service
interruption is to be imposed. Such notice shall:
         (a)   State the day or days when the planned, temporary service
interruption will occur;
         (b)   State the time(s) when the planned, temporary service
interruptions will commence, and the time(s) the interruption will cease;
         (c)   State whether the planned, temporary service interruptions are
to be imposed on the entire system, or part thereof, and if only part(s) of the
system will experience planned, temporary service interruptions, identify
geographic boundaries within which the interruptions will occur; and
         (d)   Advise all customers within the areas affected by planned,
temporary service interruptions how to treat any water received from the system
for human consumption during the period(s) of the interruptions and for such
additional time as may be necessary until full pressure is restored to the
system.
      (3)   If a planned, temporary service interruption is implemented, the
village must make provision by any means possible, for the continued delivery
of such water as may be necessary for the proper operation of sewage
collection, treatment, and disposal systems and facilities.
      (4)   If a planned, temporary service interruption is implemented, the
village shall impose a temporary moratorium on all new service connections to
the village’s water system.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21)
§ 50.30 SHORTAGE WATER RATES.
   Upon the declaration of a water supply shortage as provided in §§
50.26 through
50.29, the Village Counsel shall have the power to adopt shortage water rates
by resolution designed to conserve water supplies. Such rates may provide for,
but not be limited to:
   (A)   Higher charges per unit for increasing usage (increasing block rates);
   (B)   Uniform charges for water usage per unit of use (uniform unit rate);
   (C)   Extra charges for use in excess of a specified level (excess demand
surcharge); and
   (D)   Discounts for conserving water beyond specified levels.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21)
§ 50.31 RETURN-TO-NORMAL.
   When it is determined that the water shortage has abated, the reverse order
of water conservation stages will be followed until a full return-to-normal is
achieved. For example, the water shortage crisis phase will go to a less
restrictive mandatory conservation phase, then to a much less restrictive
voluntary conservation phase until a return-to-normal condition is reached. It
is the village’s intent to remain for an adequate period of time at each water
conservation phase to avoid oscillating back and forth between water shortage
phases and the return-to-normal condition.
(Ord., passed 1-27-21)

removed to a storage garage or area, but no such vehicle shall be removed from
private property without the written request of the owner, lessee, or occupant
of the premises unless the Council or a duly authorized village official or
employee finds in writing that the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle
outweigh the burdens imposed on the private property owner. Such finding shall
be based on a balancing of the monetary loss of the apparent owner against the

may be considered:

of the conditions enumerated in this chapter, the Village Administrator shall
forthwith give the owner, occupant, and/or person having the lot under such

such person, owner and/or occupant at the last known address of such person,
owner and/or occupant or if the lot or parcel of land has a dwelling located
upon it by attaching such notice to the door of the dwelling. The person so
served shall have ten days from the date of such service in which to remedy the

relief in writing is made within this time period to the Village Administrator
and the Village Administrator, in his discretion, grants such person additional

   (A)   In the event charges for the removal or abatement of a public nuisance
are not paid within 30 days after the receipt of a statement of charges as

public nuisance existed and shall be collected as unpaid ad valorem taxes, as
provided in G.S. § 160A-193.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 91.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of
Chapter l43; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the N.C. General Statutes,
delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(Ord., passed 8-23-89; Am. Ord., passed 11-22-05; Am. Ord., passed 4-25-18)
§ 91.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Village of Walnut
Creek are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord., passed 8-23-89; Am. Ord., passed 11-22-05; Am. Ord., passed 4-25-18)
§ 91.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord., passed 8-23-89; Am. Ord., passed 11-22-05; Am. Ord., passed 4-25-18)
§ 91.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas
mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that
are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
   (G)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the National
Flood Insurance Program;
   (H)   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
   (I)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
   (J)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special
Flood Hazard Area.
(Ord., passed 8-23-89; Am. Ord., passed 11-22-05; Am. Ord., passed 4-25-18)

amends or revises an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance
Study. Letters of Map Change include;
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter,
to an effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA is based on
technical data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being
in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is

   "SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT." Any combination of repairs, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
during any ten-year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 30% of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant
to §
91.24.
   "TECHNICAL BULLETIN AND TECHNICAL FACT SHEET." A FEMA publication that
provides guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP,
which are contained in Title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at
Section 60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by
state and local officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP
regulations and by members of the development community, such as design
professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing
bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create
regulations; rather they provide specific guidance for complying with the
minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations. It should be noted that
Technical Bulletins and Technical Fact Sheets provide guidance on the minimum
requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or community requirements that
exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design professionals should contact
the community officials to determine whether more restrictive state or local
regulations apply to the building or site in question. All applicable standards
of the state or local building code must also be met for any building in a
flood hazard area.
   "TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED." Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/
or cooling system, built-in or appliance.
   "VARIANCE." A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter.
   "VIOLATION." The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in §§
91.20 et seq. and §§
91.40 et seq. is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   "WATER SURFACE ELEVATION (WSE)." The height, in relation to NAVD 1988, of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine
areas.
   "WATERCOURSE." A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the BFE and the elevation to which the
structure is to be built and that such construction below the BFE increases
risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the BFE may result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to $25 per S100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal

(Ord., passed 8-23-89; Am. Ord., passed 11-22-05; Am. Ord., passed 4-25-18)
§ 91.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where BFE data has been provided, as set
forth in §
91.07 or §
91.42 the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
91.40, are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
91.05.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
91.05. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with §
91.45(B). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the floodproofing standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification
shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in §
91.21(C), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
91.05.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is
above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) of this section.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall not be temperature-controlled or conditioned;
      (3)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      (4)   Shall include, in Zones A, AB, AH, AO, A99 flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      (5)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record a non-
conversion agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring that the
area below the lowest floor shall not be improved, finished or otherwise
converted to habitable space; the Village of Walnut Creek will have the right
to inspect the enclosed area. The Village of Walnut Creek will conduct annual
inspections. This agreement shall be recorded with the Wayne County Register of
Deeds and shall transfer with the property in perpetuity.
      (6)   Release of restrictive covenant. If a property which is bound by a
non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed areas below BFE, then
the owner may request release of restrictive covenant after staff inspection
and submittal of confirming documentation.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally
modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the
addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
      (2)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one-year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with
the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the ten-
year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this chapter.
Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement
does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions.
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Temporary placement:
         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (b)   Be fully licensed nod ready for highway use (A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no
permanently attached additions).
      (2)   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
   (G)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation; of a location outside
the Special Flood Hazard Area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures.
      (1)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be

hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation in conformance with the provisions of §
91.41(D)(4).
      (2)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet
or that is a minimal investment of $3,000 or less and satisfies the criteria
outlined above is not required to meet the elevation or floodproofing standards
of §
91.41(B). Elevation or f1oodproofing certifications are required for all other
accessory structures in accordance with §
91.41(C).
   (I)   Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within a
Special Flood Hazard Area, the following criteria shall be met:

hazard area;
      (3)   Above-ground tanks, not elevated. Above-ground tanks that do not
meet the elevation requirements of §
91.41(B) shall be permitted in flood hazard areas provided the tanks are
designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist all flood-related and
other loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of the design
flood and without release of contents in the floodwaters or infiltration by
floodwaters into the tanks. Tanks shall be designed, constructed, installed,
and anchored to resist the potential buoyant and other flood forces acting on
an empty tank during design flood conditions;
      (4)   Tank inlets and vents. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and
vents shall be:
         (a)   At or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or fitted
with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the
contents of the tanks during conditions of the design flood; and
         (b)   Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic

   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet
each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is
greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined based on the following criteria:
      (1)   When BFE data is available from other sources, all new construction
and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all
applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be elevated or floodproofed in
accordance with standards in §§
91.40 and
91.41.
      (2)   When floodway or non-encroachment data is available from a federal,
state, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements

outlined in §§
91.40 and
91.41, shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
      (1)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result
in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain
Administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
      (2)   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by
FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six months
of completion of the proposed encroachment.

91.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to §§
91.40 and
91.41, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
   (A)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
   (B)   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed
to the same level as required in division (A) so that the structure, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that level shall be
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and

(Ord., passed - -)
§ 92.10 PERMIT CHOICE.
   (A)   This section applies to all development permits issued by the village.
   (B)   If a development permit applicant submits a permit application for any
type of development and a rule or ordinance is amended, including an amendment
to any applicable land development regulation, between the time the development
permit application was submitted and a development permit decision is made, the
development permit applicant may choose which adopted version of the rule or
ordinance will apply to the permit and use of the building, structure, or land
indicated on the permit application. If the development permit applicant
chooses the version of the rule or ordinance applicable at the time of the
permit application, the development permit applicant shall not be required to
await the outcome of the amendment to the rule, map, or ordinance prior to
acting on the development permit.
   (C)   Where multiple local development permits are required to complete a
development project, the development permit applicant may choose the version of
each of the local land development regulations applicable to the project upon
submittal of the application for the initial development permit. This provision
is applicable only for those subsequent development permit applications filed
within 18 months of the date following the approval of an initial permit. For
purposes of the vesting protections of this section, an erosion and
sedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial development
permit.
   (D)   If a permit application is placed on hold at the request of the
applicant for a period of six consecutive months or more, or the applicant
fails to respond to comments or provide additional information reasonably
requested by the village for a period of six consecutive months or more, the
application review shall be discontinued and the development regulations in
effect at the time permit processing is resumed shall be applied to the
application.
(Ord., passed 6-23-21)
§ 92.11 VESTED RIGHTS.
   (A)   Vested rights, if established through a development plan approval
granted by the village, confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and
complete the development and use of the property under the terms and conditions
of the approved development plan.
   (B)   Duration of vesting. Local development permits expire after the time
period specified in the section of this chapter in which they are authorized,
unless work authorized by the permit has substantially commenced.
   (C)   Discontinued work. Except where a longer vesting period is provided by
statute or land development regulation, the statutory vesting granted for a
development project, once established, expires for an uncompleted development
project if development work is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a
period of not less than 24 consecutive months, and the statutory vesting period
granted by this section for a nonconforming use of property expires if the use
is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24
consecutive months. The 24-month discontinuance period is automatically tolled
during the pendency of any board of adjustment proceeding or civil action in a
state or federal trial or appellate court regarding the validity of a
development permit, the use of the property, or the existence of the statutory
vesting period granted by this section. The 24-month discontinuance period is
also tolled during the pendency of any litigation involving the development
project or property that is the subject of the vesting.
   (D)   Process to claim vested right. A person claiming a statutory or common
law vested right may submit information to substantiate that claim to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer, who shall make an initial determination as to the
existence of the vested right. The decision of the Zoning Administrator or
Officer may be appealed under G.S. § 160D-405.
   (E)   Ownership of vested rights. The vested rights granted by this section
run with the land.
   (F)   Multi-phased development. A multi-phased development is vested for the
entire development with the land development regulations then in place at the
time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased
development.
      (1)   A right which has been vested as provided for in this division (F)
(1) remains vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan
approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development.
      (2)   A development containing 25 acres or more that is both of the
following:
         (a)   Submitted for development permit approval to occur in more than
one phase.
         (b)   Subject to a master development plan with committed elements
showing the type and intensity of use of each phase.
   (G)   Site-specific vesting plans. A site-specific vesting plan consists of
a plan submitted to the village in which the applicant requests vesting
pursuant to this section. If the plan is approved, the resulting vested right
confers upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development
and use of the property under the terms and conditions of the site-specific
vesting plan, including any amendments thereto.
   (H)   The following plans constitute a site-specific vesting plan under the
village ordinances:
      (1)   Preliminary subdivision plat;
      (2)   Special use permit;
      (3)   Site plan;
      (4)   Conditional zoning;
   (I)   These plans shall be reviewed as site-specific vesting plans using the
procedures for each corresponding permit type included in the village
ordinances.
   (J)   If approved, each plan shall have a period of validity of two years.
   (K)   A variance does not constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and
approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be
obtained does not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance
is obtained.
   (L)   The village may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms
and conditions that may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare.
   (M)   A vested right, once established as provided for in this section,
precludes any zoning action by the Village which would change, alter, impair,
prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as
set forth in an approved site-specific vesting plan, except under one or more
of the following conditions:
      (1)   With the written consent of the affected landowner.
      (2)   Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary
hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of
the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health,
safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site-
specific vesting plan.
      (3)   To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for
all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but
not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all
architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consulting fees incurred
after approval by the local government, together with interest as provided
under G.S. § 160D-106. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the
value of the property which is caused by the action.
      (4)   Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary
hearing, that the landowner or the landowner’s representative intentionally
supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations that made a
difference in the approval by the local government of the site-specific vesting
plan or the phased development plan.
      (5)   Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or
regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site-specific
vesting plan or the phased development plan, in which case the village may
modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or
federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and
an evidentiary hearing.
   (N)   The establishment of a vested right under this section does not
preclude the application of overlay zoning or other development regulations
which impose additional requirements but do not affect the allowable type or
intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and
are applicable to all property subject to development regulation by the
village, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical,
and mechanical codes.
   (O)   Otherwise applicable new regulations become effective with respect to
property which is subject to a site-specific vesting plan upon the expiration
or termination of the vesting rights period provided for in this section.
   (P)   Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of a
vested right does not preclude, change, or impair the authority of a local
government to adopt and enforce development regulations governing nonconforming
situations or uses.
(Ord., passed 6-23-21)
§ 92.12 ANNUAL REPORT, ANALYSIS OF EXPENDITURES, AND BUDGET REQUEST.
   The Planning Board shall, in May of each year, submit in writing to the
Village Council a report of its activities and an analysis of the expenditures
to date for the current fiscal year; and shall submit to the Village Council
for budget consideration its requested budget of funds needed for operation
during the ensuing fiscal year.

§ 93.18 FINAL PLAT.
   After the improvements shown on the approved preliminary plat have been
installed, or guaranteed, for the whole or portion of a subdivision, the
applicant shall submit a final plat of the area covered by such improvements.
The final plat shall be prepared by a registered surveyor or professional
engineer licensed to practice in North Carolina and shall conform to the
provisions of G.S. § 47-30.1. It should be noted that detailed plans for water
and waste water systems must be prepared by a registered engineer licensed to
practice in North Carolina.
   (A)   No less than seven days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting
of the Planning Board, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Board seven
paper print copies and one final plat suitable for reproduction. Within 45 days
of submission, the final plat shall be reviewed by the Planning Board for
compliance with the approved preliminary plat. The Planning Board may appoint
an engineer or surveyor to check the final plat against the subdivision's
actual layout for correctness, charging the costs to the subdivider if the plat
is found to be in error.
   (B)   (1)   If the Planning Board disapproves the final plat, the reasons
for such action shall be stated in writing and references shall be made to the
specific section of the chapter with which the plat does not complete. Appeals
from this decision may be made directly to the Village Council.

with recommendations, such plat to the Village Council. The Village Council
shall approve or disapprove the final plat within 90 days after submission by
the Planning Board.
      (4)   Approval of the final plat is authorization for the plat to be
filed with the Register of Deeds.
      (5)   This approval shall be noted on four copies of the final plat. One
copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy shall be transmitted to the
Wayne County Register of Deeds for recording at the expense of the subdivider,
one copy shall be transmitted to the Council Health Department, Sanitation
Division, and one copy shall be retained for the permanent files of the
Planning Board.
      (6)   No final plat shall be approved until all improvements are
installed or meet the requirement set forth in §§
93.65 through
93.68, all required fees have been paid, and certificates required by this
chapter to appear on the final plat have been properly filled out and signed.
   (C)   If the final plat is not in compliance with these regulations or the
Village Council does not accept the changes from the approved preliminary plat,
the subdivider shall be given 60 days to submit a revised final plat. If a
revised final plat is not submitted within 60 days, the reasons for disapproval
and recommendations on the basis of which the proposed subdivision would be
approved shall be noted on two copies of the final plat. One copy shall be
returned to the subdivider and one copy shall be retained by the Village
Council.

street shall be recommended for acceptance for maintenance by the North
Carolina Department of Transportation, or the village nor shall any permit, if
required, be issued by any administrative agent or by the village for the
construction of any building or other improvement requiring a permit, upon any
land requiring final plat approval, unless and until the requirements set forth
in this chapter have been compiled with and same approved by the Village
Council.
   (F)   The approval of a final plat pursuant to regulations adopted under
this subchapter shall not be deemed to constitute or effect the acceptance by
the village or the public of the dedication of any street or other ground,
public utility line, or other public facility shown on the plat.

   (C)   Provisions for street lighting shall also be incorporated in the
subdivider's utility plans.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77)
§ 93.51 BUFFER STRIPS.
   In residential districts, a buffer strip, at least 50 feet in depth in
addition to the normal lot size and depth required, shall be provided adjacent
to all railroads and limited access highways, commercial and/or industrial
developments and public developments. This strip shall be a part of the platted
lots, but shall have the following restrictions lettered on the face of the
plat. This strip reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs by the owner; the
building of structures hereon is prohibited.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77)
§ 93.52 COMPLIANCE WITH OFFICIAL PLANS.
   Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a major thoroughfare,
parkway or boulevard designated in the official maps and plans for the village,
such part of such proposed public way shall be platted and dedicated by the
subdivider in the location and at the width specified.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77)
§ 93.53 SITES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES.
   When a subdivision plat is submitted for approval, in which, according to
the land use or land development plan a school site should be reserved, the
Planning Board shall notify the Wayne County Board of Education that the
subdivision has been submitted for approval and that under the ordinance a
school site may be reserved therein. In reviewing the subdivision and giving
approval thereto, the Planning Board shall consult the Board of Education in
determining the exact size and location of any school site to be reserved
therein. Before the final plat of the subdivision is approved, the Board of
Education shall determine whether or not it wishes to have a school site
reserved in the subdivision. If the Board of Education does wish to have a
school site reserved in the subdivision, the subdivision as finally approved
shall reserve a school site of a size and location agreeable to the Board of
Education and to the Planning Board. The Board of Education shall then have 18
months beginning on the date of final approval of the subdivision within which
to acquire the site. If the Board of Education has not purchased or begun
proceedings to acquire the site within 18 months after the subdivision is
finally approved, the subdivider may proceed to dispose of it in accordance
with the subdivision procedures and provisions of this chapter.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77)
IMPROVEMENTS
§ 93.65 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Prior to approval of a final plat for the subdivision of land within
the jurisdiction of the village, the subdivider shall have installed
improvements specified in this subchapter or guaranteed their installation as
provided.
   (B)   No services or utilities shall be extended or furnished to any
subdivision until the subdivider shall have installed the improvements
specified in this subchapter or guaranteed their installation as provided.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77)
§ 93.66 GUARANTEES OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   In lieu of prior construction of the improvements required by this
subchapter, the village may, for the purpose of approving a final plat, accept
a guarantee from the subdivider that such improvements will be carried out
according to the village's specifications at his expense.
      (1)   Type. The type of the performance guarantee shall be at the
election of the developer. The term “PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE” means any of the
following forms of guarantee:
         (a)   Surety bond issued by any company authorized to do business in
this state.
         (b)   Letter of credit issued by any financial institution licensed to
do business in this state.
         (c)   Other form of guarantee that provides equivalent security to a
surety bond or letter of credit.
      (1a)   Duration. The duration of the performance guarantee shall
initially be one year, unless the developer determines that the scope of work
for the required improvements necessitates a longer duration. In the case of a
bonded obligation, the completion date shall be set one year from the date the
bond is issued, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the
required improvements necessitates a longer duration.
      (1b)   Extension. A developer shall demonstrate reasonable, good-faith
progress toward completion of the required improvements that are secured by the
performance guarantee or any extension. If the improvements are not completed
to the specifications of the village, and the current performance guarantee is
likely to expire prior to completion of the required improvements, the
performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance guarantee issued,
for an additional period. An extension under this subdivision shall only be for
a duration necessary to complete the required improvements. If a new
performance guarantee is issued, the amount shall be determined by the
procedure provided in division (A)(3) below and shall include the total cost of
all incomplete improvements.
      (2)   Release. The performance guarantee shall be returned or released,
as appropriate, in a timely manner upon the acknowledgement by the village that
the improvements for which the performance guarantee is being required are
complete. The village shall return letters of credit or escrowed funds upon
completion of the required improvements to its specifications or upon
acceptance of the required improvements, if the required improvements are
subject to local government acceptance. When required improvements that are
secured by a bond are completed to the specifications of the village, or are
accepted by the village, if subject to its acceptance, upon request by the
developer, the village shall timely provide written acknowledgement that the
required improvements have been completed.
      (3)   Amount. The amount of the performance guarantee shall not exceed
125% of the reasonably estimated cost of completion at the time the performance
guarantee is issued. The village may determine the amount of the performance
guarantee or use a cost estimate determined by the developer. The reasonably
estimated cost of completion shall include 100% of the costs for labor and
materials necessary for completion of the required improvements. Where
applicable, the costs shall be based on unit pricing. The additional 25%
allowed under this division (A)(3) includes inflation and all costs of
administration regardless of how such fees or charges are denominated. The
amount of any extension of any performance guarantee shall be determined
according to the procedures for determining the initial guarantee and shall not
exceed 125% of the reasonably estimated cost of completion of the remaining
incomplete improvements still outstanding at the time the extension is
obtained.
      (3a)   Timing. The performance guarantee shall be posted at the time the
plat is recorded.
      (4)   Coverage. The performance guarantee shall only be used for
completion of the required improvements and not for repairs or maintenance
after completion.
      (5)   Multiple guarantees. The developer shall have the option to post
one type of a performance guarantee as provided for in division (A)(1) above,
in lieu of multiple bonds, letters of credit, or other equivalent security, for
all development matters related to the same project requiring performance
guarantees.
      (6)   Exclusion. Performance guarantees associated with erosion control
and stormwater control measures are not subject to the provisions of this
section.
   (B)   The village shall require a bond guaranteeing utility taps, curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, drainage facilities, water and sewer lines, and other
improvements against defects for one year. This bond shall be in the amount
determined by the Village Council and shall be in cash or be made by a surety
company authorized to do business in North Carolina.
   (C)   The Village Council shall secure from all subdividers a letter in
which said subdivider shall agree to maintain the backfill and improvements
located thereon and therein and any ditch or drain tile which has been dug or
installed in connection with the installation of such improvements. Such letter
shall be binding on the subdivider for a period of one year after the
acceptance of such improvements by the Village Council. The subdivider shall
notify the buyer of the nature, extent, and location of these improvements and
shall include such notice as a part of the written sales transaction. The buyer
is to assume maintenance and upkeep for these improvements and this
responsibility for maintenance of such improvements on all such lands until
sale thereof is made.
   (D)   No final plat will be accepted for review by the Village Council
unless this section has been complied with.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77; Am. Ord., passed 11-20-85; Am. Ord., passed 6-23-21)
§ 93.67 PERMANENT REFERENCE POINTS.
   Prior to the approval of the final plat the following survey reference
makers shall be installed.
   (A)   Permanent concrete monuments four inches in diameter or four inches by
four inches square, and not less than three feet long, shall be placed at not
less than two corners of the subdivision and at all corners of all
intersections, provided that additional monuments shall be placed where
necessary so that no point within the subdivision lies more than 500 feet from
a monument. Two or more of the required monuments shall be designated as
control corners. The top of each monument shall have an indented cross, metal
pin, or metal plate to identify properly the location of the point. All
monuments shall be shown on the final plat. A monument shall be at least 30
inches in the ground with at least six inches exposed above the ground unless
this requirement is impractical.
   (B)   All lot corners, all points where the street lines intersect the
exterior boundaries of the subdivision, and all angle points of curve in each
street shall be marked with iron pipe or iron stakes at least one-half inch in
diameter and 24 inches long, driven so as to be within one inch of finished
grade.
   (C)   At least one corner of the property surveyed shall be designated by
course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker. If a
corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station or N.C. Grid
System coordinated monument, then this corner shall be marked with a monument
so designated and shall be accurately tied to the station or monument by
computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement
identifying the station or monument and to an accuracy of at least 1:5,000.
When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some
pertinent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical
object or structure.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77)
§ 93.68 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Street improvements.
      (1)   The subdivider shall bear the costs of grading all streets within
the subdivision to their full right-of-way width except on major thoroughfares
where he shall bear the costs of grading to a width of 60 feet. Finished grade
cross-section, and profile shall be approved by the Village Council or their
designee.
      (2)   The subdivider shall bear the costs of the installation of base
material and paving for all streets within the subdivision in accordance with
the Minimum Construction Standards for Subdivision Roads of the North Carolina
Department of Transportation, Division of Highways. For major thoroughfares,
the subdivider shall be responsible for the cost of base materials and paving
equal to that required to construct a minor thoroughfare only. The subdivider
is encouraged to install combination curbs and gutters on all streets within
the subdivision.
   (B)   Water and sewer facilities.
      (1)   Unless the Village Council agrees or directs otherwise, the
subdivider will install water and sanitary sewer mains and lines and connect to
the village water system under the following policies:
         (a)   All property proposed for development shall have installed
adequate water lines and sewer lines to be connected with the village water and
sewer system. The subdivider shall bear the costs of all extensions necessary
to connect with the village water and sewer system.
         (b)   Water and sewer mains and lines shall be constructed in
accordance with specifications and plans approved by the Village Council.
         (c)   As soon as water and sewer mains and lines are completed and
connected to the village system, they shall, at the time of connection become
the property of the village.
         (d)   No water mains less than six inches in diameter shall be laid.
Sanitary sewers shall be no smaller than eight inches in diameter.
         (e)   When it is necessary for a developer to extend water or sewer
lines and mains to property being developed in order to comply with the
provisions of this subchapter, the village agrees that the subdivider can be
reimbursed as follows: In the event a property owner adjacent to said extended
service desires to tap into such lines, such owner shall be charged a pro rata
fee to be set by the Village Council. This charge shall be in addition to the
tapping fee provided for tapping onto the village water or sewer lines. The
additional charge collected by the village shall be used to reimburse the
developer who paid for the extension of such lines. Reimbursement shall
terminate ten years after completion of installation or when complete
reimbursement has been made, whichever occurs first.
         (f)   Fire hydrants shall be installed at a maximum interval of 500
feet.
      (2)   If the developer provides a community water and/or sewer system
rather than connecting to the municipal system(s) or provides individual well
(s) and/or septic tank(s), the materials, design, and installation shall be
subject to approval by the Division of Health Services, Department of Human
Resources, the North Carolina Division of Environmental Management, Department
of Natural and Economic Resources and the Wayne County Health Department.
         (a)   Sanitary sewers shall be no smaller in size than eight inches
nominal diameter. Water distribution lines shall be no smaller in size than six
inches nominal diameter with the following exceptions.
         (b)   On cul-de-sacs which are served by a fire hydrant at their
intersection with a local street, and said hydrant is connected to a water line
of six inches nominal diameter, or larger, water service may be provided with
lines of smaller than six inches, but not less than two inches if a blow-off
valve is established at the end of such line or the line is connected to
another line within the subdivision to form a loop. This exception shall not
apply where such line represents the interconnection between the subdivision
and the municipal system. On streets which are "stubbed out" at property lines
to permit future development, service must be provided by lines of at least six
inches nominal diameter.
         (c)   For the purpose of this section, the terms "water system" and
"sewer system" shall include all appurtenance and fixtures normally associated
with such facilities, including fire hydrants, gate valves, blow-offs,
manholes, and pumping apparatus. The term "water system" shall also include
such wells, well sites, pumping apparatus and tanks as required by the Village
Council. The subdivider shall bear the costs of such water system. The design
of such water system shall be subject to the approval of the Village Council.
   (C)   Storm drainage. The subdivider shall provide an adequate drainage
system for the proper drainage of all surface water in order to protect the
proposed development from water damage. The design of such system shall be
subject to the approval of the Planning Board.
      (1)   No surface water shall be channeled or directed into a sanitary
sewer.
      (2)   Where feasible, the subdivider shall connect to a municipal storm
drainage system.
      (3)   Where the municipal storm drainage system cannot feasibly be
extended to the subdivision, a surface drainage system shall be designed to
complement surface drainage systems to surrounding properties.
      (4)   Cross pipe under streets and driveways shall be concrete,
reinforced concrete, or other pipe, as approved by the Village Council. All
such cross pipes shall be a minimum of 15 inches in diameter.
      (5)   Surface drainage courses shall have side slopes of at least one
foot of horizontal distances blended into the landscape and seeded. The spoil
shall not be allowed to wash back into the drainage course.
      (6)   The minimum grade along the bottom of a surface drainage course
shall be one-tenth (0.1) percent, with a maximum of five-tenths (0.5) percent.
In some instances, grades exceeding the maximum may be allowed if recommended
by the Wayne Soil and Water Conservation District.
   (D)   Street name signs. Street name signs which meet village specifications
shall be placed at all street intersections.
   (E)   Underground utilities. Within the subdivision, the subdivider shall
cause all new utilities installed to serve the subdivision to be placed
underground without expense to the village. Such underground utilities shall
include, but not be limited to, electrical distribution, telephone, and
cablevision facilities.
   (F)   Street trees. It is recommended that street trees be planted in all
subdivisions. The planting of street trees is considered a duty of the
subdivider as well as good business practice. Street trees are a protection
against excessive heat and glare and enhance the attractiveness and value of
the property. Trees, where planted, shall be planted inside the property lines
where they are less subject to injury, decrease the chance of motor accidents,
and enjoy more favorable conditions for growth.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 93.80 EXCEPTIONS.
   The standards and requirements of this chapter may be modified by the
Village Council in the case of a planned unit development, which in the
judgment of the Village Council provides adequate public spaces and
improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of
the tract when fully developed and populated, and which also provides such
covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity to and
achievement of the plan.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77; Am. Ord., passed 11-20-85)
§ 93.81 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Where because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the
site, strict adherence to the provisions of the regulations of this chapter
would cause an unnecessary hardship, the Village Council may authorize a
variancefollowing the procedures and standards included in this section.
   (B)   Application and fee. Landowners who would like to seek a variance
shall complete an application using the form provided by the village, and pay
the required fee. Village staff shall then review the application, prepare a
staff report, and forward the application and staff report to the Village
Council.
   (C)   Hearing procedures. The Village Council shall hold an evidentiary
hearing on each variance request using the quasi-judicial procedures included
in §
94.58(C).
   (D)   Variance standards. The Village Council shall issue a variance upon a
showing of all of the following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the regulation. It is not necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability.
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-
created hardship.
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.
   (E)   Voting. A four-fifths vote of the Village Council shall be required in
order to issue a variance. For the purposes of this division (E), vacant
positions on the Board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-
judicial matter under G.S. § 160D-109(d) shall not be considered members of the
Board for calculation of the requisite majority.
   (F)   No change in use. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by
variance.
   (G)   Variance conditions. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any
variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.

§ 93.82 DUTY OF REGISTER OF DEEDS.
   The village shall file a copy of this chapter with the Register of Deeds of
Wayne County. The Register of Deeds shall not thereafter file or record a plat
of subdivision location within the platting jurisdiction of the village without
the approval of the subdivision as required in this chapter. The landowner or
his authorized agent, shall on a subdivision plat submitted for recording, sign
a statement on the plat stating whether or not any land shown thereon is within
the platting jurisdiction of the village as defined herein. The filing or
recording of a plat of subdivision without the approval of the subdivision as
required by this chapter, shall be null and void.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77)
§ 93.83 AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.
   This chapter may be amended from time-to-time by the Village Council as
herein specified but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have
been proposed by or shall have been submitted to the Planning Board for review
and recommendation. The Planning Board shall have 45 days within which to
submit its report. If the Planning Board fails to submit a report within the
specified time, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval of the
amendment. A public hearing shall be held by the Village Council before it
considers whether to make any amendment to this chapter. A notice of such
public hearing shall be given once a week for two consecutive calendar weeks in
a newspaper of general circulation in Wayne County. The notice shall be
published the first time not less than 15 days nor more than 25 days prior to
the date established for such public hearing.

APPENDIX C: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
Pursuant to the requirements and guidelines of the National Environmental
Protection Act, the Council on Environmental Quality, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, and the State Environmental Policy Act, the
following is a summary of environmental considerations regarding the
Subdivision Regulations for The Village of Walnut Creek, North Carolina.
1.   Abstract: The Subdivision Regulations will constitute a municipal
ordinance, setting forth provisions that will aid in bringing orderly
development. This ordinance applies to the future subdivision of land within
the village planning jurisdiction as authorized by the General Statutes of
North Carolina. Included are provisions for the orderly layout of streets: for
properly identifying, monumenting and recording real estate for insuring that
adequate improvements are installed in new subdivisions; and the establishment
of a plat review and approval process.
2.   Environmental Impact: These regulations, if adopted and adequately
enforced, will have a favorable impact on the environment because of more
efficient use of land, sewage collection and disposal requirements, and soil
erosion control requirements.
3.   Adverse Environmental Effects Which Cannot Be Avoided: The subdivision
regulations will not create any adverse environmental effects.
4.   Alternatives: Three other alternatives exist; no subdivision regulations,
less restrictive subdivision regulations, and more restrictive regulations. The
first two alternatives would not produce satisfactory development controls. The
third alternative would excessively retard development.
5.   The Relationship Between Local Short-Term Uses Of Man's Environment And
The Maintenance And Enhancement Of Long-Term Productivity: The subdivision
regulations require street and lot design compatible with land characteristics.
A short-term consideration is that families will enjoy more pleasurable
residential developments while at the same time protecting long-term
productivity considerations embracing soils, vegetation and other unique
topography.
6.   Irreversible And Irretrievable Commitments Of Resources: The subdivision
regulations will not commit resources, but rather help direct the commitment of
resources in a protective manner.
7.   Applicable Federal And State Environmental Controls: Federal Controls
include the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. State Legislation
includes the North Carolina Environmental Policy Act of 71 (Chapter 113A).
8.   Mitigation Measures Proposed To Minimize Impact: One of the primary
purposes of subdivision regulations is to minimize the impact of development on
the natural environment.
(Ord., passed 6-2-77)
APPENDIX D: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
The objective of The Village of Walnut Creek Subdivision Regulations is to
establish procedures and standards for the development and subdivision of real
estate within The Village of Walnut Creek planning jurisdiction. Furthermore,
these regulations provide for an orderly layout of further residential
development and require that adequate utilities be installed in all new
subdivisions.
The Subdivision Regulations provide the procedures for subdivision plat review
and are designed to improve the overall living environment for all of The
Village of Walnut Creek citizens through the general improvement of land
subdivision and land recordation.
The following charts attempt to Illustrate the overall beneficial effects which
should result from compliance with this ordinance.

(Ord., passed 2-22-79)
§ 94.06 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS; ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be
held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety,
health, convenience, prosperity and general welfare. It is not intended by this
chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants, or
other agreements between parties, provided, however, that where this chapter
imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the
height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or
required by other ordinances, rules, regulations, or by easements, covenants or
agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall govern, provided that nothing
in this chapter shall be construed to amend or repeal any other existing
ordinance of the village.
(Ord., passed 2-22-79)
§ 94.07 AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES.
   (A)   The Village Council may, on its own motion or upon recommendation of
the Planning Board, or upon petition by any person within the zoning
jurisdiction, amend the regulations or the maps which are a part of this
chapter. No zoning regulation or zoning maps shall be amended, supplemented,
changed, modified or repealed except through the following procedures:
      (1)   Hearing with published notice. The Village Council shall hold a
legislative hearing. A notice of the hearing shall be given once a week for two
successive calendar weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the
area. The notice shall be published the first time not less than ten days nor
more than 25 days before the date scheduled for the hearing. In computing such
period, the day of publication is not to be included but the day of the hearing
shall be included.
      (2)   Notice for zoning map amendments.
         (a)   Mailed notice. When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the
owners of affected parcels of land and the owners of all parcels of land
abutting that parcel of land shall be mailed a notice of the hearing on a
proposed zoning map amendment by first-class mail at the last addresses listed
for such owners on the county tax abstracts. For the purpose of this section,
properties are "abutting" even if separated by a street, railroad, or other
transportation corridor. This notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten
but not more than 25 days prior to the date of the hearing.
         (b)   Optional notice for large-scale zoning map amendments. The
first-class mail notice required under division (A)(2)(a) above is not required
if the zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning designation of more
than 50 properties, owned by at least 50 different property owners, and the
village elects to use the expanded published notice provided for in this
division (A)(2)(b). In this instance, the village may elect to make the mailed
notice provided for in division (A)(2)(a) above or, as an alternative, elect to
publish notice of the hearing as required by G.S. § 160D-601, provided that
each advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size.
The advertisement is effective only for property owners who reside in the area
of general circulation of the newspaper that publishes the notice. Property
owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation area, according to the
address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected
property, shall be notified according to the provisions of division (A)(2)(a)
above.
         (c)   Posted notice. When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the
local government shall prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site
proposed for the amendment or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-
way. The notice shall be posted within the same time period specified for
mailed notices of the hearing. When multiple parcels are included within a
proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not
required but the local government shall post sufficient notices to provide
reasonable notice to interested persons.
      (3)   Notice to military bases. If the adoption or modification would
result in changes to the zoning map or would change or affect the permitted
uses of land located five miles or less from the perimeter boundary of a
military base, the village shall provide written notice of the proposed changes
by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the commander of the military
base not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the
hearing. If the commander of the military base provides comments or analysis
regarding the compatibility of the proposed development regulation or amendment
with military operations at the base, the Village Council shall take the
comments and analysis into consideration before making a final determination on
the ordinance.
      (4)   Down-zoning. No amendment to zoning regulations or a zoning map
that down-zones property shall be initiated nor is it enforceable without the
written consent of all property owners whose property is the subject of the
down-zoning amendment, unless the down-zoning amendment is initiated by the
village. For purposes of this section, "DOWN-ZONING" means a zoning ordinance
that affects an area of land in one of the following ways:
         (a)   By decreasing the development density of the land to be less
dense than was allowed under its previous usage.
         (b)   By reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in
a zoning ordinance or land development regulation to fewer uses than were
allowed under its previous usage.
      (5)   Planning Board review.
         (a)   Timeframe. Every proposed amendment or repeal to this chapter
shall be referred to the Planning Board for its recommendation and report. If
no written report is received from the Planning Board within 30 days of
referral of the amendment to that Board, the Village Council may act on the
amendment without the Planning Board report. The Village Council is not bound
by the recommendations, if any, of the Planning Board.
         (b)   Plan consistency. When conducting a review of proposed zoning
text or map amendments pursuant to this section, the Planning Board shall
advise and comment on whether the proposed action is consistent with any
comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan
that is applicable. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation
to the Village Council that addresses plan consistency and other matters as
deemed appropriate by the Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board
that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not
preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Village
Council.
         (c)   Plan consistency for large-scale rezonings. If a zoning map
amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the
Planning Board statement describing plan consistency may address the overall
rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted
plans were considered in the recommendation made.
      (6)   Village Council review.
         (a)   Plan Consistency. When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or
map amendment, the Village Council shall approve a brief statement describing
whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive
plan.
            1.   If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed
inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect
of also amending the Future Land-Use Map, and no additional request or
application for a plan amendment shall be required.
            2.   A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered
concurrently.
            3.   The plan consistency statement is not subject to judicial
review.
            4.   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale
rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the governing board statement describing
plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis
and policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the action taken.
         (b)   Additional reasonableness statement for rezonings.
            1.   When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map
amendment, a statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning
shall be approved by the governing board. This statement of reasonableness may
consider, among other factors:
               A.   The size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the
area proposed to be rezoned;
               B.   The benefits and detriments to the landowners, the
neighbors, and the surrounding community;
               C.   The relationship between the current actual and permissible
development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be
permissible under the proposed amendment;
               D.   Why the action taken is in the public interest; and
               E.   Any changed conditions warranting the amendment.
            2.   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale
rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the governing board statement on
reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.
         (c)   Single statement permissible. The statement of reasonableness
and the plan consistency statement required by this section may be approved as
a single statement.
      (7)   Application requirements. All petitions for a change in the zoning
map or the zoning regulations shall include the information required on the
current application form provided by the village, and pay the fee listed in the
current fee schedule.

parallel to the center lines of streets, alleys, or highways, or the rights of
way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel
thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning map.
   (D)   Where a district boundary line divides a lot or tract in single
ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of such
lot or tract shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided such depth
extensions shall not include any part of a lot or tract more than 35 feet
beyond the district boundary line. The term "least restricted" shall refer to
use restrictions, not lot or tract size.
(Ord., passed 2-22-79)

constructed, or maintained so as to interfere with vision clearance along any
street, road or highway or at any intersection or junction of two or more
traffic arteries; nor shall any advertising sign or structure be located within

not permanently fixed shall not be allowed.
   (D)   Administration and maintenance. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
order the immediate removal of any signs that are not constructed or maintained
in accordance with the provisions of this section. All advertising signs,

the regulations of this chapter before the two-year expiration date:
      (1)   Any alteration of a nonconforming sign shall make that sign conform
to the regulations of this chapter.

Department of Transportation shall comply with the requirements of G.S. § 136-
32.
   (G)   Whenever this chapter permits a commercial sign, a non- commercial

§ 94.37 OFF-STREET PARKING AND STORAGE.
   It is the intent of this section to provide adequate parking in the various
districts established by this chapter. Off-street automobile parking or storage
space shall be provided on every lot on which any of the following uses are
hereafter established. At the time of the erection of any building, or at the
time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding
dwelling units, guest rooms, seats or floor area, or before conversion from one
type of use to another, permanent off-street parking space in the amount
specified by this section shall be provided. Such parking space may be provided
in a parking or properly graded open space.
   (A)   Certification of minimum parking requirements. Each application for a
zoning compliance permit or certificate of occupancy submitted to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer as provided for in §§ 94.82 and 94.83 shall include
information as to the location and dimensions of off-street parking and loading
space and the means of ingress and egress to such space. This information shall
be in sufficient detail to enable the Zoning Enforcement Officer to determine
whether the requirements of this section are met.
   (B)   Combination of required parking space. The required parking space for
any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required space
assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use, except that one-half of
the parking space required for churches, theaters, or assembly halls whose peak
attendance will be a night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be
closed at night or on Sundays.
   (C)   Requirements for parking lots in residential districts. Where parking
lots for more than five automobiles are permitted or required in residential
districts, the following provisions shall be complied with:
      (1)   The lot may be used only for parking and not for any type of
commercial loading, sales, repair work, dismantling or servicing.
      (2)   All entrances, exits, barricades at sidewalks, and drainage works
shall be approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer prior to construction.
      (3)   Only one entrance and one exit sign not larger than two square feet
in area prescribing parking regulations, but bearing no advertising matter, may
be erected at each entrance or exit. No other signs shall be permitted.

§ 94.39 SATELLITE DISH ANTENNAS.
   Satellite dish antennas are considered an accessory building or use and may
be permitted subject to the following conditions and criteria:
   (A)   An application for the installation of a satellite dish antenna shall
be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer and a zoning permit issued by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer prior to the installation, construction or
reconstruction of the satellite dish antenna. Each application for installation
shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, showing accurate
dimensions of the lot, and such other information as may be necessary to
provide for the enforcement of this chapter, including the height, diameter,
color, location, set backs, foundation details, landscaping, and screening,
including the plant materials and other materials to be used for screening or
otherwise.
   (B)   No satellite dish antenna shall be constructed in any front or side
yard, but, shall be constructed to the rear of the dwelling or principal
building. If a usable satellite signal cannot be obtained from the rear of the
property, application may be made for a variance pursuant to the provisions of
§
94.86. In such case, the burden of proof should be upon the applicant as to the
inability to receive a usable signal from the rear of the property.
   (C)   Not more than one satellite dish antenna shall be constructed or
maintained on any lot or combination of lots used as a residence.
   (D)   Any satellite dish antenna shall be effectively screened from any
adjacent property including lakes and golf courses or public right- of-way. The
screen may be structures, wood or masonry fence, or evergreen plant materials,
or earth berms, which uniformly reduce the view from the adjacent property or
right-of-way at least 75% to a height of six feet above ground elevation year
round. If evergreen plant materials are used for screening, they shall provide
the required screen at the time of initial planting and shall be maintained in
good condition by owner. If a fence or wall is used for screening, plantings on
the outside of the fence or wall shall be installed which will hide the
horizontal view of the fence or wall by more than 50% at the time of the
installation of the fence or wall.
   (E)   A satellite dish antenna shall not exceed a grade height of 12 feet.
   (F)   A satellite dish antenna shall not have a diameter greater than eight
feet.
   (G)   No satellite dish antenna shall be constructed upon the roof of any
principal building, tower, or other structure. Provided, however, that
notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a satellite dish antenna
that is no larger than 19 inches in diameter shall be permitted to be
constructed upon the rear portion of the roof of any principal building so long
as the height of such antenna does not exceed the height of the top ridge line
of the roof on which such antenna is placed. In such case, such satellite dish
antenna shall not be required to comply with the provisions of divisions (D)
and (E) of this section. Provided, further, a satellite dish antenna that is no
larger than 19 inches in diameter shall be exempt from that portion of division
(H) below which states that only open mesh materials shall be used for the
dish.
   (H)   Satellite dish antennas, including guy wires, supporting structures,
and accessory equipment, shall be constructed of materials and colors that

reasons for such action shall be stated in writing and reference shall be made
to the specific section of the village ordinances with which the preliminary
plan does not comply.
         (g)   If the Village Council approves the plan, a zoning permit shall
be issued. If disapproved, no zoning permit shall be issued.
   (F)    Nonconforming uses. Buildings, land and uses may exist in the

buildings are demolished, remodeled or renovated such that the renovation of
any existing property which results in any expansion of the existing square
footage or such that the cost of the renovation exceeds 25% of the value of the

   (A)   Purpose. Whereas, G.S. § 160A-385 authorizes local governments to
amend ordinances regulating land use within their jurisdiction. Whereas, the
purpose of this section is to regulate whole-house short-term rentals (WHSTRs)
and homestay rentals (HRs{'}'}, with the following goals determined to be
essential to preserving the health, safety, and general welfare of village
citizens, protection of neighborhoods, and property values:
      (1)   To clearly define whole-house short-term rental and homestay
rental.
      
      (2)   To clearly identify where whole-house short-term and homestay
rentals are permitted.
      (3)   To establish basic safety regulations for visitors renting WHSTRs.
      (4)   To protect neighborhoods from unwanted rentals and the problems
that arise as a result parties, noise, parking, dogs, trash, etc.
      (5)   To have a local contact to quickly and effectively address issues
that may arise during a rental stay.
      (6)   To allow permanent residents the opportunity to legally rent their
dwelling units where permitted.
      (7)   To regulate HRs and WHSTRs consistent with authority given by the
North Carolina General Statutes.

§ 94.58 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Encouraging and guiding high standards of site design allows certain
property uses to be permitted in certain designated districts where these uses
would not otherwise be acceptable. Requiring certain controls on site
improvements through the special use permit procedure will allow what is
otherwise considered to be undesirable to be developed so as to minimize any
objectionable or bad effects it might have on surrounding properties or
neighborhood.
   (B)   Special use permits granted by the Village Council.
      (1)   Special use permits may be granted by the Village Council for the
uses designated as special uses in any zoning district.
      (2)   The owner or owners of all property included in the petition for
the special use permit shall submit an application and pay the filing fee
established by resolution of the Village Council to the Zoning Enforcement
Officer at least 30 days prior to the next meeting date of the Village Council.
The application shall include all requirements pertaining to it as provided in
the applicable zoning district and on the current special use permit
application form. The Village Council shall then conduct an evidentiary hearing
following the procedures in §
94.58(C) below.
   (C)   Evidentiary hearing.
      (1)   Notice of hearing. Notice of evidentiary hearings shall be mailed
to the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request is the subject of
the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if
the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land
abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to any
other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by the development
regulation. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the village may rely on
the county tax listing to determine owners of property entitled to mailed
notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten days, but not
more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time
period, the village shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the
site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway
right-of-way. The Board may continue an evidentiary hearing that has been
convened without further advertisement. If an evidentiary hearing is set for a
given date and a quorum of the Board is not then present, the hearing shall be
continued until the next regular Board meeting without further advertisement.
      (2)   Administrative materials. The Administrator or staff to the Board
shall transmit to the Board all applications, reports, and written materials
relevant to the matter being considered. The administrative materials may be
distributed to the members of the Board prior to the hearing if at the same
time they are distributed to the Board a copy is also provided to the appellant
or applicant and to the landowner if that person is not the appellant or
applicant. The administrative materials shall become a part of the hearing
record. The administrative materials may be provided in written or electronic
form. Objections to inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials may be
made before or during the hearing. Rulings on unresolved objections shall be
made by the Board at the hearing.
      (3)   Presentation of evidence. The applicant, the village, and any
person who would have standing to appeal the decision under G.S. § 160D-1402(c)
shall have the right to participate as a party at the evidentiary hearing.
Other witnesses may present competent, material, and substantial evidence that
is not repetitive as allowed by the Board. Objections regarding jurisdictional
and evidentiary issues, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an
appeal or the standing of a party, may be made to the Board. The Board Chair
shall rule on any objections, and the Chair’s rulings may be appealed to the
full Board. These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to G.S.
§ 160D-1402. Objections based on jurisdictional issues may be raised for the
first time on judicial review.
      (4)   Appearance of official new issues. The official who made the
decision or the person currently occupying that position, if the decision maker
is no longer employed by the village, shall be present at the evidentiary
hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to
matters stated in a notice of appeal. If any party or the village would be
unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of
appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing.
      (5)   Oaths. The Chair of the Board or any member acting as Chair and the
Clerk to the Board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any
matter coming before the Board. Any person who, while under oath during a
proceeding before the Board determining a quasi-judicial matter, willfully
swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
      (6)   Subpoenas. The Board making a quasi-judicial decision under this
chapter through the Chair or, in the Chair's absence, anyone acting as Chair
may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request
issuance of a subpoena, the applicant, the village, and any person with
standing under G.S. § 160D-1402(c) may make a written request to the Chair
explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be
compelled. The Chair shall issue requested subpoenas he or she determines to be
relevant, reasonable in nature and scope, and not oppressive. The Chair shall
rule on any motion to quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas
made by the Chair may be immediately appealed to the full Board. If a person
fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this division (C)(6),
the Board or the party seeking the subpoena may apply to the General Court of
Justice for an order requiring that its subpoena be obeyed, and the Court shall
have jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all proper parties.
      (7)   Appeals in nature of certiorari. When hearing an appeal pursuant to
G.S. § 160D-947(e) or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing
shall be based on the record below, and the scope of review shall be as
provided in G.S. § 160D-1402(j).
      (8)   Voting. The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board shall be
necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to
decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the
nature of certiorari. For the purposes of this division (C)(8), vacant
positions on the Board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-
judicial matter under G.S. § 160D-109(d) shall not be considered members of the
Board for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified
alternates available to take the place of such members.
      (9)   Decisions. The Board shall determine contested facts and make its
decision within a reasonable time. When hearing an appeal, the Board may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from
and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to
be made. The Board shall have all the powers of the official who made the
decision. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent,
material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision
shall be reduced to writing, reflect the Board’s determination of contested
facts and their application to the applicable standards, and be approved by the
Board and signed by the Chair or other duly authorized member of the Board.
      (10)   In order to grant a special use permit, the Village Council shall
find:
         (a)   That the use will not endanger the public health, safety or
welfare if located where proposed and developed according to the plan as
submitted.
         (b)   That the use meets all required conditions and specifications
requested.
         (c)   That the use will not have a significant adverse impact on the
value of adjoining or abutting property.
         (d)   The location and character of the use, if developed according to
the plan submitted, will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood
and the Village of Walnut Creek.
      (11)   In granting a special use permit,the Village Council may designate
reasonable and appropriate conditions in addition and in connection therewith,
as will, in its opinion, assure that the use and its proposed location will be
harmonious with the area. All such additional conditions shall be consented to
in writing by the applicant, entered in the minutes of the meeting at which the
special use permit is granted and also on the building permit and on the
approved plans submitted therewith. All special conditions shall run with the
land and shall be binding on the original applicants for the special use
permit, their heirs, successors, and assigns unless otherwise specified in this
chapter. In a case where an application for a special use permit has been
denied, no reapplication for the same special use permit for the same property
or any part thereof shall be filed unless the Village Council shall find that
there have been substantial changes in the application or the conditions or
circumstances bearing on the application.
      (12)   If the Village Council denies the permit, it shall enter a report
of its action in the minutes of the meeting at which the action is taken.
      (13)   A quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written
decision with the Clerk to the Board or such other office or official as the
development regulation specifies. The decision of the Board shall be delivered
within a reasonable time by personal delivery, electronic mail, or first-class
mail to the applicant, landowner, and any person who has submitted a written
request for a copy prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person
required to provide notice shall certify to the village that proper notice has
been made, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of
fraud.
      (14)   Judicial review. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to
review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari
pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1402. Appeals shall be filed within the times specified
in G.S. § 160D-1405(d).
      (15)   In the event of failure to comply with the plans approved by the
Village Council, or with any other conditions imposed upon the special use
permit, the permit shall thereupon become void and of no effect. No permits of
any kind for further construction or certificates of occupancy under this
special use permit shall be issued.
      (16)   Where plans are submitted and approved as part of the application
for a special use permit, modifications of the original plans may be authorized
by the Village Council after review and recommendation by the Planning Board.

Penalty, see § 94.99
§ 94.68 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose. Conditional zoning districts (CD) are zoning districts in
which the development and use of the property is subject to predetermined
ordinance standards and the rules, regulations, and conditions imposed as part
of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the
particular property. A conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be
established only in accordance with specific standards and conditions
pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such a
nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately
surrounding area and on the entire community, which cannot be predetermined and
controlled by conventional district standards. There are also circumstances in
which a conventional district designation allowing such a use by right would
not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could,
if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the
objectives of these regulations and the adopted Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
      In addition, conditional zoning districts are intended only for firm
development proposals and should not be used for tentative projects without
definitive plans. The review process established in this section provides for
the accommodation of such uses by a classification or reclassification of
property into a conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions,
which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring
properties.
   (B)   Conditional districts established.
      (1)   A parallel conditional zoning district is a conditional zoning
district in which the potential permitted use or uses are, except as limited by
the conditions imposed on the district, of the same character or type as the
use or uses permitted in a conventional district having a parallel designation
or name. The following parallel zoning district categories are conditional
zoning districts:
         C-l CD      Commercial
         IG CD      Institutional & Government
         OA CD   Open Area
         R-25 CD   Residential
         R-30 CD   Residential
         R-35 CD   Residential
      (2)   The Patio Home Residential Conditional District (Patio Home RCD)
does not have a corresponding conventional district. The R-35 CT does not have
a corresponding conventional district.
   (C)   Procedure.
      (1)   A zoning or rezoning to a CD shall be initiated only by an
application signed by all the owners of the property or by an agent which has
written authorization from all of the owners to file such application.
      (2)   The applicant shall submit an application for a CD along with a
site plan that shall specify the use or uses that are intended for the
property, as well as any additional conditions on the use of the property that
the applicant proposes. The Village Council may waive the site plan requirement
at the time of rezoning provided a site plan is approved by the Village Council
prior to the issuance of any construction approvals.
      (3)   All applications for CDs shall be submitted at least two weeks
prior to the date of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Board
to facilitate a review and recommendation by village staff. A public hearing on
the application will be held at the next meeting of the Village Council in the
month after the consideration of the application by the Planning Board unless
the Planning Board recommends an earlier date for the public hearing.
   (D)   Consultation before formal application. To minimize development and
planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation and ensure
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, pre-application consultation
between the developer and the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) may be required
as provided by this section. The applicant is encouraged to arrange a pre-
application consultation at least ten days prior to the application deadline.
The ZEO shall meet with the developer as soon as possible to review the
conditional district application. Before submitting an application for any
other permit, developers are strongly encouraged to consult with the ZEO
concerning the application of this section to the proposed development.
   (E)   (1)   Review of conditional district rezoning requests. Conditional
zoning district decisions are a legislative process subject to judicial review
using the same procedures and standard of review as apply to conventional
zoning map amendments as specified in §
94.07, including a review and recommendation by the Planning Board and a
legislative hearing and decision by the Village Council. The Village Council
may consider a development agreement pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D, Article 10
in conjunction with a conditional zoning that incorporates the development
agreement.
      (2)   In approving an application to classify or to reclassify property
to a conditional zoning district, and with the consent of the petitioner, the
Village Council may change the existing classification of the property, or any
part of the property covered by the petition, to the classification requested,
to a classification or classifications between the existing and requested
classifications, or to any higher classification in the hierarchy of zoning
districts established in this section. This action may occur without the
withdrawal or modification of the petition or further public hearings.
      (3)   In approving a petition for the classification or reclassification
of property to a conditional zoning district, the Planning Board may recommend,
and the Village Council require, that conditions be attached to approval of the
petition. Conditions may address the conformance of the development and use of
the site to village ordinances, plans adopted pursuant to G.S. § 160D-501, or
the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of
the site. Only those conditions approved by the village and consented to by the
applicant and the property owners in writing may be incorporated into the
zoning regulations. Any such conditions should relate to the relationship of
the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as
parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems,
screening and buffer area, the timing of development, street and right-of-way
improvements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision
of open space, building design elements and other matters that the Village
Council may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose. Such conditions to
approval of the petition may include dedication to the village, county or
state, as appropriate, of any right-of-way or easements for streets, water,
sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed development.
   (F)   Approval criteria. In deciding whether to approve a Conditional
District rezoning, the Planning Board and the Village Council shall consider
the following factors:
      (1)   The proposed rezoning corrects an error or meets the challenge of
some changing condition, trend or fact;
      (2)   The proposed rezoning is compatible with the Village of Walnut
Creek Comprehensive Plan;
      (3)   The proposed rezoning and the range of uses permitted in the
requested zoning district are compatible with the surrounding zoning patterns
and land uses;
      (4)   The village or other service providers will be able to provide
adequate public facilities and services intended to serve the subject property,
including but not limited to roadways, public transportation, parks and
recreational facilities, police and fire protection, schools, stormwater
drainage systems, water supplies, and wastewater treatment and garbage
services;
      (5)   The proposed classification or reclassification will not adversely
affect a known archaeological, environmental, historical, or cultural resource;
and
      (6)   The proposed zoning or rezoning will not impair or injure the
health, safety and general welfare of the public.
   (G)   Village Council action on conditional districts.
      (1)   After reviewing the reports and recommendation of village staff and
Planning Board and considering the views discussed at the public hearing, the
Village Council shall take one of the following actions within 90 days of the
public hearing:
         (a)   Approve the CD; or
         (b)   Approve the CD, but to a more restrictive district (see below);
         (c)   Approve the CD, but with an alteration in the area requested;
         (d)   Approve the CD, with a combination of divisions (G)(1)(b) and
(G)(1)(c) above;
         (e)   Reject the proposed CD; or
         (f)   Refer the proposed CD back to the Planning Board and ZEO for
further consideration.
   (H)   Effect of approval.
      (1)   If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development
and use of the property shall be governed by the ordinance requirements of the
parallel zoning district except those superseded by specific conditions, the
approved site plan for the district, and any additional approved rules,
regulations, and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning
regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as an
amendment to these regulations and to the zoning maps.
      (2)   If a petition is approved, the petitioner shall comply with all
requirements for obtaining, a zoning permit, a building permit and certificate
of occupancy. Only those uses and structures indicated in the approved petition
and site plan shall be allowed on the subject property. A change of location of
the structures may be authorized pursuant to division (J) (Alterations to
approval). The changes to the site plan layout shall not increase the number of
structures.
      (3)   Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning
district, the subject property shall be identified on the zoning maps by the
appropriate district designation. A parallel conditional zoning shall be
identified by the same designation as the underlying general district followed
by the letters "CD" (for example "R-35 CD").
      (4)   Properties that receive Conditional District approval shall
commence construction within two years of rezoning to a Conditional District.
If the project has not substantially commenced, as defined in §
94.04, within two years of rezoning, then the Planning Board shall evaluate
whether to recommend to the Village Council the rezone of the property back to
its previous zoning designation, or to some alternative designation based on
changing conditions in the community, using the zoning map amendment process in
§
94.07.
   (I)   Rehearing. No application, connected to the same property or any part
thereof, for a zoning or rezoning to a CD shall be filed for a period of six
months unless the Village Council finds that there has been a substantial
change in the application or the conditions or circumstances bearing on the
application.
   (J)   Alterations to approval.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (J)(2) below, changes to an approved
petition or to the conditions attached to the approved petition shall be
treated the same as amendments to these regulations or to the zoning maps and
shall be processed in accordance with the procedures in this chapter.
      (2)   The ZEO shall have the delegated authority to approve an
administrative amendment change to an approved site plan, as long as the
proposed revision meets all of the following:
         (a)   Does not involve a change in uses permitted or the density of
overall development permitted;
         (b)   Does not increase the impacts generated by the development on
traffic, stormwater runoff, or similar impacts beyond what was projected for
the original development approval;
         (c)   Complies with underlying zoning standards, applicable conditions
of the approval, and all other applicable ordinance requirements; and
         (d)   Is a minor change such as, but not limited to, a minor
adjustment to road configuration or internal circulation, a minor adjustment to
building location, or a minor adjustment to utility alignment.
         Any proposed revision that does not meet all of these requirements
must go back through the regular conditional zoning review and approval process
specified in §
94.68. Any decision must be in writing stating the grounds for approval or
denial.
      (3)   Any request for an administrative amendment shall be pursuant to a
written letter, signed by the property owner, to the ZEO detailing the
requested change. Upon request, the applicant must provide any additional
information that is requested. Accompanying the letter shall be the applicable
fee for administrative review. Upon an approval of an administrative amendment,
the applicant must file a sufficient number of copies of a revised site plan as
deemed necessary by the ZEO.
      (4)   If the ZEO denies approval of the requested amendment, then the
applicant can appeal that decision to the Village Council for its review and
decision. An appeal to Council will require filing a revised application and
site plan, submittal of the required filing fee, and another public hearing and
recommendation of the Planning Board. Any change that increases the intensity
of the development or the residential density shall be approved by the Village
Council after a new public hearing and recommendation of the Planning Board.
   (K)   Judicial review.
      (1)   Every decision of the Village Council granting, denying or revoking
a conditional district rezoning shall be subject to review by the Superior
Court of Wayne County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari.
      (2)   The petition for the writ of certiorari must be filed with the
Wayne County Clerk of Court within 30 days after the following occurs:
         (a)   A written copy of the Council's decision has been filed in the
office of the Village Clerk; and
         (b)   A written copy of the Council's decision has been delivered by
personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the applicant
or appellant and every other aggrieved party who has filed a written request
for such copy at the hearing of the case.
      (3)   A copy of the writ of certiorari shall be served upon the Village
of Walnut Creek.

§ 94.85 (RESERVED).
§ 94.86 VARIANCES.
   Where because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site,
strict adherence to the provisions of the regulations of this chapter would
cause an unnecessary hardship, the Village Council may authorize a variance

§ 94.87 APPEALS; STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   It is the intention of this chapter that all questions arising in
connection with the enforcement of this chapter shall be presented first to the

   (C)   Time to appeal. The owner or other party has 30 days from receipt of
the written notice of the determination within which to file an appeal. Any
other person with standing to appeal has 30 days from receipt from any source
of actual or constructive notice of the determination within which to file an
appeal. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given pursuant to

proceeding authorized by law or appeals therefrom, unless the official who made
the decision certifies to the Board after notice of appeal has been filed that,
because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril
to life or property or, because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay
would seriously interfere with enforcement of the development regulation. In
that case, enforcement proceedings are not stayed except by a restraining
order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not
stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited
hearing of the appeal, and the Board shall meet to hear the appeal within 15
days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
section, appeals of decisions granting a development approval or otherwise
affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the development
regulation does not stay the further review of an application for development
approvals to use the property; in these situations, the appellant or the
village may request and the Board may grant a stay of a final decision of
development approval applications, including building permits affected by the
issue being appealed.
   (F)   Alternative dispute resolution. The parties to an appeal that has been
made under this section may agree to mediation or other forms of alternative
dispute resolution. The development regulation may set standards and procedures
to facilitate and manage such voluntary alternative dispute resolution.

construction, remodeling, or other activity without first obtaining all
permits, certificates, or other forms of authorization required by this
section.

attached to a conditional district.
      (6)   Continue a violation. To continue any of the above violations is a
separate and distinct offense for each day's continuing violation.

      (1)   Inspections. The Zoning Enforcement Officer or his designee is
authorized upon presentation of proper credentials, or inspection warrant if
necessary, to enter on any premises within the village at any reasonable hour

certifications, or the filing of reports with respect to pertinent questions
relating to complaints or alleged violations of this section.
      (4)   Failure to comply. Failure of the Zoning Enforcement Officer or his
designee to observe or recognize conditions that violate this chapter, does not
relieve the property owner from responsibility for resulting conditions or
damages and does not result in the village, its officers, or agents being
responsible for resulting conditions or damages.
   (C)   Enforcement procedure.
      (1)   When the Zoning Enforcement Officer or his designee investigates an
alleged violation and determines that a violation of this chapter has occurred,
the Zoning Enforcement Officer must notify the owner and/or occupant of the
land, building, structure, sign, or use of the violation in writing. Where
applicable, the owner and occupant must remedy the violation at the earliest
reasonable date.
      (2)   Notice of violation. If the owner or occupant of the land, building

mail is deemed received on the third business day following deposit of the
notice for mailing with the United States Postal Service. The Board of
Adjustment must hear an appeal using the evidentiary hearing procedures in §

notice of violation. In the absence of an appeal, the decision of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer or his designee shall be final.
      (4)   Notice of appeal decision. The decision of the Board of Adjustment
on a filed appeal may be delivered to the aggrieved party either by personal
service or by registered mail or certified mail return receipt requested.
Otherwise, notice is presumed to be given at the day and time of the hearing,
if such party is present.
      (5)   Failure to comply with notice. If the owner or occupant of a
property fails to comply with a notice of violation from which no appeal has
been taken, or after a final decision by the Board of Adjustment following an
appeal, the owner or occupant is subject to such remedies and penalties as may
be provided for by this chapter or by state law.
   (D)   Remedies.
      (1)   Cumulative. All available remedies for violations of this chapter
are cumulative. To the extent that North Carolina law may limit the
availability of a particular remedy authorized by this chapter for a certain
violation, such remedy remains available for other violations or other parts of
the same violation.
      (2)   Repeat violations. If an owner or occupant repeats the same
violation within a five-year period from the date of the initial violation,
that repeat violation will be considered to be a continuation of the initial
violation and is subject to additional penalties and remedies.
      (3)   Available remedies. Any or all of the following may be used to
enforce the provisions of this chapter.
         (a)   Injunction. Any violation of this chapter or of any condition,
order, requirement, or remedy adopted pursuant to this chapter may be
restrained, corrected, abated, mandated, or enjoined by other appropriate
proceeding pursuant to state law. The institution of an action for injunctive
relief under this section does not relieve any party to such proceedings from
any civil penalty prescribed for violations of this chapter.
         (b)   Civil penalties. Any person who violates any provision of this
chapter may be subject to the assessment of a civil penalty in accordance with
§94.99(E).

thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation
of this chapter, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may order the work to be

stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which
the work may be resumed. Such action must be in accordance with North Carolina

         (d)   Revocation of permits or certificates. The Zoning Enforcement
Officer or his designee may revoke and require the return of a permit by
notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation.
Permits or certificates may be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved application, plans, or specifications; refusal or failure to comply
with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or
misrepresentations made in securing the permit or certificate. Any permit or
certificate mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law
may also be revoked.
         (e)   No criminal penalties. Any violation of this chapter will have
no criminal penalty and the provisions of G.S. 14-4 do not apply.
         (f)   State and common law remedies. In addition to other enforcement
provisions contained in this section, the Village Council may exercise any and
all enforcement powers granted to it by state law or common law.
         (g)   Previous enforcement. Nothing in this chapter prohibits

APPENDIX: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT STATEMENT VILLAGE OF WALNUT CREEK NORTH
CAROLINA ZONING ORDINANCE
Abstract
   The zoning ordinance is a legal device for implementing the land use plan
for a community. When properly enforced, it regulates the uses of land in the
zoned areas of the Village in order to promote the health, safety, morals and
the general welfare of the residents of the community. The ordinance permits
the village to regulate and restrict:
   (1)   The height, number of stories, and the size of buildings and other
structures.
   (2)   The percentage of the lot that may be occupied.
   (3)   The size of yards, courts, and open spaces.
   (4)   The density of population.
   (5)   The location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade,
industry, residency, or other purposes.
Environmental Effects
   The following effects on the environment are based on the assumption that
the planning area will be developed in accordance with the Village's
comprehensive planning program and controls adopted to fulfill the goals and
objectives established in the program.
   The Zoning Ordinance will have several beneficial effects on the physical
environment in the Village of Walnut Creek. These effects are:
   (1)   It will help insure compatible utilization of land.
   (2)   Aid the county in preserving open space.
   (3)   Protect flood prone areas.
   (4)   Protect woodlands as well as animal habitats.
   (5)   Lower population densities.
   (6)   Facilitate the design of water/sewer facilities based on planned
densities and development.
   (7)   Protect property values.
   Since a zoning ordinance is basically positive in nature, its negative
consequences on the environment are minimal.
Unavoidable Adverse Environmental Effects
   There are certain effects on the environment which cannot be avoided
entirely when development occurs. (1) There are some losses of natural
vegetation; (2) increases in water run-offs and waste products; (3) higher
levels of air, water, and noise pollution may occur; (4) and some wildlife
habitats may be disturbed, if not destroyed.
Alternatives to the Proposed Plan with Analysis
   The only alternative to this Zoning Ordinance is to take no action. The
consequences would be uncontrolled and unplanned growth.
Short-Term Uses of the Environment Versus the Long-Term Maintenance and
Enhancement of It
   In regard to short-term and long-term benefits, they are identical for the
Village of Walnut Creek Zoning Ordinance. It will help preserve a quality
environment for those living in Wayne County now and for those who will live
there in the future.
Irreversible Commitments of Resources
   The document will not require the commitment of any resources. All existing
federal, state and county environmental controls currently enforced will have
some relationship to this zoning ordinance.
Mitigation Measures Proposed to Minimize the Impact
   Adoption and enforcement of this ordinance will mitigate some of the
potential adverse environmental effects of urbanization.
Problems Raised During the Review Process
   None.

   The Housing Inspector and Public Officer are hereby designated and appointed
to enforce the provisions of this subchapter and to exercise the duties and
powers herein prescribed:
   (A)   To investigate housing conditions and to inspect housing located in
the village in order to determine which housing is unfit for human habitation,
and to carry out and effectuate the objectives of this subchapter with respect
to the repair, closing or demolition of such housing;
   (B)   To take such action, together with other appropriate departments and
agencies, public and private, as may be necessary to effect rehabilitation of

subchapter and an inventory of housing that does not meet the minimum standards
of fitness herein prescribed;
   (D)   To administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive
evidence;
   (E)   To enter upon premises for the purposes of making examinations and
inspections; provided, such entries shall be made in such manner as to cause
the least possible inconvenience to the persons in possession;
   (F)   To appoint and fix the duties of officers, agents, and employees
necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter;
   (G)   To delegate any of the Inspector’s functions and powers under this
subchapter; and
   (H)   To perform such other duties as may be prescribed herein or by the
Village Council.
(Res., passed 6-28-23)
§ 95.48 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Authority to enter. For the purpose of making inspections and
otherwise performing duties under this subchapter, the Inspector is hereby
authorized to enter, examine and survey at all reasonable times all housing for
the purpose of performing the Inspector’s duty of safeguarding the health and
safety of the occupants of housing and of the general public.
   (B)   Obtaining a warrant. Whenever an owner, occupant, or agent thereof
shall deny the Inspector reasonable access to any premises for purposes of
making inspections, the Housing Inspector shall obtain a warrant to inspect as
authorized by G.S. 15-27.2.
(Res., passed 6-28-23)
§ 95.49 PROCEDURE FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. On the Inspector’s own
motion, on request of any public authority, or upon receipt of a petition
signed by any five residents of the village alleging that any housing is unfit
for human habitation, the Inspector shall undertake a preliminary investigation
of the premises. If the Inspector’s preliminary investigation discloses a basis
for such charges, the Inspector shall issue a complaint stating the charges and
containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the Inspector or the
Inspector’s designated agent at a place within the county in which the property
is located, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of the
complaint. The Inspector shall serve the complaint and notice upon the owner
of, and parties in interest in, such housing. The owner and any party in
interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear
in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the
complaint. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall
not be controlling in hearings before the Inspector.
   (B)   Issuance of order after hearing. If, after such notice and hearing,
the Inspector shall determine that the housing under consideration is unfit for
human habitation under the terms of this subchapter, the Inspector shall state
in writing his or her findings of fact in support of that determination and
shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order. If any
party in interest took part in the hearing, the order shall also be served on
that person. The order shall do the following:
      (1)   Deteriorated housing. If the housing is determined to be
deteriorated, the order shall require the owner, within the time specified in
the order, to repair, alter or improve it in order to render it fit for human
habitation. The order may require that the housing be vacated and closed only
if continued occupancy during the time allowed for repair will present a
significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of the
necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current state of the
housing; and any additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors
under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. The
order shall state that the failure to make timely repairs as directed in the
order shall make the dwelling subject to the issuance of an unfit order under
division (C)(2)(b) below; or
      (2)   Dilapidated housing. If the housing is determined to be
dilapidated, the order shall require the owner, within the time specified in
the order, to demolish or remove such housing.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any housing to fail, neglect,
or refuse to repair, alter, or improve the same, or to fail, neglect or refuse
to vacate and close or vacate and demolish and remove such housing, upon order
of the Inspector duly made and served as herein provided, within the time
specified in such order. Each day that any such failure, neglect, or refusal to
comply with such order continues shall constitute a separate and distinct
offense.
      (2)   Unless specifically provided otherwise, violation of this
subchapter shall be a civil offense. If an owner fails to comply with an order
to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close, or demolish or remove any
housing, any one, all, or combination of the enforcement actions authorized by
law may be taken, including those set forth herein.
         (a)   Civil penalty.
            1.   If the owner of any deteriorated or dilapidated housing shall
fail to comply with an order of the Inspector within the time specified
therein, or if any housing is occupied in violation of this subchapter or any
valid order or decision of the Inspector or Board of Adjustment made pursuant
to this subchapter, the owner shall be subject to a civil penalty of $100 per
day. Each day in which a violation is allowed to persist will constitute a
separate and distinct offense. If a person fails to pay the civil penalty
within ten days after being notified of the amount due, the village may recover
the civil penalty together with all costs by filing one or more civil actions
in the general court of justice in the nature of a suit to collect a debt. The
Village Attorney is hereby authorized to file suit on behalf of the village to
collect any civil penalties, and the Village Administrator is hereby authorized
to verify and sign complaints on behalf of the village in such suits.
            2.   No civil penalty shall be imposed against an owner of unfit
housing where the only violation rendering the housing unfit is a violation for
which this subchapter provides that the occupant is the sole person
responsible, unless the owner is also the occupant.
            3.   If the owner of any deteriorated or dilapidated housing shall
fail to comply with an order of the Inspector within the time specified
therein, or if any housing is occupied in violation of this subchapter or any
valid order or decision of the Inspector or Board of Adjustment made pursuant
to this subchapter, two times or more within any 12-month period regarding the
same housing unit, the civil penalty for the second and all subsequent
violations shall be double the amounts specified in division (C)(2)(a)1. above.
         (b)   Action pursuant to ordinance. If the owner of deteriorated or
dilapidated housing fails to comply with an order of the Inspector within the
time specified therein and court ordered relief has not been sought or has not
been granted as provided in division (C)(2)(e) below, the Public Officer may
cause the housing to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, closed or
demolished and removed, as required by the order, provided the Public Officer
takes the following steps. The Public Officer may submit to the Village Council
for adoption an ordinance describing the property and ordering the Public
Officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter with respect to
the particular property or properties which the Public Officer found to be
unfit for human habitation. No such ordinance shall be adopted to require
demolition and removal of housing until the owner has first been given a
reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with this subchapter. Such
ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the
county where the property is located and shall be indexed in the name of the
property owner in the grantor index. After the adoption of an ordinance
authorizing that housing be vacated and closed, the Public Officer may post a
placard on the main entrance of any housing so closed stating “This building is
unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human
habitation is prohibited and unlawful.” If any occupant fails to comply with an
order to vacate housing after adoption of such ordinance, the Public Officer
may file a civil action in the name of the village to remove such occupant in
accordance with G.S. 160D-1203(8), including the provision of 30 days’ prior
notice to an occupant who is a tenant of the owner.
         (c)   Occupation in violation of posting a misdemeanor.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, in accordance with G.S.
160D-1203(4), occupation of a building posted by the Public Officer pursuant to
division (C)(2)(b) shall constitute a class 1 misdemeanor.
         (d)   Abandonment of intent to repair. If the Village Council shall
have adopted an ordinance pursuant to division (C)(2)(b) above or, if the
Public Officer shall have issued an order ordering a dwelling to be repaired or
vacated and closed, as provided in division (B)(1) above, and if the owner has
vacated and closed such housing and kept such housing vacated and closed for a
period of one year pursuant to the ordinance or order, then, if the Village
Council shall find that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to
repair, alter or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human
habitation and that the continuation of the housing in its vacated and closed
status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the
village in that the housing would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire
and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract
persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to blight and
the deterioration of property values in the area, in such circumstances the
Village Council may, after the expiration of such one-year period, enact an
ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner requiring the owner to:
            1.   If the housing is deteriorated, repair or demolish and remove
the dwelling within 90 days; or
            2.   If the housing is dilapidated, demolish and remove the
dwelling within 90 days.
            Such ordinance shall meet the requirements set forth in G.S. 160D-
1203(6) and shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the
county where the housing is located and shall be indexed in the name of the
property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with this
ordinance within the time fixed by such ordinance, then the Inspector shall
effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.
         (e)   Court-ordered relief. If the owner of any deteriorated housing
shall fail to comply with an order of the Public Officer to repair, alter, or
improve or to vacate and close such housing within the time specified therein,
or if the owner of dilapidated housing shall fail to comply with an order of
the Inspector to demolish or remove such housing within the time specified
therein, or if any housing is erected, constructed, altered, repaired,
converted, maintained, or used in violation of this subchapter or any valid
order or decision of the Public Officer or Board of Adjustment made pursuant to
this subchapter, the Public Officer may institute any appropriate action or
proceedings to prevent the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration or use; to restrain, correct or abate the violation; to prevent the
occupancy of the housing; or for any other purpose authorized by G.S. 160D-1208
(e) or other law.
         (f)   Other enforcement action. The failure of the owner to comply
with an order issued by the Public Officer may also be enforced through any
equitable or other remedy deemed appropriate by the village and permitted by
law.
(Res., passed 6-28-23)
§ 95.50 APPEALS FROM ORDERS OF THE INSPECTOR; REVIEW BY COURT.
   (A)   Appeals board. All appeals which may be taken from decisions or orders
of the Inspector pursuant to this subchapter shall be heard and determined by
the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
   (B)   When appeal may be taken. An appeal may be taken by any person
aggrieved thereby, or by any officer, board or commission of the village, from
a final decision or an order of the Inspector, unless a different method of
appeal is provided for herein. Any appeal shall be taken within ten days from
the rendering of the decision or service of the order, as the case may be, by
filing with the Public Officer and with the Board of Adjustment a written
notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is
based. The notice of appeal must be accompanied by the appropriate fee, as
established by the Village Council in the annual operating budget.
   (C)   Duty of Inspector upon the filing of an appeal. Upon the filing of any
notice of appeal, the Inspector shall forthwith transmit to the Board of
Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the final decision
or order appealed from was made. The Inspector who made the decision or the
person currently occupying that position, if the decision maker is no longer
employed by the local government, shall be present at the hearing as a witness.
   (D)   Staying of action. When an appeal is from a decision or order of the
Public Officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act,
the Public Officer’s decision or order shall remain in force until modified or
reversed. When an appeal is from a decision or order of the Public Officer
requiring the person aggrieved to do any act or pay any fines, the appeal shall
have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the Board,
unless the Public Officer certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal is
filed with the Public Officer, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of
the Public Officer’s requirement would cause imminent peril to life or
property. In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a
restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than
one day’s written notice to the Public Officer, by the Board of Adjustment, or
by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160D-1208(d) and this
section.
         (e)   Hearing of appeals. The Board of Adjustment shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all
the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party
may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may
make any decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter,
and to that end it shall have all the powers of the Public Officer, but the
concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse or
modify any decision or order of the Public Officer. The Board shall have power
also in passing upon appeals, in any case when practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of this
subchapter, to adapt the application of this subchapter to the necessities of
the case to the end that the spirit of this subchapter shall be observed,
public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. A copy of the
Board’s decision shall be served on the appellant by the Public Officer.
         (f)   Petition to superior court.
            1.   Every decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be subject to
review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of
the date of service of the decision of the Board, but not otherwise.
            2.   Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the Public Officer
or a decision rendered by the Board of Adjustment may petition the superior
court for an injunction restraining the Public Officer from carrying out the
order or decision and the court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary
injunction restraining the Public Officer pending a final disposition of the
cause. The petition shall be filed within 30 days after issuance of the order
or rendering of the decision. Hearings shall be held in accordance with G.S.
160D-1208(b).
(Res., passed 6-28-23)
§ 95.51 FILING OF NOTICE OF LIS PENDENS.
   “LIS PENDENS” (a pending suit), in general terms, is a notice filed on
public records for the purpose of warning all persons that the title to certain
property is in litigation, and they are in danger of being bound by an adverse
judgment. Upon the issuance of a complaint and notice of hearing or order
pursuant thereto, a notice of lis pendens, with a copy of the complaint and
notice of hearing or order attached thereto, may be filed by the Inspector in
the office of the clerk of superior court for the county, as provided in G.S.
1-120.2. The Inspector shall serve a copy of the notice of lis pendens upon the
owners and parties in interest in the housing. The Inspector may have the
notice of lis pendens canceled at such time as the housing is brought into
conformity with this subchapter by sending to the clerk of superior court a
notice asking that the notice of lis pendens be canceled.
(Res., passed 6-28-23)
§ 95.52 METHODS OF SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)   Complaints or orders issued by the Public Officer shall be served upon
persons either personally or by registered or certified mail. When service is
made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also
be sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered
or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned
by the post office within ten days after the mailing. If regular mail is used,
a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on
the premises affected.
   (B)   If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Public Officer in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, or, if the owners are known but have refused to accept
service by registered or certified mail, and the Public Officer makes an
affidavit to that effect, then the serving of the complaint or order upon the
owners or other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having
general circulation in the village at least once no later than the time at
which personal service would be required under these provisions. When service
is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in
a conspicuous place on the premises affected by the complaint or order.

State law reference:
   Similar provisions, G.S. 160D-1206(b)
§ 95.53 COSTS A LIEN ON PREMISES; DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   (A)   Lien. As provided by G.S. 160D-1203(7), the cost of any repairs,
alterations, or improvements, or of vacating and closing, or removal or
demolition, caused to be made or done by the Public Officer pursuant to this
subchapter shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was
incurred. Such lien shall be filed, having priority, and be collected in the
same manner as the lien for special assessments established by G.S. 160A,
Article 10 (G.S. 160A-216 et seq. including G.S. 160A-233(c)). Such lien, if
against real property located within the village limits, is also a lien on any
other real property of the owner located within the village limits or within
one mile thereof except for the owner’s primary residence. This additional lien
is inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a money judgment. All
liens shall be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county where
the property is located.
   (B)   Disposition. If the housing is removed or demolished by the Public
Officer, the Public Officer shall sell the materials of the housing, and any
personal property, fixtures or appurtenances found in or attached to the
housing, and shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the
removal or demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the
superior court by the Public Officer, shall be secured in a manner directed by
the court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be
entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court.
(Res., passed 6-28-23)
§ 95.54 OTHER REMEDIES.
   Nothing contained herein or in any other part of this subchapter shall be
construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the village to define and
declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary action or
otherwise; to enforce any provision of its charter, or its ordinances or
regulations; or to prevent or punish violations thereof, and the procedure
described herein shall be in addition and supplemental to the powers conferred
on the village by any other law.
