Section
   
32.01   Workplace smoking and tobacco use policy
   
32.02   Drug-free workplace policy
§ 32.01 WORKPLACE SMOKING AND TOBACCO USE POLICY.
   (A)   The town is dedicated to providing a healthful, comfortable and
productive work environment for its employees.
   (B)   The United States Surgeon General, in his 1980 report, Reducing the
Health Consequences of Smoking, concluded that:
      (1)   Involuntary smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer in
healthy non-smokers; and
      (2)   The simple separation of smokers and non-smokers within the same
air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of non-smokers to
environmental tobacco smoke.
   (C)   In light of these findings, the offices and workplaces of the town
shall be entirely smoke-free and tobacco-free, effective February 1, 1993.
Smoking and other uses of tobacco will be prohibited within town owned and
operated buildings, including offices, hallways, meeting rooms, waiting rooms
and restrooms. This policy applies to all employees, citizens, contractors and
visitors.
   (D)   Breaks will be granted to all employees in accordance with the town’s
personnel policies, and smoking and other use of tobacco should be confined to
these breaks and will take place outside the town owned and operated buildings.
   (D)   Copies of this policy shall be distributed to all employees. “No
Smoking” signs shall be posted at all building entrances and throughout the
buildings.
   (E)   The success of this policy will depend upon the thoughtfulness,
consideration and cooperation of smokers and non-smokers. All employees share
in the responsibility for adhering to and enforcing the policy.
      (1)   Any problems should be brought to the attention of the Manager and
handled through the normal chain of command.
      (2)   Employees who violate this policy will be subject to the same
disciplinary actions that accompany violation of other personnel policies.
   (F)   This policy has been adopted by the Town Council and is enforced
February 1, 1993.
(1979 Code, § N-1) (Ord. passed 2-1-1993
§ 32.02 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY.
   (A)   In accordance with the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of
1988 being 41 U.S.C. 8101 et seq., the following policy relating to all staff
and the premises of the town is established.
   (B)   The town has a legitimate interest in providing a drug-free and
alcohol-free work environment. Substance abuse by employees of the town while
on the job could interfere with the organizational performance and jeopardize
the safety and welfare of other employees, as well as that of the public.
   (C)   In order to confirm instances of substance abuse by employees, the
town may demand a specimen of urine and/or breath and/or blood from an employee
or town official on the basis of reasonable suspicious of such abuse.
Reasonable suspicion is defined as a belief, based on objective facts and/or a
report observation, that an employee has taken drugs or consumed alcohol while
on the job or recently before the start of work, or whose work appears to be
impaired as from the influence of drugs.
   (D)   Breath analysis shall be performed by the State Highway Patrol at the
employer’s/town’s expense. Urine and/or blood specimens shall be collected by
an authorized health care professional and be analyzed at a laboratory
designated by the town, at the employer’s/town’s expense. The specimen will be
tested for, but not limited to, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
cannabinoids, cocaine, methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine or any drugs or
controlled substances which are not prescribed by a licensed medical doctor, or
prescription drugs used in a manner not consistent with recognized medical
procedures.
   (E)   Custody and security of specimen samples will be thoroughly documented
by the town and the independent testing laboratory.
   (F)   Refusal to submit a specimen sample that is required within the
parameters of this policy may subject the employee or elected official to
disciplinary action.
   (G)   In addition, the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation,
possession or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the town
workplace. Any employee found in violation of this policy will be subject to
action authorized by the existing state and federal statutes relating to this
criminal offense. Further, as a condition of employment and/or continued
employment, such employee will:
      (1)   Notify the employer of any criminal drug statute conviction for a
violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such
conviction; and
      (2)   As deemed appropriate by the Manager, an employee found to be in
violation of this policy may be required to seek appropriate, prescribed
professional services at the employee’s expense.

the provisions of this chapter, or failing or neglecting or refusing to comply
with same, shall, upon conviction be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor and

chronic violator as defined herein shall be notified by the Village Manager
and/or their designee(s) if property owned by the chronic violator is
determined to be in violation of this chapter, and the village may take action

abandoned in the technical sense or become a junked motor vehicle as strictly
defined in this chapter.
   (D)   It is the policy of the Town Council that vehicles which are
abandoned, junked or otherwise a nuisance ought to be prohibited in the town.
   (E)   Further, such vehicles and the conditions which surround such vehicles
shall not be allowed to present a danger to the citizens of the town,
especially small children who may be attracted to such vehicles.

law which supersedes this chapter, abandoned, nuisance and junked motor
vehicles on both public and private property shall be removed.

policy set forth in G.S. §§ 160A-193, 160A-303 and 160A-303.2. In those
instances when the owner of the vehicle or the property owner refuses to take
corrective action, the town will take an active role in having vehicles which
violate this chapter removed.
(1979 Code, § F-2-1)
§ 93.02 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   The Town Administrator and the Planner are primarily responsible for
the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. From time

vehicle to remain on the property after it has been declared a nuisance
vehicle.
   (B)   A motor vehicle shall be deemed to be a NUISANCE MOTOR VEHICLE for the
purposes of this chapter in the following circumstances: a vehicle on public or

it may refuse to grant the requested franchise.
      (1)   If Town Council determines that an applicant is so qualified, it
may, by ordinance, grant a nonexclusive franchise to such applicant; provided,
however, no provisions of this chapter may be deemed or constructed as to
require the granting of a franchise when the Town Council determines that to do
so would not be in the public interest.
      (2)   The franchise granted shall not be pledged collateral or security
for any indebtedness or security obligation without the express written consent
of the Town Council.
      (3)   Any franchise granted shall include the following condition: the

material respect with any provision of this chapter, or has, by any act or
omission, violated in some material respect any term or condition of any
franchise or permit issued hereunder; the grantee made a material, false
statement in the application for the franchise, knowing it to be false; or the
grantee, contrary to the best interest of public convenience and welfare, is
not providing subscribers with regular, adequate and proper service.
   (D)   In the event that the use of any part of the CATV system is
discontinued for any reason, or the franchise has been terminated, cancelled or
has expired, the grantee shall promptly remove from the streets or public
places all such property and poles of the system, other than those which the
town’s designated agent may permit to be abandoned in place, and as directed by
the town’s designated agent, shall either restore the street or pay the town

a condition for public use acceptable to the town’s designated agent based on
department of transportation standards. Any property remaining in place six
months after the discontinuance, termination or expiration of the franchise
shall be considered permanently abandoned and may be appropriated by the town
or removed by the town at the expense of the grantee.
   (E)   In the event of any termination of the franchise, the Town Council may

such removal shall be performed by and at the expense of the terminated
grantee. In carrying out this removal, the grantee shall place the streets,
roads or public places in the same condition as before the system was built. If
the town or state is forced to remove the system, the work shall be done at the
expense of the terminated grantee.

events, completion of the service shall be pursued with reasonable diligence.

Council may extend the time of the commencement and completion of construction
and installation for additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in
good faith, experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond its control.

preceding the date of filing.

service to as much of the town as is practicable without the impairment of the
economic feasibility of a grantee’s system.
      (1)   In the event that potential subscribers in a sparsely settled
section of the franchise areas shall request service, and grantee shall be of
the opinion that the small number of potential subscribers make such service
economically unfeasible, the grantee may make such service available by
requiring a reasonable contribution from the potential subscribers to the cost
of such extension of service; however, grantee shall not be required to make
such services available.
      (2)   Similarly, in the event potential subscribers in a non-sparsely
settled portion of the franchise area request service and grantee must run its
cables through a sparsely settled section in order to reach those potential
subscribers, the grantee may make such service available by requiring a
reasonable contribution from such potential subscriber; to the cost of such
extension through the sparsely settled section; however, grantee shall not be
required to make such service available.

mile shall be deemed “sparsely settled”, as that term is used herein, and the
areas of the town having 30 or more homes per mile shall be deemed “non-
sparsely settled”, as that term is used herein.
      (4)   In determining the reasonable contribution from subscribers as
herein provided, the grantee shall take into account the size of the sparsely
settled areas through which it must run its cables in a sparsely settled area
seeking service, the number of potential subscribers in such sparsely settled
area seeking service, and the economic effects of the proposed extension and
service upon the total operation of grantees’ system.

(1979 Code, § S-3-1) (Ord. passed 6- -1987)
§ 151.26 MINOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL PROCESS.
   (A)   If the land to be subdivided meets the requirements of a minor
subdivision as defined in §
151.05(B), the subdivider will not have to follow the same procedures as for a
general subdivision. The review process for minor subdivisions shall be
adequate to protect the public interest, but should also provide minimum delay
and expense to the subdivider. A preliminary plat is not required.
   (B)   The developer may go from a sketch plan to a final plat with the
approval of the Staff Planner; however, the following minor plat approval
process may be used only where the subdivision includes all contiguous land
under the ownership of the sponsor.
      (1)   Sketch plan required. A preliminary plat shall not be required for
approval for minor subdivisions. Instead, a sketch design plan shall first be
submitted to the Staff Planner for approval and shall depict or contain the
following information:
         (a)   A sketch vicinity map showing the location of the subdivision in
relation to neighboring tracts, subdivisions, roads and waterways;
         (b)   The boundaries of the tract to be subdivided;
         (c)   The total acreage to be subdivided;
         (d)   The existing and proposed uses of the land within the
subdivision and adjoining it;
         (e)   The lines of existing streets and easements;
         (f)   The name, address and telephone number of the owner and/or
developer; and
         (g)   The zoning classification of the tract and adjacent properties.
      (2)   Review procedure. The Staff Planner shall review the sketch design
plan for general compliance with the requirements of this chapter and shall
advise the subdivider or his or her authorized agent of the regulations
pertaining to the proposed subdivision and the procedures to be followed in the
preparation and submission of the final plat.
      (3)   Approval of sketch plat by Staff Planner. The Staff Planner, after
determining that all requirements of this chapter have been met on the sketch
map, shall submit copies to the County Health Department, Erosion Control
Section, Soil and Water Conservation District and Inspection Division for their
comments and reports. The sketch plan shall be approved and the subdivider
shall be advised that the final plat may be prepared as long as it conforms to
the sketch plat. This review shall in no way be construed as constituting an
official approval for recording.
      (4)   Dispute of findings of Staff Planner. In the event that the
subdivider disagrees with any findings of the Staff Planner concerning approval
of a sketch plan of a minor subdivision, the matter shall be taken to the
Planning Board for a decision. No final plat shall be prepared until the
Planning Board has acted on the disputed sketch plan.
      (5)   Disposition of copies. Five copies of the sketch plan shall be
retained as part of the files of the Planning Board, with the original drawing
being returned to the subdivider or his or her authorized agent.
      (6)   Certificates required. The following signed and notarized
certificates shall appear on the reproducible copy of the final plat which is
submitted to the Subdivision Administrator:

unnecessary expense to the developer and to the administrative departments of
the town, the Staff Planner shall have the responsibility for approving minor
subdivisions. The final plat for minor subdivision shall be complete and show
all information required for a final plat for general subdivisions as
prescribed by this chapter. The recording of a minor subdivision plat shall be
the same as for a general subdivision as provided in this chapter. If a minor
subdivision plat is disapproved, the Staff Planner shall specify the reasons
for such action in writing. One copy of such reasons shall be given to the
subdivider. If a minor subdivision plat is disapproved, the subdivider may make

required improvements prior to approval of final plats, the applicant may post
a performance guarantee in an amount sufficient to secure to the town the
satisfactory construction, installation and dedication of the uncompleted
portion of the required improvements.
   (C)   Type of guarantee.
      (1)   The performance guarantee may be in the form of a certified check,
a no-contest irrevocable bank letter of credit or a performance and payment
bond underwritten by a state-licensed corporate surety company.
      (2)   Except in the case of certified check, such sureties shall not be
accepted unless the Town Attorney has made a review thereof and rendered a
written opinion that the interests of the town are fully protected.
      (3)   The certified check should be deposited with the Town Clerk, as
escrow agent, who shall deposit it in an escrow account of the town.
      (4)   The no-contest irrevocable bank letter of credit shall be from a
banking corporation licensed to do business in the state. The terms of the
letter shall include the absolute right of the Town Clerk to
withdraw funds from the bank forthwith upon the Town Clerk certifying to the

breached.
   (D)   Plans and construction programs.
      (1)   Plans, specifications, quantities, unit costs and estimated total
costs shall be provided by the applicant to the Staff Planner, together with a
schedule indicating time of initiation and completion of the work, as a whole
or in stages. Number of copies shall be as required for records and processing
in the particular case.
      (2)   The Staff Planner shall refer such plans and programs to
governmental bodies exercising control for their recommendations as to whether
the proposals meet all requirements of such agencies, as to sufficiently of
cost estimates, and as to reasonableness of construction programs.
   (E)   Amount and terms of guarantee; time limits.
      (1)   Following receipt of such commendations, the Staff Planner shall
prepare recommendations as to amount and terms of the performance guarantee,

stages, provisions concerning extensions for cause and provisions for release
of portions of the guarantee upon completion of portions or stages of the work.
      (2)   The time between initiation and the completion of the required
improvements, including any provision for extension shall not exceed two years.
      (3)   The Planning Board, based upon the recommendations and with such
changes as it sees fit, shall set the amount and terms of the performance
guarantee, subject to the legal review and opinion required by division (C)
above.
      (4)   The amount of the guarantee shall be sufficient to provide adequate
funds to the town to insure, in the case of default, the installation of all
required improvements uncompleted at the time of default. In setting the amount
of the performance guarantee, the Planning Board shall consider the difficult
of restarting a closed project, the size and complexity of the required
improvements, the record of the applicant and the site conditions.
   (F)   Inspections; reports; cost responsibility.
      (1)   Governmental bodies exercising control shall make inspections to
determine whether work has started as scheduled; shall make inspections as are
necessary during the course of work, and shall make final inspections to
determine whether stages of construction required under the performance
guarantee have been completed in accordance with the terms of the guarantee.

results thereof shall be provided to the Staff Planner. The full cost of making
such inspections and preparing such reports shall be paid by the applicant.
   (G)   Action on inspection reports.
      (1)   Reports indicating satisfaction of requirements. Where such reports
indicate satisfactory completion of work within the time limits set and in
accord with other terms of the performance guarantee, for agreed-upon stages or
for the entire work, the Staff Planner shall so indicate to the applicant, and
surety company involved and the Town Clerk. The Town Clerk, upon such
notification and any further assurance that may be required from the Town
Attorney or governmental bodies exercising operating control, shall then
release all or portions of the performance guarantee in accordance with the
terms thereof
      (2)   Reports indicating failure to satisfy requirements.
         (a)   Where such reports indicate failure to initiate work on schedule

performance guarantee, the Staff Planner shall so indicate to the applicant,
governmental bodies exercising control, any surety company involved and the
Town Clerk.
         (b)   Such notice shall indicate that, unless action required under
the terms of the performance guarantee is completed within 30 days of the date
of such notification, the performance guarantee or portions thereof set forth
in its terms shall be called.

reports from governmental bodies exercising control transmitted through the
Staff Planner, the Town Clerk shall call the performance guarantee or affected
portions thereof.
      (3)   Reports indicating unsatisfactory progress. Where such reports
indicate that work initiated appears likely not to be completed on schedule,
and where the performance guarantee provides for extension of time for cause,
the Staff Planner shall notify the applicant and any surety company involved
concerning potential need for an application for such extension. Where such

(1979 Code, § S-5-3) (Ord. passed 6- -1987)
§ 151.63 HILLSIDE SUBDIVISIONS.
   This section shall apply only to that development which occurs in the
subdivision of land along private streets and, furthermore, the development
must comply with the provisions herein referred to in this section.
   (A)   Street design.
      (1)   Widths. The private street shall have a right-of-way of not less
than 60 feet, except that a right-of-way of 50 feet will be permitted if a
reduced width is essentially unavoidable and is approved by the Planning Board.
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs. The required turnaround on a dead end private street
in a hillside subdivision shall have a roadway diameter of not less than 50
feet and a right-of-way diameter of not less than 60 feet. If the street length
does not exceed 300 feet and if construction difficulties will not permit a
turnaround, the use of a “Y” or “T” or other turning space of a design such as
will allow a vehicle with a wheel base of at least 20 feet to complete a
turning movement with a maximum of one backing movement, may be permitted if
approved by the Planning Board.
      (3)   Grading. Grading will not be required for the full right-of-way in
hillside subdivisions if the Planning Board determines that full grading will
prevent convenient access to adjoining property or will destroy the natural
beauty of the site by excessive cut and fill; however, where slope extends
beyond right-of-way, add slope easement where needed. Easement to extend ten
feet beyond top of cut where it exceeds 15 feet.
      (4)   Street grades. In hillside land subdivisions, maximum private
street grades permitted shall be 20% unless the Planning Board determines that
a steeper grade is essentially unavoidable and would not create excessive
danger.
   (B)   Street improvements for Hillside Subdivisions.
      (1)   Pavement widths where required. Pavement widths shall not be less
than 20 feet except for designated interior streets or where the average cross
slope is 16% or greater, pavement widths may be reduced with Planning Board
approval as follows.
         (a)   Where the average cross slope is between 16% and 40%, minimum
pavement width may be reduced to 18 feet.
         (b)   Where the average cross slope is greater than 40%, approval of
the district engineer of the State Highway Commission shall be secured prior to
any road construction. Evidence of such approval shall be shown on the
preliminary plat.
         (c)   Where pavement width is reduced, the more stringent requirements
shall apply.
      (2)   Sixteen to 25% cross slope. When the average cross slop is between
16% and 25%, design requirements for lot are as follows.
         (a)   The average minimum lot area for the entire subdivided area will
be 15,000 square feet. No less than 80% of the lots shall have a minimum area
of 15,000 square feet, and no lot shall have an area of less than 15,000 square
feet.
         (b)   Minimum lot frontage will be 70 feet except a minimum frontage
of 45 feet may be permitted at the end of a cul-de-sac.
         (c)   Minimum average lot width wilt be 70 feet.
      (3)   Twenty-six to 40% cross slope. When the average slope is between
26% and 40%, design requirements for lots are as follows.
         (a)   The average minimum lot for the entire subdivided area will be
25,000 square feet. Not less than 80% of the lots shall have a minimum area of
28,000 square feet, and no lot shall have an area of less than 15,000 square
feet.
         (b)   Minimum lot frontage will be 100 feet, except a minimum of 50
feet may be permitted at the end of the cul-de-sac.
      (4)   Cross slope greater than 40%. When the average cross slope is
greater than 40%, design requirements for lots are as follows.
         (a)   The average minimum lot area for the entire subdivided area will
be one acre. Not less than 80% of the lots shall have a minimum area of 48,000
square feet, and no lot shall have an area less than 25,000 square feet.
         (b)   Minimum foot frontage of 60 feet may be permitted at the end of
a cul-de-sac.
         (c)   Minimum average lot width will be 130 feet.
      (5)   Panhandle lots. The Planning Board may approve panhandle lots in
exceptional cases where it is unpractical to serve an isolated lot by a public
street. The frontage of the panhandle lot shall have a minimum width of 25 feet
providing an access strip between two regular lots to the isolated building
site. The area of such strip shall be excluded in computing the lot area and
width, and the length of said strip shall not exceed 300 feet.
      (6)   Residential building setback lines. Within the town the residential
building setback lines for Hillside Subdivisions shall conform to the
requirements of the zoning ordinance.
(1979 Code, § S-5-4) (Ord. passed 6- -1987)
§ 151.64 FAMILY SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   This section shall apply only to that development which occurs in the
subdivision of land along private streets and, furthermore, the development
must comply with the provisions herein referred to in this section.
   (B)   Street design:
      (1)   For new lots being developed for someone other than family members,
the property owner is required to pave an 18-foot wide road within a 35-foot
right-of-way leading from the subdivision to a state-maintained road; and
      (2)   For lots developed for family members (defined as children,
grandchildren, parents, grandparents or spouse) the following guidelines must
be followed:
         (a)   For subdivisions created through an estate, a map must be
created to record the subdivision and a 15-foot right-of-way must be dedicated
up to the property to be subdivided and a 45-foot right-of-way within the
estate property; and
         (b)    Subdivisions created by living persons for family members can
be done in stages based on the number of lots involved:
            1.   For one to two lots, a 35-foot right-of-way is required to the
nearest state-maintained road;
            2.   For three to five lots, an 18-foot wide graveled road is
required within a 35-foot right-of-way up to the nearest state-maintained road.
The road also must meet NCDOT design standards; and
            3.   For subdivisions with more than five lots, 18-foot wide paved
roads which meet NCDOT design standards is required within a 35-foot right-of-
way.
(1979 Code, § S-5-5) (Ord. passed 6- -1987)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   After the effective date of this chapter, any person who, being the
owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the jurisdiction of this

§ 152.042 OD-M MALCOLM BOULEVARD OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   The regulations of this district are intended to accommodate future widening
of Malcolm Boulevard (SR 1001) from the Catawba River to Interstate 40 and to
better increase the aesthetic values of Malcolm Boulevard as the major
thoroughfare through the town.
   (A)   Purposes.
      (1)   The Malcolm Boulevard Overlay District is designed to create an
aesthetically pleasing corridor along Malcolm Boulevard in keeping with the
town’s policy of protecting our safe, family-friendly, attractive,
predominately residential environment.
      (2)   This district is intended to protect properties adjacent to the
roadway from the noise, activity, light and dust of vehicular traffic by
requiring building setbacks and landscaping along the corridor. The Malcolm
Boulevard Overlay District does not affect land use regulations or development
standards of the underlying zoning districts except as specified in this
section.
      (3)   The specific purposes of the OD-M District are:
         (a)   To ensure compatibility with any future widening of Malcolm
Boulevard;
         (b)   To encourage appropriate residential and commercial development;
         (c)   To preserve, enhance and improve the visual quality, function,
safety and enjoyment of the Malcolm Boulevard corridor;
         (d)   To promote orderly development and safe and efficient movement
of traffic;
         (e)   To preserve and enhance the streetscape along Malcolm Boulevard;
and
         (f)   To preserve, enhance and improve the Malcolm Boulevard corridor
as a major thoroughfare through a predominately residential area.
   (B)   District boundaries.
      (1)   The Malcolm Boulevard Overlay District shall extend along Malcolm
Boulevard from the town’s northern-most boundary to the I-40 intersection,
including any extraterritorial jurisdictions in the northern part of town.
      (2)   The width of the Malcolm Boulevard Overlay District shall include
the entire area of all lots adjoining either side of Malcolm Boulevard.
   (C)   Principal uses. Any permitted or special use allowed in the underlying
general zoning district or parallel special use district shall be permitted in
the OD-M District. In addition, all such permitted and special uses shall also
meet all requirements of the OD-M District. Where the requirements of the OD-
M district are more restrictive than in the underlying district, the
regulations of the OD-M District shall prevail.
   (D)   Setbacks. Minimum required front yard setback: 30 feet, measured from
existing right-of-way.
   (E)   Sign standards. To reduce clutter, improve visual impact and enhance
safety.
      (1)   Signs shall be in accordance with §§
152.185 through
152.197 for the underlying zoning district, with the following exceptions.
      (2)   Prohibited signs.
         (a)   Billboards;
         (b)   Any sign attached to trees or utility poles;
         (c)   Abandoned or dilapidated signs; and

on the site plans. For buildings located within the Overlay District (OD), the
site plan shall include exterior facades of the proposed buildings (and/or
additions) and all other information necessary to show compliance with this
section.
         (b)   Where the facade of any principal structure is visible from a
public road, metal materials shall constitute less than 50% of the entire area
of such facade.
         (c)   Windows and building entrances shall comprise at least 50% of
the first floor length of any principal structure. On any ground floor level,
any window or door shall be horizontally separated by no greater than 15 feet
from the nearest other such window or door in the same facade level. If the
principal structure contains a second or higher story, each such story shall
contain windows that are spaced in a manner complementary to the second story
of nearby buildings.
         (d)   The exterior color finish of all building facades visible from
the street shall be of low reflectance, subtle or neutral earth tone colors.
High intensity colors, metallic colors, black or fluorescent colors shall be
prohibited.
         (e)   All vegetation shall be installed and maintained to a uniform
and well- kept standard, consistent with the spirit of the Malcolm Boulevard
Overlay District. During the course of standard maintenance, vegetative waste
will be discarded to preserve the sightliness of curb and gutter and parking
areas within the district.
      (2)   Except for single- and two-family dwellings, all streets,
driveways, sidewalks, parking areas and other common areas and facilities shall
be lighted where necessary to insure the security of property and the safety of
persons using the facilities.

adjacent property or constitute a hazard to motorists using public streets.
         (b)   Exterior lighting on any lot shall be designed and directed so
that light is confined primarily to that lot.
   (G)   Exceptions.
      (1)   If the Planning Board deems it impractical for a developer to
comply with portions of this subchapter, the Planning Board shall have the
authority to modify or elect not to apply portions of this subchapter, so long
as the modification or deletion of a requirement does not constitute a
variance.
      (2)   Any nonconforming structure existing before the adoption of this
chapter shall be allowed to expand as long as the new construction falls within
existing setbacks.

§ 152.043 PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   The purpose of a planned unit development (PUD) is to allow diversification
in the relationship of industrial, commercial, office and/or residential uses
and structures to their sites and to permit a more flexible development of such
sites through unified site planning. The application of PUD concepts is
intended to encourage good architectural and site design, to use public
facilities efficiently, to avoid development of environmentally sensitive
areas, and to insure substantial compliance with the intent of the Rutherford
College Zoning Ordinance and other provisions related to public health, safety,
and general welfare.
   (A)   Permitted uses. Planned unit developments may be approved for any use
or combination of uses permitted in existing districts, except combinations of
residential and industrial uses. Additionally, commercial or residential
marinas may be permitted as PUDs if located on Lake Rhodhiss.
   (B)   Minimum site area.
PUD Type Minimum Area
PUD Type                            Minimum Area
Residential (Single-Family)         Two acres
Residential (Multi-Family)          Two acres
Residential (Mixed Multi/Single)    Two acres
Office/Commercial                   Four acres
Office/Commercial/Residential Mixed Five acres
Industrial                          Ten acres
Industrial/Commercial               Ten acres
 
   (C)   Relationship to adjacent areas. The design and layout of a PUD shall
take into account the relationship of the site to the surrounding areas.
Additionally, the perimeter of the PUD shall be so designed as to minimize any
negative impact on adjacent properties.
   (D)   Phased development. Development of a PUD may be phased, in which case
all the property anticipated for PUD development shall be submitted as part of
the PUD development plan showing a conceptual depiction of the eventual
development and approximate phase lines shown. Plats for PUD's requiring
platting may be processed concurrently with the PUD approval procedures.
   (E)   Design standards and requirements.
      (1)   Subdivision requirements. If land or structures within a proposed
PUD are to be sold to more than one person, partnership, firm or corporation,
or are to include the dedication of land, then the proposed PUD shall be
subject to the Rutherford College Subdivision Regulations. Deviations from said
standards may be approved provided they are stated as part of the PUD
development standards.
      (2)   Density. The basic density in a PUD shall be established on the
approved development plan.
      (3)   Open space requirements. A commercial PUD shall provide not less
than 10% of the gross land area for common open space. In residential or
residential mixed use PUDs, the PUD shall provide not less than 25% open space.
Required open space may not be part of any proposed or platted single-family
residential lots.
      (4)   Setbacks. Setbacks from property lines shall generally follow the
standards of the districts abutting the PUD. Deviations from said standards may
be approved by Council provided they are stated as part of the PUD development
standards.
      (5)   Lot sizes. Minimum lot sizes for single-family residential lots
shall generally follow the average of the districts abutting the PUD.
Deviations from said standards may be approved by Council provided they are
stated as part of the PUD development standards. In no case shall the density
or built-upon area of a site exceed the requirements of the Watershed
Protection Ordinance of Rutherford College.
      (6)   Parking. Parking ratio and design for the development shall conform
to the standards of §§
152.210 -
152.218, Off-Street Parking, Loading and Landscaping.
      (7)   Landscaping and buffering. Landscaping and buffering shall conform
to the standards of §§
152.230 -
152.232, Buffers and Screening.
      (8)   Pedestrian and vehicle access. All PUDs shall provide for
pedestrian connectivity through a minimum of 5' wide concrete sidewalk or
pedestrian path built to ADA standards along internal streets and on the
external boundary of the property if its abuts an existing street. To the
extent practicable, adjoining parking lots, serving non-residential buildings
shall be interconnected. Parking lots and driveways shall be designed to
minimize conflict with pedestrians.
   (F)   Procedure for approval of planned unit developments. PUDs may be
approved according to the procedures in §
152.078 and §
152.285.

§ 152.058 NONCONFORMING USES.
   After the effective date of this chapter, existing structures, or the uses
of land or structures which would be prohibited under the regulations for the
district in which it is located (if they existed on the adoption date of this
chapter), shall be considered as nonconforming. Nonconforming structures or
uses (as defined in §
152.005) may be continued provided they conform to the following provisions.
   (A)   Continuing nonconforming uses of land.
      (1)   Extensions of use. Nonconforming uses or land shall not hereafter
be enlarged or extended in any way.
      (2)   Change of use. Any nonconforming uses of land may be changed to a
conforming use, or with the approval of the Board of Adjustment, to any use
more in character with the uses permitted in the district in question.
      (3)   Cessation of use. When nonconforming uses of land are discontinued
for a continuous period of 180 days the property involved may thereafter be
used only for conforming purposes.
         (a)   All nonconforming uses of land involving minor structures such
as junkyards, signs or any nonconforming uses similar to those enumerated,
shall be eliminated within two years from the date of adoption of this chapter.
         (b)   A record of these nonconforming uses shall be compiled by the
Planning Board and kept on permanent file in the Town Hall.
         (c)   Involved property owners shall be notified of this provision
within six months of the adoption of this chapter.
   (B)   Continuing the use of nonconforming buildings.
      (1)   Extensions of use. Nonconforming buildings and nonconforming uses
of buildings shall not hereafter be enlarged. Additionally, no nonconforming
structure or use may be enlarged or altered in any way which increases its
dimensional deficiencies.
      (2)   Change of use. The lawful use of a building existing at the time of
the adoption of this chapter may be continued although such use does not
conform with the provisions of this chapter, and such building may be
reconstructed or structurally altered and nonconforming use therein changed
subject to the following regulations.
         (a)   The order of classification of uses from highest to lowest for
the purpose of this section shall be as follows: single-family residential
uses, multi-family residential uses, commercial uses and industrial uses as
permitted by this chapter.
         (b)   A nonconforming use may be changed to a use of higher
classification but not to a use of lower classification, nor shall a
nonconforming use be changed to another use of the same classification unless
the new use shall be deemed by the Board of Adjustment, after public notice and
hearing, to be less harmful to the surrounding neighborhood, from the
standpoint of the purposes of this chapter, than the existing nonconforming
use.
         (c)   A nonconforming commercial or industrial use may not be
extended, but the extension of a use to any portion of a building, which
portion is at the time of the adoption of this chapter primarily or designed
for such nonconforming use, shall not be deemed to be an extension of a
nonconforming use.
         (d)   Nor shall the building be enlarged, unless the use therein is
changed to a conforming use; provided, however, that a nonconforming building
damaged by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake or similar uncontrollable cause
to the extent of not more than 60% of its assessed value at the time of the
damage may be repaired or rebuilt within one year of the date of such damage,
but not thereafter. Such determination shall be made by the Board of
Adjustment.
         (e)   Nevertheless, the erection of a single-family dwelling unit
shall be permitted on any lot of record which contains an area or width less
than that required for a single-family dwelling in the district in which such
lot is located. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership on the effective date of this
chapter. Variance of any district regulations other than area and/or width
shall be obtained only through the action of the Board of Adjustment.
      (3)   Cessation of use. If active operations are discontinued for a
continuous period of 180 days with respect to a nonconforming use of a
building, such nonconforming use shall thereafter be occupied and used for a
conforming use. A period, however, between tenants or occupant shall not be
construed to mean discontinuance.
   (B)   Continuing the nonconforming use of manufactured homes and
manufactured home parks.
      (1)   Extension of use. Nonconforming manufactured homes and manufactured
home parks existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter shall be
allowed to continue to their present existence. Existing mobile home parks
shall not hereafter be enlarged or extended in any way.
      (2)   Replacement of manufactured homes in existing manufactured home
parks. Manufactured home parks that are operating as existing parks as of the
effective date of this chapter may continue to operate. The replacement of
nonconforming manufactured homes in manufactured home parks is allowed and must
meet the criteria of this section.
      (3)   Nonconforming manufactured homes, however, may be replaced provided
that the new or replacement manufactured home is a Class B manufactured home as
defined in this chapter, is not more than seven years old, and meets all other
standards for manufactured homes outlined in § 153.097.
(Ord. passed 4-5-2010; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.059 AMORTIZATION.
   The following uses, if they are nonconforming, shall be terminated and all
outside storage or junk removed within three years:
   (A)   Junk yards not located in a G-M General Manufacturing District; and
   (B)   The provisions of division (A) above shall not be applicable,
provided, that the following conditions pertaining to junk yards herein are
met:
      (1)   The junk or salvage yard area must comply with all setback
requirements for the G-M General Manufacturing District.
      (2)   A natural buffer, consisting of a double row of evergreen trees
which will reach at least ten feet in height within three years and be of
sufficient density to provide a reasonable visual buffer or a ten-foot high
view-obscuring fence shall be placed between the site and all streets, roads or
highways and surrounding property within sight distance of the junk yard. This
requirement may be waived or modified by the Board of Adjustment if it can find
that the intent of this section is met by existing topographic conditions or
vegetation. Junk or salvage shall not be piled higher than the height of the
fence, nor against the fence.
      (3)   All materials shall be required to be stored in such a manner as to
prevent the breeding or harboring of rats, insects or other vermin. Where
necessary, this shall be accomplished by enclosures in containers, storage of
materials above ground, separation of types of materials, preventing the
collection of stagnant water, extermination procedures or other means.

§ 152.060 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Uses not designated as permitted by right or as a special use approved
by the Board of Adjustment shall be prohibited. Additional uses in character
with the district may be added to the ordinance by amendment.
   (B)   The regulations set forth by this chapter shall be minimum
regulations. If the district requirements set forth in this chapter are at a
variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations
or ordinances, the more restrictive or higher standard shall govern.
   (C)   Unless the restrictions established by covenants for the land are
prohibited by or are contrary to the provisions of this chapter, nothing herein
contained shall be construed to render such covenants inoperative.
(Ord. passed 4-5-2010; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.061 EXEMPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Lot of record.
      (1)   Where the owner of a lot of official record in any residential
district at the time of the adoption of this chapter or his or her successor in
title does not own sufficient contiguous land to enable him to conform to the
minimum lot size requirements of this chapter, such a lot may be used as a
residential building site; provided, however, that the requirements of the
district are complied with or a variance is obtained from the Board of
Adjustment.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever two or more adjoining
vacant lots of record are in single ownership at any time after the adoption of
this chapter and such lots individually have less area or width than the
minimum requirements of the district in which such lots are located, such lots
shall be considered as a single lot or several lots which meet the minimum
requirements of this chapter for district in which such lots are located.
      (3)   Every lot to be built upon shall abut by at least 37.5 feet a
public street or other public way and no dwelling shall be placed or built upon
a lot which does not abut upon a public street or other public way by the same
distance, with the exception of division (B) below.
   (B)   Provisions for landlocked lots. Existing landlocked lots within the
residential zoning districts, defined as a lot that does not abut a public
street and therefore does not meet the requirements that the lot have a minimum
frontage on a public street of 37.5 feet, may be developed for one single-
family dwelling unit if the lot otherwise meets the zoning requirements of the
zone in which the lot is located provided that the lot has a recorded easement
of ingress and egress to and from a public street which is appurtenant to the
lot and which meets the following requirements:
      (1)   A private easement with a minimum continuous width of 20 feet is
acquired from intervening property owners;
      (2)   The recorded documents creating the easement shall specify that the
public service, utility and emergency personnel and vehicles shall have the
freedom of ingress and egress from the landlocked property;
      (3)   The recorded documents shall also specify that public utilities
(water, sewer, electricity, telephone, cable and the like) may be located
within the easement;
      (4)   The recorded documents shall include a maintenance agreement
specifying the party responsible for maintaining the easement and its traveled
surface;
      (5)   The easement must have an all weather surface of gravel, concrete
or asphalt with a minimum continuous width of ten feet to ensure access of
public service, utility and emergency personnel and vehicles;
      (6)   Easements existing prior to the adoption of this chapter with
widths less than 20 feet may be used to access landlocked lots provided that
such easements abut a public street or way; and
      (7)   Subdivision of landlocked parcels will require the provision of a
publicly dedicated street constructed to the town standards and must meet all
the requirements of the town’s subdivision regulations.
   (C)   Front yard for dwellings.
      (1)   The front yard requirements of this chapter for dwellings shall not
apply to any lot where the average setback of existing buildings located wholly
or in part within 100 feet on either side of the proposed dwelling and on the
same side of the street in the same block and use district as such lot is less
than the minimum required front yard depth.
      (2)   In such case, the setback on such lots may be less than the
required setback but not less than the average of the existing setbacks on the
aforementioned lots, or a distance of ten feet from the street right-of-way,
whichever is greater.
   (D)   Height limitation. The height limitations of this chapter shall not
apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes not intended for human
occupancy; monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission towers,
chimneys, smokestacks, conveyors, flagpoles, radio towers, television towers,
masts, aerials and similar structures, except as otherwise noted in the
vicinity of airports.
   (E)   Visibility of intersections. On a corner lot in any residential
district, no planting, structure, sign, fence, wall or obstruction to vision
more than three feet in height measured from the centerline of the street or
road shall be placed or maintained within the triangular area formed by the
intersecting street or road right-of-way lines and a straight line connecting
points on said street or road right-of-way line each of which is 35 feet
distance from the point of intersection.
(Ord. passed 4-5-2010; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.062 FENCES.
   Fences and walls are permitted as an accessory use in all zoning districts,
provided that:
   (A)   No fence shall be constructed within or upon any street right-of-way.
   (B)   On a corner lot in any district, no fence, wall or obstruction to
vision more than three feet in height measured from the centerline of the
street or road shall be placed or maintained within the triangular area formed
by the intersecting street or road right-of-way lines and a straight line
connecting points on said street or road right-of-way line, each of which is 35
feet distance from the point of intersection.
   (C)   No fence or wall shall alter or impede the natural flow of water in
any stream, creek, drainage swale, or ditch.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall preclude the installation of temporary
fences related to construction sites or sediment and erosion control.
   (E )    A zoning permit is required for the installation of any fence.

§ 152.076 ADULT ESTABLISHMENTS.
   (A)   It is recognized that there are some uses of property which, because
of their very nature, are recognized as having characteristics which impose
adverse effects on the neighborhood in which the use is located. Regulations
are necessary to minimize the adverse effects and to prevent a particular area
subject to the zoning jurisdiction of the town from a concentration of the
uses. It is not the intent of this section to conflict with state laws
regulating adult establishments, but rather to regulate the location of adult
establishments whose material or activities are legal.
   (B)   An adult establishment can include any structure or use of land that
is defined in G.S. § 160D-902 and/or including the following:

the Highway Business (H-B) and General Manufacturing (G-M) Districts.
   (D)   There shall be a spacing of 1,500 feet between adult establishment
uses. The 1,500-foot distance shall be measured on a straight line from
property line to property line, with no consideration as to intervening
structures, roads or land forms.
   (E)   No adult establishment shall be located within 1,500 feet of a church,
public or private school, child day care or nursery school, or public park. The
1,500-foot distance shall be measured on a straight line from property line to
property line, with no consideration as to intervening structures, roads or
land forms.
   (F)   The minimum setbacks, maximum building height and all other
dimensional requirements shall be the same as for uses in the Highway Business
District.
   (G)   The amount of parking spaces required shall be the same as for all
other commercial uses. Parking areas shall only be located in the front of the
principal building.
   (H)   There shall be no screening or buffers allowed in any form except when
the property abuts a residentially zoned property on the side or rear.
   (I)   Signs allowed shall be in compliance with Highway Business District
sign regulations. Any ground, wall, canopy or projection sign shall contain
only the name of the establishment. It shall not contain any advertising nor
identification of any product, service and the like.
   (J)   Customer or member entrances shall only be in the front of the
building facing the street. No side or rear entrances shall be allowed for use
by anyone patronizing an adult business.
   (K)   No printed material, slide, video, photograph, written text, live show
or other visual presentation format shall be visible from outside the
establishment.
   (L)   There shall not be more than one adult business use, either the same
or another use, located on the same property, building or structure.
   (M)   Other applicable regulations contained in this chapter shall be in
effect.

§ 152.122 STORM WATER CONTROL STRUCTURES.
   (A)   All storm water control structures shall be designed by a state
registered professional engineer. Other storm water systems shall be designed
by a state registered professional with qualifications appropriate for the type
of system required; these registered professionals are defined as professional
engineers or landscape architects, to the extent that the G.S. Ch. 89A allow
and land surveyors, to the extent that the design represents incidental
drainage within a subdivision, as provided in G.S. § 89C-3(7).
   (B)   All storm water controls shall use wet detention ponds as a primary
treatment system, unless alternative storm water management measures, as
outlined in division (C) below, are used. Wet detention ponds shall be designed
for specific pollutant removal according to modeling techniques approved by the
State Division of Environmental Management. Specific requirements for these
systems shall be in accordance with the following design criteria:
      (1)   Wet detention ponds shall be designed to remove 85% of total
suspended solids in the permanent pool and storage runoff from a one-inch
rainfall from the site above the permanent pool;
      (2)   The designed runoff storage volume shall be above the permanent
pool;
      (3)   The discharge rate from these systems following the one-inch
rainfall design storm shall be such that the runoff does not draw down to the
permanent pool level in less than two days and that the pond is drawn down to
the permanent pool level within at least five days;
      (4)   The mean permanent pool depth shall be a minimum of three feet;
      (5)   The inlet structure shall be designed to minimize turbulence using
baffles or other appropriate design features;
      (6)   Vegetative filters shall be constructed for the overflow and
discharge of all storm water wet detention ponds and shall be at least 30 feet
in length. The slope and width of the vegetative filter shall be determined so
as to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow through the filter for a ten-year,
24-hour storm with a ten-year, one-hour intensity with a slope of 5% or less.
Vegetation in the filter shall be natural vegetation, grasses or artificially
planted wetland vegetation appropriate for the site characteristics; and
      (7)   All storm water control structures shall be enclosed by a fence
with a minimum height of six feet.
   (C)   Alternative storm water management systems, consisting of one
treatment option or a combination of treatment options, may be used, The design
criteria for approval shall be 85% average annual removal of total suspended
solids. Also, the discharge rate shall meet one of the following criteria:
      (1)   The discharge rate following the one-inch design storm shall be
such that the runoff draws down to the pre-storm design stage within five days,
but not less than two days; or
      (2)   The post development peak discharge rate shall equal the pre-
development rate for the one-year, 24-hour storm.
   (D)   In addition to the vegetative filters required in division (B)(6)
above, all land areas outside of the pond shall be provided with a ground cover
sufficient to restrain erosion within 30 days after any land disturbance. Upon
completion of the storm water control structure, a permanent ground cover shall
be established and maintained as part of the maintenance agreement described in
§
152.123(C).
   (E)   A description of the area containing the storm water control structure
shall be prepared and filed consistent with §
152.126(A) and (B), as a separate deed with the County Register of Deeds along
with any easements necessary for general access to the storm water control
structure. The deeded area shall include the storm water control structure,
vegetative filters, all pipes and water control structures, berms, dikes and
the like, and sufficient area to perform inspections, maintenance, repairs and
reconstruction.
   (F)   Qualifying areas of the storm water control structure may be
considered pervious when computing total built-upon area; however, if the
structure is used to compute the percentage built-upon area for one site, it
shall not be used to compute the built-upon area for any other site or area.
(Ord. passed 4-5-2010; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.123 POSTING OF FINANCIAL SECURITY REQUIRED.
   (A)   Generally. All new storm water control structures shall be conditioned
on the posting of adequate financial assurance for the purpose of maintenance,
reconstruction or repairs necessary for adequate performance of the storm water
control structures.
   (B)   Financial assurance. Financial assurance shall be in the form of the
following:
      (1)   Security performance bond or other security. The permit applicant
shall obtain either a performance bond from a surety bonding company authorized
to do business in the state, an irrevocable letter of credit or other
instrument readily convertible into cash at face value payable to the town or
placed in escrow with a financial institution designated as an official
depository of the town. The bond or other instrument shall be in an amount
equal to one and one-quarter times the total cost of the storm water control
structure, as estimated by the applicant and approved by the town. The total
cost of the storm water control structure shall include the value of all
materials such as piping and other structures; seeding and soil stabilization;
design and engineering; and, grading, excavation, fill and the like. The costs
shall not be prorated as part of a larger project, but rather under the
assumption of an independent mobilization.
      (2)   Cash or equivalent security deposited after the release of the
performance bond. Consistent with §
152.126(C)(l), the permit applicant shall deposit with the town either cash or
other instrument approved by the Town Attorney that is readily convertible into
cash at face value. The cash or security shall be in an amount equal to 15% of
the total cost of the storm water control structure or the estimated cost of
maintaining the storm water control structure over a ten-year period, whichever
is greater. The estimated cost of maintaining the storm water control structure
shall be consistent with the approved operation and maintenance plan or manual
provided by the developer under §
152.124(A). The amount shall be computed by estimating the maintenance cost for
25 years and multiplying this amount by two fifths or 0.4.
   (C)   Operation and maintenance agreement. Consistent with §
152.121(G), the permit applicant shall enter into a binding operation and
maintenance agreement between the town and all interests in the development.
Said agreement shall require the owning entity to maintain, repair and, if
necessary, reconstruct the storm water control structure in accordance with the
operation and management plan or manual provided by the developer. The
operation and maintenance agreement shall be filed with the County Register of
Deeds by the Watershed Administrator.
   (D)   Default under the performance bond or other security. Upon default of
the permit applicant to complete and/or maintain the storm water control
structure as specifically provided in the performance bond or other security,
the town may obtain and use all or any portion of the funds necessary to
complete the improvements based on an engineering estimate. The town shall
return any funds not spent in completing the improvements to the owning entity.
   (E)   Default under the cash security. Upon default of the owning entity to
maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the storm water control
structure in accordance with the operation and maintenance agreement, the town
shall obtain and use all or any portion of the cash security to make necessary
improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of funds shall
only be made after exhausting all other reasonable remedies seeking the owning
entity to comply with the terms and conditions of the operation and maintenance
agreement. The town shall not return any of the deposited cash funds.
(Ord. passed 4-5-2010; Ord. 5-3-2021)
§ 152.124 MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP.
   (A)   An operation and maintenance plan or manual shall be provided by the
developer for each storm water control structure, indicating what operation and
maintenance actions are needed, what specific quantitative criteria will be
used for determining when those actions are to be taken and, consistent with
the operation and maintenance agreement, who is responsible for those actions.
The plan shall clearly indicate the steps that will be taken for restoring a
storm water control structure to design specifications if a failure occurs.
   (B)   Landscaping and grounds management shall be the responsibility of the
owning entity; however, vegetation shall not be established or allowed to
mature to the extent that the integrity of the control structure is diminished

§ 152.146 LOCATION OF WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   (A)   To protect the visual qualities of the center of the town and to
protect public safety, new towers shall be prohibited from the following areas:
      (1)   Within 1,000 feet of each side of Malcolm Boulevard for the area
beginning north of I-40 and extending to Talmon Street; and
      (2)   Within a 1,000 feet zone of the school property located on
Honeycutt Drive.
   (B)   Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate,
site and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with
the following priorities, one being the highest priority and six being the
lowest priority.
      (1)   On existing towers or other structures without increasing the
height of the tower or structure;
      (2)   On town-owned properties;
      (3)   On properties in areas zoned General Manufacturing;
      (4)   On properties in areas zoned Highway Business;
      (5)   On properties in areas zoned Office-Institutional;
      (6)   On properties in areas zoned Central Business; and
      (7)   On properties in areas zoned Residential.
   (C)   If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed
above, then a detailed explanation must be provided as to why a site of a
higher priority was not selected. The person seeking such an exception must
satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be
granted for the proposed site and the hardship that would be incurred by the
applicant if the permit were not granted for the proposed site.
   (D)   An applicant may not defend or justify bypassing sites of a higher
priority by claiming the site proposed is the only site leased or selected. All
applications shall address co-location as an option. If such option is not
proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the town
why co-location is commercially or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between
providers limiting or prohibiting co-location shall not be a valid basis for
any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.
   (E)   Notwithstanding the above, the town may approve any site located
within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the town finds
that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and
welfare of the town and its inhabitants and will not have a negative effect on
the nature and character of the community and neighborhood.
   (F)   The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the
applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority, demonstrating
the technological reason for the site selection. If appropriate, based on
selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why
sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the
application.
   (G)   Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of
highest priority or highest available priority, the town may disapprove an
application for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
      (2)   Conflict with the historic nature or character of the community, a
neighborhood or a historical district;
      (3)   The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities
which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use
designation;
      (4)   The placement and location of wireless telecommunications
facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable
probability of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the
town, or employees of the service provider or other service providers; and/or
      (5)   Conflicts with the provisions of this subchapter.

§ 152.147 SHARED USE OF FACILITIES AND OTHER STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Locating on existing towers or others structures without increasing
the height shall be preferred by the town, as opposed to the construction of a
new tower. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying
existing towers and other functionally suitable structures within four miles of
the location of any proposed new tower, unless the applicant can show that some
other distance is more reasonable and demonstrate conclusively why an existing
tower or other suitable structure cannot be used.
   (B)   An application to co-locate on an existing tower or other suitable
structure shall contain proof of the intent of the existing owner to permit its
use by the applicant.
   (C)   Such shared use shall consist of only the minimum antenna array
technologically required to provide service primarily and essentially within
the town, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.

§ 152.148 HEIGHT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER(S).
   (A)   The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the total height
of any tower, facility and/or antenna and the basis therefore. Such
documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the
height needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the town, to
the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
   (B)   Unless otherwise granted relief or a waiver, the maximum permitted
height of a new tower shall be no taller than the applicant service provider
can prove is the minimum height necessary to provide service primarily to
provide a balanced link (both up and down link) service in the area of no
service. Such proof shall be provided using RF propagation studies showing the
height of attachment of the array, the ERP (effective radiated power) stated in
watts, the direction or azimuth of each of the maximum lobes, any designed or
intended pitch or down-tilt of any of the sector panels. At a minimum an
applicant for a tower shall provide one set of RF propagation studies on clear
acetate overly showing all existing sites adjacent to the search ring that
shows the gap in coverage. Another set of propagation studies shall be provided
showing the lowest height at which service can be provided in the search ring
and another set shall be provided computed at ten feet below the minimum height
necessary to provide service in the search ring. The town retains the right to
determine the adequacy of the needed information provided as regards the
determination of need for the requested height.
   (C)   No tower constructed after the effective date of this chapter,
including allowing for all attachments, shall exceed that height which shall
permit operation without required artificial lighting of any kind as may be
required by municipal, county, state and/or any federal statute, law,
ordinance, code, rule or regulation.

      (5)   To enforce this chapter and take all necessary steps to remedy any
condition found in violation by ordering in writing the discontinuance of
illegal uses or illegal work in progress and may institute mandamus, or other
appropriate action; and
      (6)   To keep the Board of Adjustment advised of all matters other than
routine duties pertaining to the enforcement of this chapter and to transmit
all applications and records pertaining to appeals, variances or requests for
special use approval.
   (B)   The administrative officer or other staff member shall not make a
final decision on an administrative decision required by this chapter if the
outcome of that decision would have a direct, substantial, and readily
identifiable financial impact on the staff member or if the applicant or other
person subject to that decision is a person with whom the staff member has a
close familial, business, or other associational relationship (G.S. § 160D-
109).
   (C)   The administrative officer may inspect work undertaken pursuant to a
development approval to assure that the work is being done in accordance with
applicable State and local laws and of the terms of the approval. In exercising
this power, staff are authorized to enter any premises within the jurisdiction
of the city local government at all reasonable hours for the purposes of
inspection or other enforcement action, upon presentation of proper
credentials, provided the appropriate consent has been given for inspection of
areas not open to the public or that an appropriate inspection warrant has been
secured (G.S. § 160D-403(e)).

§ 152.246 ZONING COMPLIANCE PERMIT AND BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Within the town limits, no building, sign or other structure shall be
erected, moved, added to or structurally altered before a zoning compliance
permit has been issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer of the town or
designated representative and a building permit is issued by the County
Building Inspector.
(Ord. passed 4-5-2010; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.247 APPLICATION FOR A ZONING COMPLIANCE PERMIT.
   (A)   Each application to the Zoning Enforcement Officer for a zoning permit
shall be accompanied by plot plans in duplicate showing:
      (1)   The actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon;
      (2)   The size of the building to be erected;
      (3)   The location of the building on the lot;
      (4)   The location of existing structures on the lot, if any;
      (5)   The number of dwelling units the building is designed to
accommodate;

      (7)   The intended use of the property;
      (8)   The county tax map identification number of the property and a copy
of the metes and bounds description of the lot of record; and
      (9)   Such other information as may be essential for determining whether
the provisions of this chapter are being observed.
   (B)   Vesting. Zoning permits expire one year after issuance unless work has
substantially commenced. Expiration of a local development approval does not
affect the duration of a vested right established as a site specific vesting
plan, a multiphase development plan, a development agreement, or vested rights
established under common law. A site specific plan or planned unit development
shall remain vested for a period exceeding two years, but not exceeding five
years. A multi-phase development shall remain vested for a period of seven
years from the time a site plan is approved. For the purposes of this chapter,
a multi-phase development must contain 100 acres or more and is submitted for
site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one phase and is a
master plan that includes a requirement to offer land for public use (G.S. §
160D-108(d)).
   (C)   Revocation of development approvals. Development approvals may be
revoked by the local government issuing the development approval by notifying
the permit holder in writing stating the reason for the revocation. The local
government shall follow the same development review and approval process
required for issuance of the development approval, including any required
notice or hearing, in the review and approval of any revocation of that
approval. Development approvals shall be revoked for any substantial departure
from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure
to comply with the requirements of any applicable local development regulation
or any state law delegated to the local government for enforcement purposes in
lieu of the state; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in
securing the permit approval. Any development approval mistakenly issued in
violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. The
revocation of a development approval by a staff member may be appealed to the
Board of Adjustment pursuant to G.S. § 160D-405. If an appeal is filed
regarding a development regulation adopted by a local government pursuant to
this chapter, the provisions of G.S. § 160D-405(e) regarding stays applies
(G.S. § 160D-403(f)).

regulation or limitation is imposed on the use of any land and water, or on the
erection of a structure, a failure to comply with such provisions shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.

§ 152.251 PROCEDURE UPON DISCOVERY OF VIOLATION.
   Notices of violation. When staff determines work or activity has been
undertaken in violation of these development regulations a written notice of
violation may be issued. The notice of violation shall be delivered to the
holder of the development approval and to the landowner of the property
involved, if the landowner is not the holder of the development approval, by
personal delivery, electronic delivery, or first class mail and may be provided
by similar means to the occupant of the property or the person undertaking the
work or activity. The notice of violation may be posted on the property. The
person providing the notice of violation shall certify to the local government
that the notice was provided and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in
the absence of fraud (G.S. § 160D-404(a)).
(Ord. passed 4-5-2010; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.252 REMEDIES.
   If a building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
repaired, converted or maintained or any building, structure or land is used in
violation of this chapter or a regulation made under authority conferred by
this chapter, the Zoning Enforcement Officer, in addition to other remedies,
may institute any appropriate action on proceedings to prevent the unlawful

BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
§ 152.265 ESTABLISHMENT OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   A Board of Adjustment is hereby established. The Board shall consist of
seven members; six members shall be residents of the town, and the other (ETJ)
member shall be appointed as provided in G.S. § 160D-307. Said Board shall be
appointed by the Town Council for overlapping terms of three years. The
Planning Board may serve as the Board of Adjustment. Any vacancies in the
membership shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the
initial appointments. Members shall serve without pay but may be reimbursed for
any expenses incurred while representing the Board.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2014; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.266 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall elect a Chair and a Vice-Chair from its
members who shall serve for two years. Board of Adjustment officers may be the
same as Planning Board officers. The Board shall appoint a secretary, who may
be a municipal officer, an employee of the town or a member of the Planning
Board. The Board shall adopt rules and by-laws in accordance with the
provisions of this subchapter and of G.S. § 160D-1-9(d). The Planning Board by-
laws may serve as the Board of Adjustment by-laws. Meetings of the Board shall
be held at the call of the Chair, and at such other times as the Board may
determine. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public.
   (B)   Boards shall follow quasi-judicial procedures in determining appeals
of administrative decisions, special use permits, certificates of
appropriateness, variances, or any other quasi-judicial decision (G.S. § 160D-
406).
   (C)   Members of the Board of Adjustment shall not participate in or vote on
any quasi-judicial matter in a manner that would violate affected persons’
constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations
of due process include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion
prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex
parte communications, a close familial, business, or other associational
relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of
the matter. If an objection is raised to a Board member’s participation at or
prior to the hearing or vote on that matter and that member does not recuse
himself or herself, the remaining members of the Board shall by majority vote
rule on the objection. For purposes of this section, a CLOSE FAMILIAL
RELATIONSHIP means a spouse, parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, or
grandchild. The term includes the step, half, and in-law relationships. (G.S. §
160D-109(d), (e), (f)).
(Ord. passed 4-7-2014; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.267 COMPOSITION AND DUTIES.
   (A)   Alternate members; boards. The Council may appoint and provide
reimbursement for expenses for alternate members to serve on the Board in the
absence or temporary disqualification of any regular member or to fill a
vacancy pending appointment of a member. Alternate members shall be appointed
for the same term, at the same time, and in the same manner as regular members.
Each alternate member serving on behalf of any regular member has all the
powers and duties of a regular member. The subchapter may designate a Planning
Board or governing board to perform any of the duties of a Board of Adjustment
in addition to its other duties and may create and designate specialized boards
to hear technical appeals.
   (B)   Provisions of chapter. The Board of Adjustment hears and decides
special use permits, requests for variances, and appeals of decisions of
administrative officials charged with enforcement of the chapter. As used in
this subchapter, the term DECISION includes any final and binding order,
requirement, or determination. The Board of Adjustment shall follow quasi-
judicial procedures when deciding appeals and requests for variances and
special and special use permits. The Board shall hear and decide all matters
upon which it is required to pass under any statute or ordinance that regulates
land use or development.
   (C)   Notice of hearing. Notice of hearings conducted pursuant to this
subchapter shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal, application,
or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is
the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the
owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject
of the hearing; and to any other persons entitled to receive notice as provided
by the zoning or unified development ordinance. In the absence of evidence to
the contrary, the town may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners
of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail
at least ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing.
Within that same time period, the town shall also prominently post a notice of
the hearing on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent
street or highway right-of-way.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2014; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.268 APPEALS.
   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from decisions of
administrative officials charged with enforcement of the zoning or unified
development ordinance and may hear appeals arising out of any other ordinance
that regulates land use or development, pursuant to all of the following:
   (A)   Any person who has standing under G.S. § 160D-1-2 or the town may
appeal a decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a
notice of appeal with the Town Clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the
grounds for the appeal. The owner or other party shall have 30 days from
receipt of the written notice of the determination within which to file an
appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal has 30 days from receipt from
any source of actual or constructive notice of the determination within which
to file an appeal. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice pursuant
to G.S. § 160D-403(b) given by first class mail is deemed received on the third
business day following deposit of the notice for mailing with the United States
Postal Service (G.S. § 160D-405(d).
   (B)   The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the
owner of the property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who
sought the decision, if different from the owner. The written notice shall be
delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail.
   (C)   The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the
written notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing
to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or
constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.
   (D)   It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to
appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing
the words “Zoning Decision” or “Subdivision Decision” in letters at least six
inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information
about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of
the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least ten days.
Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting
shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the
posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Absent an
ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall not be required.
   (E)   The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the
appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if
the appellant is not the owner.
   (F)   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays
enforcement of the action appealed from unless the official who made the
decision certifies to the Board of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been
filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in
nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the chapter. In
that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining
order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not
stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited
hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the
appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a
proposed use of property is consistent with the chapter shall not stay the
further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such
property; in these situations the appellant may request and the Board may grant
a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected
by the issue being appealed.
   (G)   Subject to the provisions of division (D) of this section, the Board
of Adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
   (H)   The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as
a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated
in the notice of appeal. If any party or the town would be unduly prejudiced by
the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board
shall continue the hearing. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any
order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The Board
shall have all the powers of the official who made the decision.
   (I)   When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. § 160D-102 or any other appeal
in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record below and
the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. § 160D-1402.
   (J)   The parties to an appeal that has been made under this section may
agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. The
subchapter may set standards and procedures to facilitate and manage such
voluntary alternative dispute resolution.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2014; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.269 SPECIAL USES; CONDITION GOVERNING APPLICATION.
   (A)   To grant in particular cases and subject to appropriate conditions and
safeguards, permits for special uses as authorized by this chapter and set
forth as special uses under the various use districts.
   (B)   The Board shall not grant a special use permit unless and until:
      (1)   A written application for a special use permit is submitted to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer indicating the section of this chapter under which
the special use permit is sought; and
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment finds that in the particular case in
question the use for which the special use permit is sought will not adversely
affect the health or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood
of the proposed use, and will not be detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to property or public improvement in the neighborhood. In granting
such a permit the Board of Adjustment may designate such conditions in
connection therewith as will, in its opinion, assure that the proposed use will
conform to the requirements and spirit of this chapter.
      (3)   Minor modifications to a special use permit may be administratively
approved by the Zoning Administrator if issues arise after the special use
permit has been approved by the Board of Adjustment that keep the applicant
from carrying out the strict interpretation of the ruling.
   (C)   If at any time after a special use permit has been issued, the Board
of Adjustment finds that the conditions imposed and agreements made have not
been or are not being fulfilled by the holder of a special use permit, the
permit shall be terminated and the operation of such a use discontinued. If a
special use permit is terminated for any reason it may be reinstated only after
a public hearing is held.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2014; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.270 VARIANCES.
   When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter
of a zoning ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions
of the ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:
   (A)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the
ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;
   (B)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance;
   (C)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the
property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship;
   (D)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial
justice is achieved; and
   (E)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate
conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are
reasonably related to the variance. Any other ordinance that regulates land use
or development may provide for variances consistent with the provisions of this
section.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2014; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.271 VOTING.
   (A)   The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board shall be necessary to
grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any
other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of
certiorari. For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the Board and
members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not
be considered members of the Board for calculation of the requisite majority if
there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such members.
   (B)   A member of any Board exercising quasi-judicial functions pursuant to
this subchapter shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter
in a manner that would violate affected persons’ constitutional rights to an
impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations of due process include, but
are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter
that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close
familial, business, or other associational relationship with an affected
person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection
is raised to a member’s participation and that member does not recuse himself
or herself, the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2014; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.272 QUASI-JUDICIAL DECISIONS AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   (A)   The Board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within
a reasonable time. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent,
material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision
shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Board’s determination of contested
facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision
shall be signed by the Chair or other duly authorized member of the Board. A
quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the
Clerk to the Board or such other office or official as the chapter specifies.
The decision of the Board shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic
mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any
person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the
decision becomes effective. The person required to provide notice shall certify
that proper notice has been made.
   (B)   Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the
Superior Court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. §
160D-1402. A petition for review shall be filed with the Clerk of Superior
Court by the later of 30 days after the decision is effective or after a
written copy thereof is given in accordance with division (A) of this section.
When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three days shall be added to
the time to file the petition.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2014; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.273 OATHS.
   The Chair of the Board or any member acting as Chair and the Clerk to the
Board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter coming
before the Board. Any person who, while under oath during a proceeding before
the Board of Adjustment, willfully swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1
misdemeanor.
(Ord. passed 4-7-2014; Ord. passed 5-3-2021)
§ 152.274 SUBPOENAS.
   The Board of Adjustment through the Chair, or in the Chair’s absence anyone
acting as Chair, may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence.
To request issuance of a subpoena, persons with standing under G.S. § 160D-1402
may make a written request to the Chair explaining why it is necessary for
certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The Chair shall issue requested
subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope,
and not oppressive. The Chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a
subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the Chair may be appealed to
the full Board of Adjustment. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena
issued pursuant to this section, the Board of Adjustment or the party seeking
the subpoena may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order requiring
that its subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue
these orders after notice to all proper parties.

the county tax abstracts. For the purpose of this section, properties are
“abutting” even if separated by a street, railroad, or other transportation
corridor.
Additionally, the town shall prominently post a notice of the public hearing on
the site proposed for rezoning the amendment or on an adjacent public street or
highway right-of-way. The notice shall be posted within 25 days prior to the
hearing until ten days prior to the hearing. When multiple parcels are included
within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is
not required, but the town shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable
notice to interested persons (G.S. § 160D-602).
   (E)   Plan consistency. When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map
amendment, the Town Council shall approve a brief statement describing whether
its action is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive plan.
The requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear
indication in the minutes of the Town Council, that at the time of action on
the amendment, the Town Council was aware of and considered the Planning
Board’s recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive
plan. If the amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with
the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending
any future land use map in the approved plan and no additional request or
application for a plan amendment shall be required. A plan amendment and a
zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The plan consistency statement
is not subject to judicial review. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a
“large-scale rezoning” under G.S. § 160D-6-2(b), the Town Council statement
describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how
the analysis and polices in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the
action taken.

§ 152.287 ACTION BY THE TOWN COUNCIL.
   (A)   Town Council consideration. The Town Council shall consider changes
and amendments to this chapter as often as necessary; provided, however, that
should the Town Council deny a request for a zoning amendment, it shall not
thereafter accept any other application for the same change of zoning district
affecting the same property, or any portion thereof, until the expiration of
one year from the date of such previous denial.
   (B)   Notice of public hearing. No amendment shall be adopted by the Town
Council until after public notice and hearing. Notice of public hearing shall
be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the town at least once a
week for two successive weeks prior to hearing. Notice may also be made by
posting the property concerned or by mailing notices to the owners of
surrounding property.
   (C)   Town Council action. Before taking such lawful action as it may deem
advisable, the Town Council shall consider the Planning Board’s recommendations
on each proposed zoning amendment. If no recommendations are received from the
Planning Board within 30 days after public hearing by the Town Council, the
proposed amendment shall be deemed to have been approved by the Planning Board.
   (D)   Protests.
      (1)   In case, however, of a protest against such changes signed by the
owners of 20% or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed
change or of those immediately adjacent in the rear thereof extending 100 feet
therefrom, or of those directly opposite thereto extending 100 feet from the
street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment shall not become
effective except by favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the Town
Council.
      (2)   No protest against any change in or amendment to the zoning map
shall be valid or effective unless it be in the form of a written petition
actually bearing the signatures of the requisite number of property owners and
stating that the signers do protest the proposed change or amendment, unless it
shall have been received by the Town Clerk in sufficient time to allow the town
at least two normal working days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal
holidays, before the date established for a public hearing on the proposed
change or amendment to determine the sufficiency and accuracy of the petition
(G.S. § 160D-604). A person who has signed a protest petition may withdraw his
or her name from the petition at any time prior to the vote on the proposed
amendment.
   (D)   Generally. The Town Council may amend, supplement or change the text
regulations and zoning district lines according to the following procedures.
Under no circumstances shall the Town Council adopt such amendments that would
cause this chapter to violate the watershed protection rules as adopted by the
State Environmental Management Commission. Amendments affecting the watershed
protection portions of this chapter shall be filed with the State Division of
Environmental Management, the State Division of Environmental Health and the
State Division of Community Assistance.

prosecutions resulting from the violation of any zoning ordinance heretofore in
effect, which are now pending in any of the courts of this state or of the
United States, shall not be abated or abandoned by reason of the adoption of
this chapter, but shall be prosecuted to their finality the same as if this
chapter had not been adopted; any and all violations of existing zoning
ordinances, prosecutions for which have not yet been instituted, may hereafter
be filed and prosecuted; and nothing in this chapter shall be so construed as

§ 152.999 PENALTY; REMEDIES; SANCTIONS.
   (A)   (1)   Remedies.
         (a)   If any subdivision, development and/or land use is found to be
in violation of this chapter, the town may, in addition to all other remedies
available either in law or in equity, institute a civil penalty in the amount
of $50 a day, institute actions or proceedings to restrain, correct or abate
the violations; to prevent occupancy of the building, structure or land; or to
prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about the premises. In
addition, the State Environmental Management Commission may assess civil
penalties in accordance with G.S. § 143-215.6A. Each day the violation
continues shall constitute a separate offense.
         (b)   If the Watershed Administrator finds that any of the provisions
of this chapter are being violated, he or she shall notify in writing the
person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation,
and ordering the action necessary to correct it. He or she shall order
discontinuance of the illegal use of land, buildings or structures; removal of
illegal buildings or structures, or of additions, alterations or structural
changes thereto; discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or shall take
any action authorized by this chapter to ensure compliance with or to prevent
violation of its provisions. If a ruling of the Watershed Administrator is
questioned, the aggrieved party or parties may appeal such ruling to the Board
of Adjustment.
      (2)   Sanctions. The Town Council may seek enforcement of this chapter by
assessing a civil penalty to be recovered by the town in a civil action in the
nature of debt if the offender does not pay the penalty in a prescribed period
of time after being cited for violation of this chapter. Such violation may be
enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent
jurisdiction. The court may issue an injunction and order of abatement
commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the
unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by
the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the rules of civil
procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular. If the defendant fails or
refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the
time allowed by the court, the defendant may be cited for contempt and the town
may execute the order of abatement. The town shall have a lien on the property
for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic’s
and material man’s lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of
abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for
compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by
the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the
matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant’s full compliance
with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge.
Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction
issued in conjunction therewith. Enforcement of this chapter may be by any one,
all or a combination of the remedies authorized in this chapter. Each day’s
continuing violation shall be a separate and distinct offense.
   (B)   (1)   In the event of a violation of §§
152.140 through
152.171 or any special use permit issued pursuant to §§
152.140 through
152.171, the town may impose and collect, and the holder of the special use
permit for wireless telecommunications facilities shall pay to the town, fines
or penalties as permitted by state law.
      (2)   A violation of §§
152.140 through
152.171 is hereby declared to be an offense, punishable by a fine not exceeding
that which is permitted under state law for conviction of a first offense. For
conviction of a second offense, both of which were committed within a period of
five years, the holder of a special use permit issued under §§
152.140 through
152.171 may be sanctioned by a fine of not less than $350 nor more than $700 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both; and, upon
conviction for a third or subsequent offense all of which were committed within
a period of five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than
$1,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both; however,
for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers
generally, violations of §§
152.140 through
152.171 or of such ordinance or regulation shall be deemed misdemeanors and for
such purpose only all provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall apply to
such violations. Each day after the first seven days following notification
that the violations continues, shall constitute a separate additional
violation, punishable separately and individually.
      (3)   Notwithstanding anything in §§
152.140 through
152.171, the holder of the special use permit for wireless telecommunications
facilities may not use the payment of fines, liquidated damages or other
sanctions or penalties, to evade or avoid compliance with §§
152.140 through
152.171 or any section of §§
152.140 through
152.171. An attempt to do so shall subject the holder of the special use permit
to termination and revocation of the special use permit. The town may also seek
injunctive relief to prevent the continued violation of §§
152.140 through
152.171, without limiting other remedies available to the town.

   (A)   The Inspector is hereby designated as the officer to enforce the
provisions of this chapter and to exercise the duties and powers herein
prescribed. The Inspector is authorized to exercise such powers as may be
necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purpose and provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   The Inspector or designee shall have the following powers and duties:
      (1)   To investigate the dwelling conditions, and to inspect dwellings
and dwelling units located in the town, in order to determine which dwellings
and dwelling units are unfit for human habitation, and for the purpose of
carrying out the objectives of this chapter with respect to the repair, closing
or demolition of such dwellings and dwelling units;
      (2)   To provide for an inspection of any dwelling that falls vacant or
which there is a request for utilities to be changed from one party to another.
The Inspector shall be responsible for collecting a fee for the inspection of
the dwelling units which are inspected for compliance with this code. The Town
Council shall set the amount of such inspection fee;
      (3)   To take such action, together with other appropriate departments
and agencies, public and private as may be necessary to effect rehabilitation
of housing which is deteriorated;
      (4)   To keep a record of the results of inspections made under this
chapter and an inventory of those dwellings that do not meet the minimum
standards of fitness herein prescribed;
      (5)   To administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses and receive
evidence;
      (6)   To enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations and
inspections; provided such entries shall be made in accordance with Section 17
of this ordinance and state law, and shall be made in such a manner as cause
the least possible inconvenience to the persons in possession;
      (7)   To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents, and

(Ord. passed 7-14-2008)
§ 153.21 INSPECTIONS; DUTY OF OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS.
   (A)   For the purpose of making inspections, the Inspector is hereby
authorized to enter, examine and survey at all reasonable times all dwellings,
dwelling units, rooming houses, rooming units and the premises associated
therewith. The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming
house or rooming unit or the person in charge thereof shall give the Inspector
free access to such dwelling and its premises at all reasonable times for the
purpose of such inspection, examination and survey.
   (B)   Every occupant of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, or rooming
unit shall give the owner thereof, or his or her agent or employee, access to
any part of such dwelling or dwelling unit and its premises at all reasonable
times for the purpose of making such repairs or alterations as are necessary to
effect compliance with the provisions of this chapter or with any lawful order
issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
 
Note: When permission to inspect a dwelling or its premises is denied, the
Inspector must obtain a warrant to inspect. G.S. § 15-27.2 provides for the
issuance of warrants for the conduct of inspections authorized by law. The N.C.
Court of Appeals, in In Re Dwelling, 24 N.C. App. 17 (1974), has held that the
consent of the tenant-occupant who was in actual possession and control of the
premises was sufficient to authorize an inspection without a warrant,
notwithstanding the fact that the owner had objected to the warrantless search.
When faced with a situation where permission to inspect is denied, inspectors
are advised to seek the advice of the Town Attorney.
 
(Ord. passed 7-14-2008)
§ 153.22 PROCEDURE FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is
filed with the Inspector by a public authority or by at least five residents of
the town charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human
habitation, or whenever it appears to the Inspector, upon inspection that any
dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation he or she shall, if his
or her preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and
cause to be served upon the owner or any parties in the interest in such
dwelling or dwelling unit a complaint stating the charges and containing a
notice that a hearing will be held before the Inspector at a place therein
fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the service of the
complaint. The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an
answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give
testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of such hearing
shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating
to such dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give
evidence. Formal rules of evidence shall not be controlling in hearings before
the Inspector.
   (B)   Procedure after hearing. After such notice and hearing, the Inspector
shall state in writing his or her determination whether the dwelling or
dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, and if so, whether it is
deteriorated or dilapidated.
      (1)   If the Inspector determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is
deteriorated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact in
support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the
owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter, or
improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of
fitness established by this chapter within a specified period of time, not to
exceed 90 days. Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and
close such dwelling or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations, and
improvements have been made.
      (2)   If the Inspector determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, he or
she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact to support such
determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an
order directing and requiring the owner either to repair, alter or improve such
dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness
established by this chapter, or else to vacate and remove or demolish the same
within a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order. Violation of any provision of the code
shall subject the offender to a civil penalty as set out in this code of
ordinances.
      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or
dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the Inspector to repair,
alter, or improve or to vacate and close the same within the time specified
therein, or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail
to comply with an order of the Inspector to repair, alter or improve or to
vacate and close and remove or demolish the same within the time specified
therein, the Inspector shall submit to the Town Council at its next regular
meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney to petition the Superior Court
for an order directing such owner to comply with the order of the Inspector, as
authorized by G.S. § 160A-446(g).
      (2)   In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated or
dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with an order of the Inspector
within the time specified therein, if injunctive relief has not been sought or
has not been granted as provided in the preceding division (C)(1), the
Inspector shall submit to the governing body of the town an ordinance ordering
the Inspector to cause such dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered,
improved vacated, closed, removed or demolished, as provided in the original
order of the Inspector, provided by G.S. § 160A-443 and Section 16 of the
ordinance.

any notice of appeal, the Inspector shall forthwith transmit to the Board all
the papers constituting the record upon which the decision to allow the person
aggrieved thereby to do any act, his or her decision shall remain in force
until modified or reversed. When an appeal is from a decision of the Inspector
requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect
of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the Board unless the
Inspector certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him
or her, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which
shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his or her requirement would
cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall
not be suspended except for the due cause shown upon not less than one day’s
written notice to the Inspector, by the Board, or by a court of record upon
petition made pursuant to G.S. § 160A-446(f) and division (E) of this section.
      (1)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all
appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its
decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent
or attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in
its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all
powers of the Inspector, but the concurring vote of four members of the Board
shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Inspector.
The Board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where
there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of the chapter to adapt the application of the
chapter to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the

   (A)   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article
21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article
8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local
governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Therefore, the Town Council of Rutherford College, North Carolina,
does ordain as follows.
(Ord. passed 10-4-2010)

Sec. 2.3.
§ 154.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 10-4-2010)
§ 154.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 10-4-2010)
§ 154.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas
mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that
are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.

definition as stated in §
154.20 of this chapter, provided provisions of §
154.44(I)(2), (I)(3), and (I)(5) have been satisfied, and such facilities are
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
create no additional threats to public safety; or
      (3)   Any other type of development, provided it meets the requirements
of this section.
   (D)   In passing upon variances, the appeal board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as defined
under §
154.20 of this chapter as a functionally dependent facility, where applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (E)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (F)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25
per $100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a
record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the State of North Carolina upon request.
   (I)   Conditions for variances:
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or
non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 154.55 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas the following provisions are required:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement of the structure.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
   (D)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding to the regulatory flood protection elevation. These
include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units, bath/
kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable
boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
   (E)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to

   (F)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (H)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall
meet the requirements of “new construction” as contained in this chapter.
   (I)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this
chapter and located totally or partially within the floodway, non-encroachment
area, or stream setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the
regulatory flood protection elevation in the floodway, non-encroachment area,

replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter.
   (J)   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted. A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an
allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater
treatment facility may be located in a special flood hazard area only if the
structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least the regulatory
flood protection elevation and certified in accordance with the provisions of §
154.41(C).
   (K)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   (L)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
   (M)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (N)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which
approval is required by Federal or State law, including Section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
   (O)    When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard area,
the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
   (P)   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation shall apply.
(Ord. passed 10-4-2010)
§ 154.56 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in §
154.22 or §
154.57, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
154.55, are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
154.20 of this chapter.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
154.20 of this chapter. Structures located in A, AE, and A1-30 Zones may be
floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation
provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are
satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator
as set forth in §
154.41(C), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
154.20 of this chapter.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is
above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) below.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local emergency management coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or
      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
   (G)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, and the like) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the
following criteria shall be met:
      (1)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
      (2)   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
      (3)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
      (4)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
      (5)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
the provisions of §
154.55(A);
      (6)   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of §
154.55(D); and
      (7)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in
conformance with the provisions of division (D)(3) above.
   (I)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet that
satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or
floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with §
154.41(C).
(Ord. passed 10-4-2010)
§ 154.57 STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS.
   Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Approximate Zone A and
established in §
154.22, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the
following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
154.55, shall apply:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet
each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is
greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined based on the following criteria:
      (1)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in §§
154.55 and
154.56.
      (2)   When floodway or non-encroachment data is available from a federal,
state, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements
within floodway or non-encroachment areas shall also comply with the
requirements of §§
154.56 and
154.59.
      (3)   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such
base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance
with §
154.22 and utilized in implementing this chapter.
      (4)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be
elevated or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
154.20. All other applicable provisions of §
154.56 shall also apply.
(Ord. passed 10-4-2010)
§ 154.58 STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS WITH BFE BUT WITHOUT ESTABLISHED
FLOODWAYS OR NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available
from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are
identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report,
the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   Standards of §§
154.55 and
154.56; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.
(Ord. passed 10-4-2010)
§ 154.59 FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   (A)   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located
within the special flood hazard areas established in §
154.22. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles.
   (B)   The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in §§
154.55 and
154.56, shall apply to all development within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         (b)   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion
of the proposed encroachment.
      (2)   If division (B)(1) above is satisfied, all development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
provided the following provisions are met:
         (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
154.56(C); and
         (b)   The no encroachment standard of division (B)(1) above.
