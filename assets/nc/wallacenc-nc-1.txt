GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 50.001 PURPOSE, POLICY AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth uniform
requirements for direct and indirect contributors into the wastewater
collection and treatment system for the town; to enable the town to comply with
all applicable state and federal laws now in effect or hereinafter adopted or
amended as required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and general pretreatment
regulations 40 C.F.R. part 403; to provide for the regulation of direct and
indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance
of permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for all other users; and to authorize monitoring and enforcement
activities; to require user reporting and provide for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein. This chapter shall apply to all users of the municipal wastewater
system, as authorized by G.S. §§ 160A-312 and/or 153A-275. The town shall
designate an administrator of the publicly owned treatment works or POTW and
pretreatment program hereafter referred to as the POTW Director. Any powers
granted to or imposed upon the POTW Director may be delegated by the POTW
Director to other town personnel.
   (B)   Applicability; authority of POTW Director. This chapter shall apply to
all persons within the town and to persons and entities outside the town, who
are, by permit, agreement or otherwise, users of the town’s POTW, as defined in
G.S. § 14-202(a)55. Except as otherwise provided herein, the POTW Director
shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any
powers granted to or imposed upon the POTW Director may be delegated by the
POTW Director to other town personnel. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to
adopt such other written rules and policies which are consistent with this
chapter in order to implement and enforce the provisions hereof. By discharging
wastewater into the municipal wastewater system, all users located beyond the
town limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions established in this
chapter as well as any permits or orders issued hereunder. This includes all
industrial and/or domestic sewage users discharging or hauling and depositing
sewage in the wastewater collection system owned by any satellite POTW.
   (C)   Policy.
      (1)   It is the policy of the town that the discharge of pollutants into
the wastewater collection and treatment system is not a matter of right, but is
a privilege which may be withdrawn by means consistent with the provisions of
this chapter or with any permit or interlocal agreement issued pursuant hereto
or both in order to protect its citizens, the environment and its wastewater
collection and treatment system. Any user who is unwilling or unable to comply
with the provisions contained herein will not be permitted to make or maintain
a connection to or deposit sewage for treatment by the town the wastewater
treatment system of the town.
      (2)   Also, recognizing that the scientific and technical expertise
involved in demonstrating the burden of proof in matters concerning significant
industrial users is substantially greater and more complex as compared to that
of other wastewater permittees or users, the Town Council deems it to be in the
best interests of the public health, safety and welfare to provide an
adjudicatory hearing process for significant industrial users which provides
sufficient time to collect and analyze data necessary for contested case
hearings. Also, a more expeditious administrative appeals process is provided
for permittees or users in the interests of safety, efficiency and economy
while still preserving such persons’ due process rights to notice and an
opportunity to be heard before a final determination of his, her or their
rights.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges
into the wastewater system of the municipality which will interfere with the
efficient and economic operation of the system or contaminate the resulting
sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges
into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system,
inadequately treated, into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible
with the system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to dispose of and utilize sludge from
the system;
      (4)   To protect both municipal personnel who may come into contact with
sewage, sludge and effluent in the course of their employment as well as
protecting the general public;
      (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and
      (6)   To ensure that the town complies with its NPDES or non-discharge
permit conditions, sludge use disposal requirements and any other federal or
state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject.

the system are creating back pressure or flow problems, the town will provide
and maintain grinder pump connections.
      (1)   Any grinder pump units owned and operated by the town shall have
easements recorded at the Register of Deeds that allows access for operation,
maintenance and replacement of all town-owned infrastructure as a condition of
the grinder pump placement.
      (2)   The residential customer is responsible for the cost of electricity
and shall allow such connection as a condition of the grinder pump placement.
      (3)   For any pre-existing grinder pumps that fall into this category,
upon their failure or need for replacement of repairs, the town, at its
discretion, will repair or replace the grinder pump and at that point require
the creation of an easement for the grinder pump to become town-maintained
facility sewer connections, floor drains, grease removal equipment, sinks,
restrooms and the like. Blueprints are acceptable; a “to scale”, hand-drawn
copy may be acceptable in some cases.

   (B)   Any user discharging hazardous waste shall comply with the following
provisions.
      (1)   Any an industrial user/satellite town who commences the discharge
of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include
the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or
other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to
the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
waste stream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream expected to be
discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no
later than 180 days before the discharge commences. The user shall not begin
the discharge until receiving written approval from the town. Any notification
under this division (B)(1) need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under
§
50.139 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
50.135,
50.137 and
50.139 of this chapter.
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (B)(1)
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulation under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW Director, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and state hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective
date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
hereunder or any applicable federal or state law.

chapter and shall constitute grounds for enforcement action.
   (B)   Request for preliminary determination. All persons proposing to
discharge either domestic or non-domestic wastewater or proposing to change the
volume or characteristics of an existing discharge of non-domestic wastewater
or whose wastewater in excess of the concentration listed therein, shall
request from the POTW Director, a preliminary determination of the status of
the user, utilizing such forms and procedures as the POTW Director may from
time to time require. The POTW Director may determine that the user is a
significant industrial user, a user whose discharge is such that a permit will
not be required or a user that has discharge such that it will be required to
obtain a permit prior to discharging or continuing to discharge into the POTW.
Failure to request a preliminary determination pursuant to this section shall
be considered a violation of this chapter and constitutes grounds for
enforcement action.
   (C)   Action by POTW Director.
      (1)   If the POTW Director determines or suspects that the proposed

   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW Director finds that any
user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this subchapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or any prohibition, limitation or requirement
contained therein or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the POTW
Director may serve upon such user a written notice of violation. Within 14 days
or within such other greater period as the POTW Director may allow from the
date of the notice, the user shall submit an explanation for the violation and
a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof. Submission of this plan shall
not relieve the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the POTW Director to take any action, including emergency actions
or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the non-compliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the non-compliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to divisions (D)(1) and (D)(2) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   In cases not involving an emergency or endangerment to the public
health or POTW personnel, the POTW Director may order any user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, who has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this subchapter or who is in non-compliance with a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, to appear before the
POTW Director and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. In the event the POTW Director determines a show cause order should be
issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for
the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and
requesting that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days
before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a
corporation, or the Mayor or Town/County Manager. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, the assessment of a civil penalty or
the taking of any other action against the user, nor is any action or inaction
taken by the POTW Director under this section subject to an administrative
appeal under §
50.098(H) of this chapter.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
   (D)   Administrative orders.
      (1)   When the POTW Director finds that a user has violated or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement or
that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the POTW Director may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to do any of the following:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
         (b)   Come into compliance in accordance with a time schedule set
forth in the order;
         (c)   Take the appropriate remedial or preventive action needed to
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations or
terminating discharge; and
         (d)   Initiate legal action to compel compliance with the provisions
of this chapter, unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time
period. The person will have to disconnect from the POTW.
      (2)   Issuance of an administrative order shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The POTW Director may temporarily suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, which interferes with the POTW, or which causes the POTW to
violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of an intended temporary suspension of the
wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held as soon as possible,
but in all events within five working days from the date of the giving of the
notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted, or the
user’s waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure by the user
to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW Director shall take
such steps deemed necessary to prevent or minimize further damage to the POTW
or endangerment to any individuals including, but not limited to, continued
temporary termination of the receipt of wastewater from the user. The POTW
Director shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment
service upon proof of the elimination of the non- compliant discharge. The user
shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW
Director prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit or permission to discharge.
      (1)   The POTW Director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or
permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the
material and continued breach of the user’s obligations under this chapter for
the following reasons:
         (a)   Failure to accurately report the constituents and
characteristics of its wastewater discharge;
         (b)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
         (c)   Failure or refusal to allow access without delay to the user’s
premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
         (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to
discharge, provisions of this chapter or any applicable state and federal
regulations.
      (2)   Non-compliant users will be notified of the proposed termination of
their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under
§
50.119 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken.

prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or
in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or
interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or
interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the town WWTP was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit and, in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   Permitted bypass. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does
not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to divisions (C)(3) and (C)(4) below.
      (2)   Notice of bypass.
         (a)   Except in the case of emergencies, a user shall submit at least

enforcement action against user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(3)
(a)2. above.

§ 50.146 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Monitoring facilities.
      (1)   User to provide facility. The POTW Director may require the user to
provide and operate at the user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal
drainage systems. The monitoring facility shall, unless otherwise permitted by
the POTW Director, be situated on the user’s premises, but the POTW Director
may, when such location would be impractical or would cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the dedicated public right-
of-way, street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed
by landscaping or parked vehicles. The POTW Director may designate a minimum
frequency for calibration of monitoring equipment; however, the user shall be
responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the equipment at all times.
      (2)   Space. The user shall provide ample room in or near such sampling
manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at
all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility
to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the
written or verbal request of the POTW Director and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
      (3)   Facility to meet town standards. Whether constructed on public or
private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be installed
within 90 days or such greater period as determined by the POTW Director. All
sampling and monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the
town requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.
   (B)   Right of entry; inspection and sampling.
      (1)   Right of entry/sampling. The town may inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the conditions of this chapter are being complied
with and all requirements are being met. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the town, approval authority
and EPA, or their representatives ready access at all reasonable times to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, determining
compliance with any order, records examination and copying, or in the
performance of any of their duties. The town, approval authority and EPA shall
have the right to set up on the user’s property such devices as are necessary
to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations.
      (2)   User to arrange for prompt entry of town. When a user has security
measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before
entry onto its premises or safety requirements or concerns, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with its personnel or security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town, approval
authority and the EPA will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes

Public Works Department of the town as the water purveyor in the elimination of
all cross-connections within its potable water supply.
      (2)   This chapter shall apply to all users connected with the public
works potable water supply regardless of whether the user is located within the
town limits or outside the town limits.
      (3)   This chapter will comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Act, being
42 U.S.C. §§ 300(f) et seq., the State Administrative Code (Title 15A,
Subchapter 8C), and the State Building Code (Volume II) as they pertain to
cross-connections with the public water supply.
(Prior Code, § 51.090)
   (B)   Objectives. The specific objectives of this chapter for the Public
Works Department of the town are as follows:
      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply of the town against
actual or potential contamination by isolating within the consumers water
system, contaminates or pollutants which could, under adverse conditions,
backflow through uncontrolled cross-connections in to the public water system;
      (2)   To eliminate or control existing cross-connections, actual or
potential, between the consumers potable water system(s) and non-potable or
industrial piping system(s); and
      (3)   To provide a continuing inspection program of cross-connection
control which will systematically and effectively control all actual or
potential cross-connections which may be installed in the future.
(Prior Code, § 51.091)
   (C)   Responsibilities.
      (1)   Health Agency.
         (a)   The State Department of Environment Health and Natural Resources
(Division of Health Services) has the responsibility for promulgating and
enforcing laws, rules, regulations and policies to be followed in carrying out
an effective cross-connection control program.
         (b)   The State Department of Environment Health and Natural Resources
(Division of Health Services) has the primary responsibility of ensuring that
the water purveyor operates the public potable water system free of actual or
potential sanitary hazards, including unprotected cross- connections. They have
the further responsibility of ensuring that the water purveyor provides an
approved water supply at the service connection to the consumer’s water system;
and, further, that he or she requires the installation, testing and maintenance
of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service connection when
required.
      (2)   Water purveyor.
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided herein, the water purveyor’s
(Public Works) responsibility to ensure a safe water supply begins at the
source and includes all of the public water distribution system, including the
service connection and ends at the point of delivery to the consumers water
system(s). In addition, the water purveyor shall exercise reasonable vigilance
to ensure that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public
potable water system. To ensure that the proper precautions are taken, the
Public Works Department is required to determine the degree of hazard or
potential hazard to the public potable water system; to determine the degree of
protection required; and to ensure proper containment protection through an on-
going inspection program.
         (b)   When it is determined that a backflow prevention assembly is
required for the protection of the public system, the Public Works Department
shall require the consumer, at the consumer’s expense, to install an approved
backflow prevention assembly at each service connection, to test immediately
upon installation and thereafter at a frequency as determined by the Public
Works Department, to properly repair and maintain the assemblies, and to keep
adequate records of each test and subsequent maintenance and repair, including
materials and/or replacement parts.
      (3)   Plumbing inspections.
         (a)   The Plumbing Inspection Department of the county has the
responsibility to not only review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is
installed, but it also has the explicit responsibility of preventing cross-
connections from being designed and built into the plumbing systems within its
jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests or detects the
potential for cross-connections being made an integral part of the plumbing
system, the Plumbing Inspector has the responsibility, under the State Building
Code, for requiring that the cross-connections be either eliminated or provided
with backflow prevention equipment approved by the State Building Code.
         (b)   The plumbing inspectors responsibility begins at the point of
delivery and continues throughout the entire length of the consumers water
system. The Plan Inspector should inquire about the intended use of water at
any point where a point of delivery is actually called for by the plans. When
such is discovered, it shall be mandatory that a suitable, backflow prevention
assembly approved by the State Building Code be required by the plans and be
properly installed. The primary protection assembly for containment purposes
only shall have approval from the Public Works Department, the State Building
Code and the State Department of Environment Health and Natural Resources.
      (4)   Consumer. The consumer has the primary responsibility of preventing
pollutants and contaminants from entering his or her potable water system or
the public potable water system. The consumer responsibility starts at the
point of delivery from the public potable water system and includes all of his
or her water system. The consumer, at his or her own expense, shall install,
operate, test and maintain approved backflow prevention assemblies as directed
by the Public Works Department. The consumer shall maintain accurate records of
tests and repairs made to backflow prevention assemblies and shall maintain the
records for a minimum period of three years. The records shall be on forms
approved by the Public Works Department and shall include the list of materials
or replacement parts used. Following any repair, overhaul, re-piping or
relocation of an assembly, the consumer shall have it tested to ensure that it
is in good operating condition and will prevent backflow. Tests, maintenance
and repairs of backflow prevention assemblies shall be made by a certified
backflow prevention assembly tester.
      (5)   Certified backflow prevention assembly tester. When employed by the
consumer to test, repair, overhaul or maintain backflow prevention assemblies,
a backflow prevention assembly tester will have the following responsibilities:
The tester will be responsible for making competent inspections and for
repairing or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies and making reports of
the repair to the consumer and responsible authorities on forms provided by the
Public Works Department. The tester shall include the list of materials or
replacement parts used. The tester shall be equipped with and be competent to
use all necessary tools, gauges or other equipment necessary to properly test,
repair and maintain backflow prevention assemblies. It will be the tester’s
further responsibility not to change the design, material or operational
characteristics of an assembly. A certified tester shall perform the work and
be responsible for the competency and accuracy of all tests and reports. A
tester shall provide a copy of all test and repair reports to the consumer and
to the Public Works Department within ten business days of any completed test
or repair work. A tester shall maintain the records for a minimum of three
years.

   The purpose of this subchapter shall be to establish a golf cart ordinance

operation of golf carts on roads. The town, by regulating such operation, is
merely trying to address obvious safety issues, and adoption of this subchapter
is not to be relied upon as a determination that operation on roads is safe or
advisable if done in accordance with this subchapter. All persons who operate
or ride upon carts on roads do so at their own risk and peril and must be
observant of and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including
their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. The town has no

cover the risks involved in using a cart on the roads of the town.

street within the town without liability insurance coverage being provided for
that golf cart. Any person who owns a golf cart that is operated within the
town shall be responsible for procuring liability insurance sufficient to cover
the risk involved in operating a golf cart on public streets.

allies), as well as any "rear fanged" snakes of the family Colubridae that are
known to be dangerous to humans (including, but not limited to Dispholidus
typus (boomslang), Thebtomis Kirtland (Twig snake) and Rhabdophisspp

§ 92.18 NUISANCES ABATEMENT PROCEDURES.
   When any public nuisance as set out in §§

following procedures shall be followed.
   (A)   The Town Manager and Code Enforcement Officer shall have the following
authority:
      (1)   To enter upon property;
      (2)   To obtain an administrative search and inspection warrant, if
necessary, as provided in G.S. § 15-27.2;
      (3)   To issue a notice of violation and impose civil penalties;
      (4)   To enter upon or authorize an agent to enter upon and clean up
premises in violation of this section;
      (5)   To utilize the services of an outside contractor to clean up
premises in violation of this section; and
      (6)   To summarily remove, abate, or remedy everything in the town limits
that is considered by ordinance to be either dangerous or prejudicial to the
public health or which has been declared to be a nuisance.
   (B)   Where any public nuisance as set out in §§
92.15 or
92.16 requires immediate abatement to avoid and prevent an immediate and
dangerous threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the
town and would degrade adjoining properties as determined by the Town Manager
or Code Enforcement Officer, the nuisance may be summarily removed and abated
by the town without prior notice to the property owner. The owner as determined
from the tax records of County of Duplin shall be responsible for all abatement
costs, administrative fees, and civil penalties as provided in §
92.99.
   (C)   Notices or orders issued by the Town Manager or Code Enforcement

of the identified property by either hand delivery or by registered or
certified mail and regular mail. Service by mail shall be deemed complete by
depositing the notice or order in the mail at the address listed in the County
of Duplin tax records postage prepaid. When the manner of service is by
registered or certified mail and regular mail and the registered or certified
mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the Post
Office within ten days of mailing, service is deemed sufficient. The person
mailing the notice or order by regular mail shall certify that fact and the
date of the mailing and the certification shall be conclusive evidence of
service in the absence of fraud.
   (D)   Except in situations identified in division (B) above, notification to
the property owner will advise that the conditions that exist on the identified
property constitute a public nuisance and shall be abated within ten days of
the date of the notification and that failure to abate or remove the nuisance
shall result in the owner's assessment of the costs of abatement or removal,
imposition of administrative fees and the assessment of a civil penalty as
identified in §
92.99. The Town Manager or Code Enforcement Officer may afford the owner
additional time to remove or abate the nuisance if the failure was caused by
weather conditions or other factors as determined by the Town Manager or Code
Enforcement Officer not to have been within the control of the owner.
   (E)   Upon abatement of the nuisance, the Town Manager or Code Enforcement
Officer shall create a written statement of the actual costs incurred by the
town, including time and materials expended by the town, the amounts charged by
private contractors, administrative fees and civil penalty, if applicable, to
the owner of the property with instructions that the charges are due and
payable within 30 days of the date that the statement is mailed. The written
statement shall be delivered in the same manner as provided by division (C)
above. If the charges are not paid within 30 days, then the town shall cause
the costs associated with the abatement as provided in the statement to be
filed as a lien on the subject property with the charges to be collected and
enforced in the same manner as unpaid taxes.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Town Manager
or Code Enforcement Officer may notify a chronic violator that if the chronic
violator's property is determined to be a nuisance as defined in §§
92.15 or
92.16, the town shall, without further notice in the calendar year in which the
notice is given, take action to remedy the violation. The expense of the
action, including the actual cost to remedy the violation and an administrative
fee and civil penalties as provided in §
92.99, shall become a lien upon the property, and shall be collected as unpaid
taxes. For the purpose of this section, a chronic violator is a person who owns
property whereupon, in the previous calendar year, the town gave notice of
violation at least three times under any provision of this chapter.
   (G)   In addition to the nuisances abatement procedures provided by this
chapter, the town reserves the right to utilize any other remedies available
under applicable law, including, but not limited to, proceeding in a criminal
action against any person, firm, or corporation violating the provisions of
this chapter as provided in G.S. § 14-4.
(Ord. 25-04, passed 6-12-2025)
§ 92.19 PENALTY.
   Any owner of a property whose property shall be declared a public nuisance
as provided in this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty in the amount
of $50 per day for each day the nuisance exists beginning on the first day
following the ten-day abatement period provided in §
92.18(D). If a person fails to pay the civil penalty within 30 days after being
notified of the amount due, the city may recover the penalty together with all
costs by filing a civil action in the general court of justice in the nature of
a suit to collect a debt.

and indicating that the vehicle is subject to removal within seven days if the
safety hazard is not eliminated. The town shall also provide the same notice to
the owner, lessee or occupant of the premises, either by personal service or
certified mail, prior to removal of the safety hazard vehicle. The owner of
such vehicle may obtain possession thereof by paying to the private tower all
reasonable costs incident to the removal and storage of the vehicle and
locating the owner of the vehicle.
   (B)   Sale or disposition generally. Subject to the right of a prior hearing
as set forth in §
93.10 of this chapter, a private tower is hereby authorized to sell or dispose
of abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, or safety hazard vehicles.
The sale or disposition of such vehicles shall be by private sale similar to
that provided for in G.S. Chapter 44A; except that, no additional hearing is
required. If no one purchases the vehicle at the sale and if the value of the
vehicle is less than the amount of the lien, the private tower holding a lien
against such vehicle may dispose of it in accordance with applicable law.
   (C)   Procedure for sale. Pursuant to G.S. § 44A-4(c), the sale shall be by
private sale in any such manner that is commercially reasonable. Such sale may
not be made until notice has been given to the state’s Commissioner of Motor
Vehicles on a form approved by the Commissioner at least 20 days before the
date of such sale as provided in G.S. § 20-114(c). Not less than 30 days prior
to the date of the proposed private sale, the private tower shall cause a
notice of sale to be mailed to the person having legal title to the property,
if reasonably ascertainable, to the person with whom the private tower dealt,
if different, and to each secured party or other person claiming an interest in
the property who is actually known to the private tower or can be reasonably
ascertained. The notice of sale provided by the private tower shall include:
      (1)   The name and address of the private tower holding a lien per G.S. §
44A-1;
      (2)   The name of the person having legal title to the property, if such

proposed to be made or, if a public sale, the date and hour when the sale is to
be held.
   (D)   Purchase by town or private tower prohibited. Neither the town nor the
private tower holding a lien shall purchase, directly or indirectly, the
property at private sale and such a sale to the lienor shall be voidable.
   (E)   Disposition of proceeds of sale. In accordance with G.S. § 44A-5, the
proceeds of the sale shall be applied as follows.
      (1)   Expenses of sale include, but are not limited to, reasonable
storage and boarding expenses after giving notice of sale.
      (2)   Any surplus shall be paid to the person entitled thereto, but when
such person cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the
surplus shall be paid to the Clerk of Superior Court of Duplin County, to be
held by the Clerk for the person entitled thereto.
   (F)   Acquisition of title by purchaser. Pursuant to G.S. § 44A-6, a
purchaser for value at a properly conducted sale and a purchaser for value
without constructive notice of a defect in the sale who is not the lienor or an
agent of the lienor acquires title to the property free of any interests over
which the lienor was entitled to priority.

the vehicle owner to a civil penalty and impoundment penalties. Thus, the
assessment of a civil penalty is in addition to the administrative fee, and
towing and storage charges assessed in accordance with §
93.13 of this chapter. The violation and subsequent towing need not occur with
the same vehicle each time.
   (C)   If the civil penalty, as set forth herein, is not paid within ten days
after notification of the amount due, the town may recover the penalty,
together with all costs, by filing a civil action in the General Court of
Justice in the nature of a suit to collect a debt.

have variable widths, as shown on the Zoning Map. Transition zones extend
outward from a line 125 feet on either side of the centerline of the non-
instrument runway for the length of the runway plus 200 feet on each end and
500 feet on either side of the centerline of the instrument runway for the
length of the runway, plus 200 feet on each end and are parallel and level with
the runway centerlines. The transition zones along the runways slope upward and
outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where
they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones
are established adjacent to both instrument and non-instrument approach zones
for the entire length of the approach zones. These transition zones have
variable widths, as shown on the Zoning Map. The transition zones flare
symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of
the zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for
each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of
the horizontal and conical zones. Additionally, transition zones are
established adjacent to the instrument approach zone where it projects through
and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of 5,000 feet
measured horizontally from the edge of the instrument approach zones at right
angles to the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      (4)   Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is established as the area
within a circle with its center at the airport reference point and having a
radius of 5,000 feet. The horizontal zone does not include the instrument and
non-instrument approach zones and the transition zones.
      (5)   Conical zone. A conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom

§ 153.04 HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no structure or tree
shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in any zone created by
this subchapter to a height in excess of the height limit established for the
zone. The height limitations are computed from the established airport
elevation and are established for each of the zones in question as follows:
      (1)   Instrument approach zone. One foot in height for each 50 feet in
horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from the end of the
instrument runway and extending to a distance of 10,200 feet from the end of
the runway; thence one foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance
to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway; thence one foot in height
for each 40 feet;
      (2)   Non-instrument approach zones. One foot in height for each 40 feet
in horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from the end of the non-
instrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the
runway;
      (3)   Transition zones. One foot in height for each seven feet in
horizontal distance beginning at any point 125 feet normal to and at the
elevation of the centerline of non-instrument runways extending 200 feet beyond
each end thereof, and 500 feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline
of the instrument runway, extending 200 feet beyond each end thereof, extending
to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 37.50 feet above
mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height
limits of one-foot vertical height for each seven-feet horizontal distance
measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the
approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points where they
intersect the horizontal or conical surfaces. Further, where the instrument
approach zone projects through and beyond the conical zone, a height limit of
one foot for each seven feet of horizontal distance shall be maintained
beginning at the edge of the instrument approach zone and extending a distance
of 5,000 feet from the edge of the instrument approach zone measured normal to
the centerline of the runway extended;
      (4)   Horizontal zone. One hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation
or a height of 187.50 feet above mean sea level; and
      (5)   Conical zone. One foot in height for each 20 feet of horizontal
distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone, extending to a
height of 337.3 feet above the airport elevation.
   (B)   Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more
restrictive limitation shall prevail.
   (C)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting the
growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to
45 feet above the surface of the land.
(Prior Code, § 150.04) (Ord. passed 3-14-1963)
§ 153.05 USE RESTRICTIONS; NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
subchapter, no use may be made of land within any zone established by this
subchapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the flyers
using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or
otherwise endanger the landing, taking-off and maneuvering of aircraft.
(Prior Code, § 150.05)
   (B)   Non-conforming uses.
      (1)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
subchapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the
regulations as of the effective date of this subchapter or otherwise interfere
with the continuance of any non-conforming use. Nothing herein contained shall
require and change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any
structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the
effective date of this subchapter and is diligently prosecuted.
      (2)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this section, the owner of any non-conforming structure or tree is required to
permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of the markers and
lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport engineers to indicate to the
operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of the
airport hazards. The markers and lights shall be installed, operated and
maintained at the expense of the town.

§ 153.06 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses.
      (1)   Except as specifically provided in divisions (A)(1)(a) through (A)
(1)(c) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no
structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established
in any zone created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and
granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the
permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined,
whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations
herein prescribed. If the determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall
be granted.
         (a)   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of
terrain, land contour or topographic features the tree or structure would
extend above the height limits prescribed for the zone.
         (b)   In areas lying within the limits of the instrument and non-
instrument approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200
feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when
the tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for the
instrument or non-instrument approach zone.
         (c)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for
any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when the tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or
topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the
transition zones.
      (2)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or
growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this subchapter, except as set forth in §
153.04 of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming use,
structure or tree to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air
navigation than it was on the effective date of this subchapter or any
amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
   (C)   Non-conforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Wherever the Town Council
determines that a non-conforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more
than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow the structure or tree to exceed the applicable height
limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (D)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure or permit the growth of any tree or use his or her property not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this subchapter may apply to the
Board of Adjustment for a variance from the regulations. The variances shall be
allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the
regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and
the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but will do
substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this subchapter.
   (E)   Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if
the action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter and
be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner
of the structure or tree in question to permit the town at its own expense to
install, operate and maintain thereon the markers and lights as may be
necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

STORM WATER DRAINAGE CONTROL
§ 154.01 GENERAL POLICY.
   (A)   It shall be the policy of the town to require that all developed land
within its jurisdiction have sufficient storm water management controls in
place so as to ensure the adequate protection of life and property. To this
end, as a minimum, developed land within the jurisdiction of the town shall be
provided with storm water controls capable of managing after-development runoff
from a ten-year, 24-hour storm, so that the on-site and off-site effects of
development are the same or better than the pre-development state. The
requirements of this subchapter shall be construed consistently with the
requirements of the state for controlling storm water quantity and quality.
   (B)   Where the requirements of this subchapter are in conflict with the
rules and regulations of the state, the more stringent or higher requirements
shall govern.
(Prior Code, § 52.01) (Ord. passed - -1997)
§ 154.02 APPLICATION.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this subchapter
shall apply to each of the following:
      (1)   Any development activity that creates 10,000 square-feet or more of
impervious surface area; provided that, single-family residential and duplex
residential development which does not meet the requirements of division (A)(3)
below shall be exempt;
      (2)   All new development which qualifies as either high density or
multi-unit development under the criteria set forth in this chapter; and
      (3)   All new major subdivisions, as defined under the town’s subdivision
regulations.
   (B)   In applying the provisions of this subchapter, the cumulative area of
the proposed development activity and all development activity which has
occurred on the site within a two-year period immediately preceding the date of
an application for a zoning or conditional use permit shall be considered
together.
   (C)   Whenever a site is redeveloped as set forth in divisions (A)(1), (A)
(2) or (A)(3) above, storm water management shall be provided in accordance
with the provisions of this subchapter for the entire site, even if the
redevelopment activity results in less impervious area than previously existed
on the site. Whenever a building or a structure on a site is redeveloped, as
defined in this subchapter, or is completely replaced, the total impervious
area shall be calculated to include both the impervious area from the new
construction as well as any impervious area remaining from the previous
development.
   (D)   Whenever a site or a building is expanded, as set forth in divisions
(A)(1), (A)(2) or (A)(3) above, the expanded portion of the site or building
shall comply with this subchapter. Whenever the expansion equals or exceeds 50%
of the existing development, the entire project shall be required to comply
with this provision. The expansion of an existing development may not be broken
up into phases or sections in order to circumvent this requirement.

(Prior Code, § 52.04) (Ord. passed - -1997)
§ 154.05 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   No zoning, conditional use or building permit shall be issued for any
development, whether for virgin land or for property which has been previously
developed to any degree, unless and until it has been demonstrated to the
town’s satisfaction that:
   (A)   Adequate drainage is available or will be provided to ensure that the
development will not increase the potential for flood-related damage which is
attributable to a ten-year, 24-hour storm, to which the development itself or
other properties could be exposed. To the extent practicable, all development
shall conform to the natural contours of the land, and natural drainage ways
shall remain undisturbed;
   (B)   The construction of all drainage control and storm water retention
devices, such as detention ponds, swales, curbs and gutters, storm drains,
culverts, and other similar devices, will conform to the standards, provisions
and requirements set forth within this subchapter or any other reasonable
standards, provisions and requirements which the town may see fit to adopt that
conform to recognized best management practices (BMP);
   (C)   Appropriate controls either have been or will be put in place to
control erosion and storm water runoff occurring during the period of time that
construction activity is occurring on the site of the development;
   (D)   No surface water will be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer,
either while construction is in progress or any time thereafter;
   (E)   The development will be constructed and maintained in such a way as to
ensure that the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties onto and
across the development site is not unduly impeded. In a similar manner, the
development will be constructed and maintained in such a way as to ensure that
surface waters collecting on the development site will not channeled onto lower
adjacent properties in either locations or in volumes as to cause damage to the
lower adjacent properties;
   (F)   In such instances where storm water controls or devices are determined
to be needed or required, at a minimum, the controls or devices shall provide
for the storage of runoff from an after- development ten-year frequency storm
and, furthermore, the controls or devices shall be designed to release the
storm water from the site at a rate not to exceed the rate at which runoff from
a pre-development ten-year frequency storm would be released;
   (G)   All drainage culverts, tile, pipes and associated facilities are
suitably sized to accommodate designated storm frequencies and, furthermore,
the devices are to be constructed and installed according to best engineering
and construction-trade practices so as to ensure that the facilities will
function properly and will not deteriorate within an unreasonably short period
of time;
   (H)   To the extent that it is practicable, the drainage system of the
property under development will coordinate with and connect to the drainage
systems or drainage ways which are located on surrounding properties or under
adjacent streets; and
   (I)   All storm water control devices will meet a minimum design frequency
of ten years; except that, in the case of storm water control devices crossing
underneath streets the design frequencies shall be 25 years.
(Prior Code, § 52.05) (Ord. passed - -1997)
§ 154.06 REQUIREMENTS FOR ON-SITE STORM WATER CONTROL STRUCTURES.
   (A)   All storm water control devices shall be designed by a professional
registered with the state who has the necessary qualifications appropriate for
the type of device which is to be designed and/or constructed.
   (B)   Wherever possible, development should be punned and constructed in
such a way as to maintain the natural drainage of the property on which the
development is occurring.
   (C)   Where development is of a high density nature, such as in the case of
apartments, mobile home parks, planned unit developments (PUDs), shopping
centers (retail or wholesale outlet stores included), shopping malls, schools,
industrial parks or large industrial plants or, in cases where the total
impervious area to be constructed exceeds 30% of the total square area of the
entire parcel of property, detention ponds shall be the primary device used to
control storm water runoff. In cases where insufficient land is available to
construct a detention pond or other significant spatial or physical constraints
exist, sand filters, bioretention areas or other innovative types of storm
water control devices may be considered for approval by the town on a case-by-
case basis.
   (D)   Detention ponds shall be constructed so as hold an amount of water
equivalent to a ten-year frequency storm. All detention ponds, whether wet or
dry, shall be enclosed by a vegetative buffer of no less than ten feet in
width. Additionally, in cases where a dry detention pond is used for storm
water control, the pond must be enclosed by vegetation or fencing of no less
than six feet in height and of a thickness as to screen the pond from view and
prohibit unintended access to the pond.
   (E)   The first one inch of runoff from all impervious surfaces shall be
detained from reaching any watercourses through the use of vegetated areas
specifically designed and maintained for infiltration purposes. Vegetative
filters may be constructed of natural vegetation, grasses or artificially
planted wetland vegetation appropriate for the site characteristics. The slope,
width and length of the vegetative filters shall be calculated so as to provide
a non-erosive velocity of flow through the filter equivalent to a ten-year, 24-
hour storm.
   (F)   The slopes of detention ponds, swales, vegetative filters and other
similar storm water management devices shall be determined by BMP, but in no
case shall they be steeper than three to one (horizontal to vertical). Where
this is not practical due to physical constraints, check dams or other types of
devices may be required to slow the rate of runoff and encourage infiltration.
Slopes of storm water control devices shall be stabilized with vegetative cover
wherever possible.
   (G)   Stockpiles of materials having exposure to rain which could pose
potential pollution or health risks shall be kept covered or else stored in
such a manner as to minimize the risks. Protection measures may include using
flexible waterproof coverings or placing the materials under some form of
permanent or semi-permanent shelter.
   (H)   Upon completion of construction of a storm water control device or
facility, certification shall be provided by an authorized registered
professional that the materials and workmanship employed in the construction of
the device or facility meets or exceeds all requirements and standards set
forth in this subchapter or those of any other state or local ordinances which
may be apply.
(Prior Code, § 52.06) (Ord. passed - -1997)
§ 154.07 OFF-SITE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.
   In cases where adequate storm water management facilities cannot be located
on-site, but a suitable public storm water management facility is available
off-site which has or will have sufficient capacity to accommodated the storm
water runoff generated by the development, the property owner or developer
shall have the option to pay the town a fee comparable to the cost of
installing on-site facilities. Fees approved and accepted by the town for off-
site storm water management may be used by the town for land acquisition
(including easements and rights-of-way), as well as the study, engineering,
design, purchase, construction, expansion, repair, maintenance, landscaping
and/or inspection of public storm water management devices.
(Prior Code, § 52.07) (Ord. passed - -1997)
§ 154.08 LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIVATE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.
   Whenever an existing or future private on-site storm water management
facility is to serve the subject property, the following shall be provided to
the town prior to the issuance of any building or zoning permit.
   (A)   A written inspection and maintenance agreement in a form acceptable to
the Town Attorney and executed by the applicant and the owners of the facility,
if different than the applicant, which shall bind the parties thereto and all
subsequent owners, successors and assigns and provide for the following:
      (1)   If a party other than the applicant assumes primary responsibility
for the maintenance of the facility, the applicant shall guarantee the
maintenance of the facility and assume ultimate responsibility therefor;
      (2)   The town shall have access to the facility at reasonable times for
inspection by its agents or representatives;
      (3)   If a town order directing the correction, repair, replacement or
maintenance of the facility or of any portion thereof is not satisfactorily
complied with within a reasonable period of time, the town may, after
reasonable notice, enter the land and perform all necessary work to place the
facility in proper working condition and may assess the owner(s) of the subject
property with the cost of the work which cost shall be a lien on the property
and may be collected as provided in G.S. § 160A-193. The owners of all property
served by the facility shall be jointly and severally responsible to the town
for the maintenance of the facility and liable for any costs incurred by the
town pursuant to the agreement and all properties are jointly and severally
subject to the imposition of liens for the costs;
      (4)   The inspection and maintenance agreement shall be recorded in the
Register of Deeds office of the county at the expense of the applicant; and
      (5)   Any other provision as may be reasonably required by the Town
Attorney to achieve the purposes of this subchapter.
   (B)   When deemed appropriate by the Town Attorney, an easement shall be
prepared and submitted by the owners of the facility in a form approved by the
Town Attorney by which the town and its agents and representatives shall be
granted adequate and perpetual access to the facility and provided with
sufficient area for inspection and maintenance, if necessary. The easement
shall be filed in the Register of Deeds Office of the county, at the expense of
the applicant, and shall bind all subsequent owners and assigns of the facility
and of the property on which the facility is located.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01 AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has, in G.S. §§
143-215.56, and 153A-11, delegated the responsibility to local governmental
units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry. Therefor, the Council does ordain as follows.
(Prior Code, § 151.01)
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards,
disruptions of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or
otherwise protected from flood damages.
(Prior Code, § 151.02)
(Ord. passed 1-8-1987)
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see G.S. §§ 143-215.56 and 153A-11
§ 155.02 PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve the uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control fillings, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Prior Code, § 151.03)
   (B)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with

context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING BUILDING). Any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-
bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is
connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls is new construction.
   APPEAL. A request from a review of the local administrator’s interpretation
of any provisions of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.

elevated above the ground level by means to fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, pilings, columns (posts and piers), shear walls or breakaway walls.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from

Emergency Management Agency where the areas of special flood hazard have been
designated as Zone A.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). The Official Map of a community on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOR. The top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including
basement), such as top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood
flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of a
garage used solely for parking vehicles.

service facilities.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of the structure.
   LOWEST FLOOD. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided that, such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOMES. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also
includes park trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable structures
placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved
property.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. The average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It
is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the
floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with NATIONAL

manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank or other human-made facilities
or infrastructures.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. The cost of any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of
the structure, either before the improvement or repair is started or before the
damage occurred, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored. For
the purposes of this definition, SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur
when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code inspections which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or a state inventory of historic places.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this

or flood-proofing by whatever construction means, whichever is applicable, it
shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Building Inspector a
certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed elevation,
whichever is applicable, as built in relation to mean sea level. The
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When
flood-proofing is utilized for a particular building, the certification shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or
architect and certified by same. Any work done within the 21-day calendar
period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit
holder’s risk. The Building Inspector shall review the floor elevation survey
data submitted.
