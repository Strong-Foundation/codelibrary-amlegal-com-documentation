§ 52.078 DISCHARGE OF CERTAIN SUBSTANCES LIMITED.
   (A)   Applications for permits allowing groundwater reclamation discharges
will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and each case on a month-by-month
basis (see §
52.100), and accepted only after approval by the DEM and/or EPA and a finding
that the discharge will not have a detrimental effect on the POTW. If accepted,
the discharge shall be pretreated so as to comply with specific pollutant
limits as set out in the permit granted for that particular groundwater
reclamation discharge.
   (B)   The following described substances, materials, waters, or waste shall
be limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentrations or quantities
which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment process, or
equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or will not
otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. The
Public Utilities Director may set limitations lower than the limitations
established in the regulations below if, in his or her opinion, the more severe
limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming his or her
opinion as to the acceptability, the Public Utilities Director will give
consideration to the factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to
flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers,
the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater
treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or
characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer which
shall not be violated without approval of the Public Utilities Director are as
follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150°F (65°C);
      (2)   Wastewater containing more than twenty-five (25) milligrams per
liter of petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, or product of mineral
oil origin;
      (3)   Wastewater from industrial plants containing floatable oils, fat,
or grease;
      (4)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded (for definition of
such, see §
52.001). Garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes,
hotels, institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments, or
similar places where garbage originates from the preparation of food in
kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the premises or when served by
caterers;
      (5)   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and
similar objectionable or toxic substances to the degree that any such material
received in the composite wastewater at the wastewater treatment works exceeds
the limits established by the Public Utilities Director for the materials;
      (6)   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the Public Utilities Director;
      (7)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of the half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the Public Utilities Director
in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;
      (8)   Quantities of flow, concentrations, or both which constitute a slug
as defined herein;
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to the degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters; and
      (10)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.

§ 52.079 SEWER ALLOCATION POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the sewer allocation policy (Policy) is:
      (1)   To ensure that the City properly manages its sewer capacity
following the recent increase in capacity;
      (2)   To equitably allocate the sewer capacity among developments gaining
the necessary approvals under the City of Havelock's subdivision or zoning
process;
      (3)   To permit as much development as possible capacity while ensuring
protection of the environment; and
      (4)   To achieve a reasonable balance between residential and commercial
development.
   (B)   Determination of available sewer capacity. The amount of available
sewer capacity, measured in gallons per day (gpd), shall be established from
time to time by the City Manager upon the advice and recommendation of the City
Engineer. The City reserves the right to establish limitations and requirements
which are more stringent that those required by either state or federal
regulation. The City Manager shall re-confirm the amount of available capacity
remaining for residential development as of the date of Preliminary approval
and for commercial developments as of the date of zoning approval and such
determination shall be made part of the approved record.
   (C)   Implementation of policy. Havelock has implemented long-term solutions
provide additional sewer capacity to support future growth. This Policy
periodically shall be reviewed and amended as appropriate in response to
information provided annually by the City Engineer concerning wastewater flows.
This policy will extend from adoption of this ordinance amendment until such
time as the policy may be amended
   (D)   Balance between commercial and residential development. The City
Manager shall seek to achieve a general balance between commercial and
residential in allocating sewer capacity. Depending on the City Manager’s
determination of what type of development is in the best interest of the
citizens of Havelock, the City Manager may from time to time allocate a higher
percentage of sewer capacity to one type of development than the other.
   (E)   Allocation cap. No individual residential or commercial development
shall receive an allocation of more than fifty percent (50%) of any remaining
sewer capacity, as from time to time may be determined, except upon approval of
the Board.
   (F)   Priority for in-City developments. Developments obtaining preliminary
subdivision approval or zoning approval within the city shall be eligible for
allocations in accordance with the Policy. Developments outside the City that
have been accepted for annexation may be eligible for an allocation as part of
an annexation agreement.
   (G)   Allocations for residential development.
      (1)   Allocations for each eligible residential subdivision development
shall be based on the volume of sewer flow required by the development, as
presented in the respective developer's preliminary subdivision approval
application. If insufficient capacity is available to accommodate the entire
development or phase of development, the City Manager shall determine the
allocation based on the volume of sewer flow required by the development or
phase of development in relation to the total volume of sewer flow required by
all eligible residential developments.
      (2)   The term ELIGIBLE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT means any development
which received preliminary subdivision approval pursuant to
Chapter 158, Subdivision of Land, Code of Ordinances, City of Havelock and for
which the City has not made an allocation of sewer flow.
      (3)   City Manager determinations. The City Manager shall make a
determination as to:
         (a)   Eligible residential developments; and
         (b)   The amount of sewer allocation required to complete the entire
development or phase(s) of the development, as approved, relative to the amount
of capacity remaining as of the date of preliminary subdivision approval;
         (c)   The amount of sewer allocation granted to each eligible
residential development in accordance with this Policy.
      (4)   Priority of allocation requests. Allocations for eligible
residential developments shall be on a first come, first served basis according
to preliminary subdivision approval.
      (5)   Allocation allowed by development phases. Sewer capacity may be
allocated by phases of development if providing capacity for an entire eligible
residential development in a manner consistent with this Policy is not
practicable due to lack of capacity, equity with other eligible developments,
or other allocation considerations.
   (H)   Allocations for commercial development.
      (1)   The term ELIGIBLE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT means any commercial
development granted zoning approval under
Chapter 154, Zoning, Code of Ordinances, City of Havelock.
      (2)   City Manager determinations. The City Manager shall make a
determination as to:
         (a)   Eligible commercial developments; and
         (b)   The amount of sewer allocation required to serve the
development, as approved, relative to the amount of sewer capacity remaining as
of the date of zoning approval.
      (3)   Project-by-project basis. Allocations for all new commercial
development shall be made on a project-by-project basis by the City Manager.
The granting of an allocation may take into consideration the anticipated
importance of the proposed commercial development to the community and the
financial benefit to the City of such development. The amount of the allocation
shall be based on the projected volume of sewer flow required for the
development in relation to the amount of available sewer capacity.
   (I)   Ten percent (10%) of the available sewer flow (set aside flow), as may
be determined from time to time, is allocated to the City Planning Director who
is authorized to use his or her discretion to grant allocations from this set
aside flow, upon application, to individual/small contractor projects and for
other miscellaneous development needs, including commercial developments in
existing structures with a maximum projected volume of sewer flow of two
thousand (2,000) gallons per day. A maximum aggregate total of fifteen thousand
(15,000) gallons per day may be allocated for all uses under this authority.
   (J)   Time period for using allocations.
      (1)   Upon receipt pursuant hereto of an allocation, the respective
developer or property owner shall be subject to the following time periods for
using the allocation:
         (a)   One hundred and eighty (180) days from receipt of written
notification of an allocation to COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION, defined as
installation of footings for each building receiving a sewer allocation; and
         (b)   Three hundred and sixty-five (365) days from receipt of building
permit to submittal of a complete application for a certificate of occupancy.
      (2)   Any allocation declined in writing by or not meeting the above-
stated time periods automatically shall be forfeited, unless the applicable
time period is extended by the City Manager in his discretion for good cause
shown.
      (3)   An allocation may be suspended or cancelled by the City Manager in
his or her discretion, upon at least ten-days’ written notice to the developer
or property owner, if continuous construction is not maintained for the
development and may be reallocated to another property in accordance with this
Policy.
      (4)   The time period for using the allocation shall run from the date of
the initial allocation by the City.
   (K)   Sale/trading/transfer of allocations/taps prohibited. A sewer
allocation or sewer tap may be utilized only at and for the physical location
at which it is located or for which it is granted, and an allocation or tap may
not be sold, traded nor transferred for use at any other location without
approval by the Board of Commissioners.
   (L)   Active sewer taps.
      (1)   Active sewer taps are those in use with an active utility account
with the City on or after 8-27-2007. After that date, any property without an
active sewer tap must obtain a new sewer allocation, unless service is re-
activated pursuant to the hardship provision below. Any property owner or
occupant who fails to maintain an active sewer account for a property for a
continuous period of one hundred and eighty (180) days or more at any time
after 3-25-2013 shall be deemed to have an inactive tap for that property and
the property owner or occupant must obtain a new sewer allocation, unless
service is re-activated pursuant to the hardship provision below. Property with
an active utility account shall have an active sewer tap and shall be provided
utility service on either an open flow meter or closed flow meter billing rate
as from time to time requested by the property owner or occupant.
      (2)   The City Manager, in his or her discretion, may allow a property
owner or occupant to restore sewer service to an occupied property with an
inactive tap in hardship cases without having to apply for a new sewer
allocation. Hardship cases shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, an
extended absence from the property due to military deployment to other bases or
locations, full-time education at a location outside of the area, long-term
medical treatment or rehabilitation outside the area, or financial inability to
maintain service during an extended absence due to other unavoidable
circumstances.
      (3)   Except as herein otherwise provided, the sewer allocation for any
property without an active tap as prescribed by this provision shall be
forfeited and the property owner thereafter must apply for and receive a new
sewer allocation as a condition to the restoration of sewer service.
      (4)   Upon a determination that a property has an inactive tap as defined
above, the City shall have the right to remove or otherwise disconnect or
disable the tap to ensure that service cannot be used without a new allocation
being authorized.

WATER CONSERVATION
§ 52.130 PURPOSE AND INTENT; STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.
   It is the purpose and intent of this subchapter to assure that available
water resources are put to reasonable beneficial uses to avoid depletion of the
City water supply during a water shortage. This subchapter shall be liberally
construed to effectuate such purpose and intent.
(Ord. 07-O-07, passed 9-24-2007)
§ 52.131 WATER SHORTAGE DEFINED.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   WATER SHORTAGE. A WATER SHORTAGE shall be deemed to exist when the ordinary
demands and requirements of water customers served by the City cannot be
satisfied without depleting the water supply to or below the level at which the
continued availability of water for human consumption, sanitation and fire
protection is jeopardized.
(Ord. 07-O-07, passed 9-24-2007)
§ 52.132 PROCLAMATION OF WATER SHORTAGE.
    It shall be the duty of the City Manager to report to the Mayor and the
Board of Commissioners conditions that may lead to, or currently are creating,
a water shortage. Upon receiving such report, and upon determining that water
conservation measures are necessary to adequately address an imminent or
current water shortage, the Mayor may impose by proclamation any stage of water
conservation described herein. Except in the case of an emergency where prior
notice is impossible or impracticable, prior to the Mayor's initial
proclamation or subsequent additional proclamations the City Manager shall
notify the Board of Commissioners regarding the Mayor's decision to impose a
stage of water conservation. In response, the City Manager shall enact the
water shortage response provisions whenever the trigger conditions outlined in
Section IV of the City of Havelock's Water Shortage Response Plan are met. In
his or her absence, the Public Services Director will assume this role.
(Ord. 07-O-07, passed 9-24-2007; Ord. 19-O-03, passed 9-23-2019)
§ 52.133 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF SHORTAGE.
   (A)   Violation. In the event that the Mayor declares one or more stages of
water conservation as set forth herein, it shall be a violation of this
subchapter for any person to use or permit use of water supplied by the City in
violation of then in force mandatory restrictions.
   (B)   Enforcement. In addition to the penalties provided for in §
10.99 of the City's ordinances and North Carolina G.S. § 14-4 for violation of
this subchapter, each violator of this subchapter additionally shall be subject
to:
      (1)   Discontinuance of service. The City may discontinue water service
to any structure(s) or parcel(s) when the City Manager gives at least twenty-
four-hours’ (24) written notice of any violation of mandatory restrictions and
intent to discontinue service. When service is discontinued pursuant to the
provisions of this section, service shall not be reinstated until the City
Manager determines that the violator will no longer violate the mandatory
restrictions or the mandatory restrictions have been rescinded.
      (2)   Equitable relief. The provisions of this subchapter may be enforced
by an appropriate remedy, including a mandatory or prohibitory injunction,
issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (C)   Penalty not a substitute remedy. The imposition of one or more
penalties for any violation shall not excuse any violation or permit it to
continue.
(Ord. 07-O-07, passed 9-24-2007)
§ 52.134 RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO VARIOUS STAGES OF WATER SHORTAGE.
   (A)   Stage I voluntary reductions. In the event the City Manager determines
that a water shortage is imminent, the Mayor may proclaim that a Stage I Water
Shortage exists. The City Manager shall recommend that residential and
commercial users voluntarily reduce water consumption 5% in comparison to their
previous month's bill. Customer education will encourage water conservation and
efficiency measures by following conservation measures such-as, but not limited
to:
      (1)   Irrigating yards, a maximum of once per week between 8:00 p.m. and
8:00 a.m.
      (2)   Limit car washing to minimum and no more than two times per month.
      (3)   Preventing water waste, runoff and watering of impervious surfaces.
      (4)   Do not leave faucets running while shaving or rinsing dishes.
      (5)   Operate clothes washers and dishwashers only when fully loaded.
      (6)   Use showers for bathing, rather than bathtub, and limit showers to
no more than four minutes.
      (7)   Use disposable and biodegradable dishes.
      (8)   Limit hours of operation of water-cooled air conditioners.
      (9)   Delay new landscape work until the water shortage has ended.
      (10)   Use spring loaded nozzles on garden hoses.
      (11)   Identify and repair all water leaks.
   (B)   Stage II mandatory reductions. In the event that the City Manager
determines that a water shortage is occurring, the Mayor may declare by
proclamation that a Stage II Water Shortage exists. All customers are expected
to reduce their water use by 10% in comparison to their previous month's water
bill. In addition to continuing to encourage all voluntary reduction actions,
the following restrictions apply and it shall be unlawful to:
      (1)   Water lawns, grass, shrubbery, trees, flowers and vegetable gardens
except in accordance with this subchapter. Irrigating is limited to once every
two weeks between 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.
      (2)   Fill or refill empty swimming pools, wadding pools, fountains, or
outdoor ornamental structures that use standing or running water. Upon written
request, an exception may be granted by the City Manager for an ornamental
fountain, pool, pond or other similar structure using water if the City Manager
determines that continuing flow of such does not draw water from the city's
water system.
      (3)   Wash any motor vehicle or other type of mobile equipment for any
noncommercial purpose.
      (4)   Wash outside areas; including sidewalks, patios or driveways.
      (5)   Use water from public or private fire hydrants for any purpose
other than fire suppression or other public emergency.

establishments except upon request.
      (7)   Operate water-cooled air conditioners or other equipment that does
not recycle cooling water except when health and safety are adversely affected.
      (8)   Use water for any unnecessary purpose or to intentionally waste
water.
   (C)   Stage III mandatory reductions II. In the event that the City Manager
determines that a water shortage is occurring and that Stage II mandatory
reduction measures are inadequate, the mayor may declare by proclamation that a
Stage III mandatory reductions II exists. Customers must continue actions from
all previous stages and further reduce water use by 20% compared to their
previous month's water bill. All non-essential uses of drinking water are
banned; and garden and landscape irrigations must be reduced to the minimum
amount necessary for plant survival. Additionally, in Stage III, a drought
surcharge of 1.5 times the per gallon billed water rate applies.
   (D)   Stage IV emergency reductions. Customers must continue actions from
all previous stages and further reduce water use by 25% compared to their
previous month's water bill. A ban on use of drinking water except to protect
public health and safety is implemented where possible, firefighting equipment
shall use raw water and drought surcharges increase to two times the per gallon
billed water rate .
   (E)   Stage V water rationing. The goal is to provide drinking water to
protect public health (e.g. residences, residential health care facilities). In
Stage V, all customers are only permitted to use water at the minimum required
for public health protection. Firefighting is the only allowable outdoor water
use and pickup for distributing potable water will be announced according to
the City of Havelock's Emergency Response Plan. Drought surcharges increase to
2.5 times the per gallon billed water rate.
   *Note: All water use reductions are cumulative and are in comparison to the
previous month's water bill (or first full month water bill for a new account)
based on the date of the Mayor's most recent proclamation. The manager is
hereby authorized to prepare a Water Shortage Response Plan - City Policy
adopted by the Board of Commissioners to implement these water conservation
measures, to further define and give examples of the various classes of water
use, to prepare a mandatory water rationing policy and plan, and to provide
such other conditions and provisions as may be necessary to successfully carry
out the goals of this section.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 53.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter shall be officially known as "The Neuse River Basin
Stormwater Ordinance for New Development." It is referred to herein as "this
chapter." The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum requirements,
procedures and standards to control the adverse effects of nitrogen in
stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new
development in the watershed of the Neuse River Basin estuary. It has been
determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will
protect water quality and aquatic resources; safeguard the public health,
safety, and general welfare of the community; minimize damage to public and
private property and infrastructure; and satisfy 15A NCAC 2B.0700-Nutrient
Management Strategy Rules for Surface Water, sections 2B.0701 through 2B.0711
Neuse Nutrient Strategy for Stormwater.
   (B)   This chapter seeks to meet its general purpose through the following
specific objectives and means:
      (1)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that
protects the integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water
resources;
      (2)   Requiring that new development not exceed export targets for
nitrogen in stormwater runoff for the watershed through site layout, engineered
stormwater controls, or permanent nutrient offset credits;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function, and use of engineered stormwater controls that may be used to meet
the minimum post development stormwater management standards;
      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices,
such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of
greenspace, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent
practicable;
      (6)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of engineered stormwater controls to ensure that they continue to
function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to
public safety;
      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
and approval and disapproval of site plans, for the inspection of approved
projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance;
      (8)   Controlling illicit discharges into the stormwater system and
waters of the State;
      (9)   Providing education and outreach to the public regarding methods to
prevent and minimize pollutant contributions to the stormwater system and
waters of the State;
      (10)   Requiring that new development maintain the pre-development
hydrologic response in their post-development state for the applicable design
storm to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint and point source
pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of
stream channels and aquatic habitats.
§ 53.02 AUTHORITY.
   The Board of Commissioners of the City of Havelock is authorized to adopt
this chapter pursuant to North Carolina law, including but not limited to
Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; City of Havelock
municipal charter; N.C.G.S. § 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the
Environmental Management Commission thereunder; § 143-215.6A; §§ 160A-174 and
160A-185, and Chapter 160D.
(Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 53.03 FINDINGS.
   It is hereby determined that:
   (A)   Development alters the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, non-point and point source pollution, and sediment transport
and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
   (B)   These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities
of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to
public health and safety as well as to the natural environment;
   (C)   These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design
and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites;
   (D)   Further, the Commission has identified the Neuse River Basin Estuary,
as nutrient sensitive waters; has identified all or a portion of the estuary as
impaired waters under the federal Clean Water Act due to exceedances of the
chlorophyll a standard; and has promulgated rules (the "Neuse River Basin
Rules") to reduce the average annual loads of nitrogen delivered to the estuary
from all point and nonpoint sources of these nutrients located within its
watershed, including stormwater from new development in this jurisdiction; and
   (E)   Therefore, the Board of Commissioners establishes this set of water
quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal
law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge for development.

reduce stormwater runoff velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to
approximate the pre-development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve
any combination of these goals. Engineered stormwater control includes physical
practices such as constructed wetlands, vegetative practices, vegetated
conveyances, filter strips, grassed swales, and other methods installed or
created on real property. "Engineered stormwater control" is synonymous with
"structural practice," "Primary SCM", "stormwater control facility,"
"stormwater control practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater
management practice," "stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater
treatment systems," and similar terms used in this chapter. It is a broad term
that may include practices that do not require design by a professionally
licensed engineer.
   EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT (ERU). The total impervious area of a typical
single-family residential property, which is determined as the median
impervious area of a representative sample, as determined by the city, of all

following criteria:
      (1)   Expenditures or incurred contractual obligations substantial in
amount, incidental to or as part of the acquisition of a building site or the
construction or equipment of a proposed building, where the obligations and/or
expenditures are incurred in good faith and are made in reasonable reliance on
and after the issuance of a valid building permit authorizing the requested
use; or
      (2)   Having an approved site specific or phased development plan in
compliance with N.C.G.S. § 160D-108.1.
   For projects that require a state permit, such as landfills, National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System wastewater discharges, land application
of residuals, and road construction activities, EXISTING DEVELOPMENT means
those projects that are built or those projects for which a state permit was
issued prior to the date of adoption of this chapter.

STORMWATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY
§ 53.15 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   This chapter identifies procedures and standards that shall apply to
development activities in addition to any other local, state, or federal
requirements. The intent of this chapter is to establish standards and
procedures to satisfy 15A NCAC 2B.0700 - Nutrient Management Strategy Rules for
Surface Water, sections 2B.0701 Nutrient Strategies Definitions through 2B.0711
Neuse Nutrient Strategy: Stormwater.
   (B)   All projects to which this chapter applies shall comply with the
standards of this section. The approval of the site plans and land clearing
permit shall require an enforceable restriction or protective covenants, to
ensure that future development and expansion of development maintains the site
consistent with the approved project plans for built upon area and engineered
stormwater controls.
(1989 Code, § 17-4) (Ord. 01-02, passed 4-23-2001; Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-
2023)
§ 53.16 NITROGEN LOADING RATE TARGETS.
   The purpose of the requirements in this section is to reduce the nitrogen
loads from stormwater runoff within the Neuse River Basin, by implementing the
Neuse Nutrient Strategy as defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0700 through .0711. The
Neuse stormwater rules apply in all areas draining to nutrient sensitive waters
within the basin, and to all surface waters within the city and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction.
   (A)   Proposed development projects that would replace or expand existing
structures and result in a net increase in built-upon area shall meet one of
two options for the project less any existing built-upon area. The project
shall meet either:
      (1)   A nitrogen stormwater loading rate target of 3.6 pounds per acre
per year (lb/ac/yr) for the Neuse River Basin; or
      (2)   Meet "runoff volume match" as defined in this chapter.
   (B)   The developer shall determine the nitrogen load and loading rate
generated from the project area without engineered stormwater controls and
determine the needed nitrogen load reduction to meet nutrient targets by using
the approved accounting tool.
   (C)   The nitrogen loading standards in this chapter are supplemental to,
not replacements for, stormwater standards otherwise required by federal, state
or local law, including without limitation any riparian buffer requirements.

§ 53.17 BUILT UPON AREA STANDARDS.
   (A)   Project density is used for determining stormwater requirements. The
project area used for nutrient calculation and stormwater requirements includes
the site area less any existing built-upon area (BUA). The project density is
the amount of built-upon area subject to this chapter at project completion
divided by the project area. Project density shall be calculated according to
15A NCAC 2H.1003(1) and as indicated in the Design Manual.
   (B)   A project is categorized as either high density or low density based
on the percent BUA, and the density treatment threshold varies depending upon
the project's location and proximity to SA waters, which are classified as
tidal, salt waters with designated use of shellfishing (15A NCAC 02B.0221). SA
waters are more sensitive and are subject to higher standards.

   (C)   The city is subject to the Coastal Counties Rule, as set forth in 15A
NCAC 02H.1019. The Coastal Rule applies to projects that meet one of the
following criteria:
      (1)   Nonresidential projects that propose to cumulatively add 10,000
square feet or more of built-upon area; or
      (2)   Residential projects that are within 1/2 mile of and draining to SA
waters, and propose to cumulatively add more than 10,000 square feet of built-
upon area, and result in a percentage built-upon area greater than 12% (high-
density).
   (D)   All other projects not meeting the criteria in division (C) will meet
the minimum standards described in 15A NCAC 02H.1003.
(Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 53.18 METHODS TO MEET NUTRIENT CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Projects subject to this chapter shall meet nitrogen loading targets
through a combination of the following methods:
      (1)   Any combination of engineered stormwater controls treating runoff
on the site;
      (2)   In an approved offsite regional engineered stormwater control; or
      (3)   Through the acquisition of permanent nutrient offset credits.
   (B)   The developer shall calculate the nitrogen reduction provided by these
controls using the approved accounting tool.
   (C)   Proposed development projects may utilize an offsite regional
engineered stormwater control, dedicated to treating an area encompassing the
project, provided the engineered stormwater control is designed to meet all
applicable requirements.
   (D)   Where a project does not meet the nitrogen target loading rate, the
developer may meet nitrogen reduction needs for the project through the use of
permanent nutrient offset credits. A project with less than 24% BUA may meet
nutrient rate targets entirely by nutrient offset credits but must also meet
low density stormwater requirements set forth in 15A NCAC 02H.1003.
   (E)   Proposed development undertaken by a local government solely as a
public road expansion or public sidewalk project, or proposed development
subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board, may meet
nitrogen reduction needs for the project entirely through the use of permanent
nutrient offset credits pursuant to the Nutrient Offset Credit Trading Rule,
15A NCAC 02B.0703.
(Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 53.19 CONTROL AND TREATMENT OF RUNOFF VOLUME.
   (A)   The requirement for runoff volume match serves to control and treat
the runoff volume generated from the built-upon area, and helps to maintain the
predevelopment hydrology of the project site. Within the Coastal Counties, the
definition of runoff volume match depends upon the project location:
      (1)   For projects that drain to SA waters, runoff volume match means the
annual runoff volume after development shall not be more than 5% higher than
the annual runoff before development.
      (2)   For projects that drain to other Coastal County waters, runoff
volume match means the annual runoff volume after development shall not be more
than 10% higher than the annual runoff before development.
   (B)   Within the Coastal Counties, the design storm used to determine the
runoff volume also depends upon the project location:
      (1)   For projects that drain to SA waters, the design storm is the one-
year, 24-hour storm.
      (2)   For projects that drain to other Coastal County waters, the design
storm depth is 1.5 inches.
   (C)   Projects meeting the definition of runoff volume match do not need to
further address nutrient export or treatment.
   (D)   All projects shall meet the stormwater system minimum design
requirements set forth in 15A NCAC 02H.1003. All engineered stormwater controls
will meet the standards set in the Design Manual and the State's Minimum Design
Criteria, 15A NCAC 02H.1050 through .1062.
   (E)   All project designs shall incorporate vegetated setbacks, dispersed
flow, vegetated conveyances and curb outlet systems.
   (F)   High-density projects shall be designed to control and treat the
volume of runoff generated from all built-upon area in one or more Primary
SCMs, using the appropriate design storm based on the project location and
receiving water. High- density projects that drain to SA waters are subject to
more stringent standards as indicated in the Design Manual.
   (G)   Low-density projects are not required to be equipped with engineered
stormwater controls in exchange for limiting the built-upon area, maximizing
dispersed flow and ensuring that stormwater conveyances are vegetated.
(Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 53.20 USE OF PERMANENT NUTRIENT OFFSET CREDITS.
   (A)   Permanent nutrient offset credits allowed by this chapter can be
acquired pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 143-214.26 and shall meet the requirements of
the Nutrient Offset Credit Trading Rule, 15A NCAC 02B.0703. Nutrient offset
credits are obtained in units of pounds per year of nitrogen for the Neuse
River Basin.
   (B)   Sufficient permanent nutrient offset credits to meet project nutrient
reduction needs not provided by engineered stormwater controls serving the
project shall be acquired prior to approval of the development plan. The
developer shall provide proof of credit acquisition to the city as part of the
site plan submittal. The city shall issue an approval letter for the
development that documents the needed nitrogen credits and where the
development is located relative to the Neuse River Basin Rules' geographic
requirements.
   (C)   A developer subject to this chapter may acquire permanent nutrient
offset credits through one of the following methods:
   
      (1)   Through a private nutrient bank;
      (2)   Through offsite offset provided by the developer and approved by
the city;
      (3)   Through payment into the State of North Carolina Riparian Buffer
Restoration Fund established in N.C.G.S. § 143-214.21 and managed by the
Division of Water Resources (Division).
   (D)   Excess permanent nutrient offset credits acquired beyond what is
required for the development may not be applied to any other development.
   (E)   Credits may only be acquired from an offset project located within the
same hydrologic area as the proposed development.
(Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 53.21 RECORDING OF BMPs.
   (A)   A legal description of the area containing any engineered stormwater
control(s) shall be prepared and filed as a separate deed with the Craven
County Register of Deeds within 30 business days of completion of the
engineered stormwater control(s), along with any easements necessary for
general access to the engineered stormwater control(s). The deeded area shall
include sufficient area to perform inspections, maintenance, repairs, and
reconstruction of the engineered stormwater control(s). The deeded area shall
include, but is not limited to, detention ponds, vegetative filters, all pipes
and water control structures, berms, and dikes. For those measures where
stormwater temporarily or permanently ponds, any easement shall be located
outside of the anticipated 100-year flood elevation. Any engineered stormwater
control must be located either on the same property on which the development
activity occurs or on an adjoining property with a recorded engineered
stormwater control easement of the owner of the adjoining property.
   (B)   Deed recordation and indications on plat. The applicable Operations
and Maintenance Agreement pertaining to every engineered stormwater control
shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county
Register of Deeds upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat is recorded
for the site, then the Operations and Maintenance Agreement shall be recorded
with the County Register of Deeds so as to appear in the chain of title of all
subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching principles.

§ 53.52 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.
   (A)   Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be
served by engineered stormwater controls pursuant to this chapter, and prior to
issuance of any permit for development requiring engineered stormwater controls
pursuant to this chapter, the applicant or owner of the site must enter into an
Operation and Maintenance Agreement (O&M Agreement) with the City of Havelock.
   (B)   The O&M Agreement shall require the applicant or owner to maintain,
repair, or reconstruct the engineered stormwater controls in accordance with
the approved design plans and the Operation and Maintenance Plan. The O&M
Agreement shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site, portions of
the site, and lots, or parcels served by the engineered stormwater control.
Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served by the engineered
stormwater control, the original owner or applicant shall have primary
responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the O&M Agreement.
   (C)   The O&M Agreement shall grant to the City a right of entry in the
event that the City has reason to believe it has become necessary to inspect,
monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the engineered stormwater control;
however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation
on the City to assume responsibility for the engineered stormwater controls.
   (D)   The O&M Agreement must be approved by the City prior to development
plan approval, and it shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be
recorded with the county Register of Deeds upon final plat approval. A copy of

§ 53.53 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HOMEOWNERS’ AND OTHER ASSOCIATIONS.
   (A)   For all engineered stormwater controls required pursuant to this
chapter and that are to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowners'
association, property owners' association, or similar entity, the required O&M
Agreement shall include all of the following provisions:
      (1)   Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and
maintain the engineered stormwater controls according to the specifications
laid out in the Operation and Maintenance Plan.
      (2)   Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for
sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major
repair, or reconstruction of the engineered stormwater controls. If engineered
stormwater controls are not performing adequately or as intended or are not
properly maintained, the City in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation,
and in such instances the City shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow
account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment removal,
structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and
reconstruction of the engineered stormwater controls, provided that the City
shall first consent to the expenditure.
      (3)   Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the
escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits,
whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an
amount equal to 15% of the initial construction cost of the engineered
stormwater controls. Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget
shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five years and the
full amount shall be deposited within ten years following initial construction
of the engineered stormwater controls. Funds shall be deposited each year into
the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association
shall include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from
the escrow account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of
anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget.
      (4)   The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund
the escrow account may be varied by the City depending on the design and
materials of the engineered stormwater controls.
      (5)   Granting to the City a right of entry to inspect, monitor,
maintain, repair, and reconstruct engineered stormwater controls.
      (6)   Allowing the City to recover from the association and its members
any and all costs the City expends to maintain or repair the engineered
stormwater controls or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay
the City all of its expended costs, after 45 days written notice, shall
constitute a breach of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, the City shall
thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and its
members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement
against the property, or both. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees
shall be added to the recovery.
      (7)   A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the City to
maintain or repair any engineered stormwater controls, and the City shall not
be liable to any person for the condition or operation of engineered stormwater
controls.
      (8)   A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish,
limit, or restrict the right of the City to enforce any of its chapters as
authorized by law.
      (9)   A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the City for any
costs and injuries arising from or related to the engineered stormwater
controls, unless the City has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance
responsibility for the engineered stormwater controls and has accepted
dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out that maintenance.

§ 53.54 STANDARDS FOR DETENTION PONDS.
   (A)   Generally. It is the intent of this section to provide fencing
standards for all stormwater detention ponds required by the State of North
Carolina in an effort to mitigate any safety and aesthetic issues they may
present. The enforcement of these standards will be through the City's zoning
and general police powers.
   (B)   Fencing required. Fencing shall be provided around the perimeter of
all stormwater detention ponds located within the corporate limits and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction. The required fence shall be no less than four
feet in height. It shall be a steel or aluminum chain link fence with black or
green vinyl coating. All fences shall provide securable entrances to allow
access for maintenance personnel and equipment, and to provide for the safety
of citizens.
   (C)   Applicability to existing detention ponds. The existence of detention
ponds within the corporate limits that do not provide for adequate fencing
surrounding the ponds presents a threat to the safety of the City's citizens.
Therefore, all detention ponds located within the corporate limits existing at
the time of adoption of this section shall, within one year after the effective
date of this subchapter, be altered to comply with the provisions of this
section.

   (B)   Inspections and inspection programs by the City may be conducted or
established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to routine
inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other
notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are
not limited to, reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges,
surface water, groundwater, and material or water in the engineered stormwater
controls; and evaluating the condition of engineered stormwater controls.
   (C)   If the owner or occupant of any property refuses to permit such
inspection, the City shall proceed to obtain an administrative search warrant
pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 15-27.2 or its successor. No person shall obstruct,
hamper or interfere with the City inspector while carrying out his or her
official duties.
(Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 53.56 RECORDS OF INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.

STORMWATER UTILITY AND FEES
§ 53.65 AUTHORITY.
   Pursuant to N.C.G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 16, the City of Havelock is authorized
to create a stormwater utility and establish a schedule of stormwater fees for
property in the city limits.
(Ord. 23-O-11, passed 10-23-2023)
§ 53.66 STORMWATER UTILITY.
   A stormwater utility is hereby established to provide stormwater management
services, as authorized by state law. Stormwater service charges will be
determined and modified from time to time so that the total revenues generated
by said charges will be used to pay the principal of and interest on the debt
incurred for stormwater purposes and such expenses as are reasonably necessary
or convenient, in the planning, public education, construction, operation, and
maintenance of the stormwater system.
(Ord. 23-O-11, passed 10-23-2023)
§ 53.67 SERVICE CHARGES, RATES AND FEE SCHEDULE.
   (A)   Stormwater utility service fees shall accrue on the date determined by
the Board of Commissioners and set forth in the City's fee schedule. Stormwater
service charges shall apply to all property within the City limits that is
served by the City's stormwater system without regard to ownership. Such
charges shall be based on the amount of impervious surface on each parcel as
determined by the equivalent residential unit standard.
   (B)   Stormwater utility service fees shall be based on a commonly accepted
rate unit for stormwater utilities, the equivalent residential unit (ERU). The
ERU is used to relate a base rate fee charged to a single-family residential
property to that charged to a non-single-family residential property. The
City's ERU is two thousand three hundred (2,300) square feet of impervious
surface area. The ERU is determined by analyzing digital photographs and, for
verification purposes, performing field checks of a representative sample of
single-family residences within the city limits.
      (1)   All single-family and multi-family residential units will be
charged one ERU per month.
      (2)   All commercial/non-residential properties will be charged based on
total square footage of impervious surface per month.
(Ord. 23-O-11, passed 10-23-2023)
§ 53.68 EXEMPTIONS AND CREDITS.
   No developed property shall be exempt from stormwater service charges or
receive a credit against such charges.
(Ord. 23-O-11, passed 10-23-2023)
§ 53.69 BILLING METHOD; RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.
   (A)   Bills for stormwater service fees shall be sent at regular, periodic
intervals. Stormwater service fees may be billed on a combined utility bill
that also contains charges for water, sewer and/or solid waste. Stormwater
service fees that are shown on a combined utility bill may be for a different
service period than that used for water, sewer and/or solid waste service. For
properties not having otherwise active utility accounts, the fee for only
stormwater utility service accounts may be billed to the owners or other
persons listed on the real property tax records. These accounts may be billed
at different intervals than the accounts receiving combined utility billings.
   (B)   As the general rule, stormwater utility bills for a property that
receives other city-provided utilities shall be sent to the customer receiving
such service. Billing for parcels or groups of adjacent and associated parcels
with multiple utility accounts may be done as a separate bill to each account,
with the impervious area allocated among the accounts. Where this allocation
results in an amount of impervious area allocable to a given account that is
similar to that for a single-family residential property, the account will be
billed the same way as a single-family residential property.
   (C)   Stormwater fees are due and payable simultaneously with any other fees
included on the bill, including fees for solid waste, sewer and water. Payments
on such bills are applied first to stormwater fees, second to solid waste fees,
third to sewer fees and last to water fees.
(Ord. 23-O-11, passed 10-23-2023)
§ 53.70 BACK BILLING.
   Failure to receive a stormwater utility service fee bill is not
justification for nonpayment. The owner of each parcel of land shall be
ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no
bill is sent, the City may back bill for up to three years.
(Ord. 23-O-11, passed 10-23-2023)
§ 53.71 COMPLAINTS REGARDING A BILL.
   (A)   A customer having a grievance or complaint regarding a bill must file
written notice with the city's finance office. If it is determined that the
bill is in error, an adjustment will be made according to the City's fee
schedule.
   (B)   No adjustment will be made for more than a three-year period per
N.C.G.S. § 1-52.
(Ord. 23-O-11, passed 10-23-2023)
§ 53.72 APPEAL.
   Any customer who believes the provisions of this subchapter have been

§ 55.01 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The City hereby authorizes the reimbursement of certain negotiated
municipal infrastructure costs incurred by a developer or property owner. The
reimbursement shall be governed by a municipal infrastructure reimbursement
agreement negotiated by the City Manager or designee. All municipal
infrastructure reimbursement agreements in excess of three hundred thousand
dollars ($300,000) shall be approved by the Board of Commissioners. Additional
authority for such agreements may exist elsewhere, and this chapter is
supplementary to such authority. This chapter is authorized by G.S. § 160A-499.
(Ord. 10-O-06, passed 6-28-2010)
§ 55.02 MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   The City Manager, or designee, is authorized to negotiate municipal
infrastructure reimbursement agreements with private developers and property
owners in accordance with this chapter, G.S. § 160A-499, and applicable
policies and procedures. Reimbursements may be paid from any lawful source. The
municipal infrastructure reimbursement agreement shall be available only for
design and construction of municipal infrastructure that is included in the
City's Capital Improvement Plan and serves the developer or property owner. For
the purpose of this chapter, MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE includes, without
limitation, water mains, sanitary sewer lines, lift stations, stormwater lines,
streets, curb and gutter, sidewalks, traffic control devices, and other
associated facilities. As part of the municipal infrastructure reimbursement
agreement, the City may exempt the developer or property owner from the City's
normal procurement policies and the requirements of G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 8 only
if the developer or property owner agrees to follow the public advertising and
bid opening requirements of G.S. § 143-129(b) which would be applicable if the
construction contract had been awarded by the City. Any developer or property
owner that fails to properly follow the public advertising and bid opening
practices required by this chapter shall be in material breach of the municipal
infrastructure reimbursement agreement, and such developer or property owner
shall not receive any reimbursement. This chapter does not limit the City
Manager or the Board of Commissioners from negotiating the placement of
additional obligations on the developer or property owner, including, without
limitation, additional procurement practices set forth in G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 8.
(Ord. 10-O-06, passed 6-28-2010)
§ 55.03 REIMBURSEMENT PROCEDURES.
   The municipal infrastructure reimbursement agreement shall set forth a
description of the infrastructure that is subject to reimbursement, the amount
of reimbursement for which the developer is eligible, and the schedule for
reimbursement. The City shall maintain an account showing the amount of
reimbursement payments made to the developer and shall make such records
available to the developer at any time during normal business hours. No
reimbursements shall be made unless and until the developer submits a claim for
reimbursement and the City approves the claim as being in accordance with the
municipal infrastructure reimbursement agreement. The developer may submit a
single claim at the completion of construction of the infrastructure
improvements. In no event shall reimbursement exceed the capital cost of the
infrastructure project, except that other, non-capital costs of the project may
be reimbursed as specified in the municipal infrastructure reimbursement
agreement.

heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Commissioners,
and further proceeding to remove the vehicle shall be stayed until the appeal
is heard and decided.
      (3)   A nuisance vehicle may be removed without giving the minimum seven-

registered owner of the vehicle and to notify him or her of the information set
forth in division (C)(1) above.
   (D)   Right to probable cause hearing before sale or final disposition of
vehicle. After removal of a vehicle declared to be a nuisance vehicle, the
owner or other person entitled to possession may request in writing a hearing
to determine if probable cause existed for removing the vehicle. The request
must be filed with the magistrate in the county where the vehicle was towed.
The magistrate will set the hearing within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of
the request, and the hearing will be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of G.S. § 20-219.11.

      (1)   With the consent of the owner, the City may dispose of any vehicle
as a junked motor vehicle without holding it for any prescribed period of time.

be held for a period of at least fifteen (15) days. The owner of any such
vehicle may claim his or her vehicle during the fifteen-day (15) retention
period by exhibiting proof of ownership to the City and by paying all

in that order, have been deducted therefrom, shall be held by the City for
thirty (30) days and paid to the owner upon demand. If the owner does not

      (3)   Secure enclosure within thirty (30) days. A dangerous animal may
only be outside unattended if it is housed in a “secure enclosure.” The secure
enclosure must be padlocked, with a concrete bottom, so constructed as to
prevent the animal from escaping under the fence and with a secure wire top, so
as to preclude the animal from escaping over the top of the fence. The fencing
will be kept in good repair at all times to prevent the escape of the animal.
The structure must be at least eight (8) feet in height and at least ten (10)
feet in width and ten (10) feet in length, or a square or rectangle shape

or debris in a location available to the animal.
         (b)   An animal house, sufficiently sized to accommodate the animal
will be available at all times to the animal to protect it from the elements of
nature. Said shelter will be kept in good repair and kept in a clean manner.
         (c)   The property will be posted with clearly visible warning signs
adequate to inform the public, including children, of the presence of a
dangerous animal and placed on the property as designated by the appropriate
city authority including, but not limited to, the pen and curtilage.
      (4)   The dangerous animal must be microchipped within thirty (30) days
after any determination or decision that the animal is dangerous, which
determination or decision either is not appealed within the period provided or
is not subject to further appeal.
      (5)   Fee. A fee of $250 must be paid to the City within thirty (30) days
of either the owner or keeper agreeing to the designation of dangerous or the
determination of the designation from the hearing entity.
         (a)   Animals that fall under part (3) of the definition of dangerous
animal, but do not fall under part (1), (2), or (4) are not subject to the fee.
      (6)   Permit fee. Owners of dangerous animals will be assessed a prorated
annual fee of $100.00 payable at the beginning of the fiscal year to be
retained by the City authority responsible for the oversight of this chapter.
These fees are in addition to any fee or liability insurance so required for
dangerous animals.
         (a)   Fees are to be paid at the time the owner or keeper has agreed
to the designation or the hearing entity has determined the designation applies
to the animal. The fees are renewable each year thereafter at the onset of the
fiscal year for the City.
         (b)   The permit fee is in addition to any other licensing,
registration, taxing or other costs assessed by any local government agency in
regulating or permitting animals.
      (7)   Status and transfer of ownership. No animal declared dangerous will
be released from that designation. The status of dangerous will stay with the
animal for its life. Animals declared dangerous may be given away, sold, traded
or placed for adoption outside the city limits of Havelock only under the
following guidelines:
         (a)   Current owner must request permission for transfer in writing to
the Havelock Animal Control Office.
         (b)   Upon approval, the animal control officer must contact the
animal control office where the animal is requested to be transferred, notify
that office of the status of dangerous, and obtain a written letter of
acceptance of the animal by that office.
         (c)   If the receiving animal control office is unwilling to accept
the animal or sign the letter of acceptance, the animal will not be allowed to
be given away, sold, traded or placed for adoption.
         (d)   If the receiving animal control office signs the letter of
acceptance, the transferring owner will be required to pay a $200 cash bond,
which will be returned after three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date
of transfer; however, such bond may be returned to the owner prior to the
expiration of the three hundred sixty-five (365) day period upon application by
the owner providing evidence satisfactory to the City Manager or his/her
designee that the residence of the owner is not within the city limits.
         (e)   If the transferring owner desires to reclaim ownership of the
animal and return it to the City, he/she will be required to obtain permission
from the City’s Animal Control Office prior to its return.
         (f)   If approval is granted to return an animal previously declared
dangerous, the owner must immediately comply with all requirements associated
with the policy on animals declared dangerous. The owner will be eligible to
receive his/her previously paid $200 cash bond upon request and after the
approved return of the animal.
         (g)   If an animal previously declared dangerous is returned to the
City without approval by the City’s Animal Control Office, the transferring
owner will be required to pay all associated fees and payments dating back to
the original date of transfer. In addition, if the owner is not in compliance
with all associated requirements with the policy on animals declared dangerous,
the animal will be humanely destroyed by City authority.
   (B)   Notice. Upon determination by a police officer or other authorized
representative of the City that the owner of an animal is in violation of this

§ 93.02 TERMINOLOGY.
   All terminology used in this section not defined below shall be in
conformance with applicable publications of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) or its successor body.
   A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL. The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on
a sound level meter using the A-frequency-weighted network and slow meter
response setting. The level so read is designated dB.
   DECIBEL (dB). A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to twenty
(20) times the base of the logarithm to the base of the ratio for the pressure
of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is twenty (20)
micronewtons per square meter.
   EMERGENCY WORK. Any work performed for the purposes of maintaining public
safety, preventing or alleviating physical trauma or property damage threatened
or caused by an existing or imminent peril.
   OUTDOOR AMPLIFIED SOUND. Any sound using amplifying equipment whose sound is
outside or whose source is inside and the sound propagates to outside through
the structure.
   PLAINLY AUDIBLE. Able to be detected by a person using his or her unaided
hearing faculties. As an example, if the sound source under investigation is a
portable or personal vehicular sound amplification or reproduction device, the
detection of the rhythmic bass component of the music is sufficient to verify
plainly audible sound. The officer need not determine the title, specific
words, or the artist performing the song.
   SOUND-AMPLIFYING EQUIPMENT. Any device for the amplification of the human
voice, music, or any other sound, including, but not limited to, jukeboxes,
stereos, and radios.
   SOUND LEVEL. The weighted sound pressure level obtained by the use of a
sound level meter and frequency weighted network, such as A, B, or C as
specified ANSI S1.4-1971. If the frequency weighting employed is not indicated,
the A-weighting shall apply.
   SOUND LEVEL METER. Device used to measure sound pressure levels with a
standardized frequency weighting and indicated exponential time weighting for
measurements of sound level, or without time weighting for measurement of time-
average sound pressure level or sound exposure level. The sound level meter
must be of standard design and quality having characteristics established by
ANSI.
   SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL. Twenty times the logarithm to the base ten of the
ratio of the RMS sound of twenty (20) micronewtons per square meter.
(1989 Code, § 11-4.2) (Ord. 02-01, passed 4-8-2002; Ord. 17-O-03, passed 11-27-

   (A)   Purpose and definition.
      (1)   The Board of Commissioners of the City of Havelock is enacting this
section to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a
program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The Board
finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and
values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless property
owners or the City act to remove graffiti from public and private property, the
graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then may become the target of
graffiti vandalism and entire neighborhoods can be adversely affected, property
values lowered, and respect for property diminished, alt to the detriment of
the City.
      (2)   The term GRAFFITI means writings, drawings, inscriptions, figures
or marks of paint, ink, chalk, dye, or other similar substances on public or
private buildings, structures or places which are not authorized or permitted
by the property owner or possessor. For the purpose of this section, graffiti
includes drawings, writings, markings or inscriptions regardless of the content
or the nature of materials used in the commission of the act.
   (B)   Graffiti prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to write,
paint, inscribe, scratch, scrawl, spray, place or draw graffiti of any type on
any public or private building, structure or any other real property or
personal property. Such acts shall be a misdemeanor. Any person convicted of a
violation of this section shall be fined not less than $250 for the first
offense and $500 for the second and subsequent offenses.
   (C)   Exemption. Division (B) of this section shall not be construed to
prohibit temporary, easily removable chalk or other water-soluble markings on
public or private sidewalks, streets or other paved surfaces which are used in
connection with traditional children's activities, such as drawings or bases
for stickball, kickball, handball, hopscotch or similar activities, nor shall
it be construed to prohibit temporary, easily removable chalk or other water-
soluble markings used in connection with any lawful business or public purpose
or activity.
   (D)   Removal of graffiti. It shall be unlawful for any person owning
private property, acting as manager or agent for the owner of the property, or
in possession or control of property to fail to remove or effectively obscure
any graffiti upon such property. In the event the person or persons responsible
for the graffiti vandalism cannot be identified by the Havelock Police
Department or if the graffiti is not removed or effectively obscured by either
the perpetrator, property owner, manager, or agent of the owner or person in
possession or control of the property within ten calendar days, then the Police
Department shall notify the Havelock Planning and Inspections Department who
will then send a notice to the person or persons owning property, acting as
manager or agent for the owner of the property, or in possession or control of
property requiring them to remove or effectively obscure the graffiti from the
property within ten calendar days. If after ten calendar days it is determined
that said property owner, manager, agent, or person in possession or control of
the property has failed to remove or effectively obscure the graffiti from the
property, the property owner, manager, agent, or person in possession will
receive notice to appear before the City Manager to show cause as why they have
not complied with the section. After hearing the statements of the noticed
person(s), the City Manager may direct the Planning and Inspections Department
to remove or effectively obscure the graffiti in accordance with division (H)
of this section.
   (E)   Mitigating circumstances. In determining the fine to be imposed, the
court may consider the efforts, if any, taken by the violator to remove or
effectively obscure the graffiti.
   (F)   Restitution. In addition to any other punishment imposed, the court
shall order the person convicted of a violation of this section to make
restitution to the victim for the damage or loss suffered by the victim as a
result of the offense. The court may determine the amount, terms, and
conditions of the restitution. In the case of a minor, the parents or legal
guardian shall be ordered jointly and severally liable with the minor to make
restitution.
   (G)   Community service.  In addition to, or as a part of, the penalties
specified in this section, a violator may be required to perform community
service as determined by the court. Reasonable effort shall be made to assign
the violator to a type community service that is reasonably expected to have
the most rehabilitative effect on the violator, including community service
that involves graffiti removal.
   (H)   Notice and removal by City.
      (1)   Whenever the City becomes aware of the existence of graffiti on any
private property, the City shall give written notice to remove or effectively
obscure such graffiti to the property owner, manager, agent, or other person in
possession or control of the property.
      (2)   If the person owning the property, acting as manager or agent for
the owner of the property, or in possession or control of the property fails to
remove or effectively obscure the graffiti within ten calendar days from
receipt of the notice described in this division (4), the City may cause the
graffiti to be removed or effectively obscured using City personnel or funds
and charge the property owner, or the property owner's manager or agent, or the
person in possession or control of the property, for the expenses incurred by
the city in removing the graffiti. Cleanup of graffiti is considered to be an
appropriate use of public funds. The City shall have a right of entry onto the
property for the sole purpose of removing or otherwise obscuring the graffiti
present on the exterior of buildings, structures, or personal property.
   (I)   Remedies available to City.
      (1)   The City may bring suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to
recover all such expenses, which shall include, but not be limited to, all
administrative personnel costs, attorney's fees and costs related to enforcing
this section; and/or the City may record a lien in the public records of Craven
County, which lien shall be for all such expenses, and the amount of the lien
shall bear interest from the date of recording.
      (2)   The City may place a lien on the property to recover its cost of
cleanup. If the City intends to place a lien on the property, as provided in
division (I)(1) of this section, it must also notify all other persons whose
names appear on the county tax rolls as having a legal interest in the
property. Notice shall be given by personal service or certified mail, except
that notice may be given first class mail to those persons, other than the
property owner, whose names appear on the county tax rolls as having an
interest in the property. All notices shall state the procedure for appeals
under this section.
   (J)   Appeal procedure. Appeals may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by
the person owning the property, acting as manager or agent for the property, or
in possession or control of the property to prevent the removal of any
graffiti, within ten calendar days of having received notice from the City that
the graffiti must be removed. Appeals shall be in writing and shall state the
reasons for the appeal. If the party filing the appeal requests a hearing, such
hearing shall be held at the next scheduled meeting of the Board of Adjustment.
If, on appeal, the Board of Adjustment determines that the graffiti must be
removed, the Board may set a new deadline date for compliance or authorize the
City to proceed to remove or obscure the graffiti. The City shall not remove or
obscure any graffiti during the pendency of an appeal.
   (K)   Emergency removal. If the City determines that any graffiti presents
an imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the public and is
unable to provide notice by personal service after at least two attempts to do
so, then forty-eight (48) hours after either:
      (1)   Mailing of the notice described in division (H) of this section by
certified and first class mail to the person owning the property, acting as
agent or manager for the owner of such property, or in possession or control of
such property, or
      (2)   The posting of the notice in a conspicuous place on the property,
the City may remove or cause the graffiti to be removed at its expense.
   (L)   Extent of removal. In no case shall the City paint or repair any area
on private property obscured by graffiti more extensively than where the
graffiti itself is located. The City shall not be required to restore the
obscured area to its original condition (i.e., color, texture, etc.).
(Ord. 10-O-01, passed 1-25-2010)
§ 130.14 URINATING, DEFECATING IN PUBLIC.
   (A)   Urinating and defecating in public prohibited. Except in designated
water closets or toilet facilities, it shall be unlawful for any person to
urinate or defecate on any public place, sidewalk, street, alleyway or right-
of-way, in any public building; or on private property.
   (B)   Violations. Violations of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor
punishable in accordance with G.S. § 14-4.

CHAPTER 131: DRUG PARAPHERNALIA
Section
   
131.01   Purpose
   
131.02   Definitions
   
131.03   Possession
   
131.04   Manufacture or delivery; generally
   
131.05   Delivery to minor
   
131.06   Advertising
   
131.07   Civil seizure
§ 131.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   State law prohibits persons outside certain specifically identified
classes from possessing syringes, needles, and other implements adapted for
injecting controlled substances (G.S. § 90-113.4). This law, as far as it goes,
provides a valid and useful, though indirect, deterrent to some forms of drug
abuse.
   (B)   However, abuse of those drugs known as controlled substances under
G.S. Ch. 90 is not limited to subcutaneous injections. This fact is common
knowledge in the City and the Board is not required to profess ignorance of the
matters. See State v. Baldwin, 226 N.C. 295 (1946) and State v. Cadora, 13
N.C.App. 176 (1971) (the courts can take judicial notice that certain articles,
which otherwise have legitimate uses, may be used for illegal purposes).
   (C)   For example, a wide variety of pipes, masks, and other devices have
been adapted for ingesting and inhaling controlled substances. Other
instruments have been devised for the production and preparation of controlled
substances. Under certain circumstances, the criminal purposes for the
instruments and devices are easily identifiable to persons of ordinary
intelligence. Possession and conveyance of these instruments and devices are
not, however, prohibited by state law.
   (D)   Thus, the purpose of this chapter is to prohibit within the
jurisdiction of the City the manufacture, possession, conveyance, and
advertising of drug paraphernalia under those circumstances set forth in this
chapter.
   (E)   Pursuant to adoption of this chapter, the Board takes notice of
analogous state law prohibiting the possession of burglary tools. (See G.S. §
14-55.) In tandem with G.S. § 90-113.4, this statute provides a precedent for
prohibiting possession of instruments used to violate other laws.
   (F)   Finally, the Board is cognizant of the state law doctrine of
preemption, which prevents local governments from duplicating criminal laws
established at the state level. See generally State v. Tenore, 280 N.C. 238
(1972); State v. Wajna, 28 N.C.App. 661 (1976). Thus, this chapter does not
prohibit, and may not be used to support a criminal prosecution for, possession
of those implements covered by G.S. § 90-113.4.
(1989 Code, § 4AA-1) (Ord. passed 9-16-1980)
§ 131.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply

concerning the object’s use;

violation of this chapter;
         (d)   The proximity of the object to controlled substances;

object;
         (f)   Direct or circumstantial evidence of the intent of an owner or

knows intend to use the object to facilitate a violation of the laws of the
state relating to controlled substances; the innocence of an owner or of anyone
in control of the object as to a direct violation of this chapter shall not
prevent a finding that the object is intended for use or designed for use as
drug paraphernalia;
         (g)   Instruction, oral or written, provided with the object,
concerning use of the object;
         (h)   Descriptive materials accompanying the object, which explain or

object(s) to the total sales of the business enterprise;
         (l)   The existence and scope of legitimate uses for the object in the
community; and
         (m)   Expert testimony concerning its use.

structural standards, sanitary maintenance standards, or infestation control
standards set forth in sections §

constitute a fire or safety hazard or be dangerous to life, health or property,
then the Inspector shall notify the owner in writing at the owner’s last known
address or by personally delivering a copy of the notice in writing to the
owner, and shall further post notice of the deficiency on the front entrance to

appealed from was made. When appeal is from a decision of the Inspector
refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, the decision
shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a
decision of the Building Inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any
act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the
hearing by the Board, unless the Inspector certifies to the Board, after the
notice of appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason of the facts stated
in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a
suspension of his or her requirement would cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a
restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than
one day’s written notice to the Inspector, by the Board, or by a court of
record upon petition made pursuant division (C) of this section. The Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due
notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within ten days
following the hearing. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision
or order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion
is proper in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the
Building Inspector, but the concurring vote of the majority of the Board of
Adjustment shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the
Building Inspector. The Board of Adjustment shall have power in passing upon
appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, to
adapt the application of the subchapter to the necessities of the case to the
end that the spirit of the subchapter shall be observed, public safety and
welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Every decision of the Board of
Adjustment shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of
certiorari instituted within 30 days of the decision of the Board of
Adjustment, but not otherwise.
   (C)   Petition to superior court by owner.  Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the Building Inspector or a decision rendered by the Board of
Adjustment shall have the right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or
rendering of the decision, to petition the superior court for a temporary
injunction restraining the Inspector pending a final disposition of the case .

in conflict with any provision of any other ordinance or code of the city, the
provision which establishes the higher standard or more stringent requirement
for the promotion and protection of the health, safety, or welfare of its
citizens and the peace and dignity of the residents of the city shall prevail.

initial terms of three years. The other one regular member and one alternate
shall reside within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city and shall be
appointed by the Craven County Board of Commissioners for initial terms of

successor extraterritorial member shall be appointed only if the remaining

remaining total number of extraterritorial members on the Board of Adjustment
is equal to or greater than the number of extraterritorial members required by

annually and following any extension of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of
the city to ensure proportionate representation based on population for

Successor extraterritorial members shall be appointed by the County Board of
Commissioners for terms of three years or less to create staggered terms, and

terms of three years or less to create staggered terms, to the end that
thereafter the terms of all members shall not expire at the same time.

compensation. Vacancies occurring for reasons other than expiration of terms
shall be filled as they occur for the period of the unexpired term by the Board
of Commissioners for the area within the city limits and by the County Board of
Commissioners for the area outside of the city limits, but within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction.
      (3)   Extraterritorial members shall have equal rights, privileges and
duties with the other members of the Board of Adjustment regardless whether the
matters at issue arise within the city or within its extraterritorial area.
      (4)   Alternate members who reside within the city limits shall serve
only in the absence of regular members who reside within the city limits, and
alternate members who reside in the extraterritorial area of the city shall
serve only in the absence of regular members who reside within the
extraterritorial area of the city.
      (5)   Members of the Board present at the hearing of an appeal or
application but who are not sitting on the five-member panel shall not
participate in the interrogation of applicants or witnesses, nor shall they
deliberate or comment upon the appeal or application or any questions raised

the appointments provided for in this section within 90 days after receipt of a

failure to faithfully attend meetings) by the Board of Commissioners upon
written charge and after a public hearing.
   (E)   Officers. The Board of Adjustment annually shall by majority vote of
its membership (excluding vacant seats), elect one of its members to serve as
Chair and preside over the Board’s meetings and one member to serve as Vice
Chair. The Board of Adjustment shall annually appoint a Secretary, who may be
an employee of the city or a member of the Board, and the other subordinates as
may be authorized by the Board of Commissioners. The persons so designated
shall serve in these capacities for terms of one year or until their successors
are elected. Nothing herein shall be interpreted so as to forbid the officers
from being elected to succeed themselves. Officer vacancies may be filled for
the unexpired terms only by a majority vote of the Board membership (excluding
vacant seats). The Chair or any member temporarily acting as Chair may
administer oaths to witnesses coming before the Board. The Chair and Vice Chair
of the Board of Adjustment may take part in all deliberations and may vote on
all issues.
   (F)   Meetings and procedures. The Board of Adjustment shall formulate,
adopt and operate under rules of procedure consistent with this chapter and
G.S. § 160D-308. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the

or in his or her absence the Vice Chair or acting Chairperson, may administer
the oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board
shall be open to the public. Evidentiary hearings shall be conducted in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter and notice of the hearings
shall be provided in accordance with this chapter. The Board shall keep written
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote, indicating the facts and also

   (G)   Quorum. A quorum is necessary for the Board of Adjustment to take
official action. A quorum shall consist of five members of the Board and for
which one of the five members must be a member from the city’s extraterritorial
jurisdiction. Each appeal or application to the Board shall be deliberated and
voted upon by five members of the Board and, in the absence of a regular
member, alternate members whose terms of office have the earliest expiration
date shall fill the remaining seats on the five member panel in the order of
the expiration dates, and where two or more of the members terms of office
shall expire on the same date, then the order of priority for sitting on the
panel shall be determined, as between or among those members, by the
alphabetical order of their surnames, but in no case shall more than five
members of the Board deliberate and vote upon any appeal or application. A
member who has withdrawn from the meeting without being excused as provided in
division (H) below shall be counted as present for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present.
   (H)   Voting. The concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the Board
shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination
of the administrative officer, or to decide in favor of the applicant any
matter upon which it is required to pass under any ordinance or to grant any
variance. For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the Board and
members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not
be considered “members of the Board” for calculation of the requisite super-
majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of
the members. All other actions of the Board shall be taken by majority vote, a
quorum being present.
      (1)   Once a member is physically present at a Board meeting, any
subsequent failure to vote shall be recorded as an affirmative vote unless the
member has been excused in accordance with division (H)(2) below or has been
allowed to withdraw from the meeting in accordance with division (H)(3) below.
      (2)   A member may be excused from voting on a particular issue by
majority vote of the remaining members present under the following
circumstances:
         (a)   If the member has a direct financial interest in the outcome of
the matter at issue;
         (b)   If the matter at issue involves the member’s own official
conduct;
         (c)   If participation in the matter might violate the letter or
spirit of a member’s code of professional responsibility; or
         (d)   If a member has a close familial or financial relationship with
the applicant or the adjacent property owners so that the member cannot
reasonably be expected to exercise sound judgment in the public interest.
      (3)   A member may be allowed to withdraw from the entire remainder of a
meeting by majority vote of the remaining members present for any good and
sufficient reason other than the member’s desire to avoid voting on matters to
be considered at that meeting.
      (4)   A motion to allow a member to be excused from voting or excused
from the remainder of the meeting is in order only if made by or at the
initiative of the member directly affected.
      (5)   A roll call vote shall be taken for each motion.
   (I)   Right to an impartial decision maker. Pursuant to the requirements of
G.S. § 160D-109(d), a member of the Board of Adjustment shall not participate
in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter in a manner that would violate affected
persons’ constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible
conflicts include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion
prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex
parte communications, a close familial, business or other associational
relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of
the matter. If an objection is raised to a member’s participation and that
member does not recues himself or herself, the remaining members shall by
majority vote rule on the objection.

         (b)   It is not necessary that the permit application contain the type
of detailed construction drawings that would be necessary to determine
compliance with these sections or appendices, so long as the plans provide

application in the light of the substantive requirements set forth in the text
of the UDO. However, whenever the UDO requires a certain element of a
development to be constructed in accordance with the detailed requirements set
forth in one or more of these sections or appendices, then no construction work

   (F)   Federal, state or county permits required. A permit for any building
or use for which a federal, state or county permit is required shall not be
issued until the permit or approval has been issued by the appropriate federal,
state or county department.
   (G)   Permit issuance. The issuance of a zoning, sign or special use permit
authorizes the recipient to commence the activity resulting in a change in use
of the land or structure, or (subject to obtaining a building permit), to
commence work designed to construct, erect, move or substantially alter
buildings or other substantial structures. However, except as provided in §§
153.15 and

   (H)   Permit compliance.
      (1)   Periodic inspections. The Zoning Administrator shall have the

§ 153.12 SPECIAL USE PERMIT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Applicability. Permission may be granted by the Board of Adjustment

Uses in
Chapter 155.
   (B)   Submission. Two copies of the special use permit application shall be

Review Committee (TRC) meeting at which the special use permit request will be
reviewed.
   (C)   Concurrent rezoning. If a rezoning is to be requested in connection
with the request for a special use permit, complete applications for both
processes must be filed concurrently with the Zoning Administrator. The
rezoning request will proceed first through the appropriate rezoning process,
pursuant to
Chapter 160, with final approval by the Board of Commissioners (BOC). Upon BOC
approval, the application for a special use permit will proceed through its
normal approval process, pursuant to this chapter.
   (D)   Application. Applications for special use permits shall include a site
plan as specified in §
153.10(F).
   (E)   Review and approval. The review process for a special use permit
request shall include:
      (1)   Planning and Inspections Department and Technical Review Committee
review; and
      (2)   Evidentiary hearing held by, and subsequent action by, the Board of
Adjustment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (F)   Recommendations.
      (1)   The Planning and Inspections Department and Technical Review
Committee (TRC) shall:
         (a)   Review the application for details, where applicable, of the
site, situation, existing and proposed structures, architectural plans,
neighboring land and water uses, proposed parking areas, driveway locations,
highway access, traffic generation and circulation potential, drainage, waste
disposal, water supply systems and the effects of the proposed use, structure,
operation and potential changes in water quality, shoreland cover, natural
beauty and wildlife habitat;
         (b)   Consider recommending conditions that may be placed in the
granting of special use permit by the BOA. These conditions may include
landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction
commencement and proposed completion dates, sureties, lighting, fencing,
location, size and number of signs, water supply and waste disposal systems,
performance standards, street dedication, certified survey maps, flood-
proofing, ground cover, sedimentation control from the project construction,
terraces, stream bank protection, planting of buffer screens, operational
control, hours of operation, number of employees, improved traffic circulation,
deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, yard sizes or additional
parking; and
         (c)   Check for compliance of the requested special use with all other
relevant provisions of the UDO, such as lot dimensional requirements, building
heights, parking and loading standards.
      (2)   When presented to the Board of Adjustment at the evidentiary
hearing, the application for a special use permit shall be accompanied by a
report setting forth the Planning and Inspections Department’s proposed
findings concerning the application’s compliance with §
153.10(F) and the other requirements of the UDO, as well as any staff
recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the Board of
Adjustment.
      (3)   If the Zoning Administrator proposes a finding or conclusion that
the application fails to comply with §
153.10(F) or any other requirement of the UDO, the Zoning Administrator shall
identify the requirement in question and specifically state supporting reasons
for the proposed findings or conclusions.
   (G)   Evidentiary hearing requirements and procedures.
      (1)   A special use permit shall not be approved until an evidentiary
hearing following quasi-judicial procedures has been held by the Board of
Adjustment (BOA) in accordance with the provisions of this section. The purpose
of the evidentiary hearing is to gather facts, not to solicit citizen opinion.
Consequently, the hearing procedures differ from those of a legislative
hearing. In an evidentiary hearing, testimony may be provided only by sworn
witnesses and written findings of fact and conclusions of law are required.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall provide due notice of any
evidentiary hearing following the procedures in §
159.07.
      (3)   At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the BOA may proceed
to vote on the permit request or take any other action consistent with its
usual rules of procedure. Division (H) below delineates specific actions that
the BOA must take on requests for special use permits.
      (4)   The BOA is not required to take final action on a special use
permit request within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as
expeditiously as practical on permit requests since inordinate delays can
result in the applicant incurring unnecessary costs.
      (5)   Subject to division (G)(6) below, the BOA shall approve the
requested special use permit unless it concludes, based upon the information
submitted at the hearing, that:
         (a)   The requested special use permit is not within its jurisdiction
according to the Table of Permitted Uses in
Chapter 154;
         (b)   The application is incomplete; or
         (c)   If completed as proposed in the application, the development
will not comply with one or more requirements of the UDO, including the
standards of the zoning district in which it will be located.
      (6)   Even if the BOA finds that the application complies with all other
provisions of the UDO, it may still deny the special use permit request if it
concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing, that if
completed as proposed, the development, more probably than not:
         (a)   Will materially endanger the public health or safety;
         (b)   Will constitute a nuisance or hazards;
         (c)   Will substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting
property;
         (d)   Will not be in harmony with the area in which it is to be
located; or
         (e)   Will not be in general conformity with the land use plan or
other plans and policies officially adopted by the Board of Commissioners.
   (H)   Action.
      (1)   Following the evidentiary hearing, the Board of Adjustment (BOA)
may proceed to vote on the permit request or take any other action consistent
with its usual rules of procedure. The BOA, in considering special use permit
applications, acts in a quasi-judicial capacity and, accordingly, is required
to observe quasi-judicial procedures, including requiring a simple majority
vote to issue a special use permit. For purposes of this section, vacant
positions on the BOA and members who have been disqualified from voting on a
quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered “members of the Board” for
calculation of the requisite majority.
      (2)   In considering whether to approve an application for a special use
permit, the BOA shall proceed according to the following format.
         (a)   The BOA shall consider whether the application is complete. If
the BOA concludes that the application is incomplete and the applicant refuses
to provide the necessary information, the application shall be denied. A motion
to this effect shall specify either the particular type of information lacking
or the particular requirement with respect to which the application is
incomplete. A motion to this effect, concurred in by a simple majority vote of
the BOA, shall constitute the BOA’s finding on this issue. If a motion to this
effect is not made and concurred in by a simple majority vote, this shall be
taken as an affirmative finding by the BOA that the application is complete.
         (b)   The BOA shall consider whether the application complies with all
of the applicable requirements of the UDO. If a motion to this effect passes by
the necessary majority vote, the BOA need not make further findings concerning
those requirements.
         (c)   If such a motion fails to receive the necessary majority vote or
is not made, then a motion shall be made that the application be found not in
compliance with one or more requirements of the UDO. Such a motion shall
specify the particular requirements the application fails to meet. A separate
vote may be taken with respect to each requirement not met by the application.
If the BOA concludes that the application fails to meet one or more of the
requirements of the UDO, the application shall be denied.
         (d)   If the BOA concludes that all such requirements are met, it
shall issue the permit unless it adopts a motion to deny the application for
one or more of the reasons set forth in §
153.13(A). Such a motion shall propose specific findings, based upon the
evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion.
         (e)   Decisions by the BOA on special use permit requests shall be
filed in the Office of the Planning and Inspections Department. A copy of the
BOA’s decision shall be provided, by first class mail, to the applicant as well
as to any parties that have requested a written copy of the BOA’s decision.
         (f)   Decisions of the BOA regarding special use permit requests shall
be subject to review by the Superior Court of Craven County by proceedings in
the nature of certiorari (see
Chapter 162).
      (3)   Pursuant to the requirements of G.S. § 160D-109, a member of the
Board of Adjustment shall not participate in or vote on any quasi judicial
matter in a manner that would violate affected persons’ constitutional rights
to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible conflicts include, but are not
limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is
not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close
familial, business or other associational relationship with an affected person,
or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised
to a member’s participation and that member does not recuse himself or herself,
the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
      (4)   All approved special use permits shall be recorded with the Craven
County Register of Deeds and indexed under the record owner’s name as grantor.
Nothing authorized by the permit may be done until the record owner of the
property provides documentation that indicates that the permit has been
recorded.
   (I)   Reconsideration of action.
      (1)   Whenever the Board of Adjustment disapproves a special use permit
application, on any basis other than the failure of the applicant to submit a
complete application, that action may not be reconsidered by the BOA at a later
time unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that:
         (a)   Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the
application have substantially changed; or
         (b)   New information is available that could not with reasonable
diligence have been presented at a previous hearing. A request to be heard on
this basis must be filed with the Zoning Administrator within the time period
for an appeal to superior court (see
Chapter 162). However, such a request does not extend the 30-day period within
which an appeal must be taken.
      (2)   The BOA may, however, at any time consider a new application
affecting the same property as an application previously denied. A new
application is one that differs in some substantial way from the one previously
considered.
      (3)   The BOA shall, by a majority vote, make the determination as to
whether or not an amended application meets the criteria delineated in division
(I)(1) above for a rehearing or qualifies as a new application pursuant to
division (I)(2) above.

§ 153.13 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Permission may be granted by the Board of Adjustment (BOA) for the
establishment of special uses provided that the BOA finds that the special use:
      (1)   Will not endanger the public health or safety;
      (2)   Will not adversely impact the value of adjoining or abutting
property;
      (3)   Will be in harmony with the area in which it is located;
      (4)   Will not be affected adversely by the existing uses;
      (5)   Will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of
persons who will attend or use the facility, vehicular movement, noise or fume
generation, or type of physical activity;
      (6)   Will meet all minimum UDO regulations and standards of the zoning
district in which it will be located; and
      (7)   Will be in conformity with the land development plan, thoroughfare
plan or other plan officially adopted by the Board of Commissioners.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) below, in approving a special use request, the
BOA may impose or require the additional restrictions and standards in addition
to those specified in the UDO as will ensure that the development in its
proposed location will meet the findings listed in division (A) above.
   (C)   However, the BOA may not attach additional conditions that modify or
alter the specific requirements set forth in the UDO unless the development in
question presents extraordinary circumstances that justify the variation from
the specified requirements.
   (D)   Conditions and safeguards imposed shall not include requirements for
which the City does not have authority under State statute to regulate.
Conditions imposed must be agreed to in writing by the applicant.
   (E)   All additional conditions or requirements shall be specified in the
letter of approval issued to the applicant by the Zoning Administrator.
   (F)   All additional conditions or requirements authorized by this section
are enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as any other
applicable requirement of the UDO.
   (G)   A vote may be taken on application conditions or requirements before
consideration of whether the special use request should be denied for any of
the reasons set forth in §
153.12(G)(8) and (9).
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 153.14 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR SOME SPECIAL USES.
   
Chapter 155 lists specific requirements for some uses requiring special use
permits. These special use requirements are in addition to those listed in §§
153.12 and
153.13.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 153.15 AUTHORIZING USE OR OCCUPANCY BEFORE COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT UNDER
ZONING AND SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond
the control of the zoning permit recipient (exclusive of financial hardship) it
would be unreasonable to require the permit recipient to comply with all of the
requirements of the UDO before commencing the intended use of the property or
occupying any buildings, the Zoning Administrator may authorize the
commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings (insofar as the
requirements of the UDO are concerned) if the permit recipient provides an
adequately secured performance bond valued at 110% of the total cost of
required improvements, or other security satisfactory to the Zoning
Administrator, to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled
within a reasonable period (not to exceed 12 months). The proposed performance
bond and security shall be reviewed and approved by the city, however, prior to
the Zoning Administrator authorizing the intended use or occupancy.
   (B)   When the Zoning Administrator imposes additional requirements upon the
zoning permit recipient, or the BOA imposes additional requirements upon the
special use permit recipient, in accordance with §
153.13 or when the developer proposes in the plans submitted to install
amenities beyond those required by the UDO, the Zoning Administrator or BOA (as
applicable to the specific permit) may authorize the permittee to commence the
intended use of the property or to occupy any building before the additional
requirements are fulfilled or the amenities installed if it specifies a date by
which or a schedule according to which such requirements must be met or each
amenity installed and if it concludes that compliance will be ensured as the
result of any one or more of the following:
      (1)   A performance bond and security satisfactory to the city is
furnished;
      (2)   A condition is imposed establishing an automatic expiration date on
the permit, thereby ensuring that the permit recipient’s compliance will be
reviewed when application for renewal is made; or
      (3)   The nature of the requirements or amenities is such that sufficient
assurance of compliance is given by
Chapter 162.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 153.16 COMPLETING DEVELOPMENT IN PHASES.
   (A)   If a development is constructed in phases or stages in accordance with
this section, then, subject to division (C) below, the provisions of this
chapter shall apply to each phase as if it were the entire development.
   (B)   As a prerequisite to taking advantage of the provisions of division
(A) above, the developer shall submit plans that clearly show the various
phases or stages of the proposed development and the requirements of the UDO
that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or stage.
   (C)   If a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes
improvements that are designed to relate to, benefit or be used by the entire
development (such as a swimming pool or tennis courts in a residential
development) then, as part of his or her application for development approval,
the developer shall submit a proposed schedule for completion of the
improvements. The schedule shall relate completion of the improvements to
completion of one or more phases or stages of the entire development. Once a
schedule has been approved and made part of the permit by the Zoning
Administrator or BOA, no land may be used, no buildings may be occupied except
in accordance with the schedule approved as part of the permit, provided that:
      (1)   If the improvement is one required by the UDO then the developer
may utilize the provisions of §
153.15(A); or
      (2)   If the improvement is an amenity not required by the UDO or is
provided in response to a condition imposed by the Zoning Administrator or BOA,
then the developer may utilize the provisions of §
153.15(B).
   (D)   Vested right. Subject to §
153.24 a multi-phased development is vested for the entire development with the
land development regulations in place at the time the site plan approval is
granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development. The development
remains vested for a period of seven years from the time the site plan approval
is granted
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 153.17 EXPIRATION OF APPROVED PERMITS AND SITE PLANS.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (F) below, zoning, sign and special use
permits (including approved site or plot plans) shall expire automatically if,
within one year after the issuance of the permits:
      (1)   The use authorized by the permits has not commenced, in
circumstances where no substantial construction, erection, alteration,
excavation, demolition or similar work is necessary before commencement of the
use; or
      (2)   Less than ten percent of the total cost of all construction,
erection, alteration, excavation, demolition or similar work on any development
authorized by the permits has been completed on the site.
   (B)   If, after some physical alteration to land or structures begins to
take place, the work is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period
of not less than 24 months, then the zoning or special use permit authorizing
the work shall immediately expire.
   (C)   The permit-issuing authority (Zoning Administrator, Board of
Commissioners or Board of Adjustment, as applicable) may extend for a period up
to six months the date when a zoning, sign or special use permit would
otherwise expire pursuant to divisions (A) or (B) above if it concludes that:
the permit has not yet expired; the permit recipient has proceeded with due
diligence and in good faith; and conditions have not changed so substantially
as to warrant a new application.
      (1)   Successive extensions may be granted for periods up to six months
upon the same findings.
      (2)   All the extensions may be granted without resort to the formal
processes and fees required for a new permit.
   (D)   For purposes of this section, the permit within the jurisdiction of
the Board of Commissioners or the Board of Adjustment is issued when the
applicable permit-issuing authority votes to approve the application and issue
the permit. A zoning or sign permit within the jurisdiction of the Zoning
Administrator is issued when the earlier of the following takes place:
      (1)   A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the permit
recipient, and delivery is accomplished when the permit is delivered to the
permit applicant; or
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator notifies the permit applicant that the
application has been approved and that all that remains before a fully executed
permit can be delivered is for the applicant to take certain specified actions,
such as having the permit executed by the property owner so it can be recorded,
if required under §
153.17.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any of the provisions of
Chapter 161, this section shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the
date the UDO becomes effective.
   (F)   Special use permits with a vested right established in accordance with
§
153.24, shall expire at the end of the two-year vesting period established
pursuant to §
153.24.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 153.18 EFFECT OF PERMIT ON SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.
   Zoning, sign and special use permits authorize the permittee to make use of
land and structures in a particular way. The permits are transferable. However,
so long as the land or structures or any portion thereof covered under a permit
continues to be used for the purposes for which the permit was granted, then:
   (A)   A person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained
the permit) shall not make use of the land or structures covered under the
permit for the purposes authorized in the permit except in accordance with all
the terms and requirements of that permit; and
   (B)   The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use
of land or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all
persons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was
obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any interest
in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for or in connection
with purposes other than those for which the permit was originally issued.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 153.19 AMENDMENTS TO AND MODIFICATIONS OF PERMITS AND PLANS.
   (A)   Upon petition by a permit holder, administrative minor modifications
to an approved conditional zoning district, special use permit, site plan, or
other development permit approved by the Board of Commissioners, Board of
Adjustment or the Zoning Administrator are permissible. The minor modifications
authorized herein are intended to provide relief where conditions, established
by the permit granted, create a hardship based upon a unique physical attribute
of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property which was
not known at the time of permit approval and which subsequently rendered the
land difficult or impossible to use due to the condition(s) imposed. The permit
holder shall bear the burden of proof to secure the modification(s). Minor
modifications shall be limited to changes that the Zoning Administrator
determines would not:
      (1)   Change the gross square footage of nonresidential development by
more than 5%;
      (2)   Change the lot coverage by more than 5%;
      (3)   Change any use or density;
      (4)   Adjust the landscaping requirements by more than 10%; or
      (5)   Adjust the required parking more than 5%.
   (B)   All other requests for changes in approved site plans will be
processed as a modification to the original application. If the requests are to
be acted upon by the Board of Commissioners or Board of Adjustment, new
conditions may be imposed only on the specific site or area requested to be
modified in accordance with §
153.13, but the applicant retains the right to reject the additional conditions
by withdrawing his or her request for an amendment and may then proceed in
accordance with the previously issued permit.
   (C)   The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether amendments to and
modifications of permits fall within the categories set forth above in
divisions (A) and (B) above.
   (D)   A property owner requesting approval of changes shall submit a written
request for the approval to the Zoning Administrator, which request shall
identify the changes. Approval of all changes must be provided to the property
owner in writing.
   (E)   A vested right established in accordance with §
153.24 shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to an approved
site specific vesting plan unless expressly provided for by the Board of
Commissioners.

§ 153.21 MAINTENANCE OF COMMON AREAS, IMPROVEMENTS AND FACILITIES.
   (A)   The recipient or the recipient’s successor of any zoning, conditional
zoning or special use permit, shall be responsible for maintaining all common
areas, improvements or facilities required by the UDO or any permit issued in
accordance with its provisions, except those areas, improvements or facilities
with respect to which an offer of dedication to the public has been accepted by
the appropriate public authority.
   (B)   As an illustration, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, this means that private streets and parking areas, water and sewer
lines, stormwater facilities, common open space and recreational facilities
must be properly maintained so that they can be used in the manner intended,
and that required vegetation and trees used for screening, landscaping or
shading must be replaced if they die or are destroyed.

§ 153.22 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   To better structure and manage development approvals for multiple-
phase developments and to ensure their proper integration into local capital
facilities programs, the Board of Commissioners may enter into development
agreements with developers, subject to the procedures and requirements of G.S.
Ch. 160D, Art. 10.
   (B)   A development agreement may specify that the developer furnish certain
public facilities, but it must also provide that the delivery date of these
public facilities will be tied to successful performance by the developer in
completing the private portion of the development.
   (C)   A development agreement may specify that the project be commenced or
completed within a certain period of time.
      (1)   A development must provide a development schedule and include
commencement dates and interim completion dates for intervals no greater than
five years.
      (2)   The property subject to a development agreement may be of any size.
      (3)   The term of the development agreement shall be of a reasonable term
specified in the agreement.
   (D)   A development agreement must be approved by the Board of Commissioners
by ordinance. Before entering into a development agreement, the Board of
Commissioners shall conduct a legislative hearing following the same
legislative hearing procedures and requirements delineated in
Chapter 160 for zoning text amendments.
   (E)   The legislative hearing notice shall specify: the location of the
property subject to the development agreement; the development uses proposed on
the property; and a place where a copy of the proposed development agreement
can be obtained.
      (1)   Once executed by the city and the developer, the development
agreement must be recorded with the Craven County Register of Deeds.
      (2)   The burdens of the development agreement are binding upon, and the
benefits of the agreement shall inure to, all successors in interest to the
parties to the agreement.

(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 153.24 ZONING VESTED RIGHTS AND PERMIT CHOICE.
   (A)   A vested right shall be established, upon petition by the owner of the
property, after the approval or conditional approval of a site specific vesting
plan by the appropriate permit-issuing authority in accordance with the
provisions outlined in this section. A right which has been vested as provided
for in this section shall, as a general rule, remain valid for two years and
shall attach to and run with the land.
   (B)   Definitions. Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly
required by the context, the words and phrases defined in this section shall
have the meaning indicated when used in this section.
      (1)   Landowner. Any owner of a legal or equitable interest in real
property, including the heirs, devisees, successors, assigns and personal
representative of the owner. The landowner may allow a person holding a valid
option to purchase to act as his or her agent or representative for purposes of
submitting a proposed site specific vesting plan.
      (2)   Property. All real property subject to the regulations and
restrictions of the UDO as well as the zoning district boundaries established
by the UDO and depicted on the official zoning map.
      (3)   Site specific vesting plan. A plan which has been submitted to the
city by a landowner requesting vesting pursuant to this section and describing
in detail the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of
property. The plan shall be in the form of a site plan required to obtain a
zoning or special use permit or a site plan required to obtain a Nontraditional
Lot Development and/or Conditional Zoning District Rezoning. The information
required by §
153.10(F) and other permit or rezoning application details, as applicable,
shall be included. The vesting plan does not include a building permit or
variance. The development approvals listed below are determined by the City to
be site specific vesting plans:
         (a)   Subdivision plat;
         (b)   Conditional Zoning District plan.
      (4)   Vested right. The right to undertake and complete the development
and use of property under the terms and conditions of an approved site specific
vesting plan.
   (C)   A vested right shall be deemed established, following the receipt of a
petition from the property owner, upon the effective date of approval of the
site specific vesting plan by the appropriate permit-issuing authority.
Following the approval of a site specific vesting plan, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue a vested right certificate to the landowner which
indicates the duration of the vesting period, the conditions, if any, imposed
on the approval of the site specific vesting plan, and any other information
determined by the Zoning Administrator to be necessary to administer the vested
right.
   (D)   A vested right shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake
and complete the development and use of the property as delineated in the
approved site specific vesting plan. The appropriate permit-issuing authority
may approve a site specific vesting plan upon terms and conditions as may be
determined necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Failure
of the landowner to comply with the approved terms and conditions shall result
in a forfeiture of vested rights.
   (E)   Approval, modification or amendment of a site specific vesting plan by
the permit-issuing authority shall follow the procedural requirements for the
underlying permit or rezoning approval.
   (F)   A vested right obtained under this section runs with the land and is
valid for two to five years, as determined by the Board of Commissioners or
other approving authority, from the effective date of approval of a site
specific vesting plan. A vested right shall not be extended by any amendments
or modifications to an approved site-specific vesting plan unless expressly
provided for by permit-issuing authority. A vested right shall expire at the
end of the vesting period if no building permit applications have been filed
with the city to construct the use or uses proposed in the approved site
specific vesting plan. If building permits are issued, the provisions of G.S.
§§ 160D-1111 and 160D-1115 shall apply, except that a building permit shall not
expire or be revoked because of the lack of progress during the vesting period.
   (G)   A vested right, once established or provided for in this section,
precludes any zoning action by the city which would change, alter, impair,
prevent, diminish or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as
set forth in the approved site specific vesting plan, except:
      (1)   With the written consent of the affected landowner;
      (2)   Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that
natural or man-made hazards in the immediate vicinity of the property, if
uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety and
welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site specific
vesting plan;
      (3)   To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for
all costs, expenses and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but
not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all
architectural, planning, marketing, legal and other consultant’s fees incurred
after approval by the city, together with interest thereon at the legal rate
until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the
property, which is caused by that action;
      (4)   Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that
the landowner or his or her representative intentionally supplied inaccurate
information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the
approval by the city of the site specific vesting plan; or
      (5)   Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or
regulation which precludes development as contemplated in the site specific
vesting plan, in which case the city may modify the affected provisions, upon a
finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the
plan, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing.
   (H)   The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application
of overlay zoning which imposes additional requirements but does not affect the
allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations which are
general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use
regulation by the city, including, but not limited to, Building, Fire,
Plumbing, Electrical and Mechanical Codes.
   (I)   Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the establishment of a
vested right shall not preclude, change or impair the authority of the city to
enforce provisions of the UDO governing nonconforming situations or uses.
   (J)   A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right,
but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a
site specific vesting plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be
entitled to exercise those vested rights.
   (K)   The city shall not require a landowner to waive his or her vested
rights as a condition of developmental approval.
   (L)   Permit choice.
      (1)   If a land development rule or ordinance is amended between the time
a development permit application is submitted and a development permit decision
is made, the applicant may choose which adopted version of the rule or
ordinance will apply to the permit.
      (2)   If the applicant chooses the rule or ordinance in effect at the
time of application submission, he/she will not be required to await the
outcome of the rule or ordinance amendment prior to acting on the permit.
      (3)   If a development permit is wrongfully denied or an illegal
condition is imposed, as determined by an appeal of the denial or condition
imposed, and a development rule or ordinance is amended thereafter, the permit
applicant may choose which adopted rule or ordinance will apply to the permit
application.
      (4)   Any provision of the permit applicant’s chosen version of the rule
or ordinance that is determined to be illegal for any reason shall not be
enforced upon the applicant without the written consent of the applicant.
      (5)   If a permit application is placed on hold at the request of the
applicant for a period of six consecutive months or more, or the applicant
fails to respond to comments or provide additional information reasonably
requested by the City for a period of six consecutive months or more, permit
choice shall be waived and the development regulation in effect at the time
permit processing is resumed shall apply to the application.

   (C)   The certificate of zoning compliance shall be presented to the City
Building Inspector prior to the city’s issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
   (D)   A temporary certificate of zoning compliance may be issued by the
Zoning Administrator, for a period not to exceed six months, during alteration
or construction for partial occupancy of a building pending completion. The
temporary certificate shall bear the dates of issuance and expiration on the
certificate, shall be clearly marked “Temporary”, and shall stipulate such
conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the
public.

§ 154.01 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (A)   Official map. The city planning and zoning jurisdiction is hereby
divided into zones, or districts, as established in §§
154.02 through
154.06. The official zoning map is part of this chapter and is the most recent
copy of the electronic zoning map, as produced and maintained by the Planning
and Inspections Department, and as on file in the office of the City Clerk.
   (B)   Map changes. If changes are made in district boundaries or other
matters portrayed on the official zoning map, the changes shall be entered on
the official zoning map. Amendments to the official zoning map shall be made
utilizing the same procedures that apply to text amendments, as set forth in
Chapter 160. Specific public hearing notice requirements are, however,
delineated in §
160.05 for zoning map amendments.
   (C)   Unauthorized changes. No changes in zoning district boundaries shall
be made on the official zoning map, except in conformance with the procedures
set forth in the UDO. Any unauthorized change shall be considered a violation
of the UDO.
   (D)   Map location. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the
official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the
official zoning map, which shall be located in the City Planning and
Inspections Department, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning
of property within the city’s planning and zoning jurisdiction.
   (E)   Map damage and replacement. In the event that the official zoning map
becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the
nature or number of changes and additions, the Board of Commissioners may by
resolution adopt a replacement official zoning map, which shall supersede the
prior official zoning map. Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost,
or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant remaining parts
thereof shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to
its adoption or amendment.
   (F)   Replacement of official zoning map. The new official zoning map may
correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map,
but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official
zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The replacement official zoning
map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor be attested by the City
Clerk, and bear the seal of the city.
   (G)   Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. Guidelines regarding the
interpretation of zoning district boundaries are provided in
Chapter 159. The Board of Adjustment, in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 159, is authorized to make interpretations regarding the zoning map and
to pass upon disputed questions of zoning district boundaries.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 154.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   In order to achieve the purposes of the UDO as set forth, all property
within the jurisdiction of the city and its extraterritorial jurisdictional
area is divided into general use zoning districts with the designations and
purposes listed in this section or conditional zoning districts with the
designations and purposes listed in §
154.03.
   (B)   The minimum lot size specified for each residential zoning district in
this section is the general requirement. The definitions for the housing types
discussed in this section are provided in
Table 154-1.
   (C)   The specific minimum lot sizes, dimensional requirements and permitted
uses for each zoning district are provided in
Chapter 155. In addition,
Chapter 157 provides design and performance standards for specific uses.
   (D)   Additional density, intensity and use requirements for properties
located within the AICUZ and Flood Hazard Overlay Districts are provided in §
154.04.
   (E)   
Table 154-2 demonstrates the compatibility/ consistency between zoning
districts and land use categories from the city’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1659.jpg]
 
      (6)   R-10 Medium Density Residential District. The R-10 District
designates properties used principally for medium density residential purposes,
characterized by single-family detached homes. The overall gross density is
typically 4.3 units per acre or less (10,000 square feet minimum lot area).
      (7)   R-7 Medium Density Residential District. The R-7 District
designates properties used principally for medium density residential purposes,
characterized by single-family detached homes. The overall gross density is
typically 6.2 units per acre or less (7,000 square feet minimum lot area).
      (8)   R-M Multi-Family Residential District. The R-M District is
established as a district in which the principal use of land is for high-
density residential purposes, characterized by single-family detached homes,
zero lot line detached homes, semi-attached homes, multiplex attached homes,
townhouse attached homes, condominiums, multi-family attached homes and upper-
story attached homes. Residential densities range from six to 12.5 dwelling
units per acre.
      (9)   R-MH Manufactured Home Residential District.
         (a)   The R-MH District is established as a district in which the
principal use of land is for manufactured homes.
         (b)   This district is intended for the location of manufactured homes
on land under common ownership (e.g., manufactured home parks) or for the
creation of individual lots, each for the placement of a manufactured home,
within a planned manufactured home community.
         (c)   The overall gross density is typically 8.7 units per acre or
less (5,000 square feet minimum lot area).
         (d)   In addition to all other requirements of the code applicable to
manufactured housing, all manufactured homes located in the R-MH District shall
be subject to the regulations and standards pursuant to
Chapter 155.
   (B)   Business districts.
      (1)   N-B Neighborhood Business.
         (a)   The N-B District is established as a mixed-use district where
compact development, comprised of commercial retail, service, office and
residential uses are integrated vertically and horizontally with adjacent
residential uses, businesses and neighborhoods.
         (b)   The overall gross residential density ranges from three to ten
units per acre for neighborhood mixed use areas to four to 15 units per acre
for city center mixed use areas, as shown on the City Comprehensive Land Use
Plan Future Land Use Map.
         (c)   The regulations of this district are indented to assure
compatibility and interconnection with neighboring uses.
         (d)   Developments within the NB District are recommended to follow
the Conditional Zoning District process (see §
160.12) to demonstrate consistency with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan’s City
Center and Neighborhood Mixed Use land use categories, especially in terms of
types of uses, building heights, floor area ratios and integration with and
protection of surrounding uses.
      (2)   H-C Highway Commercial.
         (a)   The H-C District is established to allow commercial development
for retailing of goods and services, and providing offices and personal
services on major highways and other thoroughfares in the community. Because
these commercial uses are subject to the public view which is a matter of
important concern to the whole community, they should provide a pleasing
appearance, ample parking, controlled traffic movement and suitable
landscaping.
         (b)   For those uses that may require use of property outside of the
principal buildings, special use provisions are generally required in order to
maintain and promote a healthful environment for the business community.
         (c)   Further, open storage and accessory buildings may be
specifically limited in scope.
      (3)   O&I Office and Institutional.
         (a)   The O&I District is established as a transition district in
which the principal use of land is for services, offices and institutional
types such as medical facilities, clinics, churches and other compatible uses
within a transitional area.
         (b)   Because these uses are subject to the public view, which is a
matter of important concern to the whole community, they should provide a
pleasing appearance, ample parking, controlled low volume traffic movement and
suitable landscaping. Open storage is prohibited.
   (C)   Industrial districts.
      (1)   L-I Light Industrial.
         (a)   The L-I District is established as a district in which the
principal use of land is intended for warehousing, shipping facilities, light
manufacturing, assembly operations and wholesaling activities which have little
or no adverse impact upon adjoining residential, business and industrial
properties.
         (b)   The L-I District is intended to provide appropriate locations
for light industrial uses
in areas that would otherwise be adversely impacted by general or heavy
industrial uses.
         (c)   Other land uses allowed within the L-I District should be
limited to those uses that support light industrial uses. Generally, retail,
service and heavy commercial uses should be avoided in the L-I District.
      (2)   H-I Heavy Industrial District.
         (a)   The H-I District is established as a district in which the
principal use of land is intended for enterprises engaged in a wide range of
fabricating, manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing, renovating,
painting, cleaning or assembly of goods, merchandise or equipment and related
support retail and service uses which may not be compatible with certain light
industrial uses or surrounding residential or business uses.
         (b)   This district is intended to allow a higher density of
manufacturing and warehousing operations, and which may create less desirable
appearance and more environmental pollution than uses in the L-I District.
         (c)   These uses by their nature are more intense, may create
nuisances and should be placed in outlying locations on large tracts of land
where the operations involved do not detract from the development potential of
nearby property, or alternatively, within the AICUZ Overlay District where the
uses would not adversely affect neighboring uses or be affected by the
potential noise and safety impacts of Cherry Point operations.

accommodate the military installations under the authority of the planning and
zoning jurisdiction of the city. The purpose of the MR zone is to meet the
purpose and intent of G.S. § 160D-702 by providing zoning coverage to the
entire corporate area while providing adequate zoning protection for properties
that are presently held by the military, but might be declared surplus or
otherwise privatized in the future. The M-R District will permit by right
traditional military uses and functions/uses supportive of the military
mission.
      (2)   G-S Governmental Services. The G-S District is established as a
district in which the principal use of land is for governmental services. The
services may include city-owned and operated facilities including offices,
parks, playgrounds, training grounds, utility plants and the like. In addition,
these services may include county-owned and operated facilities such as
offices, schools, playgrounds, parks, training grounds, utility plants and the
like. Because these facilities are subject to public view, which is a matter of
important concern to the whole community, they should provide a pleasing
appearance, ample parking and suitable landscaping.

§ 154.04 NONTRADITIONAL RESIDENTIAL LOT DEVELOPMENT REQUIRING REZONING TO
CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS (CD).
   This section sets forth regulations for nontraditional residential lot
development requiring rezoning to a Conditional Zoning District (CD). All
nontraditional residential lot developments shall be established either as
initial conditional zoning districts at the time of annexation, or through a
rezoning pursuant to the procedures and criteria for rezoning (CD) set forth in
§§
160.12 and
160.13.
   (A)   General intent/purpose.
      (1)   Nontraditional residential lot development is intended to allow
flexibility in development and encourage the use of innovative design and
layout that would not otherwise be permitted under the UDO because of the
strict application of the zoning district or general development standards.
Nontraditional residential lot development encourages innovative land planning
and design concepts by:
         (a)   Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results
from strict application of zoning and development standards that were designed
primarily for individual lots;
         (b)   Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide
access, light, open space and design amenities;
         (c)   Allowing greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the
same development, including a mix of housing types, housing prices, lot sizes,
densities and nonresidential uses;
         (d)   Promoting quality urban design and environmentally sensitive
development by allowing development to take advantage of special site
characteristics, locations and land uses; and
         (e)   Encouraging quality urban design and environmentally sensitive
development by allowing increases in base densities when the increases can be
justified by superior design or the provision of additional amenities such as
public and/or private open space.
      (2)   In return for greater flexibility in site design requirements,
nontraditional residential lot developments are expected to: deliver
exceptional quality community designs that preserve critical environmental
resources; provide above-average open space amenities; incorporate creative
design in the layout of buildings, open space and circulation; coordinate and
unify design elements of the project, including building materials, signage and
architectural compatibility; assure compatibility with surrounding land uses
and neighborhood character; and, provide greater efficiency in the layout and
provision of roads, utilities and other infrastructure. The Conditional Zoning
District process shall not be used as a means of circumventing the city’s
adopted zoning and development regulations for routine developments.
   (B)   Nontraditional residential lot development defined.
      (1)   Nontraditional residential lot development is an area of land under
unified control, to be developed as a single entity for a number and variety of
dwelling units, according to a Master Plan which is approved at the time of
rezoning. Lands rezoned to a Conditional Zoning District for nontraditional
residential lot development may incorporate up to 15% of the total project area
to limited convenience commercial buildings or services to serve the residences
of the project. Lands rezoned to a Conditional Zoning District for
nontraditional residential lot development shall meet the use and development
requirements of division (D) below.
      (2)   Nontraditional residential lot developments such as mixed use
(upper story attached dwellings) requested within traditional commercial zoning
districts such as Highway Commercial (HC), and Office and Institutional (O&I)
shall incorporate a minimum of 15% of the total project area to commercial
buildings or services. The development of neighborhood, community or regional
commercial centers shall be in scale with surrounding market areas at locations
recommended in the City Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The development is
intended to permit the establishment of the projects only where planned centers
with carefully organized buildings, service areas, parking areas and landscaped
open spaces will clearly serve demonstrated public need, reduce marginal
traffic friction below that which would result from strip commercial
development along highways, and protect property values in surrounding
neighborhoods. Lands rezoned for these developments to a Conditional Zoning
District shall meet the size requirements of division (E) below.
   (C)   Nontraditional residential lot development; general use and
development standards.
      (1)   Uses allowed. A nontraditional residential lot development may
contain any or all of the uses specified in the approved development Master
Plan, provided the uses are consistent with the City Comprehensive Land Use
Plan. A wide range of uses is possible in a nontraditional residential lot
development, and the specific uses allowed may be different in each development
approved through the Conditional Zoning District (CD) process. All uses that
are set out in an approved Master Plan shall be treated as permitted uses
within the development, except that uses which are prohibited in §
154.03(D) of this chapter shall not be permitted within the development.
      (2)   Certain mixed uses allowed.
         (a)   Mixed use developments are encouraged and allowed in
Nontraditional Residential Lot Developments through the Conditional Zoning
District process only as specified in this chapter. Mixed use development may
occur by having retail or commercial uses located in the same building (e.g.,
retail or office space on ground floor, and residential above) or by having
nonresidential uses located in different buildings sited on the same lot or
parcel (e.g., office building located on the same parcel as a freestanding
residential structure).
         (b)   Mixed use developments shall be designed, located and oriented
on the site so that nonresidential uses are directly accessible to residents of
the development. For the purposes of this section, DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE shall
mean pedestrian and vehicular access by way of improved sidewalks or paths and
streets that do not involve leaving the development or using a major
thoroughfare. DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE does not necessarily mean that nonresidential
uses need to be located in a particular location, but that the siting of the
uses considers the accessibility of the residential component of the
development to the nonresidential use.
      (3)   Applicable standards.
         (a)   Nontraditional residential development approved through a
Conditional Zoning District shall be subject to all applicable overlay district
regulations in
Chapter 154, all applicable use regulations set forth in
Chapter 155, all applicable environmental regulations of
Chapters 50 through
54 in the city code of ordinances, and
Chapter 156, and all applicable general regulations set forth in
Chapter 157, unless otherwise waived or modified by the city in the terms of
the approved master plan. In case of any conflict between a specific regulation
set forth in this §
154.03 and any regulation set forth in
Chapters 154 through
157, the regulation in this section shall apply unless otherwise expressly
allowed.
         (b)   Notwithstanding division (C)(3)(a) above, in no case shall the
Board of Commissioners waive or modify the following standards for a proposed
nontraditional residential development:
            1.   All AICUZ Overlay District requirements and standards (§
154.07), including permitted use restrictions and noise level reduction
requirements;
            2.   Ownership requirements for any open space, buffers or
streetscapes unless otherwise permitted within the UDO;
            3.   Stormwater control and erosion and sedimentation control
requirements of
Chapter 156; and
            4.   Setback reduction below the minimum required by division (C)
(3)(c) below.
         (c)   Dimensional standards for nontraditional residential
developments are provided for in
Chapter 155 and shall be stated on the Master Plan and/or the associated site
plan. A building setback of less than three feet is permitted only where
firewalls are provided in accordance with all applicable Building Code
requirements.
      (4)   Emergency access. Any building established as a part of a
nontraditional residential development which cannot properly be served by
emergency or service vehicles from an abutting street shall be made accessible
to the vehicles by a paved driveway having a roadbed width of not less than 20
feet, exclusive of parking spaces.
      (5)   Transportation and circulation system. The development’s Master
Plan shall demonstrate a logical, adequate, safe and convenient on-site
transportation system that addresses vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian and transit
circulation that connects all residential areas with pedestrian destinations on
and off-site, such as schools, churches, shopping areas and recreational areas.
All elements of the on-site transportation system shall be integrated with all
off-site transportation circulation systems, with particular attention to
minimizing pedestrian/automobile contact.
      (6)   Off-street parking and loading. The development’s Master Plan shall
comply with the off-street parking and loading requirements of
Chapter 157, except that variations from these standards may be permitted if a
comprehensive parking and loading plan for the development is submitted as part
of the Master Plan that is suitable for the development and consistent with the
intent and purpose of the off-street parking and loading standards of the UDO.
      (7)   Landscaping. Landscaping shall comply with the standards of
Chapter 157, except that variations from these standards may be permitted where
it is demonstrated that the proposed landscaping sufficiently buffers uses from
each other, ensures compatibility with land uses on surrounding properties,
creates attractive streetscapes and parking areas, and is consistent with the
urban design objectives and/or character of the area.
      (8)   Utilities.
         (a)   Nontraditional residential lot development projects shall
provide for underground installation of utilities, including telephone and
power in both public and private rights-of-way, except when conditions not
reasonably within the control of the developer make this requirement
unpractical.
         (b)   Every residential and nonresidential lot shall be served by a
water supply system and a sewage disposal system that: is adequate to
accommodate the reasonable needs of the proposed use; and complies with all
applicable City and County Health Department regulations, as specified in
Chapter 150.
      (9)   Areas to be preserved. In all nontraditional residential lot
development projects, efforts shall be made to preserve historic sites, scenic
points, large trees and other desirable natural growths, watercourses and other
water areas, and other features worthy of preservation, either as portions of
public sites and open spaces, or in the other form as to provide amenities to
the neighborhood. Trees or other desirable natural growth located in public or
private rights-of-way or public or private easements shall not be removed
unless the removal is necessary for the installation of utilities or drainage
structures or for other purposes in the public interest. The removal may be
prohibited if the amenity of adjacent property, or the amenity of the general
neighborhood, is adversely affected.
      (10)   Conditions in the Master Plan. In some cases, the ability to
implement or strictly follow the approved Master Plan conditions can be
problematic (i.e., conditions requiring specimen trees to be preserved, but the
trees have subsequently died due to natural causes following the approval). In
those cases, the Planning Director shall implement the condition in a way that
most closely meets its original intent. These situations include, but are not
limited to:
         (a)   Undisturbed buffers/streetscapes required by the Master Plan
which may be beyond the city’s ability to implement due to road widening,
utility relocation, driveways and/or clear sight distance areas; and
         (b)   Specimen or champion trees required by the Master Plan to be
preserved, but which have been removed due to natural consequences or
infrastructure relocation. The Director may decide to permit re-vegetation when
the conditions exist depending upon the extent of the disturbance, the size and
quality of the existing vegetation remaining and the long term viability/
benefit of retaining the existing vegetation.
   (D)   Nontraditional residential lot development; use and development
standards.
      (1)   Permitted uses.
         (a)   All low, medium and high density residential uses and their
accessory uses as listed in
Table 155-8, except those listed in division (D)(2) below.
         (b)   Family care homes (as required by G.S. § 160D-907).
         (c)   Temporary uses intended to serve principally the residents of
the proposed development.
         (d)   Convenience retail and personal services intended to serve
principally the residents of the proposed development.
      (2)   Uses not permitted.
         (a)   Residential:
            1.   Manufactured homes on individual lots, and manufactured home
parks; and
            2.   Other group residential uses besides family care homes.
         (b)   Any retail or service use not intended for the convenient use
of, or intended to principally serve, the residents of the proposed
development;
         (c)   All manufacturing, industrial, wholesale trade uses; and
         (d)   All business repair and construction services, and all resource
production and extraction uses, except pet grooming and veterinary clinics.
      (3)   Development standards.
         (a)   Except as provided in divisions (D)(3)(b) and (c) below, the
development Master Plan shall comply with the development standards and other
requirements for development as provided in §
155.0703, except that variations from these standards may be permitted if
submitted as part of the Master Plan that is suitable for the development and
consistent with the intent and purpose of §
155.0703.
         (b)   Recreation and open space requirements:
            1.   Dedication of recreation land. Each nontraditional residential
lot development (or residential portion of a mixed use development) shall
dedicate recreational open space consistent with the requirements in
Chapter 157;
            2.   Common open space. Each nontraditional residential lot
development (or residential portion of a mixed use development) shall provide

      (15)   M-R(CD) Military Reservation Conditional Zoning District; and
      (16)   G-S(CD) Government Services Conditional Zoning District.
   (B)   District requirements. The development and use of property within a
conditional zoning district is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and
the rules, regulations and conditions imposed as part of the legislative
decision creating the district. All regulations which apply to a general use
zoning district also apply to the corresponding conditional zoning district.
Regulations which apply to a general use zoning district may be varied if
approved as part of the Master Plan during the conditional zoning district
process as described in §
154.03. All other rules, regulations and conditions which may be offered by the
property owner and approved by the Board of Commissioners as part of the
rezoning process shall also apply. Property may be placed in a conditional
zoning district only in response to a petition by the owners of all of the
property proposed to be included in the conditional zoning district.
Requirements for conditional zoning districts are delineated in §
160.12.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 154.06 OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Overlay districts establish certain regulations that are in addition
to those of the underlying general use or conditional zoning districts.
   (B)   Property within a designated overlay district may be used in a manner
permitted in the underlying general use or conditional zoning districts only if
and to the extent the use is also permitted in the applicable overlay district.
   (C)   When any general use or conditional district is also zoned one of the
overlay districts, the most restrictive requirements shall prevail.
   (D)   The following overlay districts are established.
      (1)   (AICUZ) Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Overlay District.
         (a)   The AICUZ Overlay District is established as an overlay district
in which certain types of land uses are restricted to ensure that the impacts
of air base operations in the areas surrounding Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS)
Cherry Point are minimized and prevent any future encroachment by development
incompatible with air base operations.
         (b)   The AICUZ Overlay District is divided into six subdistricts:
four Noise Overlay Zones that correspond to the 65 DNL, 70 DNL, 75 DNL and 80
DNL noise contours and two Accident Potential Zones (APZ), APZ-1 and APZ-II.
Use restrictions within the underlying zoning district (see
Chapter 155) are superseded by the use restrictions specified in the AICUZ
Overlay District (§
154.07) to the extent the use restrictions specified in the AICUZ Overlay
District are more restrictive than those of the underlying zoning district.
         (c)   The boundaries of the AICUZ Overlay District, composed of the
Noise and Accident Potential Overlay Zones described in division (D)(1)(b)
above, are depicted on the city official zoning map, as specified in §
154.06. The boundaries for these overlay zones originate from the map entitled
Figure D-1 Noise Contours in the Aircraft Installation Compatible Use Zone
Study, MCAS Cherry Point, N.C., December 18, 2001. This map, or its more recent
official update, is hereby adopted as authoritative by the city for the
purposes of the AICUZ Overlay District, and is incorporated within and shown on
the city official zoning map.
         (d)   To protect the public health and welfare from the potential
noise and safety impacts of air base operations, §
130.06 of the city code of ordinances specifies that no person shall sell,
lease or offer for sale or lease any property within the city unless the
prospective buyer or lessee has been given a land use disclosure statement as
set forth in that section of the code of ordinances. Affected property owners
are referred to §
130.06 for specifics of this disclosure requirement. This disclosure
requirement is not a zoning requirement. Information concerning this disclosure
requirement is provided in this chapter merely for information purposes only
and the convenience of the public.
      (2)   Flood Hazard Overlay District. The Flood Hazard Overlay District
sets forth regulations that will protect people and property from the hazards
of flooding. This district shall include special flood hazard areas as defined
in
Chapter 156. The regulations applicable to the Flood Hazard Overlay District
are specified in
Chapter 156.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 154.07 AICUZ OVERLAY DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The city finds it necessary and appropriate to adopt the Air
Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Overlay District to provide the
following benefits:
         (a)   Facilitate orderly development within the vicinity of MCAS
Cherry Point;
         (b)   Ensure land use compatibility within noise zones and APZs;
         (c)   Mitigate noise impacts from aircraft overflights; and
         (d)   Contribute to the safe operation of MCAS Cherry Point.
      (2)   The city also finds that nothing in the provisions of this section
is intended to state that objectionable levels of noise from overhead aircraft
will be confined to the limits of the overlay district.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   The AICUZ Overlay District establishes land use compatibility
standards and aircraft noise mitigation measures that are in addition to those
of the underlying general use or conditional zoning districts.
         (a)   The AICUZ Overlay District is divided into six subdistricts:
four noise overlay zones that correspond to the 65 DNL, 70 DNL, 75 DNL and 80
DNL noise contours and two accident potential overlay zones, APZ-I and APZ-II.
         (b)   The boundaries of the noise zones and accident potential overlay
zones are depicted on the official zoning map.
      (2)   New or replacement manufactured homes moved onto an existing
manufactured home space in an existing manufactured home park or manufactured
homes moved onto a single-family lot outside of a manufactured home park are
exempt from the AICUZ Overlay District.
      (3)   The use restrictions of this section shall apply to any application
for a building permit, zoning permit, special exception use permit, conditional
use permit, site plan approval, subdivision plat approval, certificate of
occupancy or vested rights certificate.
      (4)   The noise level reduction standards delineated in §
154.07(D) apply to the establishment of new uses of land and the total
replacement of an existing land use to include the expansion of an existing use
or to structural additions as authorized in §
154.07(D).
      (5)   None of the provisions of the AICUZ Overlay District shall be
construed to prohibit the continuance of any existing land use.
   (C)   Permitted uses and density/intensity requirements.
      (1)   The AICUZ Overlay District contains specific use restrictions and
density/intensity requirements that supersede the restrictions and requirements
contained in
Chapter 155 or other general design and performance standards contained in
Chapter 157.
      (2)   Land usage within the APZ-I and APZ-II subdistricts shall comply
with
Table 154-4, Permitted Uses and Density/Intensity Requirements within Accident
Potential Zones. Land usage within the Noise Overlay subdistricts shall comply
with
Table 154-5, Permitted Uses and Required Noise Level Reduction by Noise Contour
Zones. Both of these tables are located at the end of this chapter.
      (3)   For land uses located within both an APZ and a Noise Contour Zone,
the permissible use requirement of the APZ shall supersede that of the noise
zone. Consequently, if the use is not permitted within the APZ that restriction
shall prevail. If the use is permitted within both the APZ and within the noise
zone, the density and intensity requirements of
Table 154-3 shall be met as well as any noise level reduction requirement
delineated in
Table 154-4 for the noise contour zone within which it is also located.
   (D)   Noise level reduction.
      (1)   The noise level reduction (or attenuation) standards delineated in
this section apply only to the establishment of new uses of land and to the
expansion of an existing use or to structural additions as described in
division (D)(5) below.
      (2)   Land usage within a Noise Contour Zone shall comply with
Table 154-5, Permitted Uses and Required Noise Level Reduction by Noise Contour
Zones.
      (3)   All new land uses shall be designed to achieve the applicable noise
level reduction standard delineated in
Table 154-5. The noise level reduction standard may be achieved by any suitable
combination of building design, building materials and construction standards
so as to reduce the interior noise levels from overhead aircraft flights. Noise
level reduction must be incorporated into all residential structures to ensure
that the interior noise levels within living spaces (not including garages,
sunrooms or porches) do not exceed the applicable standard delineated in
Table 154-5. Noise level reduction must be incorporated into the design and
construction of the portions of nonresidential buildings where the public is
received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level
is low.
      (4)   In the event that the requirements of this section conflict with
the State Building Code, the State Building Code shall prevail.
      (5)   Applicability:
         (a)   Nothing in this division (D) shall require any change in any
lawfully constructed or established building, structure or use in existence at
the time of adoption or amendment of these regulations;
         (b)   The provisions of this division shall apply to any application
for a building permit, certificate of occupancy, zoning, conditional use
permit, special use permit, zoning compliance certificate, vested right
certificate and subdivision/site plan approval;
         (c)   The noise level reduction requirements of this division shall
apply to the construction, alteration, moving, repair, replacement or new use
of any building or occupied permanent structure built using traditional (site
built) or modular (factory built) techniques within the city located within the
Noise Contour Zone as defined in this division; and
         (d)   The provisions of this division shall apply to the following
development activities.
            1.   New construction shall comply with all the applicable
provisions of this division.
            2.   Moved building or structures shall comply with all the
applicable provisions of this division, except as provided in division (F) of
this section.
            3.   Existing structures. Expansions to the building areas, as
specified as follows and as detailed in division (F) of this section, shall be
required to comply with the applicable noise attenuation requirements of this
division.
               a.   If the expansion is less than 50% of the gross floor area
of the original building, only the expansion shall comply with the noise
attenuation requirements.
               b.   If the expansion is greater than or equal to 50% of the
gross floor area of the original building, the entire building shall comply
with all the noise attenuation requirements.
               c.   In addition, repairs and renovations, not resulting in an
expansion of the building gross floor area, but collectively costing more than
50% of the appraised or tax value recorded in the Craven County Tax Record at
the date of application, shall be required to fully comply with the noise
attenuation requirements of this division.
               d.   Structures that are destroyed shall he rebuilt or repaired
in compliance with division (F) of this section.
      (6)   Permitted uses. The Noise Contour Zone contains several general use
zoning districts. Uses permitted in those districts, whether by right or as a
conditional or special exception use, shall be permitted in the Noise Contour
Zone according to the standards and the restrictions as indicated in
Tables 154-4 and
154-5 accordingly, except as provided in division (F) of this section.
      (7)   Noise level reductions. The noise level reduction requirements of
this division may be achieved by one of the following two methods:
         (a)   Complying with the recommended construction methods and
materials shown in divisions (D)(11) through (13) below; or
         (b)   Certification from a registered professional architect or
engineer that when constructed in accordance with approved plans, the building
shall achieve the specified noise level reductions.
      (8)   Required approval.
         (a)   The construction standards of this division shall be applied to
plans and specifications for any proposed structure or use in the Noise Contour
Zone. The Building Inspector shall issue a building permit only when the
applicant can establish that noise level reduction requirements of this
division shall be met prior to the occupancy or use of a building hereafter
erected, altered or moved and/or prior to the change of use of any building or
land.
         (b)   No building or structure that has been erected, moved or
structurally altered may be occupied until the Building Inspector has approved
and issued a certificate of occupancy.
      (9)   Approval procedure.
         (a)   All development activity and subdivisions regulated by the
provision of the Noise Contour Zone are also required to follow all applicable
general land use and subdivision approval procedures contained in the city code
of ordinances.
         (b)   Each application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a
plat or site plan, drawn to scale, showing accurate dimensions of the lot to be
built upon, accurate dimensions of the building to be erected and its location
on the lot.
         (c)   In addition, in the Noise Contour Zone, the applicant shall
submit detailed cross sections of exterior walls, roofs, ceilings and the like,
manufacturer’s specifications of windows, doors, skylights and the like, and
details of the heating, air conditioning and ventilation sufficient for the
Planning and Inspections Department to determine compliance with the provision
of this division. For modular structures, the applicant shall submit these
details to the Planning and Inspections Department for approval prior to
finalizing plans and beginning construction in the factory.
      (10)   Approval criteria.
         (a)   All development activity and subdivisions regulated by the
provisions of the Noise Contour Zone are also required to follow all applicable
regulations of the general district in which the property is located.
         (b)   In addition, the approval criteria shall include the permitted

SLUCM = Standard Land Use Coding Manual, 1965
NEC = Not elsewhere classified
FAR = Floor Area Ratio = Total Building Area divided by Total Lot Area.
Example: A maximum FAR of 0.28 would yield a maximum building area of 7,000 sq.
ft. on a 25,000 sq. foot lot (25,000 x 0.28 = 7,000)

Notes to Table 154-4
   1.   This table delineates allowable use within APZs by general land use
classification. The land use classifications are based upon the Standard Land
Use Coding Manual (SLUCM) classifications but have been modified to accommodate
the specific zoning and land use regulatory needs of the city. Whenever a land
use is proposed, it will be assigned to the SLUCM classification that, in the
opinion of the zoning administrator, most closely reflects the characteristics
of the proposed use. The general use classification, as delineated in this
table, shall be utilized to determine whether or not the proposed use is
permissible within the APZ in which it is proposed to be located. For example,
if a proposed use is assigned SLUCM classification number 5995, the use would
fall under the 5900 general classification and be permissible in accordance
with the specified intensity standard. Whenever a proposed land use has
characteristics of two or more individual land uses, that use shall be
evaluated, on a case-by-case basis, to determine if one or more of the use
characteristics creates an overwhelming incompatibility with the purposes and
objectives of the APZ within which the use is proposed to be located. If, in
the opinion of the zoning administrator, one or more of the proposed use’s
characteristics creates such an incompatibility, the use shall not be permitted
as proposed.
   2.   Other use factors that will be considered in determining allowable
nonresidential uses include labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive
characteristics, air pollution, electronic interference with aircraft, height
of structures and potential glare to pilots.
   3.   Passenger terminals, major above ground transmission lines, broadcast
studios and communication towers are not permitted in APZ-I.
   4.   Low intensity office uses only. Accessory uses such as meeting places,
auditoriums and the like are not permitted.
   5.   Chapels are not allowed within APZ-I or APZ-II.
   6.   Facilities shall be low intensity and include no tot lots and the like.
Facilities such as club houses, meeting places, auditoriums, large classrooms
and the like are not permitted.
   7.   Resource production and extraction uses that produce smoke, glare,
electronic interference or which involve explosives are not permitted.
   8.   Uses and activities that attract concentrations of birds that would
create a hazard to aircraft operations are not permitted.
   9.   Naturally occurring water features (e.g., rivers, lakes, streams,
wetlands) are permitted.
   10.   A combination single-family dwelling unit and nonresidential use
(live/work use) may be permitted in APZ-II provided that: the density of the
residential portion does not exceed the maximum density for single-family
detached dwellings (SLUCM # 1100.1); and the nonresidential portion is an
allowable use within the APZ-II and it does not exceed the specified maximum
FAR for its assigned use classification.
   11.   Mixed uses on a single lot or within a single structure are allowable,
provided that each proposed individual use comprising the mixed use is
allowable within the APZ in which proposed to be located; and that each
proposed individual use comprising the mixed use complies with the specified
maximum FAR for its assigned use classification.
   12.   Uses that produce or generate VOCs (Volatile Organic Chemicals) are
not permitted.
   13.   No structure shall exceed 10,000 square feet in size.
   14.   Manufactured or mobile homes either within or outside of a mobile home
park are exempt from the AICUZ Overlay District.

Notes to Table 154-5
   1.   This table delineates allowable use within noise contour zones by
general land use classification. The land use classifications are based upon
the Standard Land Use Coding Manual (SLUCM) classifications but have been
modified to accommodate the specific zoning and land use regulatory needs of
the city. Whenever a land use is proposed, it will be assigned to the SLUCM
classification that, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, most closely
reflects the characteristics of the proposed use. The general use
classification, as delineated in this table, shall be utilized to determine
whether or not the proposed use is permitted within the noise contour zone in
which it is proposed to be located. For example, if a proposed use is assigned
SLUCM classification number 5995, the use would fall under the 5900 general
classification.
Columns a, c, e and g indicate whether or not a particular use is allowed
within the applicable noise contour zone (DNL 65, 60, 75 or 80). A “Yes” in
these columns indicates that the land use delineated in the “Land Use” column
is permitted outright or is permitted provided compliance with the specified
restrictions is achieved. A “No” in these columns indicates that the land use
delineated in the “Land Use” column is not permitted.
Columns b, d, f and h indicate the noise level reduction level, if any, that
must be achieved to make the use compatible and permissible; and/or the
specific restriction, if any, placed on the use to make it permissible. “25dB”,
“30dB” or “35dB” in these columns indicate the noise level reduction standard
that must be incorporated into the design and construction of structures in
order to make the use permissible. References to notations which outline
specific restrictions applicable to particular land uses are also delineated in
these columns.
Measures to achieve the specified NLR standard for nonresidential uses must be
incorporated into the design and construction of the portions of the buildings
where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive area or where the
normal noise level is low. Generally, the noise level reduction design
standards apply to all new structures and/or new uses of land and under
specific circumstances as defined in division (E) above, to enlargements,
extensions and replacements. The noise level reduction design standards do not,
however, apply to a manufactured home moved onto an existing manufactured home
park space.
Noise level reduction standards do not eliminate or mitigate outdoor noise
problems. However, building location, site planning and design and use of berms
and barriers may help to mitigate outdoor noise exposure.
Whenever a proposed land use has characteristics of two or more individual land
uses, that use shall be evaluated, on a case-by-case basis, to determine if one
or more of the use characteristics creates an overwhelming incompatibility with
the noise contour zone within which the use is proposed to be located. If, in
the opinion of the zoning administrator, one or more of the proposed use’s
characteristics creates such an incompatibility, the use shall not be permitted
as proposed.
   2.   Measures to achieve the indicated Noise Level Reduction must be
incorporated if the use is a noise sensitive use. If the use is not a noise
sensitive use, it is allowable without noise attenuation measures.
   3.   Permitted if special sound reinforcement systems are installed.
   4.   Residential buildings require a NLR of 25.
   5.   Residential buildings require a NLR of 30.
   6.   Residential buildings are not permitted.
   7.   Any use in existence at the time of adoption of this ordinance that is
shown as “Not” Allowable on this table can only be reconstructed after being
completely destroyed if it: meets a noise level reduction consistent with what
is required for similar permitted uses in this table; and it meets all other
requirements as listed in division (E) above. For this provision, land uses
will be treated similarly by main SLUCM Classification and Noise Contour Zone.
For example:
      a.   To rebuild SLUCM No.’s 1100, 1200, 1300 or 1900 in a 75 DNL Contour
under this provision would require a 35dB NLR.
      b.   To rebuild SLUCM No.’s 4700 or 4900 in an 80 DNL Contour under this
provision would require a 35dB NLR.
   8.   The largest NLR required for any use in this table is 35dB.
   9.   Manufactured homes (SLUCM No. 1400) located either within or outside of
a mobile home park are exempt from the AICUZ Overlay District.

§ 155.01 PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Table of permitted uses.
      (1)   Within each zoning district indicated on the official zoning map
and subject to all requirements and conditions specified in the UDO, land,
buildings and structures shall only be used and buildings and structures shall
only be erected, which are intended or designed to be used for uses listed in
the Table of Permitted Uses,
Table 155-8.
      (2)   In the appropriate columns of
Table 155-8, uses permitted by right, are indicated by a “P”, uses requiring a
special use permit are indicated by a “S” and uses requiring rezoning to a
conditional zoning district are indicated by “CD”. Uses listed as “S/CD” may be
subject to a special use permit or conditional zoning district depending upon
whether the use is existing or considered as part of the overall conditional
zoning district request.
      (3)   Uses listed in
Table 155-8 are subject to meeting additional development standards if the
“Additional Development Standards Required” column contains specific references
to §
155.07. Zoning permit applications thus designated shall demonstrate how
compliance with the indicated development standards will be achieved. These
additional development standards are in addition to the required development
standards for new development. Special use permit applications must also comply
with the indicated development standards as well as any additional standards or
conditions required by the Board of Adjustment. Conditional Zoning District
applications must also comply with the indicated development standards as well
as any additional standards or conditions required by the Board of
Commissioners.
      (4)   A blank space in the table indicates that a particular use is not
permitted. Should there be a discrepancy between the Table of Permitted Uses
and any other section of the UDO as to a use being permitted, the Table of
Permitted Uses shall prevail.
      (5)   A blank space in the Table of Permitted Uses for G-S Government
Services and M-R Military Reservation is subject to approval and review
authority of the city and/or the MCAS Cherry Point.
      (6)   Exempt uses are indicated by an “E” in
Table 155-8.
   (B)   Formulation of permitted use table.
      (1)   The Standard Land-Use Coding Manual (SLUCM), 1965, was utilized in
the preparation of this table and shall be referred to as a guide for purposes
of interpretation by the Zoning Administrator. SLUCM numbers are used to refer
to land use classifications. Entries with “0" in the Reference SLUCM column do
not correspond to any classification in the SLUCM.
      (2)   The SLUCM, as used for the Permitted Use Table, was last used in
1967 by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis to classify
land uses, but is currently not in active use. Other variations of SLUCM are
currently in active use by some federal agencies. An archive manual showing the
complete SLUCM classification system was retrieved from the American Planning
Association Research web site, under the name, “RClassSysSLUCM” . When a use is
not listed in the Permitted Use Table, the Zoning Administrator shall classify
it with that use in the above named SLUCM most similar to it. This SLUCM shall
serve as a guide in classifying any unlisted use. If the Zoning Administrator
should determine that a use is not listed and is not similar to a use in the
Permitted Use Table, then the use is prohibited.
      (3)   Rental and leasing of any commodity shall be permitted under the
same classification and in the same districts, as are sales of that commodity,
unless rental or leasing of that commodity is listed separately in the
Permitted Use Table.
   (C)   Change in use.
      (1)   A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the
essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This
occurs whenever:
         (a)   The change involves a change from one principal use category to
another;
         (b)   If the original use is a combination use, the relative
proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the
combination use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the
overall use are altered;
         (c)    If the original use is a combination use, the mixture of types
of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes; or
         (d)   If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot
(regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual
principal use or a combination use), that business or enterprise moves out and
a different type of enterprise moves in (even though the new business or
enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use
category as the previous type of business). For example, if there is only one
building on a lot and an office, that is the sole tenant of that building moves
out and is replaced by a clothing store, that constitutes a change in use.
However, if the office were replaced by another office, that would not
constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not
have changed. Moreover, if a floral shop moved out of a rented space in a
shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute
a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and the
essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping center-
combination use) has not changed.
            1.   A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to
occupied or vice-versa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in
use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property
without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have
been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180
consecutive days or has been abandoned.
            2.   A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a
change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use.
   (D)   Combination uses. When a combination use comprises two or more
principal uses that require different types of permits (zoning, special use and
conditional zoning district), then the permit authorizing the combination use
shall be:
      (1)   A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires
a special use permit;
      (2)   A conditional zoning district request if the development site
requires a conditional zoning district for the proposed uses; or
      (3)   A zoning permit in all other cases.
   (E)   Mixed uses. A mixed use is one in which a residential use and a
commercial use may exist in the same unit. This definition does not exempt
permitted mixed uses from complying with the State Building Code.
   (F)   Accessory uses.
      (1)   Whenever an activity is conducted in conjunction with another
principal use and the former use: constitutes only an incidental or
insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot; or is
customarily associated with the principal use and integrally related to it,
then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may
be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal
use.
      (2)   For purposes of interpreting division (F)(1) above:
         (a)   A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is
incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal
use; and
         (b)   To be “customarily associated” with a principal use it is not
necessary for an accessory use to be connected with the principal use more
times than not, but only that the association of the accessory use with the
principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common
acceptance of their relatedness.
      (3)   
Table 155-8, Table of Permitted Uses, outlines the zoning districts in which
specific accessory uses are allowed. See also §
155.02 for dimensional standards for accessory structures.
   (G)   Temporary uses. Temporary uses are established for a limited duration
not to exceed 180 days, with the intent to discontinue the use upon the
expiration of the time period.
Table 155-8, Table of Permitted Uses outlines the zoning districts in which
temporary uses are allowed. See also §
155.0704 for specific standards and requirements for certain temporary uses.
   (H)   Prohibited uses. Within certain overlay districts some uses are
specifically prohibited. In addition to those uses listed in
Chapter 154, the following uses are prohibited or restricted in the districts
as listed. Open storage in Business and Manufacturing Zoning Districts: in the
N-B, H-C and O&I zoning districts, open storage is not permitted. In L-I and H-
I zoning districts, outdoor storage is permitted for uses such as building
materials sales, plumbing and heating supply houses, contractor offices and
storage yards, industrial supplies and equipment sales. However, all outdoor
storage must be enclosed by a solid fence at least six feet in height and
landscaped in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 157.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 155.02 DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Table of density and dimensional requirements. The density and
dimensional requirements for all general zoning districts and uses are found in
Table 155-9, Table of Density and Dimensional Requirements.
   (B)   Accessory uses, buildings and structures. The following requirements
are for accessory uses, buildings and structures. Other accessory uses may have
additional development requirements found in §
155.0704. Supplementary dimensional requirements are also found in §
155.03. Accessory uses, buildings and structures shall not be placed within an
easement.
      (1)   Setback and location requirements.
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be located in front yards.

setback a minimum of seven feet from the rear and side yard lot lines.
         (d)   All accessory structures shall be located in rear yards and
shall be no closer than seven feet to rear and side yard lot lines.
         (e)   Accessory structures or buildings shall not be located closer
than the principal building setback on the street side yard. Accessory
structures or buildings located in the side yard adjacent to the street yard
must be screened by an enclosed privacy fence.
         (f)   An accessory structure or building except utility substations
and similar appurtenances shall not be erected in any easements.
      (2)   Lot coverage. The land coverage of principal and accessory
buildings shall not exceed the maximum lot coverage shown in
Table 155-9, provided that unattached accessory buildings shall not occupy more
than 30% of the rear yard.
      (3)   Maximum height. The height of all accessory structures and
buildings shall comply with maximum height requirements of the zoning district
in which located (
Table 155-9). However, all accessory building setbacks shall increase one foot
for every one foot increase in height over 15 feet.
      (4)   Prohibition of manufactured home as an accessory storage building.
Manufactured homes shall not be used as an accessory building for storage
purposes or any other use other than a single-family dwelling unit or temporary
security residence pursuant to §
155.0713(H).
      (5)   Parking of recreational vehicles in residential areas.
         (a)   The parking of recreational vehicles (RVs) in the driveways of
residential dwellings shall be considered an accessory use. RVs shall not be
occupied as temporary or permanent dwellings.
         (b)   RVs shall not be used for living, sleeping or housekeeping
purposes when parked or stored on a residential lot, or on any lot not approved
for the use, except that the vehicle may be used to house out-of-town guests,
on a non-fee basis, for a period not to exceed 14 continuous days. Further
provided, that utility hookups shall be limited to electrical.
         (c)   RVs may be parked or stored on a residential lot 20 feet from
the street edge or curb, provided, however, that the vehicle may be parked
anywhere on the residential premises for a period not to exceed eight hours
during loading or unloading.
         (d)   This section does not apply to temporary housing allowed after a
disaster declaration.
   (C)   Fences and walls.
      (1)   In all zoning districts, fences in yards shall not impede vehicular
visibility or movement at any intersection on the edge of driveways with street
lines; nor shall they encroach on the right-of-way of a street.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall preclude, however, the installation
of temporary fences around construction work sites, erected or maintained
pursuant to the State Building Code or soil erosion and sedimentation control
requirements.
      (3)   The following fence types are permitted in all zoning districts:
         (a)   Masonry or stone walls;

prisons or correctional facilities.
      (5)   Fences shall be maintained in a safe manner, plumb (vertical) to
the ground. Fences no longer maintained in a safe manner through neglect, lack
of repair, manner of construction, method of placement or otherwise, shall be
repaired, replaced or removed at the property owner’s expense.
      (6)   Fence height:
         (a)   Residential uses. Fences in yards shall not exceed four feet in
height in the front yard and six feet in height in the side and rear yards. A
fence shall not exceed four feet in height within 15 feet of any public or
private street right-of-way. In any case a fence shall not exceed eight feet in
height;
         (b)   Recreational, agricultural and mining uses. A fence shall not
exceed six feet in height unless the fence observes the required principal

§ 155.03 SUPPLEMENTARY DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Structures permitted above height limits.
      (1)   Except as otherwise prohibited by the UDO, a district’s height
limitations shall not apply to the following uses, provided the structures meet
the required State Building Code, however, features, appurtenances or
structures shall not be higher than Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) standards for
airport approach clear zones.
         (a)   Architectural features and mechanical appurtenances such as
church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, antennas, ventilators or chimneys
which occupy no greater than 5% of the total area of a building; and

   The development standards listed herein are additional to other requirements
in the UDO. These development standards are use-specific and apply to those
uses designated with a “P” in
Table 155-8, Table of Permitted Uses. Uses requiring approval of a special use
permit (designated with an “S” in
Table 155-8) shall also be subject to these standards as well as any additional
standards or conditions required by the Board of Adjustment. Requests to a
Conditional Zoning District (designated with a CD in
Table 155-8) shall also be subject to these standards as well as any additional
standards or conditions required by the Board of Commissioners. Permit
applications and site plans for these uses shall demonstrate how compliance
with the applicable development standards will be achieved. Should there be a
discrepancy between the Table of Permitted Uses and any other section of the
UDO as to a use being permitted, the Table of Permitted Uses shall prevail.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 155.0702 Development Standards for All Uses.
   The following rules apply to all development standards and uses listed
below.

maximum number of units allowed per acre for each housing type shall be the
same as that permitted for the zoning district in which the use is located.
   (C)   Outdoor lighting. Outdoor lighting structures shall be located,
angled, shielded or limited in intensity so as to cast no direct light upon
adjacent property and to avoid the creation of a visual safety hazard to
passing motorists. All new development and redevelopment located within the
Accident Potential Zone that provide for outdoor lighting shall require the use
of cutoff and semi-cutoff high sodium vapor lighting. Outdoor lighting shall
comply with the standards delineated in
Chapter 157.
   (D)   Noise levels. Unless otherwise specified herein, noncompliance with
the noise level limits established by the UDO shall mean exceeding the
specified noise limit for five or more of any 25 consecutive readings taken at
ten-second intervals when measured at any point beyond the property line of the
property from which the noise originates. As a continuing condition of
approval, all uses shall comply with the requirements delineated in
Chapter 93 of the city code of ordinances. If any requirement in the UDO
exceeds those of the city code, the more restrictive standard shall apply.
   (E)   Landscaping and buffering. Unless a more stringent requirement is
specifically specified elsewhere in this chapter, the minimum screening,
buffering and landscaping standards contained in
Chapter 157 are applicable to all uses.
   (F)   Parking and signage. Unless a more stringent or alternative
requirement is specifically specified elsewhere in this chapter, the minimum
parking and signage standards delineated in
Chapter 157 shall apply.

§ 155.0705 Development Standards for Manufacturing and Industrial Uses.
   Development standards applicable to particular manufacturing and industrial
uses identified in
Table 155-8, Table of Permitted Uses, include the following.
   (A)   (Reserved).
   (B)   (Reserved).
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 155.0706 Development Standards for Towers, Qualified Small Wireless
Facilities, Utility Facilities, and Wind Energy Facilities/Turbines.
   The city has a vested economic interest in preserving, maintaining, and
sustaining land uses that are compatible with military activities at MCAS
Cherry Point. Development located proximate to MCAS Cherry Point has been
identified as a critical issue impacting the long-term viability of the
military in the city. Additional concerns associated with development include
loss of access to air space and river and other marine areas and radio
frequency encroachment. The construction of towers and wind energy facilities
in areas surrounding MCAS Cherry Point is of utmost concern to the city because
those structures may interfere with or impede the military's ability to carry
out activities that are vital to its function and future presence. In addition
to the purposes set forth in §
152.04, this section regulates communications towers of all types that exceed
50 feet in height and wind energy facilities or turbines for the purpose of
protecting military training and deployment operations. This section shall be
implemented consistent with the city's commitment to avoiding encroachment on
MCAS Cherry Point and avoiding interference with the military's control of
airspace.
   Development standards applicable to particular transportation, communication
and utilities uses identified in
Table 155-8, Table of Permitted Uses, are set forth below. Note: Communications
towers that are less than 50 feet in height are governed by §
155.0704(A). For the purposes of this section, "towers" means any and all
communications towers and all other radio or television towers except for
qualified small wireless facilities and public safety towers.
   (A)   Towers.
      (1)   Additional requirements. The following shall be required of all
towers constructed following the enactment of the UDO, whether approved through
the administrative or special use approval processes.
         (a)   Towers are only permitted in the AICUZ Overlay District pursuant
to §§
154.07 et seq. and
Table 154-4.
         (b)   The tower shall not encroach upon or otherwise interfere with
the mission, training, or operations of MCAS Cherry Point. For those towers
requiring a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment shall consider whether
the proposed tower would cause interference with air navigation routes, air
traffic control areas, military training routes, or radar based on the written
statement received from the U.S. Marine Corps, Department of the Navy, or the
Department of Defense. The Board of Adjustment shall also consider any written
statements or oral comments submitted during an evidentiary hearing on the
application. If the Board of Adjustment does not receive a written statement or
request for additional time to respond from the military within 90 days of
issuance of the city’s request to the base commander, the Board of Adjustment
may deem that the tower does not interfere with the military.
         (c)   The perimeter around the base of the tower and all guy anchors
shall be surrounded by a security fence or wall at least eight feet in height,
unless the entirety of the tower and guy anchor(s) are mounted on a structure
above eight feet in height. The guy anchors may be fenced separately in order
to comply with the requirements of this division.
         (d)   Before any tower is approved, a site plan showing location and
height of existing and proposed towers(s), guys and the like, along with
proposed accessory structures or equipment, proposed landscaping, screening,
points of ingress and egress, and any other features that are proposed or
existing shall be submitted and approved.
         (e)   Towers shall be of the monopole type (that is, non-lattice or
other multi-poled structure), unless the applicant shows by a preponderance of
the evidence that the applicant's purposes are reasonable and could not be
accomplished with a monopole tower.
         (f)   Buildings associated with a tower within a residential zoning
district shall not be used as an employment center for any worker. This
provision does not prohibit periodic maintenance or monitoring of equipment,
instruments or anything else on the site.
         (g)   Commercial advertising shall not be allowed on a tower or any of
its related facilities. However, an identification wall sign is allowed on any
accessory structure, provided the sign does not exceed 10% of the wall area.
         (h)   Engineering evidence must be presented which demonstrates that
the proposed use meets all FAA standards, presents no threat to aviation
standards, or to persons or property by reason of unusual exposure to aviation
hazards. The evidence shall consist of engineering certification that, in the
event of collapse, the tower's structure shall crumble in such a way that it
will not threaten persons or property on adjoining lots. The cost of all
engineering evidence shall be at the expense of the applicant. In addition, the
applicant shall provide proof of adequate insurance coverage, covering damages
of the facility itself and all surrounding property before any permits are
issued.
         (i)   The maximum height of any privately owned and operated tower is
200 feet whether the tower is free-standing or placed on an existing structure.
The maximum height of public safety towers is 500 feet.
         (j)   The minimum lot size requirements for any tower up to 200 feet
in height shall be two acres. The minimum lot size does not apply if facilities
are located on existing structures or buildings. Consideration of placing
towers on existing structures is encouraged.
         (k)   No outside storage shall be allowed on any tower facility site.
         (l)   Any driveway accessing a tower facility shall be paved, at least
20 feet wide, and well maintained. Such drives shall have recorded easements,
where appropriate.
         (m)   The setback distance from existing property lines in all zoning
districts for all towers shall be 100 feet, or one foot for every one foot of
tower height, whichever is greater.
         (n)   Before any permit is issued for the construction of a tower,
each applicant for approval of any new tower shall provide the Zoning
Administrator with an inventory of existing towers located within a one mile
radius of the proposed tower, including specific information concerning
location, height, and design of each tower. The applicant shall also provide
sound engineering evidence as to why any proposed use could not be accomplished
by collocating onto existing towers.
         (o)   The applicant must provide documentation that the proposed tower
complies with Federal Radio-Frequency Emission standards.
         (p)   Towers shall not be allowed within the front yard of any
existing development within any zoning district.
         (q)   All lighting of towers must comply with FAA standards. No
lighting shall present a glare to any adjoining properties or into any public
right-of-way or a nuisance to pilots.
         (r)   Towers shall not be constructed within one mile of another free
standing telecommunications site.
      (2)   Structures not subject to the requirement of this section.
         (a)   Any tower of less than 50 feet in height erected solely for
residential or non-commercial (civic, religious and the like) use such as
television antennas, satellite dishes or amateur radio antennas. The structure
shall, however, comply with all other applicable requirements of the UDO.
         (b)   Telephone or utility poles erected for the sole purpose of
providing basic electrical coverage or non-cellular telephone coverage.
         (c)   Alternative freestanding tower structures such as clocks,
steeples, bell towers and the like, which are not used for telecommunications
purposes. The structure shall, however, comply with all other applicable
requirements of the UDO.
         (d)   Qualified small wireless facilities.
         (e)   Public safety communications towers equal to or less than 200
feet in height as defined in §
155.0706(C).
      (3)   Administrative approval. The following uses may be approved by the
Zoning Administrator after an administrative review is conducted. The approval
shall be contingent on the satisfaction of criteria listed in subsection (1)
above.
         (a)   Installation of an antenna on any existing structure other than
a residential structure (such as a nonresidential building or water tower) that
is greater than 50 feet in height so long as the addition adds no more than 20
feet to the height of the existing structure.
         (b)   Installation of an antenna on any existing structure other than
a residential structure (such as a nonresidential building or water tower) that
is less than 50 feet in height, so long as the addition adds no more than 20
feet, or doubles the total height of building, whichever is less.
         (c)   Installation of an antenna on an existing tower of any height,
including the placement of additional buildings directly related to the use, so
long as the antenna adds no more than 20 feet, or 25%, whichever is greater, to
the height of the existing tower.
      (4)   Special use permit. All newly constructed towers shall require a
special use permit, issued by the Board of Adjustment after public hearing. At
the hearing, in addition to meeting the general requirements set forth in the
UDO for the issuance of special use permits, the applicant must provide
evidence that the applicant has investigated other means for locating proposed
facilities than construction of a new tower. The alternative means shall
consist of, but are not limited to, consolidating the proposed facility onto an
existing tower, stealth technology or constructed so that it would be permitted
as an administratively approved use. The evidence shall consist of the
following.
         (a)   The applicant shall send letters to all owners of existing
towers within one mile radius of the proposed tower requesting the following
information:
            1.   Tower height;
            2.   Existing and planned tower uses;
            3.   Assessment of existing tower’s ability to accommodate proposed
antenna without causing radio frequency disturbance or instability; and
            4.   If subsection (3) above cannot be met, an evaluation of
whether existing tower could be modified so as to support an additional antenna
without producing electromagnetic interference.
         (b)   A copy of all responses of the letter required by division (A)
(4)(a) above.
         (c)   A summary explanation of why the applicant believes the proposed
tower cannot be located on an existing tower.
         (d)   Presentation of sound engineering evidence which demonstrates
that the location of a new tower rather than the addition onto an existing
tower is necessary to avoid interference; is in the interest of public safety;
is technologically necessary; or is more practical in any other relevant way.
         (e)   Sound engineering evidence that the communication tower is
designed to support at least one additional telecommunications provider, and a
statement that, if commercially reasonable, the owner would be willing to
accommodate additional user(s) to attach communications additions onto the
proposed tower, so long as the addition(s) does not interfere with the
functional purpose of the tower.
         (f)   Evidence that the proposed tower, if permitted, meets all the
requirements established by the UDO.
   (B)   Qualified small wireless facilities.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to:
         (a)   Minimize the impacts of small wireless facilities on surrounding
areas by establishing standards for location, structural integrity and
compatibility;
         (b)   Encourage the location and collocation of small wireless
facilities equipment on existing structures thereby minimizing new visual,
aesthetic, and public safety impacts, and to reduce the need for additional
antenna-supporting structures;
         (c)   Encourage coordination between suppliers of small wireless
facilities;

its citizens and businesses to enjoy the benefits of wireless communications
services; and
         (h)   Encourage the use of existing buildings and structures as
locations for small wireless facilities infrastructure so as to minimize the
aesthetic impacts of related infrastructure.
      (2)   It is not the purpose or intent of this section to prohibit or have
the effect of prohibiting wireless communications services; unreasonably
discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication
services; regulate the placement, construction or modification of wireless
communications facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio
frequency emissions where it is demonstrated that the small wireless facility
does or will comply with applicable FCC regulations; or prohibit or effectively
prohibit collocations or modification that the city must approve under state or
federal law. The provisions of this Section are in addition to, and do not
replace, any obligations an applicant may have under any franchises, licenses,
encroachments, or other permits issued by the city.
      (3)   Siting. To protect the aesthetics of the city, to minimize new
visual, aesthetic, and public safety impacts, and to reduce the need for
additional antenna-supporting structures, the city prefers that small wireless
facilities be collocated on existing utility poles or wireless support
structures in the public right of way, concealed, and have their accessory
equipment mounted on the utility pole or wireless support structure. These
preferences are intended as guidance for development of an application for
small wireless facilities.

(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 156.02 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION.
   (A)   Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives.
      (1)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of North
Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Article 6 of Chapter 153A;
Article 8 of Chapter 160A; and Articles 7, 9 and 11 of Chapter 160D of the
North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the
responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Havelock, North Carolina,
does ordain as follows:
      (2)   Findings of fact.
         (a)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of
Havelock are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
         (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities
and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other
hazards.
      (3)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to
promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions
designed to:
         (a)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging
increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
         (b)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
         (c)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
         (d)    Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development
that may increase erosion or flood damage; and
         (e)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
      (4)   Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are to:
         (a)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
         (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
         (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         (d)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
         (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
          (f)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
         (g)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the
National Flood Insurance Program;
         (h)    Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
         (i)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas; and
         (j)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a
Special Flood Hazard Area.
   (B)   Definitions.  Unless specifically defined in
Chapter 163, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as
to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance
it's most reasonable application.
   (C)   General provisions.
      (1)   Lands to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall apply
to all Special Flood Hazard Areas within the jurisdiction, including the
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction of the City of Havelock.
      (2)   Basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas. The Special
Flood Hazard Areas are those identified under the Cooperating Technical State
(CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its FIS dated
June 19, 2020 for Craven County and associated DFIRM panels, including any
digital data developed as part of the FIS, which are adopted by reference and
declared a part of this ordinance and all revisions thereto.
      (3)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A Floodplain
Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities within
Special Flood Hazard Areas determined in accordance with the provisions of §
156.02(C)(2) of this ordinance.
      (4)   Compliance.  No structure or land shall hereafter be located,
extended, converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance
with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
      (5)   Abrogation and greater restrictions.  This ordinance is not
intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
      (6)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
ordinance, all provisions shall be:
         (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
         (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
         (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under State statutes.
      (7)   Warning and disclaimer of liability.  The degree of flood
protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger
floods can and will occur. Actual flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the Special
Flood Hazard Areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Havelock or by any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative
decision lawfully made hereunder.
      (8)   Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this
ordinance or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including
violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of
variance or special exceptions, shall be enforced by any one or all of the
procedures identified in §
162.04. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of
its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $100.00
or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the City of Havelock from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
   (D)   Administration.
      (1)   Designation of floodplain administrator. The Planning Director,
hereinafter referred to as the "Floodplain Administrator", or their designee,
is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this
ordinance. In instances where the Floodplain Administrator receives assistance
from others to complete tasks to administer and implement this ordinance, the
Floodplain Administrator shall be responsible for the coordination and
community's overall compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program and
the provisions of this ordinance. 
      (2)   Floodplain development application, permit and certification
requirements.
         (a)   Application requirements. Application for a Floodplain

            1.   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall
only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
            2.   Shall not be temperature-controlled or conditioned;
            3.   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at
least to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation; and
            4.   Shall include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
               b.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least
one (1) square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
               c.   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each
enclosed area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically
enter and exit;
               d.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no
higher than one (1) foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent
grade;
               e.    Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions; and
               f.    Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
            5.   Shall, in Coastal High Hazard Areas (Zone VE), meet the
requirements of §
156.02(E)(7).
            6.   Property owners shall be required to execute and record a non-
conversion agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring that the
area below the lowest floor shall not be improved, finished or otherwise
converted to habitable space; the City of Havelock will have the right to
inspect the enclosed area. This agreement shall be recorded with the Craven
County Register of Deeds and shall transfer with the property in perpetuity.
            7.   Release of restrictive covenant. If a property which is bound
by a non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed areas below BFE,
then the owner may request release of restrictive covenant after staff
inspection and submittal of confirming documentation.
         (e)   Additions/improve ments.
            1.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
               a.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more non-conforming than the existing structure.
               b.   A substantial improvement, with modifications/
rehabilitations/ improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is
structurally modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing
structure and the addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
            2.   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/ improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
            3.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
               a.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction
consistent with the code and requirements for the original structure.
               b.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
            4.   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a ten
year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market
value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply
with the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the
ten year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance.
Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement
does not, however, include either:
               a.   Any project for improvement of a building required to
correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the
building official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living
conditions.
               b.   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
         (f)   Recreational vehicles.  Recreational vehicles shall either:
            1.   Temporary placement
               a.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
               b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and
has no permanently attached additions.)
            2.   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet
the limitations of Temporary Placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
         (g)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
            1.   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
            2.   The name, address, and phone number of the individual

removed (i.e., minimum of seventy-two (72) hours before landfall of a hurricane
or immediately upon flood warning notification);
            4.   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the
entity responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
            5.    Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location
outside the Special Flood Hazard Area, to which the temporary structure will be
moved.
         (h)   Accessory structures.  When accessory structures (sheds,
detached garages, and the like) are to be placed within a Special Flood Hazard
Area, the following criteria shall be met:
            1.   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation

hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation in conformance with the provisions of §
156.02(E)(2)(d)4.
            9.   An accessory structure with a footprint less than one hundred
fifty (150) or that is a minimal investment of $5,000 or less and satisfies the
criteria outlined above is not required to meet the elevation or floodproofing
standards of §
156.02(E)(2)(b). Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all
other accessory structures in accordance with §
156.02(D)(2)(c);
         (i)   Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within
a Special Flood Hazard Area, the following criteria shall be met:

shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads during conditions of the design flood,
including the effects of buoyancy assuming the tank is empty;
            2.    Above-ground tanks, elevated. Above-ground tanks in flood
hazard areas shall be elevated to or above the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation on a supporting structure that is designed to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement during conditions of the design flood. Tank-
supporting structures shall meet the foundation requirements of the applicable
flood hazard area;
            3.    Above-ground tanks, not elevated.  Above-ground tanks that do
not meet the elevation requirements of §
156.02 (E)(2)(b) of this ordinance shall not be permitted in V or VE Zones.
Tanks may be permitted in other flood hazard areas provided the tanks are
designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist all flood-related and
other loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of the design
flood and without release of contents in the floodwaters or infiltration by
floodwaters into the tanks. Tanks shall be designed, constructed, installed,
and anchored to resist the potential buoyant and other flood forces acting on
an empty tank during design flood conditions.
            4.   Tank inlets and vents. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and
vents shall be:
               a.   At or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation or

156.02(E)(6) of this ordinance.
            3.   Roads and watercourse crossings in regulated floodways and
NEAs. Roads and watercourse crossings, including roads, bridges, culverts, low-
water crossings and similar means for vehicles or pedestrians to travel from
one side of a watercourse to the other side, that encroach into regulated
floodways shall meet the limitations of §
156.02(E)(6) of this ordinance.
            4.    Commercial storage facilities are not considered "limited
storage" as noted in this ordinance, and shall be protected to the Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation as required for commercial structures.
      (3)   Reserved.
      (4)   Standards for floodplains without established base flood
elevations. Within the Special Flood Hazard Areas designated as Approximate
Zone A and established in §
156.02 (C)(2), where no BFE data has been provided by FEMA, the following
provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
156.02 (E)(1), shall apply:
         (a)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of twenty
(20) feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream,
whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         (b)   The BFE used in determining the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria:
            1.   When BFE data is available from other sources, all new
construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply
with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be elevated or
floodproofed in accordance with standards in §
156.02(E)(1) and (2).
            2.   When floodway or non-encroachment data is available from a
Federal, State, or other source, all new construction and substantial
improvements within floodway and non-encroachment areas shall also comply with
the requirements of §
156.02(E)(2) and (6).
            3.   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development
proposals shall provide BFE data if development is greater than five acres or
has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home sites. Such BFE data shall be
adopted by reference in accordance with §
156.02(C)(2) and utilized in implementing this ordinance.
            4.   When BFE data is not available from a Federal, State, or other
source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated or floodproofed
(nonresidential) to or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation, as
defined in § 156.02(B). All other applicable provisions of §
156.02(E)(2) shall also apply.
      (5)   Standards for riverine floodplains with base flood elevations but
without established floodways or non-encroachment areas. Along rivers and
streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source
but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are identified for a Special
Flood Hazard Area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements
shall apply to all development within such areas:
         (a)   Standards of §
156.02(E)(1) and (2); and
         (b)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is
designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless certification
with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at
any point.
      (6)   Floodways and non-encroachment areas. Areas designated as floodways
or non-encroachment areas are located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas
established in §
156.02 (C)(2). The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous
areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry
debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to
standards outlined in §
156.02 (E)(1) and (2), shall apply to all development within such areas:
         (a)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
            1.   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain
Administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
            2.   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six
months of completion of the proposed encroachment.
         (b)    If §
156.02(E)(6)(a) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of this ordinance.
         (c)   Manufactured homes may be permitted provided the following
provisions are met:
            1.   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
156.02(E)(2)(c); and
            2.   The encroachment standards of §
156.02(E)(6)(a).
      (7)   Coastal high hazard area (Zone VE).  Coastal High Hazard Areas are
Special Flood Hazard Areas established in §
156.02 (C)(2), and designated as Zones VE. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with high velocity waters from storm surges or seismic
activity and, therefore, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall meet the following provisions in addition to the provisions of §
156.02 (E)(1) and (2):
         (a)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall:
            1.   Be located landward of the reach of mean high tide;
            2.   Comply with all applicable CAMA setback requirements.
         (b)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation. Floodproofing shall not be utilized on any
structures in Coastal High Hazard Areas to satisfy the regulatory flood
protection elevation requirements.
         (c)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest
floor either be free of obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls, open
wood latticework or insect screening, provided they are not part of the
structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under
abnormally high tides or wave action without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system or otherwise
jeopardizing the structural integrity of the building. The following design
specifications shall be met:
            1.   Material shall consist of open wood or plastic lattice having
at least 40% of its area open, or
            2.   Insect screening; or
            3.   Breakaway walls shall meet the following design
specifications:
               a.    Breakaway walls shall have flood openings that allow for
the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters to minimize damage caused by
hydrostatic loads, per §
156.02(E)(2)(d)(a-f); and
               b.    Design safe loading resistance shall be not less than ten
nor more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot; or
               c.    Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading
resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot (either by design or when so
required by State or local codes) shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a
water load less than that which would occur during the base flood event, and
the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not
be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components (structural and non-structural). The water loading values used shall
be those associated with the base flood. The wind loading values used shall be
those required by the North Carolina State Building Code.
         (d)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
securely anchored to pile or column foundations. All pilings and columns and
the structure attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all building components.
            1.   Water loading values used shall be those associated with the
base flood.
            2.   Wind loading values used shall be those required by the
current edition of the North Carolina State Building Code.
         (e)   For concrete pads, including patios, decks, parking pads,
walkways, driveways, pool decks, and the like, the following is required:
            1.   Shall be structurally independent of the primary structural
foundation system of the structure and shall not adversely affect structures
through redirection of floodwaters or debris; and
            2.   Shall be constructed to breakaway cleanly during design flood
conditions, shall be frangible, and shall not produce debris capable of causing
damage to any structure. (The installation of concrete in small segments
(approximately 4 feet x 4 feet) that will easily break up during the base flood
event, or score concrete in 4 feet x 4 feet maximum segments is acceptable to
meet this standard); and
            3.    Reinforcing, including welded wire fabric, shall not be used
in order to minimize the potential for concreted pads being a source of debris;
and
            4.   Pad thickness shall not exceed 4 inches; or
            5.   Provide a Design Professional's certification stating the
design and method of construction to be used meet the applicable criteria of
this section.
         (f)   For swimming pools and spas, the following is required:
            1.   Be designed to withstand all flood-related loads and load
combinations.
            2.   Be elevated so that the lowest horizontal structural member is
elevated above the RFPE; or
            3.   Be designed and constructed to break away during design flood
conditions without producing debris capable of causing damage to any structure;
or
            4.   Be sited to remain in the ground during design flood
conditions without obstructing flow that results in damage to any structure.
            5.   Registered design professionals must certify to local
officials that a pool or spa beneath or near a VE Zone building will not be
subject to flotation or displacement that will damage building foundations or
elevated portions of the building or any nearby buildings during a coastal
flood.
            6.   Pool equipment shall be located above the RFPE whenever
practicable. Pool equipment shall not be located beneath an elevated structure.
         (g)   All elevators, vertical platform lifts, chair lifts, and the

not be mounted on, pass through, or be located along breakaway walls.
            3.   The cab, machine/equipment room, hydraulic pump, hydraulic
reservoir, counter weight and roller guides, hoist cable, limit switches,
electric hoist motor, electrical junction box, circuit panel, and electrical
control panel are all required to be above RFPE. When this equipment cannot be
located above the RFPE, it must be constructed using flood damage-resistant
components.
            4.   Elevator shafts/enclosures that extend below the RFPE shall be
constructed of reinforced masonry block or reinforced concrete walls and
located on the landward side of the building to provide increased protection
from flood damage. Drainage must be provided for the elevator pit.
            5.   Flood damage-resistant materials can also be used inside and
outside the elevator cab to reduce flood damage. Use only stainless steel doors
and door frames below the BFE. Grouting in of door frames and sills is
recommended.
            6.   If an elevator is designed to provide access to areas below
the BFE, it shall be equipped with a float switch system that will activate
during a flood and send the elevator cab to a floor above the RFPE.
         (h)   Accessory structures, regardless of size or cost, shall not be
permitted below elevated structures.   
         (i)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record a non-
conversion agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring that the
area below the lowest floor, or the detached accessory building shall not be
improved, or otherwise converted; the City of Havelock will have the right to
inspect the enclosed area. This agreement shall be recorded with the Craven
County Register of Deeds and shall transfer with the property in perpetuity.
         (j)   Release of restrictive covenant. If a property which is bound by
a non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed areas below BFE, then
the owner may request release of restrictive covenant after staff inspection
and submittal of confirming documentation.
         (k)    A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance
with the provisions of §
156.02(D)(2) and §
156.02(E)(7)(c) and (d), on the current version of the North Carolina V-Zone
Certification form or equivalent local version. In addition, prior to the
Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy issuance, a registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify the finished construction is compliant with
the design, specifications and plans for VE Zone construction.
         (l)   Fill/grading.
            1.   Minor grading and the placement of minor quantities of
nonstructural fill may be permitted for landscaping and for drainage purposes
under and around buildings and for support of parking slabs, pool decks, patios
and walkways.
            2.   The fill material must be similar and consistent with the
natural soils in the area.
            3.   The placement of site-compatible, non-structural fill under or
around an elevated building is limited to two feet. Fill greater than two feet
must include an analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional
demonstrating no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave
reflection that would increase damage to adjacent elevated buildings and
structures.
            4.    Nonstructural fill with finished slopes that are steeper than
five units horizontal to one unit vertical shall be permitted only if an
analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional demonstrates no
harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave reflection that would
increase damage to adjacent elevated buildings and structures.
         (m)   There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands
which would increase potential flood damage.
         (n)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted except in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be
placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided
the anchoring and elevation standards of this Section have been satisfied.
         (o)   Recreational vehicles may be permitted in Coastal High Hazard
Areas provided that they meet the Recreational Vehicle criteria of §
156.02(E)(2)(f)(1).
         (p)    A deck that is structurally attached to a building or structure
shall have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member at or above
the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and any supporting members that
extend below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall comply with the
foundation requirements that apply to the building or structure, which shall be
designed to accommodate any increased loads resulting from the attached deck.
The increased loads must be considered in the design of the primary structure
and included in the V-Zone Certification required under §
156.02(D)(2)(c)6.
      (q)   A deck or patio that is located below the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation shall be structurally independent from buildings or
structures and their foundation systems, and shall be designed and constructed
either to remain intact and in place during design flood conditions or to break
apart into small pieces to minimize debris during flooding that is capable of
causing structural damage to the building or structure or to adjacent buildings
and structures.
      (r)   In coastal high hazard areas, development activities other than
buildings and structures shall be permitted only if also authorized by the
appropriate state or local authority; if located outside the footprint of, and
not structurally attached to, buildings and structures; and if analyses
prepared by qualified registered design professionals demonstrate no harmful
diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave reflection that would increase
damage to adjacent buildings and structures. Such other development activities
include but are not limited to:
            1.   Bulkheads, seawalls, retaining walls, revetments, and similar
erosion control structures;
            2.   Solid fences and privacy walls, and fences prone to trapping
debris, unless designed and constructed to fail under flood conditions less
than the design flood or otherwise function to avoid obstruction of
floodwaters.
            3.   Docks, piers, and similar structures.
         (s)   No more than four electrical outlets and no more than four
electrical switches may be permitted below RFPE unless required by building
code.
      (8)   Standards for coastal A Zones (Zone CAZ) LiMWA. Structures in CAZs
shall be designed and constructed to meet V Zone requirements, including
requirements for breakaway walls. However, the NFIP regulations also require
flood openings in walls surrounding enclosures below elevated buildings in CAZs
(see Technical Bulletin 1, Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of
Enclosures). Breakaway walls used in CAZs must have flood openings that allow
for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters to minimize damage caused by
hydrostatic loads. Openings also function during smaller storms or if
anticipated wave loading does not occur with the base flood.
         (a)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation. Floodproofing shall not be utilized on any
structures in Coastal A Zones to satisfy the regulatory flood protection
elevation requirements.
         (b)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest
floor either be free of obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls, open
wood latticework or insect screening, provided they are not part of the
structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under
abnormally high tides or wave action without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system or otherwise
jeopardizing the structural integrity of the building. The following design
specifications shall be met:
            1.   Material shall consist of open wood or plastic lattice at
least 40% of its area open, or
            2.   Insect screening; or
            3.   Breakaway walls shall meet the following design
specifications:
               a.    Breakaway walls shall have flood openings to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified
by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the design criteria
in §
156.02(E)(2)(4)(d); and
               b.    Design safe loading resistance shall be not less than ten
nor more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot; or
               c.    Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading
resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot (either by design or when so
required by State or local codes) shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a
water load less than that which would occur during the base flood event, and
the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not
be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components (structural and non-structural). The water loading values used shall
be those associated with the base flood. The wind loading values used shall be

§ 156.03 SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Statement of purpose.
      (1)   Regulating certain land-disturbing activities to control
accelerated erosion and sedimentation in order that water pollution from
sedimentation may be controlled, and that the accelerated erosion and
sedimentation of lakes and natural watercourses and damage to public and
private property by sedimentation be inhibited; and
      (2)   Establishing procedures through which these purposes can be
fulfilled.
   (B)   Scope and exclusions of section. This section shall apply to land-
disturbing activities undertaken by any person, with the following exclusions.
      (1)   Those undertaken on agricultural land for the production of plants
and animals useful to humans, including, but not limited to: forage and sod
crops, grain and feed crops, tobacco, cotton and peanuts; dairy animals and
dairy products; poultry and poultry products; livestock, including beef cattle,
sheep, swine, horses, ponies, mules or goats, including the breeding and
grading of any or all those animals; bees and apiary products; and fur animals;
      (2)   Those undertaken on forest land for the production and harvesting
of timber and timber products;
      (3)   Activities undertaken by persons as defined in G.S. § 113A-52(7)
who are otherwise regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of 1971, G.S.
§§ 74-46 through 74-68; and
      (4)   Those land-disturbing activities over which the state, by statute,
has exclusive regulatory jurisdiction, which are activities:
         (a)   Conducted by the state;
         (b)   Conducted by the United States;
         (c)   Conducted by persons having the power of eminent domain;
         (d)   Conducted by local governments;
         (e)   Licensed by the state or the United States; and
         (f)   Funded in whole or in part by the state or the United States.
   (C)   General requirements. Persons engaged in land-disturbing activities
shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property
from damage by those activities.
   (D)   Basic control objectives. The basic control objectives which are to be
considered in developing and implementing an erosion and sedimentation control
plan are to:
      (1)   Identify critical areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe
erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from
erosion or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention;
      (2)   Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activities are to be
planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time;
      (3)   Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activities are to be
planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one
time;
      (4)   Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of
exposed areas shall be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during
the period of exposure;
      (5)   Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activities are to be
planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage; and
      (6)   Manage stormwater runoff. When the increase in the velocity of
storm water runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to
cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include
measures to control the velocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize
accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream.
   (E)   Standards for land-disturbing activity.
      (1)   Specifically. Land-disturbing activities subject to the control of
this section shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following
standards.
         (a)   Buffer zone. Land-disturbing activity shall not be permitted in
proximity to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided
along the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible
siltation within the 25% of the buffer zone nearer the land-disturbing
activity; provided, that this division (E) shall not apply to a land-disturbing
activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on,
over or under a lake or natural watercourse.
         (b)   Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills
shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or
other adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left
exposed will, within 30 working days of completion of any phase of grading, be
planted or otherwise provided with ground cover, devices or structures
sufficient to restrain erosion.
         (c)   Ground cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on
a tract comprising more than one acre, if more than one contiguous acre is
uncovered, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install the
sedimentation and erosion-control devices and practices as are sufficient to
retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the
boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of the tract,
and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to
restrain erosion after completion of construction or development within 30
working days or 120 calendar days following completion, whichever period is
shorter.
         (d)   Design and performance standard. Erosion and sedimentation
control measures, structures and devices shall be so planned, designed and
constructed as to provide control from the calculated peak rates of runoff from
a ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the
USDA, Soil Conservation Services’ National Engineering Field Manual for
Conservation Practices, or other acceptable calculation procedures.
   (F)   Permanent downstream protection of stream banks and channels.
      (1)   Generally. Provision shall be made for the permanent protection of
off-site stream banks and channels from the erosive effects of increased
velocity and volume of stormwater runoff resulting from certain land-disturbing
activities.
      (2)   Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land-
disturbing activity shall be protected from increased degradation by
accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land-
disturbing activity. The provisions of this rule will be publicly and
periodically reviewed by the Board of Commissioners.
      (3)   Performance standard.
         (a)   The land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted so
that the velocity of stormwater runoff in the receiving watercourse at the
point of discharge resulting from a ten-year storm after development shall not
exceed the greater of:
            1.   The velocity as determined from the table in division (F)(6)
below; or
            2.   The velocity in the receiving watercourse determined for the
ten-year storm prior to development.
         (b)   If divisions (F)(3)(a)1. or (3)(a)2. above cannot be met, the
channel below the discharge point shall be designed and constructed to
withstand the expected velocity.
      (4)   Acceptable management measures. Measures applied alone or in
combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are
no objectionable secondary consequences. The Commission recognizes that the
management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and
bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will
be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce
successful results. Some alternatives are to:
         (a)   Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by
including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff
from areas rendered impervious;
         (b)   Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using
vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high
velocity paved sections;
         (c)   Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage
facilities to reduce flow velocities at the point of discharge. These may range
from single rip-rapped sections to complex structures; and/or
         (d)   Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving
cross-sections or providing erosion-resistant lining.
      (5)   Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated
that stormwater discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the
receiving watercourse.
      (6)   Maximum permissible velocity. The following
Table 156-1 provides the maximum permissible velocities for stormwater
discharges:

Adapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation Research,
American Society of Civil Engineers, 1926, for channels with straight
alignment. For sinuous channels, multiply allowable velocity by 0.95 for
slightly sinuous channels, by 0.9 for moderately sinuous channels, and by 0.8
for highly sinuous channels.
 
   (G)   Borrow and waste areas. When the person conducting the land-disturbing
activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity,
areas from which borrow is obtained and which are not regulated by the
provisions of the Mining Act of 1971, and waste areas for surplus materials
other than landfills regulated by the Department of Human Resources, Division
of Health Services, shall be considered as part of the land-disturbing activity
where the borrow material is being used or from which the waste material
originated. When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is not the
person obtaining the borrow or disposing of the waste, these areas shall be
considered a separate land-disturbing activity.
   (H)   Access and haul roads. Temporary access and haul roads, other than
public roads, constructed or used in connection with any land-disturbing
activity shall be considered a part of the activity.
   (I)   Operations in lakes or natural watercourses. Land-disturbing activity
in connection with construction in, on, over or under a lake or natural
watercourse shall be planned and conducted in a manner so as to minimize the
extent and duration of disturbance of the stream channel. The relocation of a
stream, where relocation is an essential part of the proposed activity, shall
be planned and executed so as to minimize changes in the stream flow
characteristics, except when justification for significant alteration to flow
characteristic is provided.
   (J)   Responsibility for maintenance. The person engaged in or conducting
the land-disturbing activity shall be responsible for maintaining all temporary
and permanent erosion and sedimentation measures and facilities during the
development of a site. The responsibility for maintaining all permanent erosion
and sedimentation control measures and facilities after site development is
completed shall lie with the landowner except facilities and measures installed
within road or street right-of-way or easements accepted for maintenance by a
governmental agency.
   (K)   Additional measures. Whenever the city determines that erosion or
sedimentation is occurring as a result of a land-disturbing activity, despite
application and maintenance of protective practices, the person responsible for
maintenance pursuant to division (J) above will be required to take additional
protective action.
   (L)   Permits.
      (1)   A person shall not undertake any land-disturbing activity subject
to this section without first obtaining a permit from the Office of Planning
and Inspections, except that no permit shall be required for the following

Conservation District when required, 30 days prior to the commencement of the
proposed activity or as required by the subdivision regulations.
      (2)   The County Soil and Water Conservation District within 20 days of
receipt of any plan, or within the additional time as may be prescribed by the
city, shall review the plan and submit its comments and recommendations to the
City Office of Planning and Inspections. Failure of the district to submit its
comments and recommendations to the city within the prescribed time will not
delay final action on the plan.
      (3)   The Office of Planning and Inspections or the Planning Board of the
city, as appropriate, will review each plan submitted and within 30 days of
receipt thereof, or as required by the subdivision regulations, will notify the

§ 157.01 BUILDING DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER.
   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to establish standards to guide
development that is aesthetically pleasing and compatible within the context of
the surrounding area. These guidelines are intended to allow for creativity and
diversity, and avoid monotony in design. Unless otherwise specifically
provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases used
in this chapter shall have the meanings defined in
Chapter 163.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   The standards and guidelines contained in §
157.01 shall apply to all new nonresidential structures and to expansions or
alterations of any such existing building where the expansion or alteration
exceeds 50% of the building value as assessed for real property taxes.
      (2)   All development subject to this chapter shall utilize a design that
enhances existing city architectural styles, designs and forms and creates
visual character. Enhancement shall be achieved through techniques such as
varied roof lines, the use of similar proportions in building mass and outdoor
spaces, similar relationships to the street, relief of the visual effect of
long extensive walls, and the use of building materials that have natural
color, including primary colors, shades and textures that adds architectural
interest to the facade.
   (B)   Building design standards. Design standards promote creativity and
innovation while discouraging obtrusive, incongruous structures. The city
discourages architectural style that does not enhance or add visual character
to the city. The city supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained and
harmonious development is in the best economic development interests of all
residents and businesses.
      (1)   Emphasize human scale. Building design shall emphasize a human
scale at ground level, at entryways, and along street frontages through the
creative use of windows, doors, columns, canopies and awnings.
      (2)   Major building design features proportional. Major building design
features, such as windows, doors, eaves and parapets, shall be designed to be
in proportion to one another.
      (3)   Structural lines retained at storefront level. The structural lines
of a building and its materials shall be retained at the storefront level. For
instance, brick piers and columns shall be carried down to street level.
      (4)   Awnings and canopies. Awnings and canopies shall complement the
color and material of the building to which they are affixed.
      (5)   Massing. A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided.
Where large structures are required, mass should be broken up through the use
of setbacks, projecting and recessed elements, and similar design techniques.
Changes in mass shall be related to entrances, the integral structure, and/or
the organization of interior spaces and activities and not merely for cosmetic
effect.
   (C)   Avoiding monotony of design. Monotony of design in single or multiple
building projects shall be avoided by varying detail, form and siting to the
maximum extent practical, within the standards set forth in this chapter, to
provide visual interest.
   (D)   Harmony of design. The purpose of this section is to enhance the
design character of existing development, to add visual character to the
community, and to promote harmony in the visual relationships and transitions
between new and older buildings or an upgrade from the surrounding area by
complementing other buildings of good design. New buildings should respect the
scale, and proportion of existing development.
      (1)   Building color shades. Building color shades shall be used to
facilitate blending into the neighborhood and unify the development. The color
shades of building materials shall draw from the range of color shades that
already exist on the block or in the adjacent neighborhood.
      (2)   Building materials. Building materials shall either be similar to
the materials already being used in the neighborhood or, if dissimilar
materials are being proposed, other characteristics such as scale and
proportions, form, architectural detailing, color and texture, shall be
utilized to ensure that enough similarity exists for the building to be
compatible, despite the differences in materials.
      (3)   Similar size and height for infill development. New infill
development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger, be
articulated and subdivided into massing that is proportional to the mass and
scale of other structures on the same block, or if buildings do not exist
thereon, then on adjoining blocks.
      (4)   Unify individual storefronts. If several storefronts are located in
one building, the individual storefronts shall be unified in all exterior
design elements, such as mass, window and door placement, color, materials and
signage.
      (5)   Additions and renovations. Building additions and facade
renovations should be designed to reflect existing buildings in scale. A change
in scale may require a transitional design element between the new development
and existing buildings.
      (6)   Varying architectural styles. In developments with multiple
structures of varying architectural styles, buildings shall be compatible by
such means as a pattern of architectural features, similar scale and
proportions, and consistent location of signage.
   (E)   Architectural character. Architectural character focuses on the
specific details that greatly affect the overall appearance of a particular
development. These architectural character standards in this section provide
direction in aspects of color, facade materials, rooflines and the enhancement
of entryways. The primary goal is to define the “finishing touches” that
provide the development with a sense of permanence, style and compatibility.
The city discourages proposals that have not taken these matters into account.
The city policy is that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to
the community and as a “good neighbor” to its surroundings.
      (1)   General form.
         (a)   Each building shall have a primary facade that faces a public
street, private street or which has the main public entrance.
         (b)   The primary facade may have a clearly identifiable base, body
and cap with defining elements, or may have other architectural features that
express quality design characteristics by providing other coherent and complete
styles of architecture (see Figure 157-1).
         (c)   Any building facade that is not the primary facade, and that has
frontage along a private drive, parking area or street, shall be considered a
SECONDARY FACADE.
         (d)   Secondary facades shall also have a clearly-identifiable design
quality, using materials and architectural elements similar to the primary
facade.
         (e)   Any facade that does not face a street, private drive or parking
area, but is adjacent to a primary or secondary facade, shall continue around
the corner any required architectural elements of the adjoining facade for a
distance equaling at least 20% of the length of the facade.
      (2)   Wall plane.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1669.jpg]
 
         (a)   Architectural elements can be used to define bays, add interest
and variety; relieve the visual effect of long extensive walls; and split tall
structures into human scale.
         (b)   All primary and secondary facades greater than 100 feet in
length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate building wall offsets
including recesses and projections along at least 20% of the length of the
facade. Windows, awnings and arcades shall total at least 60% of the facade
length abutting a public street.
         (c)   Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally,
shall incorporate a repeating pattern of change in color, texture and material
modules. All elements should repeat at intervals of no more than 30 feet,
either horizontally or vertically.
         (d)   Rooflines, windows, doors, stairwells, porches, pilasters and
breaks in the facade may be used to establish bays.
         (e)   Replacement of windows on the facade of an existing building
shall be accomplished by using windows of the same trim, size and character as
the original or by using a different style of window that complements the
architectural style of the building.
         (f)   Bays may project or recess four inches or greater.
         (g)   Landscaping may be used to give the sense of break in long
facades. Berms with shrubs and trees of sufficient size to break up facade
planted next to the building may be used. Landscaping should be shown on
architectural rendering and meet the requirements of §
157.03. (Figure 157-2 depicts acceptable method for breaking long facade and
157-3 does not.)

      (3)   Entryways.
         (a)   Entryway design elements and variations shall provide
orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the building. The following
standards identify desirable entryway design features. Each principal building
on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances
featuring no less than three of the following (see also Figures 157-5 and 157-
6 as examples):
            1.   Canopies or porticos;
            2.   Arcades;
            3.   Overhangs;
            4.   Recesses/projections;
            5.   Raised corniced parapets over the doors;
            6.   Peaked roof forms;
            7.   Arches;
            8.   Wing walls;
            9.   Outdoor patio;
            10.   Display windows;
            11.   Planters; and
            12.   Architectural details such as tile work and moldings which
are designed into the building structure and overall design.
         (b)   All sides of a principal building that directly face an abutting
public street shall feature at least one customer entrance.
         (c)   Variations in color schemes are encouraged in order to
articulate entryways and public amenities so as to give greater recognition to
these features.

      (4)   Building materials/colors.
         (a)   Each building shall be constructed with approved primary surface
materials.
         (b)   Approved primary surface materials shall include:
            1.   Brick or glazed brick;
            2.   Wood;
            3.   Fiber cement (hardiplank);
            4.   Stone, cast stone, marble or similar material;
            5.   Stucco or synthetic stucco;
            6.   Tinted and textured concrete masonry;
            7.   Concrete (pre-cast or cast-in-place);
            8.   Glass;
            9.   Metal composite panels;
            10.   Split face block;
            11.   Concrete block may be permitted on interior sides and rears
provided it matches the color of the corresponding surface materials; and
            12.   Rigid frame metal.
         (c)   If renovating structure, brick, stone or wood facades shall not
be covered or replaced with artificial siding or panels. Synthetic materials
that resemble or match the original facade can be used.
         (d)   Secondary materials may be used to add architectural interest.
They may consist of one or more primary materials, or any other (appropriate)
material that adds architectural interest.
         (e)   Facade with main entrance may be glass (including windows and
doors) or combinations of glass and materials listed in item division (4)(b)
above.
         (f)   Variations of materials and textures are encouraged with each
storefront in multi-tenant buildings.
         (g)   It is recommended that primary surface materials shall be
natural colors including primary colors, or have “earth” tones (i.e., gray,
white, beige, brown or brick). See Figure 157-7.
         (h)   Secondary materials may be any color.

      (5)   Metal buildings.
         (a)   Metal may be used as a primary material if a non-metal base is
established which raps around the side and rear of the building, and a pitched
roof is provided. (Figure 157-8 depicts unacceptable use of metal and 157-
9 acceptable design.)
Figure 157-8            Figure 157-9

IMAGES/0-0-0-1713.jpg]
 
         (b)   Any facade not facing a public street or parking area has an
option to provide a landscape buffer/screen instead of the non-metal base.
      (6)   Base.
         (a)   Each primary facade may have a clearly identifiable base, or the
wall materials may extend to the floor slab or into the ground if the material
is appropriate for ground contact (such as masonry or stone). Wood, glass,
stucco and the like, will terminate above grade.
         (b)   A landscaped building yard may be used to define the base. See
Figures 157-10 and 11.
Examples of building yards (Figures 157-10 and 11):
   Figure 157-10            Figure 157-11

IMAGES/0-0-0-1661.jpg]
 
         (c)   Soldier course may be used to define the base. Soldier course -
often a complete course of brick laid on end vertically, with narrow side
exposed in the face of the wall.
See Figures 157-12 and 13.

   Figure 157-12            Figure 157-13
         (d)   A change of materials may be used to define the base.
         (e)   A “water table” may be used to provide a clear distinction
between the base of the building and the middle. See Figures 157-14 through 16.
Examples of “water tables” (Figures 157-14 through 157-16)

Figure 157-14      Figure 157-15           Figure 157-16
      (7)   Body.
         (a)   Each required facade shall have a defined body.
         (b)   The body should be the area between the base and the cap.
         (c)   The body of the building should be broken up in order to avoid
long monotonous walls as described in division (E)(2), unless the wall is a
design element.
         (d)   Structures in complexes without street frontage shall have their
main entrance on a primary facade.
         (e)   New buildings shall be oriented so that the largest and longest
facade faces the primary road. To the maximum extent feasible, new buildings
shall be oriented or designed to minimize shadows falling on public or semi-
public spaces.
         (f)   All exterior walls visible from a parking lot or public right-
of-way in any zoning district except the LI (Light Industrial) and HI (Heavy
Industrial) zoning districts shall be clad with the same material required for
the front of the building. Buildings in the LI and HI zoning districts are
required to provide the same material as the front of the building for at least
25% of the area of the side facades and 100% of the area of side facades
directly facing a public right-of-way. All walls not visible from a parking lot
or public right-of-way, or the remaining 75% of the side facades in the LI and
HI zoning districts, may be constructed of alternate material(s), but shall be
of a color that is complimentary to the primary material, and is incorporated
into the overall color scheme of the building. See also division (4)(b).
      (8)   Roofs. The following standards are intended to foster variations in
roof lines to soften and reduce the massive scale of large buildings:
         (a)   Roof lines shall be varied to reduce the scale of structures and
add visual interest. See Figure 157-23.
         (b)   Roof shape (for example: flat, hip, mansard or gable) and
material shall be architecturally compatible with facade elements and the rest
of the building. Can include cornices, fascias, dormers and overhangs (See
Figures 157-17 through 157-20 below).
         (c)   If roof cornices have been removed or damaged on an existing
building, renovations of that building must include retaining, repairing and
replacing the roof cornices if previously removed.
         (d)   Flat roofs must be enclosed by a parapet that screens mechanical
equipment from view by pedestrians at street level.
         (e)   The height of the parapet shall not exceed one-third of the
height of the supporting wall. The parapet shall not be of a constant height
for a distance greater than 150 feet.
         (f)   Green roofs and solar panels are encouraged. Solar panels shall
be at the same slope of the roof. Otherwise they should be located at the rear
of the building or on the ground. See Figures 157-24 through 157-27.

(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 157.03 LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING.
   (A)   Purpose and applicability.
      (1)   Purpose. Protection of the city’s natural environment and
enhancement of the community’s built environment with installation and
maintenance of new landscape areas are important to the city and its citizens.
The regulations of this section are a tool to ensure these goals are
accomplished. The purposes of this section are:
         (a)   To enhance the visual character of the community, and preserve
the economic value of property by screening objectionable views within and
between uses and provide assistance in noise abatement;
         (b)   To encourage the proper use of the land by promoting an
appropriate balance between the built environment and preservation/conservation
of open space;
         (c)   To preserve and improve property values and protect private and
public investment through preservation of open space, protection of the
existing tree canopy, providing buffers between incompatible uses and along
roadways, and encouraging the planting of new vegetation as deemed appropriate;
         (d)   To promote the aesthetic quality of property that provides
important psychological, sociological and aesthetic counterpoints to the human-
made urban setting;
         (e)   To preserve the climatic balance while contributing to the
process of air purification and oxygen regeneration and to add environmental
value by reducing glare and heat, decrease wind velocity and to promote energy
conservation by maximizing the shading and cooling effects of trees;
         (f)   To preserve the ecological value of property by the
stabilization and fertilization of soil and the prevention of soil erosion;
         (g)   To consider the guidelines and recommendations in the city’s
CAMA Land Use and Comprehensive Plan;
         (h)   To preserve, protect and enhance the identity, character and
business economy of the city; and
         (i)   To set forth development standards and requirements for
preserving existing vegetation and installation of new landscape areas.
      (2)   Application. The requirements of this section shall apply to:
         (a)   All new or changed uses of land, buildings, and structures
located within the City Planning and Zoning Jurisdiction which are not exempted
in division (A)(3) below; and
         (b)   Any use of building or structure which sits idle more than 180
consecutive days or is abandoned, except those uses exempted in divisions (A)
(3)(a) through (3)(d) below.
      (3)   Exemptions. None of the landscaping and screening requirements of
this section shall apply to:
         (a)   Existing uses and buildings, including repairs, alterations or
improvements to the interiors and exteriors of existing buildings which do not
result in a change of use or additions or expansions to the buildings;
         (b)   Expansion of existing structures where the cost of the expansion
project is less than or equal to 50% of either the current tax value or
appraised value of the existing structure(s);
         (c)   Areas inside the designated right-of-way of a public or private
street; or
         (d)   Federal property owned by Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station
unless mutually agreed upon.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   Landscaping plans. Landscaping plans shall be submitted for
projects described in §
157.03(A)(2), as part of required site plan approvals for the applicable Zoning
Permits specified in §
153.10.
      (2)   Plant species and sizes. Recommended plant species and minimum
plant sizes that meet the requirements of this chapter for landscaping buffers,
parking areas and other development areas are defined in §
157.03(E) and
Appendix C - UDO Approved Plant List.
      (3)   Pre-design conference. A “pre-design” conference with the Zoning
Administrator is strongly encouraged to understand the requirements of this
section.
      (4)   Alternative methods of compliance.
         (a)   Alternative landscaping plans, plant materials, planting methods
and street yard and buffer yard widths may be used where unreasonable or
impractical situations would result from strict application of landscaping
requirements or where necessary to protect existing vegetation. The situations
may result from streams, natural rock formations, topography, protected
riparian buffer locations, other physical conditions; or from lot
configuration, utility easements or unusual site conditions. Alternative
landscaping plans may propose different plant materials, methods and locations
if the quality, effectiveness, durability and performance are equivalent to
that required by this section. Sufficient evidence or proof may be required
with alternative landscaping plans to substantiate any claim that may be made
regarding the proposed plans, materials or methods. Alternative plans shall be
considered for approval as part of the normal site plan approval process as
specified in §
153.10.
         (b)   A combination of natural vegetation, fences, walls, stones and
berms may be utilized to achieve the requirements of this section provided that
the following standards are met.
            1.   Walls (a minimum of five feet in height), or an opaque fence
(a minimum of five feet in height) may be used to reduce the width of a
required buffer yard.
            2.   Understory trees may be substituted for canopy trees if, in
the opinion of the Zoning Administrator upon conferring with the electrical
utility provider, a conflict exists with overhead utility lines.
            3.   Wall planters shall be constructed of masonry, stone or
pressure treated lumber and shall have a minimum height of 30 inches. The
minimum height of shrubs in wall planters shall be 12 inches. The effective
planting area of the wall planter shall be four feet in width. The minimum
height of trees in wall planters shall be six feet. The effective planting area
of the wall planter shall be seven feet in width.
            4.   Any berm utilized for screening purposes shall comply with the
standards and requirements of division (E) below.
   (C)   Perimeter and streetscape buffer yards.
      (1)   Applicability. All land uses as defined in §
157.03(A) shall provide perimeter buffer yards and streetscape buffer yards, as
defined herein, to separate that use from adjacent land uses.
      (2)   Purpose of buffers. Preserving existing vegetation or planting new
landscaping shall be provided in order to:
         (a)   Shield properties from any adverse external effects of adjacent
development, so as to mitigate incompatibilities between adjacent uses;
         (b)   Mitigate residential development from the noise and glare
impacts of major collector and thoroughfare roadways;
         (c)   Preserve open space;
         (d)   Preserve or create tree canopy and vegetation:
         (e)   Minimize future increases in stormwater runoff; and
         (f)   Improve appearance of developments.
      (3)   Landscaped or re-vegetated buffers. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that there is not an existing buffer or it has been disturbed to the
extent it does not meet the specifications herein described, then a re-
vegetated buffer shall be installed pursuant to this section.
      (4)   Type and width of buffer required.
         (a)   
Table 157-1 determines the type and minimum width of existing or landscaped
perimeter and streetscape buffer yards that must be preserved or installed on-
site for each proposed principal land use. Buffer types are defined in division
(C)(5) below.
         (b)   Any side or rear yard of any proposed principal use that abuts a
residential use or residential district shall provide, in addition to the
buffer requirements of
Table 157-1, a six-foot fence with 80% opacity.
      (5)   Types and required criteria for buffers. The four types of natural
and landscaped buffers that appear in
Table 157-1 are described below along with criteria for each. Figure 157-28
graphically displays what is intended for each buffer. Each of these buffer
types may be achieved by meeting the requirements listed below or by an
approved alternative method that meets the performance requirements. The
preservation and use of natural vegetation is the preferred method of meeting
the buffer and landscape requirements, as specified in divisions (C)(6)(d) and
(7) below.
         (a)   Type A. For every 50 linear feet, or fraction thereof, the five-
foot wide buffer yard shall
contain: one canopy tree, two under story trees and three shrubs.
         (b)   Type B. For every 50 linear feet, or fraction thereof, the ten-
foot wide buffer yard shall contain: two canopy trees or four under story
trees, and six shrubs.
         (c)   Type C. For every 50 linear feet, or fraction thereof, the 15-
foot wide buffer yard shall contain: two canopy trees or four under story
trees, and six shrubs and a six-foot fence with 80% opacity.
         (d)   Type D. For every 50 linear feet of frontage, or fraction
thereof, the six-foot wide street yard shall contain: one under story tree with
sidewalks or planters built within or upon the sidewalk. Sidewalk requirements
are detailed in §
157.06. Type D buffer yards are intended to be used as streetscapes in new
subdivisions and nontraditional residential developments in addition to
required buffer yards as listed in
Table 157-1.

      (6)   General buffer standards.
         (a)   Coverage. All portions of required perimeter and streetscape
buffer yards not planted with trees or shrubs or covered by a wall, driveway or
other barrier shall be planted with grass, ground cover or natural mulch of a
minimum depth of three inches.
         (b)   Placement. New plantings comprising the buffer shall be spread
across the entire span of the buffer, not planted in a row or rows, and not
concentrated in a limited number of clustered locations such that the purpose
of the buffer is violated (as defined in division (C)(2) above).
         (c)   Location.
            1.   The perimeter buffers shall be located along the outer
perimeter of the parcel and shall extend to the parcel boundary line or right-
of-way line; however, the buffers may be located along shared access easements
between parcels in nonresidential developments.
               a.   Within nonresidential centers/developments, the perimeter
buffer area between outparcels may be shifted totally or in part, elsewhere on
the site.
               b.   For example, a 15-foot buffer width between like uses may
be shifted elsewhere on the site preferably interior to the site as long as the
total area is provided for.
               c.   The intent of this section is to provide for more
flexibility in designing sites and potentially save larger natural areas
elsewhere on the site.
            2.   Stormwater management structures may be allowed in a buffer
provided that it can be landscaped to meet the intent of the buffer
requirements.
            3.   All perimeter buffer yards and streetscape buffer yards shall
not obstruct the view of motorists using any street, private driveway, parking
aisles or the approach to any street intersection so as to constitute a traffic
hazard or a condition dangerous to the public safety upon any such street,
driveway, parking aisle or street intersection. Existing healthy vegetation may
be removed and no new plantings shall be installed, within required sight
triangles as noted in the signage section of this chapter.

           (d)   Existing vegetation, fences, walls and berms.
            1.   An existing natural buffer consists of existing vegetation,
soils, surface waters and topography. Where possible, required buffers should
remain in an undisturbed condition; but if the buffer is not a stream buffer or
located in a floodplain, some maintenance may be necessary to prevent
overgrowth or removal of noxious or poisonous species.
            2.   Existing healthy and significant vegetation within the
required buffer shall be preserved where possible and credited toward standards
for the type of buffer required, unless otherwise approved by the Zoning
Administrator at the time of site plan approval, pursuant to division (C)(7)
below.
            3.   Existing soils within the buffers shall remain intact and
undisturbed, unless otherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator at the time
of site plan approval, pursuant to division (C)(7) below.
            4.   Existing berms, walls or fences within the buffer, but not
including chain link fencing, may be used in part to fulfill the requirements
for the six-foot tall screen where required, provided that these elements are
healthy and/or in a condition of good repair.
            5.   Other existing site features within the required buffer area
which do not otherwise function to meet the standards for the required buffer
shall be screened from the view of other properties or removed, as determined
during review and approval of the site plan.
         (e)   New vegetation and other features. If existing significant
vegetation and other site features do not fully meet the standards for the type
of buffer required, then additional vegetation and site features shall be
planted or installed within the required buffer area in order to meet the
criteria outlined in division (C)(5) above.
         (f)   No development within required buffers. With the exceptions
noted below, the required buffer shall not contain any development, impervious
surfaces or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this
section or that require removal of existing vegetation. Grading, development or
land-disturbing activities shall not occur within the buffer or within the tree
protection fence area unless approved by the Zoning Administrator.
            1.   Sidewalks and trails may be placed in buffers provided that
damage to existing vegetation is minimized.
            2.   Utilities are not permitted in buffers unless no reasonable
alternative exists. If utilities are placed in a buffer, they shall be located
and installed in a way that minimizes disturbance of the buffer area (for
example, installed not parallel but perpendicular or not less than at a 75-
degree angle).
            3.   Streets may not be placed within a buffer except to cross the
buffer where necessary to connect to adjoining properties.
      (6)   Natural area buffer credits. The Zoning Administrator may grant
credit for the preservation of existing natural vegetation (pursuant to §
157.04) and apply this credit toward meeting perimeter and streetscape buffer
requirements, provided the caliper and quantity of the vegetation is equal to
or exceeds the specifications herein described. If an existing natural area is
to be preserved and used as a required perimeter or streetscape buffer, but it
does not meet the required buffer type as specified in
Table 157-1, it must be enhanced to meet the specifications. The final buffer
shall have the width, amount of vegetation, and other features to properly
mitigate negative effects of contiguous land uses.
   (D)   Landscaping for parking areas.
      (1)   Minimum standards.
         (a)   At least 8% of the gross paved area of a parking facility shall
be landscaped and located in the interior. For purposes of this section,
INTERIOR shall mean the area within the parking facility.
         (b)   Plantings shall be distributed evenly throughout the parking
facility.
         (c)   All interior plantings shall be physically protected. Non-
mountable concrete curbing shall be provided to prevent vehicles from
encroaching onto and overhanging required plantings.
         (d)   Consecutive parking spaces shall incorporate landscaped
peninsulas no more than 15 spaces apart and at the ends of all parking rows.
      (2)   Existing vegetation. Existing healthy, well-formed, canopy trees
that are preserved on site according to §
157.04 may be counted toward the requirements of this section, provided that
these trees are protected, in accordance with division (F) below and §
157.04, before and during development of the site and maintained after
development in a healthy growing condition.
   (E)   Other landscaping requirements. The following requirements apply to
all landscaping and buffers installed under §
157.03.
      (1)   Plant materials.
         (a)   All tree and plant material selections shall be native or
adaptable to the city region and its climate.
         (b)   The city recognizes Crape Myrtle as a widely planted species.
The practice of topping such species is discouraged. Topping of this species
can contribute to a decline in tree cover canopy and is in direct conflict with
the goals of this section. Minimum pruning to develop the crape myrtle’s
natural tree form is encouraged.
         (c)   A recommended plant materials list is provided in
Appendix C.
      (2)   Plant size. The following are the minimum required sizes at
planting:
         (a)   Shrubs: 12 inches in height;
         (b)   Understory trees: six feet in height; and
         (c)   Canopy trees: one inch in caliper, eight feet in height.
      (3)   Berms. All berms used in a perimeter buffer, streetscape buffer or
other landscape area shall meet all of the following design standards.
         (a)   The slope of all berms shall not exceed a two-to-one ratio
(horizontal to vertical), shall have a top width at least one-half the berm
height, and a maximum height of four feet above the toe (top) of the berm. The
Zoning Administrator shall approve all berms. Berms proposed to be greater than
four feet in height may be permitted if deemed appropriate by the Zoning
Administrator.
         (b)   Proposed berms to be placed over an existing or proposed utility
easement(s) shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator.
         (c)   Berms shall be vegetated as required by this section. Berms must
be stabilized with ground cover to prevent erosion and sedimentation. It is
strongly discouraged to use berms as a substitute for existing healthy
vegetation. However, if berms are allowed to replace existing vegetation which
already meets the standards in this section then they must also meet the buffer
standards and must be approved by the Zoning Administrator.
         (d)   Berms shall in no case damage the roots of existing healthy
vegetation designated to be preserved.
      (4)   Installation standards.
         (a)   All required landscaping shall be installed in a manner that
ensures the availability of sufficient soil and water for healthy growth and
that is not intrusive to aboveground and underground utilities.
         (b)   In order to reduce the damage to root systems of existing
vegetation within streetscapes, buffers or any other tree save areas,
designation of planned utility connection corridors is required to be shown on
all development plans to coordinate the location of electrical, telephone,
cable and other similar utilities.
         (c)   Understory trees are required to be substituted for canopy trees
whenever located within 25 feet of an overhead utility line.
         (d)   Nothing shall be planted or installed within an underground or
overhead utility easement or a drainage easement without the consent of the
city and the easement holder at the time of site plan approval.
         (e)   Tree planting in or about sidewalks and pavement areas with
inappropriate tree species and inadequate soil volume may create damage to
sidewalks and pavement and block light penetration to the pavement, preventing
rapid evaporation of precipitation. To avoid potential damage to sidewalks and
pavement and pooling of precipitation from such situations, a minimum soil
volume of two cubic feet shall be reserved per one square foot of crown spread
for every tree proposed for planting near sidewalks and pavement areas. The
circumference of the tree planting area shall be protected with either mulch
mounds or tree grates that will prevent root damage. Detail of this ratio must
be included on the landscape plan, as specified in
Appendix A.
         (f)   A minimum of 300 square feet of pervious ground area per canopy
tree shall be provided (understory trees may be allowed in less area but no
less than 240 square feet). Any planting area bounded by an impervious surface
should be at least ten feet wide. No canopy tree should be planted closer than
five feet to a sidewalk, paved areas or other impervious surfaces (other types
of trees may be closer).
         (g)   Culverts, rip rap structures, holding ponds and other
stormwater-related devices must be landscaped to reduce their visual impacts.
This landscape screening must consist of evergreen plantings and be part of the
approved landscape plan.
   (F)   Tree protection during construction.
      (1)   Minimum standards. The following minimum standards apply during
construction, in addition to applicable standards from §
157.04.
         (a)   Responsibility. During development of the property, the owner
shall be responsible for the erection of barriers necessary to protect any
existing or installed vegetation located within the preservation or undisturbed
buffer areas from damage both during and after construction.
         (b)   Tree protection fencing. All existing vegetation that is to be
preserved, including buffers, shall be fenced with a sturdy and visible fence
before grading begins. Fencing of these areas adjacent to existing and proposed
roadways is also required. Fencing is required on all city and NCDOT road
projects that are adjacent to protected streetscapes or buffers. The fencing
must be a minimum four feet high and of durable construction and must be placed
outside of the drip line of the tree to be protected. Passive forms of tree
protection, such as continuous rope or flagging, may be used to delineate tree
save areas that are remote from the area of land disturbance. Both applicant
and the Zoning Administrator, in determining the exact location of any tree
protection fencing, will consider the existing site conditions. The fence shall
be maintained on the site until all site work is completed. It shall be removed
before final site inspection for the certificate of occupancy.
         (c)   Tree Protection Zone signs. Tree Protection Zone signs must be
installed on the tree protection fence visible on all sides of the fenced in
area (minimum one on each side and/or every 300 linear feet).
   (G)   Time limit, installation guarantees, inspections and certificate of
occupancy.
      (1)   Time limit.
         (a)   Installation guarantee. All landscaping, including mulching and
seeding shall be completed in accordance with the approved development plan
before a permanent certificate of occupancy for the site is issued unless the
Zoning Administrator grants an exception pursuant to division (G)(1)(b) below.
If an exception is granted, an installation guarantee shall be required, that
includes:
            1.   A cost estimate provided by a landscape contractor and/or
engineer;
            2.   Cash, surety/performance bond or letter of credit that ensures
the required landscaping will be completed at a predetermined later date,
normally the next planting season but not to exceed one year from date of
exception; and
            3.   The amount of the bond/letter of credit shall be for the cost
of the plant materials plus the cost of installation, plus 10%.
         (b)   Extensions and exceptions. Extensions and exceptions to the
above time limit may only be granted under one of the following conditions:
            1.   Unusual environmental conditions, such as drought, ice, over-
saturated soil or inappropriate planting season for the plant species
(plantings between June through August are strongly discouraged);
            2.   Substitution or unavailability of plant species or acceptable
plant size as specified on the site plan; or
            3.   Circumstances beyond the developer’s or property owner’s
control, such as incomplete construction or utility work to occur in a proposed
landscaped area within 30 days after expected site completion.
      (2)   Inspections. The Zoning Administrator shall inspect the site before
the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy for the development,
unless exempted under section (G)(1)(b), and shall not issue the permanent
Certificate of Occupancy if the landscaping required under this section is not
living or healthy or is not installed in accordance with the standards set
forth in this section and in accordance with the approved site plan.
   (H)   Maintenance responsibility.
      (1)   In order for any landscaping and screening to fulfill the purpose
for which it was established, it must be properly maintained. The owner of the
property and any tenant on the property where screening is required will be
jointly responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping and screening
materials required under this UDO. Maintenance includes actions necessary to
keep screening materials healthy, neat and orderly in appearance and free of
litter and debris.
      (2)   All screening and landscaping areas must be protected from damage
by motor vehicles or pedestrians which could reduce the effectiveness of the
screening.
      (3)   Any dead, unhealthy or missing vegetation, or vegetation disfigured
by severe or excessive pruning, shall be replaced with locally adapted
vegetation that conforms to the standards of this UDO and the approved site
and/or subdivision plan. In the case of removal of existing original vegetation
from required vegetation protection areas, the replacement requirements of
division (J) below shall apply.
      (4)   In the event that any vegetation or physical element functioning to
meet the standards of this UDO is severely damaged due to an unusual weather
occurrence or natural catastrophe, or other natural occurrence such as damage
by wild or domestic animals, the owner may be required to replant if the buffer
standards are not being met. The owner shall have one growing season to replace
or replant after reconstruction is complete. The Zoning Administrator shall
consider the type and location of the landscape buffer or required vegetation
area as well as the propensity for natural revegetation in making a
determination on the extent of replanting requirements.
      (5)   Any appeals of the Zoning Administrator’s decision relating to the
amount of required revegetation shall be made to the Board of Adjustment within
ten days following the notice of decision, and the Board of Adjustment shall
consider reduction requests at the next available regular meeting.
      (6)   All required buffers, streetscapes, vehicular use areas and other
landscaped areas shall be free of refuse and debris, shall be treated for pest/
diseases in accordance with the approved site and/or subdivision plan, and
shall be maintained so as to prevent mulch, straw, dirt, grass clippings or
other materials from washing onto streets and sidewalks.
      (7)   The owner should take actions to protect trees and landscaping from
unnecessary damage during all facility and site maintenance operations. Plants
must be maintained in a way that does not obstruct sight distances at roadway
and drive intersection, obstruct traffic signs or devices, and/or interfere
with the use of sidewalks or pedestrian trails. Viable plants shall not be
removed, damaged, cut or severely pruned so that their natural form is impaired
(shrubs within existing vehicle use areas and streetscapes may be pruned, but
must maintain the minimum required height).
      (8)   In the event that existing required vegetation located within any
required buffers, streetscapes, vehicular use or other landscape areas poses an
immediate or imminent threat to improved structures on private or public
property, severe pruning and/or removal of the vegetation is allowable provided
prior approval from the Zoning Administrator is obtained, and the performance
standard of the landscape area is maintained consistent with this UDO.
      (9)   Unapproved removal of vegetation and/or severe or excessive pruning
in non-emergency situations will result in a violation of this UDO.
      (10)   The owner of the property on which a required fence or wall is
located shall maintain the fence or wall in a safe and attractive condition.
This shall mean the following:
         (a)   No fence or wall shall have more than 10% of its surface area
with disfigured, cracked, ripped or peeling paint or other material;
         (b)   A fence or wall shall not stand with bent or broken supports,
including loose or missing appendages; and
         (c)   Fences and walls shall be plumb (vertical) to the ground.
   (I)   Replacement of disturbed and damaged vegetation.
      (1)   The disturbance or damage of vegetation within any required
buffers, streetscapes, vehicular use areas or other landscape areas required by
this chapter, or by zoning condition, shall constitute a violation of the UDO.
      (2)   The natural death of existing vegetation within any required
landscape area does not constitute a violation and would not require
revegetation to replace the plant material, unless the required landscape area
no longer achieves the required performance standards of this chapter.
      (3)   All disturbed or damaged landscaped areas and natural vegetation
shall be replanted so as to meet the standards of this chapter, as well as the
approved site and/or subdivision plat, if applicable. A replacement planting
plan shall be submitted for review and approval by the Zoning Administrator
prior to replacement. This plan will ensure proper replacements are made.
      (4)   In situations where existing required vegetation on a developed
site or vacant site with an approved site and/or subdivision plat has been
removed or damaged in violation of this chapter, the Zoning Administrator may
require that the entire site be reviewed and revegetated consistent with the
current provisions of this chapter.
   (J)   Compliance. The property owner shall be held responsible for
compliance with the provisions of this section and shall cooperate with the
city in its efforts to administer and enforce these requirements. Any act
constituting a violation of this section that results in destruction, removal
or damage of trees, shrubs and any other regulated vegetation without a permit,
shall subject the property owner to enforcement proceedings as cited in
Chapter 162.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 157.04 TREE PRESERVATION AND REPLACEMENT.
   (A)   Tree preservation.
      (1)   Preservation and credit. Existing vegetation on all development
sites should be preserved to the greatest extent possible and incorporated in
the project landscape plan in order to promote the preservation of existing
natural areas. Credits for tree preservation toward buffer, parking and other
landscaping requirements are available when a tree preservation plan or site
plan illustrating trees to be saved is submitted prior to grading the site.
      (2)   Tree Protection Zones (TPZ). The preservation plan should specify
the location of temporary tree protection fences to protect trees and their
roots during construction. Temporary protection fences (defined in §
157.03(F)) shall be erected and encroachment prohibited in the TPZ area using
the following guidelines:
 
Table 157-2
Trunk Diameter Good Protection Better Protection Best Protection
8 inches       10 feet         12 feet           20 feet
12 inches      15 feet         18 feet           30 feet
16 inches      20 feet         24 feet           40 feet
20 inches      25 feet         30 feet           50 feet
 
   (B)   Standards for preservation or replacement. For the purpose of
achieving the objectives outlined in §
157.03(A) all new commercial or residential developments shall provide for the
preservation or replacement of regulated trees using the following minimum
standards.
      (1)   The total number of regulated trees to be retained should be at
least 15 trees per acre (less impervious surface area (ex. parking, building)).
      (2)   If there are less than 15 regulated trees per acre on the site,
then the difference shall be replaced with new or existing smaller trees, to a
total of 15 trees per acre equaling at least one caliper inch per tree planted
or retained.
      (3)   If there are no regulated trees on the site, then at least 15 new
or existing trees per acre (less impervious surface area) equaling at least one
caliper inch per tree shall be planted or retained.
      (4)   In the event a developer clear-cuts a lot or tract and has failed
to provide a site plan to the office of Planning and Inspections, the developer
shall be required to plant 23 trees per acre (less impervious surface area),
each with a minimum caliper of one inch.
      (5)   Regulated trees that are retained may be used to fulfill some of
the planting requirements of street yard, parking facilities or buffering,
provided they are not damaged by construction activities or the intended use of
the property.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 157.05 SCREENING.

compliance with this section.
      (2)   Heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and other mechanical and
utility equipment, which is located on, beside or adjacent to any building or
development shall be fully screened from the view of streets and adjacent
property. The screen shall exceed the height of the equipment, shall not
interfere with the operation of the equipment, and shall use building materials
and design which are compatible with those used for the exterior of the
principal building.
      (3)   Where mechanical and utility equipment is located on the roof of a
structure, all devices will be fully screened from the view of streets or
adjacent property after grading or other improvements are made outside or
adjacent to the site.
      (4)   Utility equipment and facilities associated with on-site electric,
cable, telephone, gas or other similar utility shall be screened, to the extent
possible, with evergreen plantings or other acceptable alternative approved by
the Zoning Administrator. It is noted that certain areas around this equipment
and facilities must remain clear based on each utility company’s guidelines.
   (B)   Trash containment areas.
      (1)   All site plans shall show method of garbage collection as well as
appropriate details to demonstrate compliance with this section.
      (2)   All trash containment devices, including compactors and dumpsters,

taller than (whichever is greater) the highest point of the compactor or
dumpster.
         (c)   The enclosure shall be made of a material that is at least 80%
opaque and compatible with the design and materials of the principal building.
The preferable material is masonry with solid metal gates; however, wood or
other similar material may be used as long as the material used protects the
enclosure from damage caused by unloading the trash container.
         (d)   The screening enclosure must be surrounded with a continuous
landscaped buffer composed of shrubs, ground cover and trees that further
visually hide the compactor or dumpster from view. Mulch and ground cover used
with the vegetative buffer shall be composed of organic materials.
         (e)   All compactors and dumpsters shall be placed on an elevated
concrete pad within the enclosure that is a minimum of four inches thick (or
larger if needed to provide adequate support).
         (f)   Because of the environmental risk from spills, dumpster pads
cannot be in a drainage flow area and must be designed to prevent the leaching
of waste.
         (g)   The enclosure shall contain gates to allow for access and
security. Gates must be maintained in good working order, and remain closed and
secured during inactivity.
      (4)   All driveways and turnarounds leading to the enclosure for use by
trash collection vehicles shall be paved with concrete or asphalt.
   (C)   Maintenance.
      (1)   Nonliving screening enclosures shall be maintained, cleaned and
repaired by the owner of the property, holder of the easement or occupant/
tenant on which the enclosure is located. The enclosures shall be kept free of
litter and advertising.
      (2)   Vegetative buffers surrounding the screening enclosures shall be
maintained by the owner of the property, holder of the easement or occupant/
tenant on which the enclosure is located.

(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 157.07 PARKING, STACKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Application. Each application for a zoning permit, building permit
or certificate of occupancy submitted to the Zoning Administrator as provided
for in
Chapter 153 shall include information as to the location and dimensions of off-
street parking and loading space(s) and the means of ingress and egress to the
space(s).
Chapter 153 indicates whether this information needs to be presented on a plot
plan or site plan. This information shall be in sufficient detail to enable the
Zoning Administrator to determine whether or not the requirements of this
section are met.
      (2)   Parking, stacking and loading space(s) required. There shall be
provided permanent off-street parking spaces in the amount specified by this
section at the time of the erection of any building, change of use of any
building, or the addition of 250 square feet or more to any existing building.
For purposes of this section, change in use means a change in the category of
permitted use type as set forth on
Table 157-5.
      (3)   Required number.
         (a)   All developments and uses in all zoning districts shall provide
a sufficient number of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles
that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development or use in
question.
         (b)   The minimum number of required off-street parking, stacking and
loading spaces is indicated in division (C) below and division (I) below.
      (4)   Handicapped spaces. Spaces for the physically handicapped shall be
provided as required by the State Building Code, Volume I-C and the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990.
      (5)   Reduction of minimum requirements. Unless there is a change in use
requiring fewer spaces, the number of spaces shall not be reduced below the
minimum requirements of this section.
      (6)   Maintenance. All parking, stacking and loading facilities shall be
permanently maintained by the owners or occupants as long as the use they serve
exists.
      (7)   Access. All parking, stacking and loading facilities shall have
vehicular access to a public street or approved private street.
      (8)   Use for no other purpose. Land used to provide required parking,
stacking and loading shall not be used for any other purposes, except for
authorized temporary events. If the land is devoted to any other purpose, the
Certificate of Occupancy of the affected principal use shall immediately become
void.
      (9)   Compliance with air quality standards. The construction of or
modification to: open parking lots containing 1,500 or more spaces; or parking
decks and garages containing 750 or more spaces shall comply with the
concentrated air emissions standards and permitting requirements of the State
Division of Environmental Management. (15A NCAC 02D .0805)
      (10)   Parking restrictions. See
Chapter 73 of the code of ordinances and this UDO for specific regulations
regarding parking restrictions on public streets, including specific parking
prohibitions, storage of certain types of motor vehicles and the parking and
storage restrictions for oversized motor vehicles.
   (B)   Parking requirements for change in use. If a change in use causes an
increase in the required number of off-street parking, stacking or loading
spaces, the additional spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of this section; except that if the change in use would require an
increase of less than 5% in the required number of parking spaces, no
additional off-street parking shall be required.
   (C)   Number of parking and stacking spaces required. The minimum number of
required off-street parking spaces required shall be calculated by parking
category or by peak service factor, as follows:
      (1)   Parking category.
         (a)   The minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for
each permitted use shall be calculated by parking category as shown in
Table 157-5, according to the parking requirements shown in
Table 157-3. The only exception is for manufactured home parks, which are
subject to separate requirements, pursuant to division (C)(3) below.
Table 157-3: Parking Requirements by Parking Category
Parking Category Minimum Off-Street Parking Facility Requirements
Table 157-3: Parking Requirements by Parking Category
Parking Category Minimum Off-Street Parking Facility Requirements
A                Two parking spaces per dwelling unit
B                Two parking spaces per dwelling unit plus one for each four
                 dwelling units
C                One parking space per room plus 10% of that number for
                 employees
D                Three parking spaces in addition to residence requirements
E                One parking space for each four seats in the principal place
                 of assembly
                 Parking space requirements are conditional with individual
F                special use permits, conditional zoning districts and home
                 occupation permits granted
G                One parking space for each 200 square feet of gross floor area
H                One parking space for each 600 square feet of gross floor area
I                One parking space for each 1,000 square feet of gross floor
                 area
J                Two parking spaces for the lot plus one parking space for each
                 service bay
K                One parking space for each 200 square feet of activity area
L                One parking space for each 250 square feet of gross floor area
N/A              Not applicable - no specific amount of off-street parking is
                 required
 
         (b)   In the case of a building or use not expressly provided for on
Table 157-5, the number of off-street spaces shall be the same as for a similar
use or inclusive category which is provided for.
         (c)   Where there is more than one use of a single structure or on a
single tract, or two or more instances of the same use, the minimum number of
required off-street parking spaces shall be equal to the sum of the
requirements of the various areas.
         (d)   In the case of those uses requiring a special use permit (SUP)
or conditional zoning district (CD) as indicated in the Permitted Use Table (
Table 155-8), the number of off-street spaces required will be conditional with
approval of the SUP or CD.
         (e)   In the case of mixed occupancy, the minimum number of off-street
parking, stacking and loading spaces shall be the cumulative total of
individual use requirements unless otherwise specified.
         (f)   In no event shall a nonresidential use or the nonresidential
component of a mixed use development provide more than 120% of the minimum
parking spaces, except through the approval by the Zoning Administrator of a
parking demand study, prepared by a qualified professional, which demonstrates
the need for parking spaces in excess of 120% of the minimum requirement.
         (g)   Whenever the number of parking spaces required in this section
results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or
less may be disregarded while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted
as one parking space.
         (h)   The Board of Commissioners recognizes that, due to the
particularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the
parking standards set forth in this section may result in a development either
with inadequate parking spaces or parking spaces far in excess of its needs.
Therefore, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the
requirements of this section and may require more parking or allow less parking
whenever it finds that the deviations are more likely to satisfy the general
standards delineated in division (A) above.
            1.   The permit-issuing authority may allow deviations, for
example, when it finds that a residential development is irrevocably oriented
toward the elderly, disabled or other population that demonstrates a lesser
parking need or when it finds that a business or service is primarily oriented
to walk-in trade.
            2.   The permit-issuing authority may also, for example, require
additional overflow or visitor parking in cases where the proposed lot sizes
are such that anticipated parking needs for occasional visitors cannot be
accommodated on individual lots. Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows
or requires a deviation from the requirements of this section, it shall enter
on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the
reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.
      (2)   Peak space factor.
         (a)   Purpose. Certain uses by their nature may require less parking
related to socioeconomic characteristics of users, alternative modes available
(bicycle, pedestrian), parking space availability, cost of parking,
accessibility, peak and periodic use factors and employee, and visitor, patron
characteristics. Peak space factor relates to local data regarding vehicle
occupancy, transit use and peak hour requirements.
         (b)   Applicability. These peak factors may be applied when their
source, accessibility and limitations are known and sufficient details are
provided to the Zoning Administrator during the site plan and permit approval
process.
         (c)   Requirements. At the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, the
following peak space factor may be used in place of the parking category
requirements (
Table 157-3) to determine the required parking for the following uses.
 
Table 157-4
Use                              Peak Space Factor
Retail trade less than 10,000 sf 1.0 to 4.0 spaces per 1,000 sf gross leasable
                                 area
Office                           0.5 to 3.0 spaces per 1,000 sf gross leasable
                                 area and 0.1 to 0.75 per employee
Industrial                       0.67 to 3.5 spaces per 1,000 sf gross leasable
                                 area and 0.36 to 1.6 spaces per employee
Restaurant                       5 to 25 spaces per 1,000 sf gross leasable
                                 area
 
      (3)   Manufactured home parks. Each manufactured home space within the
park shall be provided with at least two off-drive parking spaces.
         (a)   The parking spaces shall be no farther away than 50 feet from
the manufactured home space which they serve.
         (b)   In addition, there shall be provided one off-drive parking space
for each four manufactured home spaces in the park.
         (c)   Each off-drive parking space shall be at least nine feet by 18
feet.
         (d)   Automobile parking shall not be allowed in other than the
parking areas specified in the Manufactured Home Park Plan and areas so
specified shall be off the drive.
      (4)   Alternative transportation. To promote alternative modes of
transportation within the city, one parking space for the development, as
required in divisions (C)(1) through (3) above, located in a central area of
the development, may be exchanged for bicycle facilities (i.e., bike racks).

§ 157.08 OUTDOOR LIGHTING.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   All exterior lighting, such as that used in and around buildings,
recreation areas, parking lots and signs, shall be designed to protect against
the spillover of light to adjacent properties. It shall also be designed to
protect against glare onto public rights-of-way thereby impairing the vision of
motorists and adjoining properties.
      (2)   All exterior lighting shall be shielded from adjacent properties by
thick evergreen vegetated buffers, berms, walls or fences, and/or the use of
directional lighting, lighting shields, special fixtures, timing devices,
appropriate light intensities, luminaries and mountings at appropriate heights.
      (3)   Exterior lighting shall be architecturally integrated with the
building’s style, materials and colors in the selection and design of light
poles, brackets, and fixtures.
      (4)   All exterior lighting shall not interfere with operation of
aircraft.
   (B)   Lighting plan required.
      (1)   A lighting plan indicating illumination intensities shall be
submitted with site plans, plot plans and subdivision plats except for single-
family detached and manufactured homes on individual lots. The Zoning
Administrator is authorized to waive this requirement for small independent
development projects on less than an acre if the fixture types are specified on
the site plan or plat.
      (2)   Any changes to the lighting plan must be approved by the Zoning
Administrator through a site or plot plan revision and/or subdivision plat
revision.
   (C)   Exterior lighting standards.
      (1)   General standards.
         (a)   Outdoor lighting shall be designed, located and mounted at
heights no greater than:
            1.   Eighteen feet above grade for non-cut-off lights; and
            2.   Thirty-five feet above grade for cut-off lights.
         (b)   Within Accident Potential Zones, the use of cutoff and semi-
cutoff high sodium vapor lighting is required.
         (c)   All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the
maximum illumination measured in foot candles at a property line shall not
exceed 0.4 for non cut-off lights and 1.5 for cut-off lights. Cut-off lighting
shall be designed to direct light downward (e.g., shoe box style).
         (d)   For parking lots, the minimum light level shall be no less than
0.2 foot-candles. The average foot-candle maintained to the minimum foot-
candles ratio shall be no greater than four to one (upper to lower limits).
         (e)   All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be located a minimum of ten
feet from a property or right-of-way line and should not be within a required
perimeter or streetscape buffer unless it is located at the interior edge.
         (f)   Floodlights, spotlights or any other similar lighting shall not
be used to illuminate buildings or other site features unless approved as an
integral architectural element on the development plan. On-site lighting may be
used to accent architectural elements and not be used to illuminate entire
portions of building(s).
      (2)   Lighting for canopies.
         (a)   Lighting for canopies shall be restricted to lighting fixtures
(including lenses) that do not project below the bottom of the canopy. Lighting
for canopies for service stations and other similar uses shall not exceed an
average of 20 foot-candles as measured at ground level at the inside of the
outside edge of the canopy.
         (b)   Canopies used for building accents over doors, windows and the
like, shall not be internally lit (i.e., from underneath or behind the canopy).
      (3)   Wall pack lights.
         (a)   Wall packs on buildings may be used at entrances to a building
to light unsafe areas. They are not intended to draw attention to the building
or provide general building or site lighting.
         (b)   Wall packs on the exterior of the building shall be fully
shielded (true cut-off type--bulb or light source not visible from off-site) to
direct the light vertically downward and be of low wattage (preferably 100
watts or lower).
      (4)   Illumination of outdoor sports fields and outdoor events areas.
         (a)   All the lighting fixtures shall be equipped with a glare control
package (e.g., louvers, shields or similar devices), and the fixtures shall be
aimed so that their beams are directed and fall within the primary playing or
event area; and
         (b)   The hours of operation for the lighting system for any game or
event shall not exceed one hour after the end of the game or event.
      (5)   Sign lighting. Lighting fixtures illuminating signs shall comply
with the requirements of §
157.09, and the fixtures shall be aimed and shielded so that direct
illumination is focused exclusively on the sign face.
      (6)   Timer devices.
         (a)   Timer devices shall be employed to shut off luminaries or to
reduce light levels when full lighting is not required, such as after normal
business hours.
         (b)   Special attention shall be given to protecting adjoining
residential properties from off-site illumination after 10:00 pm.

      (2)   In addition, the following regulations apply to the signs indicated
below.
         (a)   Fixed advertising and business signs and structures. Total fixed
sign area per lot shall not exceed 150 square feet per 100 linear feet of lot
street frontage. For lots with less than 100 linear feet of lot street
frontage, total fixed sign area shall not exceed 150 square feet for the total
lot street frontage. For lots with more than 100 linear feet of lot street
frontage, total fixed sign area for the lot is calculated as follows: total lot
street frontage (linear feet) multiplied by one and one-half equals total fixed
sign area (in square feet) for that lot. Advertising and business signs painted
on walls, roofs, and windows, or permanently mounted flush to a wall, roof or
window (including, without limitation, permanently mounted to the interior of a
window or window frame as to be legible from outside the window) and projecting
no more than 12 inches there from, are exempt from the restriction in §
157.09(B) regarding height of signs and from the restriction in §
157.09(B) regarding side setbacks and are not included in sign area or number
calculations, but otherwise are subject to the requirements of this chapter.

            1.   No more than one portable sign per business or occupancy.
            2.   Other than signs for lease, rent, sale, construction or
remodeling of residential or other non-commercial property (including
subdivision and PUD signs), signs may be located in H-C (Highway-Commercial),
L-I (Light Industrial) and H-I (Heavy Industrial) Districts only.
            3.   Total allowable sign area per lot shall be calculated as the
remaining allowable square footage for total sign area per lot. For example, if
the lot already has utilized 132 square feet of the total allowed sign area of
150 square feet, then 18 square feet may only be utilized for the portable
sign.
            4.   Total portable sign area per lot shall not exceed 32 square
feet.
            5.   Portable signs must be properly secured to prevent the sign
from becoming windblown debris.
            6.   Portable signs shall not be connected to or utilize an
external power source, including (without limitation) by use of an electrical
extension cord or cable.
            7.   The following portable sign type is prohibited:

         (c)   Fixed subdivision and PUD signs. Signs shall identify only the
name of the subdivision or PUD and shall meet all of the following
requirements:
            1.   No more than two signs per entrance;
            2.   Total signage shall not exceed 64 square feet in area;
            3.   Signs shall not be placed on any public thoroughfare, easement
or lands or on any designated recreational land;
            4.   Signs shall be located within the identified subdivision; and
            5.   Island type signs are subject to the following additional

               a.   Signs must be designed and constructed on parcels of land
which are landscaped so as to conform to the aesthetic standards of the
sponsoring developer, the corresponding homeowner’s association and/or the
city;
               b.   The sign shall be located not less than 15 feet from the
right-of-way of the public street which intersects with the street or streets
surrounding the sign; provided, that the distance shall be reduced to five feet
for signs which are not more than 12 square feet in total structure area and
not more than 36 inches in height as measured from the street level of the
street or streets surrounding the sign;
               c.   The island on which the sign is located shall be enclosed
by a curb and shall be of a design and construction which is in accordance with
all applicable requirements of the State Department of Transportation;
               d.   No more than one sign shall be located at each subdivision
or PUD access street;
               e.   If illuminated, the illumination shall illuminate only the

               f.   A sign shall not exceed 42 square feet in total structure
area, and no sign shall be more than six feet in height as measured from the
street level of the public street or streets surrounding the sign; provided,
that the signs may exceed six feet in height if the width thereof is not more

               g.   A sign shall not be located, erected, placed or constructed
at any street intersection or within 50 feet of the intersection until a
traffic stop sign or signal is located permanently at the intersection.
   (E)   Billboards and commercial off-premises signs.
      (1)   Billboards and commercial off-premise signs shall not be allowed
within the city limits.
      (2)   Within the city’s extraterritorial jurisdiction, outside city
limits, billboards and commercial off-premises signs are allowed in H-C
(Highway-Commercial) Districts only, with a permit with the following
requirements:
         (a)   Maximum size: 378 square feet;
         (b)   Maximum height: 50 feet; measured vertically from the adjacent
edge of pavement of the main traveled way;
         (c)   Setback from a public right-of-way: 20 feet;
         (d)   Setback from a residentially zoned or residentially developed
property: 50 feet;
         (e)   Separation: minimum of 1,000 feet measured radially from
proposed billboard to any existing billboard or commercial off-premises sign;
         (f)   All billboards and commercial off-premises signs with sign face
areas greater than 32 square feet shall be designed and constructed with a
monopole support structure meeting the standards as set forth by the North
Carolina Building Code with respect to wind loads and foundation design; and
         (g)   Portable signs not complying with this section may be removed by
the Zoning Administrator and destroyed after five days
   (F)   Computation of sign area. Sign area is computed by including the
largest total surface area on the sign that is visible from any one vantage
point, using the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other
display, forming a square, rectangle, triangle or circle as appropriate,
together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background
of the display used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure
against which it is placed. This does not include any supporting framework or
bracing, even if between sections or modules, that is clearly incidental to the
display itself. For example, for a sign with two equal faces placed back to
back on the same structure, so that only one side can be seen from any vantage
point, sign area is computed using the surface area on one face only. Figures
155-36 through 155-41 graphically illustrates how to calculate the sign area
for a variety of signs. Sign area for a lot is computed by adding together the
sign area of all signs on that lot.

   (G)   Removal of nonconforming fixed subdivision and PUD signs.
      (1)   Nonconforming fixed subdivision and PUD signs may be removed on
approval of the Board of Commissioners after a written notice recommending the
removal is posted on the subject sign by the Department of Planning and
Inspections for a period of seven consecutive days and a public hearing is held
to consider the removal thereof. The written notice shall describe the sign
sufficiently to identify it, recite the conditions causing the sign to be
nonconforming, and state the date and time (which cannot be prior to expiration
of the aforementioned seven-day period) set for the public hearing thereon.
      (2)   In addition to nonconformity with any of the requirements set forth
herein, removal also may be recommended in the following circumstances:
         (a)   The sign is determined by the Department of Planning and
Inspections to be a hazard to public safety and/or traffic;
         (b)   The sign is not being maintained, thereby constituting a public
nuisance, or is not contributing to the aesthetic standards and development of
the city as determined by the Department of Planning and Inspections or the
Director of Public Works;
         (c)   The sign has not been appraised for tax purposes by the County
Tax Assessor’s Office; and/or
         (d)   The sign does not comply with the applicable standards for
nonconforming use of land and/or minor structures as set forth in this chapter.
   (H)   LED-LCD and electronic message signage.
      (1)   LED-LCD and electronic message signage shall be defined as signs
that possess alphabetic, pictographic or symbolic content that can be changed
or altered on a display screen using light-emitting diode technology, liquid-
crystal display technology or other technology that produces an electronic
image on a display screen. LED-LCD and electronic message signage shall be
permitted in accordance with this section, provided the signage complies with
the following standards:
         (a)   LED-LCD and electronic message signage shall only be allowed in
the following zoning districts: (HC) Highway Commercial, (LI) Light Industrial,
(HI) Heavy Industrial and (GS) Government Services. LED-LCD and electronic
message signage may be allowed in (O&I) Office and Institutional only after
issuance of a special exception use permit.
         (b)   LED-LCD and electronic message signage shall not exceed 60
square feet in size or 30% of the total sign area of the allowable square
footage as specified in §
157.09(B)(5), whichever is smaller.
         (c)   LED-LCD and electronic message signage shall be set to a
specific brightness level and shall automatically respond to changing light
conditions (i.e., become less bright at night). Written certification shall be
provided with sign permit application from the sign manufacturer that the sign
will not exceed the following light level standard as measured in nits. A NIT
is a non-SI name used for the International System of Units (SI) in measured
luminance based on candela per square meter (cd/m2):
            1.   Maximum daytime level at 5,000 nits or 7,500 nits if the sign
is equipped with an automatic dimmer; and
            2.   Maximum nighttime level at 500 nits.
         (d)   The leading edge of any new LED-LCD and electronic message
signage shall be set back a minimum of ten feet from the front property line
and not exceed 30 feet in height from the ground at any point. The signs shall
comply with all other side and rear yard setback requirements contained in
Table 155-9.
         (e)   LED-LCD and electronic message signage shall contain a default
design that will freeze the display in one position or power off the display if
a malfunction occurs.
         (f)   LED-LCD and electronic message signage that use off-premise
advertising (i.e., advertising used for the purpose of displaying nonpoint-of-
sale advertisement which directs attention to a business, establishment,
profession, service, event, entertainment, condition or commodity that is
located, manufactured, conducted, sold or otherwise offered or provided at an
off-premise or off-site location other than the lot of record where the
advertising is displayed) shall be limited to 50% of the display time devoted
to off-premise advertising; and shall require the sign owner or operator to
keep adequate records to demonstrate compliance with this requirement.
      (2)   Failure of any LED-LCD and electronic message signage to comply
with the provisions of this section shall cause the LED-LCD and electronic
message sign to become nonconforming and shall be subject to the requirements
of
Chapter 161.
      (3)   Existing LED-LCD and electronic signage shall have 180 days from
the date of adoption of this UDO to conform to divisions (H)(1)(c), (d), (e)
and (f) above. If for any reason the signage cannot conform to these standards,
the LED-LCD and electronic message signage shall become nonconforming and shall
be subject to the requirements of
Chapter 161.
      (4)   An existing LED-LCD and electronic message signage may be moved by
its owner to a new location within the jurisdiction of Havelock, provided prior
approval is obtained from the Director of Planning and Inspections, the sign is
placed in its new location so as to comply with all applicable zoning and
setback requirements of this chapter, and the nonconformity of the sign is not
expanded due to the size of the new location.
      (5)   Any LED-LCD and electronic message signage that becomes
nonconforming after adoption of this section shall be in violation of this UDO;
provided, the LED-LCD and electronic message signage’s owner may apply to the
Director of Planning and Inspections or his or her designee for a waiver of the
applicable requirement(s). The request for waiver shall contain justification
for the waiver, including, without limitation, evidence of hardship and written
documentation with manufacturer specifications or other supporting documents
requested by the Director of Planning and Inspections adequately demonstrating
inability to conform with this section. The Director of Planning and
Inspections may grant a waiver based on the following criteria:
         (a)   The cost to conform would exceed 50% of the present value of the
sign; or
         (b)   A functional inability to conform as demonstrated by the
manufacturer specifications.
      (6)   If a request for waiver is denied by the Director of Planning and
Inspections, then the applicant may appeal the action to the City Board of
Adjustment pursuant to
Chapter 159. Any LED-LCD and electronic message signage in violation of this
UDO must be brought back into conformity with this UDO within 30 days of notice
of violation or cease operation. An appeal or request for waiver shall stay the
30-day period for the duration of the appeal or waiver period.

§ 157.10 RECREATION AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purposes and intent of the recreational and open space
regulations prescribed in this section to be as follows:
      (1)   To provide adequate active recreational areas and passive open
space;
      (2)   To encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation;
      (3)   To encourage the retention of environmentally fragile areas;
      (4)   To encourage the protection of air and water quality;
      (5)   To enhance flood control; and
      (6)   To provide higher quality development.
   (B)   Minimum public recreational space requirements.
      (1)   Generally. Every person, corporation, partnership, other entity or
any combination thereof who or which subdivides land for residential purposes
is required to dedicate a portion of the land as provided in division (B)(3)(a)
below or, upon determination by the Board of Commissioners that the land is not
suitable for recreational purposes, to make a payment in lieu of dedication as
provided in division (B)(3)(b) below, for the purpose of public recreation to
serve the needs of the residents of the subdivision. At the request of the
subdivider, the Board of Commissioners may accept a payment in lieu of
dedication notwithstanding that land within the property to be subdivided may
be suitable for recreational purposes or may accept a partial dedication of
land and a partial payment in lieu thereof when the Board of Commissioners
determines that same is in the best interest of the citizens of the area to be
served. All payments received by the city in lieu of dedication shall be
expended for capital improvements of recreation facilities within the city or
its extraterritorial jurisdiction.
      (2)   Specifically. The requirements of §
157.10(B) shall be applicable to each of the following types of residential
development, or other residential uses not listed:
         (a)   Traditional detached single-family, modular home, duplex home,
multiplex attached home, zero-lot line detached and planned manufactured
housing subdivisions;
         (b)   Residential cluster developments;
         (c)   Townhouse developments;
         (d)   Condominium developments;
         (e)   Individual residential components of a Traditional Neighborhood
Development that include the subdivision of property for sale to individual
owners;
         (f)   Manufactured home parks;
         (g)   Multi-family dwelling/apartment complex; and
         (h)   Mixed use developments (i.e., that include upper story attached
dwellings).
      (3)   Dedication/payment.
         (a)   Amount of land to be dedicated. The amount of land required to
be dedicated by a subdivider shall be based upon the most recent U.S. Bureau of
Census population figures for an average size family in the city and a park and
recreation standard factor of seven acres per 1,000 persons determined by the
following formula: Total number of dwelling units proposed × Average size of
family × .007 acres per person × Amount of land to be dedicated. Examples: 100
units × 3.2 persons/unit × .007 acres/person = 2.24 acres; 26 units × 3.2
persons/unit × .007 acres/person = 0.58 acres.
         (b)   Amount of payment in lieu of dedication. The amount of money
required to be paid in lieu of dedication by a subdivider shall be an amount
based upon the most recent U.S. Bureau of Census population figures for an
average size family in the city, a park and recreation standard factor of seven
acres per 1,000 persons and the average per acre value for property tax
purposes of the land to be subdivided determined by the following formula:
Total number of dwelling units proposed × Average size of family × .007 acres
per person × 100% of the average per acre value for property tax purposes of
land to be subdivided = Amount of payment in lieu of dedication. Examples: 100
units × 3.2 persons/unit × .007 acres/person × ($2,563.81 average per acre
value for property tax purposes) = $5,742.93; 26 units × 3.2 persons/unit ×
.007 acres/person × ($2,563.81 average per acre value for property tax
purposes) = $1,493.16.
      (4)   Suitability of land. Criteria for use in evaluating suitability of
proposed recreation areas shall include, but not be limited to, the following,
as determined by the City Board of Commissioners after recommendations of the
Planning Board.
         (a)   Unity. The dedicated recreation land shall, where possible, form
a single parcel of land except where the City Board of Commissioners, upon
recommendation of the Planning Board, determines that two parcels or more would
be in the public interest. Recreation areas shall fit into an interconnected
system with pedestrian walkways, which could also serve as routes to schools,
churches and other major pedestrian destinations.
         (b)   Location and access. The dedicated recreation land shall be
located so as to reasonably serve the recreational needs of the immediate
neighborhood within the subdivision. The recreation and walkway system should
be located in block interiors and oriented away from exposure to heavy
automotive traffic. Dedicated recreation land must have a minimum width of at
least 60 feet of street frontage or a dedicated right-of-way of not less than
60 feet in width.
         (c)   Usableness. The dedicated recreation land shall be usable for
recreation. Lakes and swampy areas shall not be included in computing dedicated
recreation land area unless acceptable to the City Board of Commissioners upon
recommendation of the Planning Board and recreation director. Lift stations or
other utility facilities are prohibited on dedicated recreation land.
      (5)   Administrative procedures.
         (a)   Subdivider responsibility. At the time of filing a preliminary
plat for approval, the owner of the property shall, as a part of the filing,
indicate the area or areas to be dedicated for recreation purposes on the
preliminary plat as submitted or his or her desires to give fees in lieu of
dedication.
         (b)   City responsibility. At the time the preliminary plat is
submitted for approval, the Planning Board shall make its recommendations to
the City Board as to accept a dedication or fee in lieu of dedication of land
within the subdivision.
         (c)   Prerequisites for approval of final plat. Where a dedication is
required by the City Board of Commissioners, the dedication shall be shown upon
the final plat submitted for approval. Where a dedication of land is proposed
for a subdivision, the deed will be submitted with the final plat. If a fee in
lieu of land is proposed the fee may be paid upon final subdivision approval by
the City Board of Commissioners or the developer may choose to pay, by the lot,
with the request for a building permit.
      (6)   Intent of section. It is the intent of this section to permit an
early determination regarding recreation areas, especially of small
subdivisions which, because of their proximity to other recreation areas or
other good reasons, may not need recreation areas for the orderly development
of the proposed subdivision.
   (C)   Minimum private recreational space requirements.
      (1)   The developer of manufactured home parks, semi-attached/duplex,
multiplex and multi-family/apartment developments that include the construction
of dwelling units not intended for sale to individual owners shall be required
to reserve a portion of land for private recreational development to serve the
needs of the residents of the development. The purpose of this requirement is
to ensure that unsubdivided residential developments provide adequate active
recreational facilities to serve the residents of the development.
      (2)   The following are illustrative of the types of facilities that
shall be deemed to serve active recreational needs and therefore count toward
compliance with the private recreational space requirements of this section:
tennis courts, racquetball courts, swimming pools, sauna and exercise rooms,
meeting or activity rooms with clubhouses, swings, slides and play apparatus.
Each development shall install the types of recreational facilities and
equipment that are most likely to be suited to and used by the age bracket of
persons likely to reside in the development. Facilities and equipment for
active recreation shall be indicated on the site plan provided by the developer
and shall be reviewed by the Director of the City Parks and Recreation
Department. The Recreation Director shall forward a recommendation as to the
adequacy of the proposed recreational facilities and equipment to the Planning
Board for review and recommendation to the Board of Commissioners.
      (3)   The developer of each semi-attached/duplex, multiplex, upper story
attached, and multi-family residential development that includes dwelling units
that are not constructed for the purpose of sale to individual owners shall
reserve a minimum of 750 square feet of active recreational space per
manufactured home space or dwelling unit.
      (4)   The owner of the development shall be responsible for the
continuing upkeep and proper maintenance of the private, active recreational
space required by this section.
   (D)   Private common open space requirements for residential developments.
      (1)   Private, common open space shall be required for residential
developments where higher residential densities and/or smaller lot sizes than
base zoning for the zoning district in which located are allowed. This
requirement shall be in addition to any public or private recreational space
requirements required by divisions (B) and (C) above, and shall apply to each
of the following types of residential development:
         (a)   Multifamily/apartment, semi-attached/duplex, multiplex
developments that include dwelling units that are not constructed for the
purpose of sale to individual owners;
         (b)   Manufactured home park parks;
         (c)   Condominium and townhouse developments;
         (d)   Upper story attached dwellings;
         (e)   Zero lot line developments;
         (f)   Residential cluster developments; and
         (g)   Traditional neighborhood developments.
      (2)   Common open space may be passive or active and shall be owned and
maintained by the property owner, a property owners association, or approved
private, non-profit organization as authorized in division (E) below.
      (3)   Multi-family/apartment complex. The developer of each multi-family/
apartment complex development that includes dwelling units that are not
constructed for the purpose of sale to individual owners shall reserve 1,000
square feet of open space per dwelling unit.
      (4)   Manufactured home park. The developer of each manufactured home
park shall reserve 1,500 square feet of open space per dwelling unit.
      (5)   Condominium, townhouse and upper story attached development. The
developer of each condominium, townhouse or upper story attached development
shall reserve 500 square feet of open space per dwelling unit.
      (6)   Zero lot line development. The developer of each zero lot line
development shall reserve 500 square feet of open space per dwelling unit.
      (7)   Residential cluster development. The developer of each residential
cluster development shall reserve open space as follows.
         (a)   The minimum amount of open space shall equal the amount of lot
area by which all dwelling unit lots are reduced below the base zoning for
single-family detached residential units for the zoning district in which
located.
         (b)   For example, a proposed residential cluster development in the
R-20 Zoning District allows minimum lot sizes of 12,000 square feet. The base
minimum lot size for a single-family unit in R-20 is 20,000 square feet.
Consequently, the 8,000 square feet of lot area resulting from the reduced lot
size shall be set aside for common open space. The application of this open
space requirement for a ten-acre residential cluster development in an R-20
Zoning District is illustrated below:
Table 157-7
Example of Minimum Open Space Required for a Residential Cluster Development
Located in an R-20 Zoning District

Base maximum # single-family residential units           22 max. du
Base minimum lot area per single-family residential unit 20,000 sq. feet
Total base minimum single-family residential lot area    440,000 sq. feet
Residential cluster minimum lot area per unit            12,000 sq. feet
Total residential cluster minimum lot area               264,000 sq. feet
Difference in minimum lot areas                          176,000 sq. feet
Common open space acres to be dedicated                  4.04 acres
 
      (8)   Upper story attached dwellings and mixed use. The developer of each
upper story attached dwelling unit shall reserve a minimum of 500 square feet
of open space per dwelling unit.
      (9)   TND Developments. The developer of each residential component
(i.e., multi-family, condominiums, zero lot line homes and the like) of a
traditional neighborhood development shall reserve open space as required above
for that specific type of residential development. The nonresidential
components of each traditional neighborhood development shall reserve open
space equal to a minimum of 15% of the gross land area of the nonresidential
portion of the development (see also
Chapter 155).
      (10)   For purposes of this division (D), OPEN SPACE means an area that:
         (a)   Is not encumbered with any structure unless the structure is
intended for recreational purposes and is accessible to all residents of the
development or general public;
         (b)   Is not contained within a street right-of-way or otherwise
devoted to use as a roadway or parking area not associated with the use of the
open space;
         (c)   Is left in its natural or undisturbed state (as of the date
development began), if wooded (except for the cutting of trails for walking or
jogging) or, if not wooded at the time of development, is landscaped for ball
fields, picnic areas, play areas or similar recreational facilities, or is
properly vegetated and landscaped with the objective of creating a wooded area
or other area that is consistent with the objective set forth in division (D)
(10)(d) below;
         (d)   Is capable of being used and enjoyed for purposes of informal
and unstructured recreation and relaxation;
         (e)   Is legally and practically accessible to the residents of the
development out of which the required open space is taken, or to the public if
dedication of the open space is proposed pursuant to division (E)(3); and
         (f)   Is not encumbered by underground private septic lines, any part
of a private sewage disposal system, or any above-ground or below-ground
structure.
      (11)   All floodplains, wetlands, streams, riparian buffers, ponds, lakes
and other water bodies shall be contained in common open space.
      (12)   Open space shall be shown on the site plan with a notation to
indicate that the open space shall not be used for future structures except as
allowed per division (D)(10)(a) above.
      (13)   The following shall not be counted towards open space areas:
         (a)   Private yards and building setback areas;
         (b)   Public or private streets or street rights-of-way;
         (c)   Parking lot landscaping;
         (d)   Parking areas and driveways; and
         (e)   Land covered by structures except as allowed per division (10)

dedicated to the public except upon the written acceptance of the city,
pursuant to division (E)(3) below, but shall remain under the ownership and
control of the developer (or successor in title) or a property owners’
association or similar organization established pursuant to
Chapter 158. As an alternative to a property owners’ association, a private
non-profit organization, such as a private land trust, whose primary purpose is
the preservation or conservation of open space may own and manage the proposed
open space.
      (2)   The person or entity identified in division (E)(1) above as having
the right of ownership and control over the open space shall be responsible for
the continuing upkeep and maintenance of the same.
      (3)   The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to accept or
reject offers for land dedications made as a requirement of division (D) above.
Land proposed by the developer as public open space on a site plan shall be
considered to be offered for dedication until the offer is officially accepted
by the Board of Commissioners.
         (a)   The offer may be accepted by the city through:
            1.   Written acceptance by the Board of Commissioners; or
            2.   Written acceptance by an administrative officer designated by
the Board of Commissioners.
         (b)   Until the dedication has been accepted, land so offered may be
used for open space purposes by the property owner or by a property owners’
association. Land so offered for dedication shall not be used for any purpose
inconsistent with the proposed public use. The property owner shall be
responsible for the maintenance of all facilities and improvements until an
offer of dedication is accepted by the city.
   (F)   Flexibility in administration authorized.
      (1)   The requirements set forth in divisions (B) through (D) above
concerning the amount, size, location and nature of open space and recreational
space to be provided in connection with residential developments are
established by the Board of Commissioners as standards that presumptively will
result in the provision of that amount of open space and recreational space
that is consistent with generally recognized standards relating to the need for
those areas. The Board of Commissioners recognizes, however, that due to the
particular nature of a tract of land, or the particular type or configuration
of development proposed, or other factors, the underlying objectives of the
recreational and open space requirements may be achieved even though the
standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision. Therefore, the
permit-issuing board is authorized to permit minor deviations from these
standards whenever it determines that: the objectives underlying these
standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and because of
peculiarities in the developer’s tract of land or the particular type or
configuration of the development proposed, it would be unreasonable to require
strict adherence to these standards.
      (2)   Whenever the permit-issuing board authorizes some deviation from
the standards set forth in divisions (B) through (D) above, pursuant to
division (F)(1) above, the official record of action taken on the development
application shall contain a detailed statement of the reasons for allowing the
deviation.

§ 158.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures and standards for the
development and subdivision of real estate within the corporate limits and
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city in order to, among other things,
insure proper legal description, identification, monumentation and recordation
of real estate boundaries; further the orderly layout and appropriate use of
the land; provide safe, convenient and economic circulation of vehicular
traffic; facilitate adequate provision of water, sewerage, schools, parks,
playgrounds and other public requirements; provide adequate building sites
which are readily accessible to emergency vehicles; to secure safety from fire,
panic and other dangers; assure the proper installation of streets and
utilities; promote the eventual elimination of unsafe or unsanitary conditions
because of undue concentration of population; and help conserve and protect the
physical and economic resources of the city and its environs.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 158.02 REGULATION OF SUBDIVISIONS IN GENERAL.
   (A)   Exclusions determination. If a proposed division of land meets one or
more of the exclusions under the definition of “subdivision” in
Chapter 163, Definitions, the owner may submit to the City Planning and
Inspections Department maps, deeds or other materials in sufficient detail to
permit a conclusive determination by the Planning and Inspections Director or
designee. For the purpose and intent of this chapter, where reference is made
to the Planning and Inspections Director it shall also include his or her
designee. An owner of land who wishes to record a plat of such a division of
land shall obtain a Certificate of Exemption (see
Appendix B) from the Planning and Inspections Director.
   (B)   Approval required.
      (1)   Date of compliance. After the effective date of the UDO and in
accordance with G.S. § 160D-803(d), plats for the subdivision of land within
the City Planning and Zoning Jurisdiction shall not be filed, accepted for
recording, or recorded, nor shall the Clerk of the Superior Court order the
recording of a plat until it has been submitted to and approved by the city.
      (2)   Coordination with other procedures. To lessen the time required to
attain all necessary approvals and to facilitate the processing of
applications, an applicant may start the subdivision approval process
simultaneously with other applications for approvals required for the
particular project.
      (3)   No subdivision without approval. No real property, including
property declared under the State Condominium Act, G.S. §§ 47C-1 et seq., lying
within the City Planning and Zoning Jurisdiction as now or hereafter fixed
shall be subdivided except in conformance with all applicable provisions of
this chapter. Violation of this section shall be enforced by any one or all of
the procedures identified in §
162.04.
      (4)    Preliminary plats approved prior to the effective date of this
UDO. Preliminary plats approved by the city prior to the effective date of this
chapter shall be valid for 12 months from the date of approval of the plat
unless a longer time period has been authorized through vested rights
provisions.
      (5)   Decisions on approval or denial of subdivision plats. In accordance
with the provisions of G.S. § 160D-801, decisions on the approval or denial of
preliminary and final subdivision plats may be made only on the basis of
standards explicitly set forth in this chapter. Whenever this chapter includes
criteria for a decision that requires the application of judgment on the part
of the approval authority, those criteria must provide adequate guiding
standards for the approval authority.
      (6)   Recording of unapproved plats. The filing or recording of a plat of
a subdivision without the approval of the legislative body or the Planning and
Inspections Director as required by this chapter shall render the plat null and
void.
      (7)   Penalties for transferring lots in unapproved subdivisions.
Penalties for transferring lots in unapproved subdivisions are delineated in §
162.04(H).
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021; Ord. 22-O-01, passed 1-

§ 158.03 MINOR SUBDIVISION PLAT REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Applicability. The Planning and Inspections Director shall approve or
disapprove minor subdivision plats in accordance with the provisions of this
section. A minor subdivision, as defined in
Chapter 163, is a residential subdivision involving ten or fewer lots fronting
on an existing approved public street(s), not requiring a new street, easement,
extension of utilities or any other improvement to be installed or guaranteed
prior to final plat approval, and not requiring a waiver or variance from any
requirement of the UDO. If a new school site is planned within the boundaries
of a proposed subdivision according to §
158.089, or if the subdivider proposes an Owner’s Association according to §
158.09, the plat shall be considered a major plat and follow all requirements
and standards for major plats pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   Minor subdivision review and approval procedures. The minor
subdivision review process shall include the preparation of a Minor Subdivision
Plat which shall be reviewed and approved as a final plat by the Planning and
Inspections Director.
      (1)   The applicant for minor subdivision plat approval shall submit to
the Planning and Inspections Director, a plat drawn in waterproof ink on a
sheet made of material and of a size that will be acceptable to the Craven
County Register of Deeds Office for recording purposes. When more than one
sheet is required to include the entire subdivision, all sheets shall be made
of the same size and shall show appropriate match marks on each sheet and
appropriate references to other sheets of the subdivision.
      (2)   The minor subdivision plat shall be prepared by a professional land
surveyor or professional engineer licensed to render that service in the state
and shall contain the information specified in
Appendix A, the applicable certificates required in
Appendix B, permanent reference points pursuant to §
158.07, as well as all of the additional information required by G.S. § 47-30
and G.S. § 39-32.3, x A.
      (3)    If the subdivision is a minor subdivision as the result of a
proposed conveyance of property to the city, the minor subdivision plat shall
include a statement that the plat is not valid if the proposed conveyance to
the city is not closed within one year of the recording of the plat.
      (4)   The Planning and Inspections Director and the Technical Review
Committee (TRC) shall review the minor subdivision plat.
      (5)   The Planning and Inspections Director shall take expeditious action
on an application for minor subdivision plat approval. A decision shall be
rendered by the Planning and Inspections Director within 30 days after
submission of the proposed minor subdivision plat. If no decision is rendered
by the Planning and Inspections Director within the required 30-day period, the
applicant may appeal to the Board of Commissioners for review of the
application under the major subdivision preliminary plat approval process (§
158.05). Either the Planning and Inspections Director or the applicant may at
any time refer the application to the major subdivision approval process.
      (6)   Subject to division (B)(4) above the Planning and Inspections
Director shall approve the proposed subdivision unless the subdivision is not a
minor subdivision as defined in
Chapter 163 or the application or the proposed subdivision fails to comply with
the requirements of this chapter or any other applicable requirement of the
UDO.
      (7)   If the Minor Plat is not in compliance with this chapter or other
requirements of the UDO, the subdivider shall be given an opportunity to submit
a revised plat. If a revised plat is not submitted within 60 days, the Planning
and Inspections Director will disapprove the plat.
      (8)   If the minor subdivision plat is approved, the approval shall be
shown by a signed Certificate of Minor Plat Approval (see
Appendix B) on five copies of the minor plat and on the original.
      (9)   If the subdivision is disapproved, the Planning and Inspections
Director shall promptly furnish the applicant with a written statement of the
reasons for disapproval. The applicant may appeal the decision by requesting
that the minor subdivision plat be scheduled for review by the Board of
Commissioners according to the same review and approval procedures set forth in
§
158.06 for final approval of major subdivision plats. Appeals shall be filed
within 60 days of the date of the decision that the Planning and Inspections
Director disapproves the plat.
      (10)   Approval of any plat is contingent upon the plat being recorded
with the County Register of Deeds within 90 days after the date the Certificate
of Approval is signed by the Planning and Inspections Director or designee.
Failure to record the approved plat within the specified 90-day period shall
render the plat null and void.
      (11)   The approval of the final minor plat pursuant to these regulations
shall not be deemed to constitute or affect the acceptance by the city, a
governmental unit or a public body of the dedication of any lands or facilities
shown on the plat. However, the Board of Commissioners may, by resolution,
accept any dedication made to the public of lands and facilities when they are
located within its subdivision regulation jurisdiction. Acceptance of
dedication of land or facilities located within the subdivision regulation
jurisdiction but outside the corporate limits of the city shall not place on
the city any duty to open, operate, repair or maintain any land or facilities;
and the city shall in no event be held to answer in any civil action or
proceeding for failure to open, repair or maintain any land or facilities
located outside the corporate limits.
      (12)   Notification of decision. Notice of the decisions shall be
provided in writing to the property owner and to the applicant, if not the
owner. The notice shall be provided by personal delivery, electronic mail, or
by first-class mail to the last address listed on the County tax record for the
property owner and to the address listed on the application if the applicant is
not the property owner.

§ 158.03.1 EXPEDITED REVIEW.
   (A)   As provided in G.S. § 160D-802, a parcel of land in single ownership
shall require only a plat for recordation if all of the following criteria are
met:
      (1)   The tract or parcel to be divided is not exempted under G.S. §
160D-802;
      (2)   No part of the tract or parcel to be divided has been divided in
the prior ten (10) years;
      (3)   The entire area of the tract or parcel to be divided is greater
than five (5) acres;
      (4)   After division, no more than three (3) lots result from the
division; and
      (5)   After division, all resultant lots comply with all of the
following:
         (a)   All lot dimension size requirements of this UDO;
         (b)   The use of the lots is in conformity with this UDO; and
         (c)   A permanent means of ingress and egress is recorded for each
lot.

original.
         (d)   The final plat shall not be approved until all required
improvements are installed, or suitable guarantees have been made to ensure
installation pursuant to §
158.10 and the certificates required by
Appendix B to appear on the final plat have been properly filled out and
signed.
         (e)   The subdivider shall file the approved final plat with the
Register of Deeds of Craven County within 90 days after the approval of the
Planning and Inspections Director or the approval shall be void.
         (f)   If the Planning and Inspections Director disapproves the final
plat, the reasons for the action shall be stated in writing. One copy of the
reasons with the original drawing and remaining prints of the proposed
subdivision shall be provided to the subdivider.
         (g)   If the final plat is not in compliance with this chapter or the
Planning and Inspections Director does not approve the changes from the
approved preliminary plat, the subdivider shall be given an opportunity to
submit a revised final plat. Failure to submit a revised final plat within 60
days shall render the plat null and void.
      (3)   Dedication and acceptance.
         (a)   The approval of a final plat pursuant to these regulations shall
not be deemed to constitute or affect the acceptance by the city, a
governmental unit or a public body of the dedication of any street or other
ground, a public utility line or other facility shown on the plat. However, the
Board of Commissioners may accept any dedication made to the public of lands or
facilities for streets, parks, public utility lines or other public purposes,
when the lands or facilities are located within its subdivision-regulation
jurisdiction.
         (b)   Acceptance of dedication of lands or facilities located within
the subdivision-regulation jurisdiction but outside the corporate limits of the
City shall not place on the city any duty to open, operate, repair or maintain
any street, utility line or other land or facility, and the city shall in no
event be held to answer in any civil action or proceeding for failure to open,
repair, or maintain any street located outside its corporate limits. Provided,
however, with respect to a major subdivision, the Board of Commissioners shall
accept dedication of any and all new streets, shoulders, ditches, curbs,
gutters and sidewalks within the subdivision that have been installed in
accordance with §
158.08 and that have been warranted by the subdivider as to materials,
workmanship and compliance with §
158.10 for at least 18 months following acceptance of the dedication.
         (c)   Acceptance by the Board of Commissioners shall place on the city
the duty to operate, repair and maintain the streets, shoulders, ditches,
curbs, gutters and sidewalks so accepted, except as to defects, repairs and
maintenance during the warranty period that are covered by the warranty
required hereunder, and except as to damages prohibited in §
91.01 of the code of ordinances.
      (4)   Permits and certificates of occupancy. Unless otherwise provided in
this chapter, upon recordation of the final plat, the applicant shall be
eligible to apply for building and any other permits required by the UDO. A
certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until all improvements are
complete and approved by the city and the applicable utility provider.

§ 158.07 PERMANENT REFERENCE POINTS.
   (A)   Generally. Prior to the approval of a Minor Final Plat or a Major
Final Plat, permanent reference points shall have been established in
accordance with the requirements set forth in this section.
   (B)    Subdivision corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision shall
be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernable reference
marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station
or N.C. Grid System coordinated monument, or city coordinated system, if the
monument or city coordinated system exists, then this corner shall be marked
with a monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall
appear on the map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an
accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie
shall be made to some pertinent and readily recognizable landmark or
identifiable point, physical object or structure. However, if in the opinion of
the Planning Board, a subdivision is of such small size, or if there is an
existing tie within a reasonable distance of the subdivision, this shall not be
required.
   (C)   Monuments. Within each block of a subdivision at least two monuments
designed and designated as control corners shall be installed. The surveyor
shall employ additional monuments if required. All monuments shall be
constructed of concrete and shall be at least four inches in diameter or square
and not less than three feet in length. Each monument shall have embedded in
its top or attached by a suitable means a metal plate of noncorrosive material
and marked plainly with the point, the surveyor’s registration number, the
month and year it was installed, and the word “monument” or “control corner”. A
monument shall be set 30 inches in the ground unless this requirement is
impractical because of unusual conditions.
   (D)   Property markers. A steel or wrought iron pipe or the equivalent of
not less than three-quarter inches in diameter and at least 30 inches in length
shall be set at all corners, except those located by monuments. A marker shall
also be set at a point of curve, and point of tangency unless a monument has
already been placed at the points. Additional markers shall be placed where
required by the city.
   (E)   Accuracy. The allowable angular error of closure and the linear error
of closure for surveys within the city and within one mile thereof shall be in
accordance with Chapter V of the Manual of Practice for Land Surveying
published by the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and
Land Surveyors.

§ 158.08 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
§ 158.081 Subdivision Design Standards Purpose.
   The subdivision design standards, adopted and prescribed in this section,
are found by the Board of Commissioners to be necessary and appropriate to:
   (A)   Provide for suitable residential and nonresidential developments with
adequate streets and utilities and appropriate building sites;
   (B)   Provide for the distribution of population and traffic in a manner
which shall avoid congestion and overcrowding;

easements for street and utility purposes;
   (E)   Provide for the dedication or reservation of adequate spaces for
public lands and buildings;
   (F)   Encourage design that is protective of environmental quality and that
provides a balance between the built environment and natural and fragile
natural resources; and
   (G)   Provide for the dedication or reservation of recreation, park and open
space areas.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 158.082 General Subdivision Design Standards.
   (A)   Design. All proposed subdivisions, including group developments where
the transfer of building sites to separate owners is proposed, shall comply
with this chapter, shall be designed to promote beneficial development of the
community, and shall bear a reasonable relationship to the approved plans of
the city.
   (B)   Development name. In no case shall the name of a proposed development
duplicate or be phonetically similar to an existing development name in the
Havelock Planning and Zoning Jurisdiction unless the proposed development lies
adjacent or in proximity to the existing development.
   (C)   Reasonable relationship.
      (1)   All required improvements, easements, and rights-of-way (other than
required reservations) shall substantially benefit the development or bear a
reasonable connection to the need for public facilities attributable to the new
development.
      (2)   Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes or adjoins any part of a
thoroughfare or collector street as designated by an officially adopted City
Thoroughfare Plan or Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) that part of the
proposed public right-of-way shall be dedicated as public right-of-way within
the subdivision plat in the location and to the width recommended by the
Thoroughfare Plan or CTP.
   (D)   Establishment of private deed restrictions. 
      (1)   The subdivider is encouraged to prepare and record private deed
restrictions (restrictive covenants) to establish development standards to
address particular development and land use issues and/or to establish more
desirable development standards that exceed the city requirements. For example,
subdividers may establish deed restrictions that address such issues as
architectural design, building materials, minimum building floor area, parking
of recreational vehicles, home-based businesses and the like.
      (2)   Deed restrictions are private agreements between the subdivider and
lot buyers. Enforcement of deed restrictions is a private matter and is solely
the responsibility of the lot owners and/or a property owners’ association.
Deed restrictions cannot be enforced by the city. The Zoning Administrator or
any other official of the city will not be involved in the enforcement of
private deed restrictions.
   (E)   Subdivision signs. Permanent signs announcing the name of a
subdivision shall comply with the standards for identification signs delineated
in
Chapter 157.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 158.083 Land Suitability.
   Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, erosion or which for
topographical or other reasons is unsuitable for residential use as determined
by the Planning Board shall not be platted for residential use or for any other
use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety or property
unless the hazards can be and are corrected.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 158.084 Lot Dimensions and Standards.
   The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development
contemplated and shall conform to the following.
   (A)   Conformance to other regulations. Every lot shall have sufficient
area, dimensions and street access to permit a principal building to be erected
thereon in compliance with all zoning district and other use, density,
intensity and dimensional requirements of the UDO, including other sections of
this chapter as well as other chapters of the UDO.
Table 155-9 delineates minimum density, intensity and dimensional requirements
for each zoning district.
   (B)   Minimum buildable area. Every lot shall have at least 40% of its total
area, or 2,800 square feet, whichever is less, of contiguous buildable area of
a shape sufficient to hold a principal building.
   (C)   Setbacks. The minimum building setback line or the distance between
the street right-of-way line and the building line shall be not less than that
prescribed in
Chapter 155 of the UDO for the appropriate zoning district or districts in
which the subdivision exists.
   (D)    Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks shall be laid out with special attention given to the type
of use contemplated.
      (2)   Block lengths shall not exceed 1,500 feet or be less than 400 feet.
      (3)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depth except where otherwise required to separate residential
development from through traffic.
      (4)   Pedestrian ways or crosswalks shall be provided near the center of
blocks, where deemed essential in the opinion of the Planning Board, to provide
adequate pedestrian circulation or access to schools, shopping centers,
churches or transportation facilities.
   (E)   Lot line configuration.
      (1)   Side lines of lots should be at or near right angles or radial to
street lines. Intersecting lot lines shall not have an angle of less than 60
degrees.
      (2)   Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra width of 15
feet to permit adequate building setback from side streets.
      (3)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except
where necessary to separate residential development from through traffic.
      (4)   Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial
use and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street
service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development
contemplated.
   (F)   Lot lines and drainage. Lot sizes, shapes and locations shall be made
with due regard to topographic conditions, contemplated use and the surrounding
area as follows.
      (1)   Lot boundaries shall coincide with natural and pre-existing human-
made drainageways to the extent practical to avoid lots that can be built upon
only by altering the drainageways.
      (2)   Land subject to flooding and land deemed by the Planning Board to
be uninhabitable for other reasons shall not be platted for residential
occupancy, nor for the other uses as may increase danger to health, life or
property, or aggravate the flood hazard, but the land may be set aside for the
uses as will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation, or will
not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
      (3)   Lots shall have a minimum of 1% grade to streets and/or
drainageways. The city recognizes that topographical conditions may exist where
the requirement may not be practical. The absolute minimum for such conditions
as approved by the City Engineer shall be 0.5%.
      (4)   All utilities, as well as utility and drainage easements shall be
provided as required in §
158.085.
   (G)   Access requirements.
      (1)   All residential lots shall have at least 12 feet of unobstructed
frontage where the lot abuts a public street right-of-way.
      (2)   All lots shall front or abut a public street and meet the frontage
requirements set forth in
Table 155-9. The following exceptions may be approved:
         (a)   Lots and units located in developments with owners’ associations
or in group developments in which permanent access is guaranteed by means of
approved private streets and/or drives designed in accordance with the
requirements of §
158.08.
         (b)   Lots of record provided that there is recorded access and the
use is limited to only one single-family dwelling and its uninhabited accessory
structures.
         (c)   Flag lots meeting the following requirements:
            1.   A flag lot shall serve only one single-family dwelling and its
uninhabited accessory structures;
            2.   The maximum flagpole length shall be 300 feet;
            3.   The minimum flagpole width shall be 25 feet;
            4.   The maximum lot size in areas with public sewer shall be one
acre. The maximum lot size without public sewer shall be three acres. (Note:
the “flagpole” portion of the lot is not used to calculate area, width, depth,
coverage and setbacks of the lot or to provide off-street parking);
            5.   The minimum separation between the “flagpole” portion of the
lot and that of another flag lot shall be 150 feet;
            6.   Where public water is available, any building on the flag lot
must be within 500 feet of a hydrant. This distance shall be measured along the
street, then along the flagpole, then in a straight line to the building
location;
            7.   Use of a single driveway to serve a flag lot and an adjoining
lot is permitted and encouraged. The preferred location for the driveway is on
the flagpole portion of the flag lot, with the conventional lot granted an
access easement over the flagpole;
            8.   Resubdivision of a flag lot shall not be permitted unless
access to the proposed new lot(s) can be provided from an approved public or
private street; and
            9.   Flag lots shall be approved only where the configuration of
the parcel or site features warrant such a lot design. Authorizing a flag lot
design is intended to accommodate a particular extenuating circumstance which
makes traditional lot design infeasible. Therefore, flag lots should be
judiciously approved.
   (H)   Water and sewer disposal.
      (1)   Where individual sewage disposal systems are planned for a
subdivision, the minimum lot sizes specified in this chapter shall be increased
as required by the results of percolation tests and subsoil investigation. As a
minimum, the following shall apply.
         (a)   In areas not served by a community or public sewer system, the
distance between dwellings should be increased; therefore, the minimum lot
shall contain 15,000 square feet of useable land, not less than 100 feet wide
at the building line, nor less than 150 feet deep.
         (b)   In areas lacking both community water and community sewer
systems, the minimum lot shall contain 20,000 square feet of useable land, not
less than 100 feet at the building line, nor less than 200 feet deep.
         (c)   Wells shall be located at least 100 feet from any septic tank or
filter field whether on the same lot or another adjoining lot.
   (I)   Design standards for nontraditional residential lot developments.
Specific design standards for nontraditional residential subdivision
developments are provided in
Chapters 154 and
155, as provided below. Other standards for nonresidential lot developments
that may require subdivision of land are also provided in
Chapter 154 and
Chapter 155 (§§
155.0705 through

(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 158.085 Utilities.
   (A)   Water and sewage disposal.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   Every subdivision lot intended for building purposes shall be
served by a water supply system and a sewage disposal system that is adequate
to accommodate the reasonable needs of the proposed use of the lot.
         (b)   For all subdivisions within the city’s Planning and Zoning
Jurisdiction, the subdivider shall first consider installation to the city’s
public water and sewer facilities pursuant to division (A)(2) below. Where
compliance with division (A)(2) below is determined by the Planning and
Inspections Director to be infeasible, the subdivider may consider divisions
(A)(3) or (4) below.
         (c)   Water supply and sewerage facilities shall be designed in
accordance with applicable city, county and state public health laws and
regulations.
         (d)   Subdivisions must also meet any additional connection
requirements found in other chapters of the city code of ordinances, including
§
150.09.
         (e)   Various combinations of the water supply and sewage disposal
systems specified in divisions (A)(2) through (4) below may be used for a
single subdivision, but each system must meet the appropriate authorizing
agencies’ requirements according to state law.
         (f)   Utility improvements shall not be constructed until the utility
construction plans have been reviewed and approved by the appropriate utility
provider. Work performed pursuant to approved utility construction plans shall
be inspected and approved by the appropriate utility provider.
      (2)   Public Water and Sewer Connection Policy. The subdivider shall
install water and sewer utilities and connect to the city’s public water or
sewer facilities in accordance with the following specifications:
         (a)   For lands located within the city’s corporate limits.
            1.   Where city sanitary sewer lines and water mains are within 300
feet, the subdivider’s sanitary sewer lines and water mains shall connect with
the city system.
            2.   Where city sanitary sewer lines and water mains are not within
300 feet, and whether plans have or have not yet been formulated for the
installation and the proposed sanitary sewer lines and water mains are
accessible, the subdivider’s sanitary sewer lines and water mains may connect
with the city system at the city’s discretion.
            3.   Where city sanitary sewer lines and water mains are not
reasonably accessible but where plans for the installation of sewer lines and
water mains in the vicinity of the subdivision have been prepared, the proposed
sanitary sewer lines and water mains shall be installed to conform with and to
tie into the planned system, although connection to an existing sewer line or
water main may not be immediately practical, and during the interim, the use of
septic tanks and absorption tile or other methods of sewage disposal meeting
specifications of the city, the County Health Department and other authorizing
agencies will be permitted. Similarly, the use of a private water system
approved by the city, the County Health Department, and other authorizing
agencies will be permitted.
            4.   The total cost of the sanitary sewer and water distribution
improvements and accessories thereto such as manholes, laterals, valves, fire
hydrants and other items designed to connect with and become a part of the city
sanitary sewer or water distribution system is to be borne by the subdivider.
         (b)   For lands located within the city’s ETJ.
            1.   The city shall not provide services outside of the city limits
unless city specifications are adhered to.
            2.   If city water and sewer services are desired by the
subdivider, plans and specifications shall be furnished to the City Manager for
the installation of necessary sanitary sewer lines and water mains and items
accessory to each that lie wholly within the public right-of-way in the
subdivision. After approval of these plans and specifications by the City
Manager and other authorizing agencies, installation can begin under city
inspection. City mains shall be installed to conform with and to tie into the
city system prior to the paving of any streets involved.
            3.   The total cost of the sanitary sewer and water distributor
improvements and accessories thereto such as manholes, laterals, valves, fire
hydrants and other items designed to connect with and become a part of the city
sanitary sewer or water distribution system is to be borne by the subdivider.
            4.   In the event that the subdivider should desire to have the
city contract for and install the improvements mentioned in this section, the
subdivider shall bear the cost of the improvements of the completed project.
Upon agreement by the City Board to contract the project, the subdivider shall
deposit with the city the amount which the City Manager estimates will be the
cost of the project plus 10%. The subdivider will enter into a contract with
the city which will stipulate if the completion costs exceed the original
deposit the subdivider will bear the additional cost. The contract will also
state if the completed cost of the project is less than the original deposit a
refund will be made immediately on the excessive amount by the city.
      (3)   Community water and sewer facilities.
         (a)   Where city water and sewer facilities are not available and
connection to an existing community sewerage or water system is planned, the
subdivider shall install water and sewer utilities and connect to the community
system only upon connection approval by an authorized officer of the system.
Community systems are defined as a water or sewer system operated by a person,
firm or corporation other than the city or other governmental agency.
         (b)   New community water supply and sewage disposal systems serving
ten or more connections are classified by state law as “public”, and plans and
specifications for the facilities must be approved by the Sanitary Engineering
Section, Division of Health Services (formerly the State Board of Health),
State Department of Human Resources and the State Department of Environment and
Natural and Resources.
         (c)   New community water supply and sewage disposal systems serving
two to nine connections are regulated by state law, and plans and
specifications for the facilities shall have approval by the County Health
Department or the State Department of Environment and Natural Resources,
whichever is applicable.
      (4)   Individual water and sewer facilities.
         (a)   Where city water and sewer facilities are not available and
individual, on-site water supplies or individual sewage disposal systems are
planned, the subdivision owner at his or her own expense shall have the site
investigated by the County Health Department and any other authorizing agency
to determine whether or not the individual facilities are feasible.
         (b)   The subdivision owner shall present proof to the Planning Board
(for Major Plats) or Planning and Inspections Director (for Minor Plats) that
appropriate soil tests have been conducted, and each lot in the subdivision not
served by public water or sewage disposal systems has been approved by the
County Health Department for individual water supplies or sewage disposal
systems.
         (c)   The site investigation for sewage disposal shall include
sufficient number of percolation tests, and test holes of sufficient depth to
determine the absorption capacity of the soil and the location of the ground-
water table, and of rock formations or other impervious strata. The number of
percolation tests required, the depth of test holes and the testing method
shall be determined and directly supervised by the County Sanitarian.
         (d)   Individual, on-site water supply and sewage disposal systems
must be installed and maintained in accordance with state law. Approval of
these individual systems shall be based on site investigation by the County
Health Department. On-site investigations include tests of the absorption
capacity of the soil and sub-soil which will indicate whether a lot is suitable
for individual water supply or individual sewage disposal systems.
      (5)   Temporary sewer systems. Temporary sewage conveyance and disposal
systems installed due to city sewer being neither accessible nor planned shall
be financed by the subdivider without reimbursement by the city.
   (B)   Electrical, cable and telephone utilities. All electrical, cable,
telephone and other communications wiring shall be installed underground unless
the utility company serving the subdivision has a policy which mandates above
ground utility poles. In those cases, the above ground utility poles shall be
at the rear of the lots. Transformers and other apparatus may be installed on
the ground surface if it is found by the Planning and Inspections Director to
be technically unfeasible to install the equipment below the surface.
      (1)   Burial of power lines shall not be required if:
         (a)   The lines existed above ground at the time of first approval of
a plat or other development plan, whether or not the power lines are
subsequently relocated during construction of the subdivision or other
development plan; and
         (b)   The lines are located outside the boundaries of the parcel of
land that contains the subdivision or the property covered by the development
plan.
   (C)   Stormwater management, storm drainage and sedimentation control.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   The subdivider shall provide stormwater management and storm
drainage systems for the proper drainage of all surface waters. No surface
water shall be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer.
         (b)   Where an existing storm drainage system cannot feasibly be
extended to the subdivision, a surface drainage system shall be designed to
protect the proposed development from water damage. Where surface drainage
courses are provided, they shall be of shallow swale ditch type having side
slopes of approximately three feet of horizontal distance for each one foot of
vertical distance, and courses shall be sufficient size to accommodate the
drainage area. The minimum grade along the bottom of a surface drainage course
shall be a vertical fall of approximately one foot in each 300 feet of
horizontal distance.
         (c)   The subdivider shall install on-site stormwater systems in
accordance with and shall meet the minimum standards, provisions, and
requirements of Chapter 53, Stormwater Management.
         (d)   All stormwater BMPs shall meet the following specifications, in
addition to the specifications required under Chapter 53:
            1.   On-site stormwater systems shall fit the general scheme of the
development, shall be considered an amenity of the development, and shall not
be of a design or nature as to constitute a nuisance;
            2.   The ten-foot perimeter of any on-site stormwater system
(measured from the high water line, if applicable) shall be landscaped to
prevent erosion and to integrate the on-site stormwater system into the general
surroundings and development scheme;
            3.   Wet detention ponds shall be of irregular shape and shall have
sides which gradually slope to the center of the pond; and
            4.   The depth at the deepest point of any wet detention pond shall
be between three and six feet.
         (e)   The subdivider shall control sedimentation and prevent soil
erosion pursuant to the standards and requirements of §
156.03, Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control. In addition, the following
standards shall be met for the protection of all surface waters:
            1.   Any unstabilized soil exposed during construction shall be
stabilized with vegetative cover to prevent erosion by wind or surface water.
            2.   There shall be no evidence of increased siltation away from
the construction area that results from soil being exposed during clearing
operations for construction or during construction.
            3.   Surface drainage shall be directed whenever possible along
natural drainage courses or nonstructural land drainage systems so that
vegetation can cleanse runoff waters.
      (2)   Requirements for subdivisions within the city limits.
         (a)   The subdivider shall install utilities in keeping with
specifications pursuant to division (C)(1) above.
         (b)   Plans and specifications shall be provided by the subdivider and
forwarded to the Planning and Inspections Director showing necessary storm
drains, sedimentation control methods and items accessory to each that lie
wholly within the public right-of-way in the subdivision. After approval of
these plans and specifications by the City Manager, the County Health
Department, and other authorizing agencies, installation by the subdivider can
begin under city inspection.
         (c)   The total cost of the storm drainage and other improvements and
accessories thereto such as manholes, drop inlets, catch basins and other items
designed to connect with and become a part of the city storm drain system is to
be borne by the subdivider.
      (3)   Requirements for subdivisions within the ETJ.
         (a)   The subdivider shall install utilities in keeping with
specifications pursuant to division (C)(1) above.
         (b)   If city water and sewer services are desired by the subdivider,
plans and specifications shall be furnished to the City Manager for the
installation of necessary storm drains and items accessory to each that lie
wholly within the public right-of-way in the subdivision. After approval of
these plans and specifications by the City Manager and other authorizing
agencies, installation can begin under city inspection. City mains shall be
installed to conform with and to tie into the city system prior to the paving
of any streets involved.
         (c)   The total cost of the storm drainage improvements and
accessories thereto such as manholes, drop inlets, catch basins and other items
designed to connect with and become a part of the city storm drain system is to
be borne by the subdivider.
         (d)   Improvement completion agreement. In the event that the
subdivider should desire to have the city contract for and install the
improvements mentioned in this section, the subdivider shall bear the cost of
the improvements of the completed project. Upon agreement by the City Board of
Commissioners to contract the project, the subdivider shall deposit with the
city the amount which the City Manager estimates will be the cost of the
project plus 10%. The subdivider will enter into a contract with the city which
will stipulate if the completion costs exceed the original deposit the
subdivider will bear the additional cost. The contract will also state if the
completed cost of the project is less than the original deposit a refund will
be made immediately on the excessive amount by the city.
   (D)   Easements.
      (1)   The subdivider shall convey easements to the city or appropriate
utility company for both underground and overhead utility installation where
needed. Easements shall be at least 20 feet wide and normally centered along
rear or side lot lines. Wider easements may be required if the topography along
the proposed right-of-way is such that maintenance equipment cannot reasonably
operate within the minimum 20-foot wide easement. Where easements are required
along the outside perimeter of a subdivision, 15 feet will be required.
      (2)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially with the one hundred-year floodplain and
the further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose
of managing stormwater runoff in a manner that will safeguard the health and
property of the citizens of the city. Parallel streets or parkways may be
required in connection therewith if deemed in the public interest by the
Planning and Inspections Director.
      (3)   Lakes, ponds, creeks and similar areas will be accepted for
maintenance only if sufficient adjacent land is dedicated as a public
recreation area or park or if the area constitutes a necessary part of the
drainage control system. The areas must be approved by the Planning and
Inspections Director on recommendation of the Planning Board and Recreation
Director.
      (4)   If the city elects to maintain any on-site stormwater system, the
subdivider shall convey to the city an easement covering the stormwater system
together with an easement and right-of-way for access to the on-site stormwater
system. The easement and right-of-way shall provide access to the on-site
stormwater system from a public street and shall be at least 20 feet wide for
access from the public road and at least 15 feet around the perimeter of the
on-site stormwater system (measured from the high water line, if applicable).
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 158.086 Streets and Sidewalks.
   (A)   Compliance with official plans. When a tract to be subdivided embraces
any part of a major thoroughfare, parkway or boulevard designated on official
maps and plans, the part of the proposed public right-of-way shall be platted
and dedicated by the subdivider in the location and at the width specified.
   (B)   Sidewalks. Street yard, buffer yard and sidewalks shall be installed
according to
Chapter 157, except any new subdivision street located within two blocks of a
school (district access) shall be required to have sidewalks on both sides of
the street, regardless of lot size and zoning classification.
   (C)   Streets. The following shall be considered the minimum standard of
design for new streets within proposed subdivisions within the city’s
jurisdiction, but in no case shall these standards be less than the accepted
policies of the State Department of Transportation, Division of Highways, as
taken or modified from the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) manuals.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   All new proposed street systems within a subdivision shall be
coordinated with the existing street or road system surrounding the
subdivision.
         (b)   Minor thoroughfares, local streets and cul-de-sacs shall be so
laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
         (c)   Where in the opinion of the Planning Board, it is necessary to
provide for street access to an adjoining property, proposed streets shall be
extended by platting to the boundary of the property and a temporary turnaround
shall be provided.
         (d)   Private streets not open to public use shall be prohibited
within any platted subdivision.
         (e)   When a subdivision abuts a major thoroughfare or principal
arterial street, the subdivider may be required to construct a frontage road,
or in most instances reverse frontage on a minor street for the lots to be
developed adjacent to the thoroughfare. Where reverse frontage is established,
private driveways shall be prevented from having direct access to the
thoroughfare.
         (f)   Street names which duplicate or are phonetically similar to
existing street names shall be prohibited. A proposed street which is in
alignment with an existing street shall bear the name of the existing street.
         (g)   When a tract of land is subdivided into lots which are larger
than the norm, the lots will be designed and arranged so that they allow for
future opening of streets and further logical subdivision.
         (h)   Subdividers shall implement a subdivision street system that
connects in at least two
separate areas with an existing street or road system surrounding the
subdivision and will allow emergency vehicles easily to access the subdivision
other than by the primary entrance to the subdivision.
      (2)   Street classification. In all new subdivisions, streets that are
dedicated to public use shall be classified as provided herein.
         (a)   The classification shall be based upon the projected volume of
traffic to be carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per
day.
         (b)   The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be
used as a useful indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive.
         (c)   Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that
formerly terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a
subdivision street be continued beyond the subdivision at some future time, the
classification of the street will be based upon the street in its entirety,
both within and outside of the subdivision.
         (d)   The classification of streets shall be as listed in
Table 158-1:
 
Table 158-1
Arterial  A major street in the city’s street system that serves as an avenue for the
street    circulation of traffic into, out, or around the city and carries high volumes
          of traffic.
          A street whose principal function is to carry traffic between minor, local
Collector and arterial streets but that may also provide direct access to abutting

§ 158.087 Standards for Small Lot Subdivisions.
   (A)   For major residential subdivisions consisting of lots with an average
minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet or less, the Planning Board may
recommend and the Board of Commissioners may require any or all the following:
      (1)   Sufficient land area be designated and reserved on each individual
lot to accommodate anticipated off-street parking;
      (2)   The recordation of deed restrictions and subdivision plat notations
restricting vehicular parking on individual lots to paved surfaces and within
reserved off-street parking areas;
      (3)   Wider minimum street pavement widths to accommodate on-street
parking;
      (4)   The provision of off-street overflow and/or visitor parking;
      (5)   For subdivisions and nontraditional residential lot developments
and the like, sidewalks shall be considered for both sides of all streets.
Sidewalks and/or pedestrian walkways shall also be installed to provide access
to internal or adjoining recreational areas and facilities, community
buildings, schools, commercial areas and other pedestrian-oriented areas;
      (6)   Greater building setbacks along the perimeter of the subdivision
where it adjoins lower density residential areas;
      (7)   Wider buffer areas along the perimeter of the subdivision to
provide a greater separation from adjoining lower density residential areas
and/or increased planting standards to provide a more opaque screen;
      (8)   Multiple entrances to the subdivision from major streets of access;
      (9)   A higher level of vehicular connectivity with adjoining tracts;
      (10)   Shorter cul-de-sac street lengths; and
      (11)   Alternative means of vehicular access to individual lots fronting
on major thoroughfares.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the average lot size of all residential
building lots proposed in the subdivision shall be calculated to define “small
lot subdivision”.
   (C)   The Board of Commissioners, in determining the minimum design
standards applicable to small lot subdivisions, shall take into consideration
the following factors:
      (1)   The overall density of the proposed subdivision relative to other
developments in the vicinity of the small lot subdivision;
      (2)   The total number of lots proposed;
      (3)   The zoning patterns, projected future land use and development
potential of the surrounding area for similar small lot subdivision
development;
      (4)   The anticipated vehicular traffic generation and parking needs of
the intended occupants or targeted market of the proposed development;
      (5)   The existing and proposed street system and traffic flows and
patterns; and
      (6)   The mitigating impact of the voluntary provision of recreational
and open space in an amount which exceeds the minimum amount required in
Chapter 157.
   (D)   After determining the need for the imposition of the design standards
delineated in division (A) above, the Board of Commissioners shall utilize the
following guidelines to implement the additional requirements for small lot
subdivisions:
      (1)   Sufficient land area designated and reserved on each individual lot
to accommodate anticipated off-street parking shall be calculated at
approximately 200 square feet per required parking space. All parking shall be
located completely on an improved driveway or improved parking pad. No more
than 30% of the front yard or a side yard abutting a street on a corner lot may
be improved for off-street parking and drives.
      (2)   Minimum street pavement widths should be increased by approximately
nine feet to accommodate on-street parking. The Planning Board and Board of
Commissioners shall request the recommendation of the City Engineer and the
NCDOT, if applicable, for specific pavement widths necessary to provide
adequate on-street parking on public streets.
      (3)   Off-street overflow and/or visitor parking shall generally be
provided at the standard of one parking space per three lots unless the Board
of Commissioners determines that the subdivision layout and density warrant a
higher standard. Overflow/visitor parking shall be grouped and spaced
throughout the subdivision so as to be readily accessible to lot owners.
Overflow/visitor parking shall be owned and maintained by a property owners’
association.
      (4)   For subdivisions and nontraditional residential lot developments
and the like, sidewalks shall be considered for both sides of all streets.
Sidewalks and/or pedestrian walkways shall also be installed to provide access
to internal or adjoining recreational areas and facilities, community
buildings, schools, commercial areas and other pedestrian-oriented areas.
      (5)   Building setbacks along the perimeter of the subdivision where it
adjoins lower density residential areas shall be the same or exceed the
building setback standard applicable to the adjoining lower density residential
zoning district.
      (6)   To provide a greater separation from adjoining lower density
residential areas, a 20-foot wide Type B landscaped buffer shall be installed
along the external boundary line of the small lot development that adjoins a
lower density residentially-used or zoned property. The buffer shall comply
with the planting requirements of
Chapter 157.
      (7)   Developments of 50 or more residential units or additions to
existing developments that increase the total number of residential units to 50
or more shall be required to provide vehicular access to at least two public
streets unless the City Engineer determines that topography, natural features,
or the pattern of existing adjacent development makes the provision
impractical.
      (8)   Vehicular connectivity with adjoining tracts shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of §
158.086.
      (9)   Cul-de-sac street lengths generally should not exceed 400 feet or
be designed to provide access to no more than 20 dwellings or a maximum
projected average daily traffic (ADT) of 200, whichever is greater.
      (10)   Individual lots fronting on a major or minor thoroughfare or a
collector street shall not have direct vehicular access to the roadway.

   (A)   When a preliminary major subdivision plat is submitted for approval,
in which, according to the city’s CAMA Comprehensive Land Use Plan, a school
site should be reserved, the Planning Board shall notify the Board of Education
that the subdivision has been submitted for approval and that under this
section a school site may be reserved therein. In reviewing the subdivision and
giving approval thereto, the Planning Board shall consult the Board of
Education in determining the exact size and location of any school site to be
reserved therein.
   (B)   Before the final plat of the subdivision is finally approved, the
Board of Education shall determine whether or not it wishes to have a school
site reserved in the subdivision. If the Board of Education does not wish to
have a school site reserved in the subdivision, it shall so notify the Planning
Board and in that event no school site shall be reserved therein. If the Board
of Education does wish to have a school site reserved in the subdivision, the
subdivision as finally approved shall reserve a school site of a size and
location agreeable to the Board of Education and to the Planning Board.
   (C)   If the Board of Education has not purchased or begun proceedings to
acquire the site within a maximum of 18 months after the subdivision is finally
approved, the subdivider may treat the lands as freed of the reservation. If
the Board of Education does not wish to have a school site reserved, the
subdivider shall be immediately notified that he or she may proceed with the
disposition of the land in question in accordance with the subdivision
procedures and provisions of this chapter.

Commissioners may approve the plat subject to the subdivider guaranteeing the
installation of the improvements. Upon approval of the Planning and Inspections
Director, performance guarantees shall initially run for a period of one (1)
year, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the required
improvements necessitates a longer duration. In the case of a bonded
obligation, the completion date shall be set one (1) year from the date the
bond is issued unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the
required improvements necessitates a longer duration.
      (1)   The amount of the performance guarantee shall not exceed 125% of
the reasonably estimated cost of completion at the time the performance
guarantee is issued. The City Manager may determine the amount of the
performance guarantee or use a cost estimate determined by the developer. The
reasonably estimated cost of completion shall include 100% of the costs for
labor and materials necessary for completion of the required improvements.
Where applicable, the costs shall be based on unit pricing. The additional 25%
includes inflation and all costs of administration regardless of how such fees
or charges a denominated. The amount of any extension shall not exceed 125% of
the reasonably estimated cost of completion of the remaining incomplete
improvements still outstanding at the time the extension is obtained.

toward completion of the required improvements that are secured by the
performance guarantee or any extension. If the improvements are not completed
to the specifications of the City, and the current performance guarantee is
likely to expire prior to completion of the required improvements, the
performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance guarantee issued,
for an additional period. The extension shall only be for a duration necessary
to complete the required improvements. If a new performance guarantee is
issued, the amount shall be determined by the procedure below and shall include
the total cost of all incomplete improvements.
      (3)   The developer shall have the option to post one type of a
performance guarantee in lieu of multiple one for all development matters
related to the same project.

the following methods or any other method at the election of the developer.
      (1)   A letter of credit or line of credit from a lending institution
that specifies a limit of credit which may be extended to a developer upon
request. This amount may not be used for purposes other than the improvements
specified for the subdivision being approved. The lending institution shall
agree to provide assurance to the City Planning and Inspections Director that a
notice of advances on the specified line of credit will be forwarded by the
lending institution to the City Manager.
      (2)   Performance or surety bond executed by a company duly licensed to
do business in the state or certified check drawn in favor of the city, or cash
deposited with the city.
      (3)   Other form of guarantee that provides equivalent security to a

§ 158.11 MODIFICATIONS AND VARIANCES.
   (A)   This section governs modifications of and variances from the
improvements set forth in this chapter; provided, however, that modifications
or variances from requirements may be permitted only upon a determination by
professional engineers registered in the state, applying generally accepted
engineering principles, that due to topographic or other conditions undue
practical difficulties or undue hardships would result if adherence to these
provisions are required.
   (B)   All subdivisions with modifications or variances shall be considered
major subdivisions and be processed as such according to this chapter.
   (C)   The initial determination shall be made by a professional engineer for
the city and a professional engineer for the subdivider. In the event these two
engineers are unable to agree as to any matter concerning the proposed
variation or modification, the disagreement shall be referred to a third
engineer selected by the engineer for the city and the engineer for the
subdivider. The engineer so selected shall settle the disagreement between the
engineer for the city and the engineer for the subdivider. The engineers shall
submit their findings to the Planning and Inspections Director who promptly
shall submit the findings to the Planning Board for consideration. All expenses
incurred by the city in obtaining the opinion of the engineers shall be paid by
the subdivider.
   (D)   In the case of a plan or program for a nontraditional residential lot
development which, in the judgment of the Planning Board, provides adequate
light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated,
and which also provides the covenants or other legal provisions as will assure
conformity to and achievement of the land development plan of the city and the
UDO, the Planning Board may recommend and the Board of Commissioners may
authorize that certain standards and requirements of these regulations be
modified.
   (E)   Any modification thus authorized is required to be entered in writing
in the minutes of the Planning Board and the reasoning on which the
modification was based set forth. It is intended here that these regulations be
used in association with the nontraditional residential lot development
provisions of the UDO. Any modifications in the standard design criteria of
these regulations needed, in the opinion of the Planning Board, to fulfill the
intent and purpose of the nontraditional residential lot development provisions
of the zoning ordinance are permitted.
   (F)   Where, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the
site, strict adherence to the provisions of the regulations of this chapter
would cause an unnecessary hardship, the Board of Adjustment may authorize a
variance pursuant to §
159.02, if the variance can be made without destroying the intent of these
regulations and if the other requirements of
Chapter 159 are met.

§ 159.01 APPEALS.
   (A)   Generally. An appeal from any final order, requirement, interpretation
or decision of the Zoning Administrator or other administrative official
charged with enforcement of the UDO, except as provided in §§
159.01.1 and
159.01.2, may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any person aggrieved. The
appeal system established in this chapter provides for a review of cases in
which a decision or interpretation made by the Zoning Administrator or other
administrative official charged with enforcement of the UDO is alleged to be
erroneous. For example, an appeal may contest the Zoning Administrator’s
decision regarding whether a particular use is permitted within a particular
zoning district or the Zoning Administrator’s interpretation of the methodology
for computation of sign area.
   (B)   Applicability. The appeal system established herein applies only to
decisions or interpretations made by the Zoning Administrator or other
administrative official charged with enforcement of the UDO. This appeal system
does not apply to decisions or interpretations made by the Planning Board or
the City Board of Commissioners. Additionally, the Board of Adjustment is not
authorized to issue advisory decisions regarding appeals, except as provided in
§§
159.01.1 and
159.01.2. Only the formal decisions or interpretations of the Zoning
Administrator or other administrative official charged with enforcement of the
UDO may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
   (C)   Filing. An appeal is taken by filing with the Zoning Administrator and
the Board of Adjustment a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds
therefore. A notice of appeal shall be considered filed with the Zoning
Administrator and the Board of Adjustment when delivered to the Planning and
Inspections Department, the required filing fee paid, and the date and time of
filing entered on the notice by the Planning and Inspections staff. The owner
or other party must file the appeal within 30 days from receipt of the written
notice of the determination. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice
given by first-class mail is deemed received on the third business day
following deposit of the notice for mailing.
   (D)   Transmittal of record. Whenever an appeal is filed, the Zoning
Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the
papers, applications and recordings constituting the record relating to the
action appealed from. A copy of the record shall also be provided to the
appellant and to the owner of the property if the appellant is not the owner.
   (E)   Stay of action. An appeal stays all actions by the Zoning
Administrator seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision
appealed from, including fines, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to
the Board of Adjustment that (because of facts stated in the certificate) a
stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property
and/or seriously interfere with the enforcement of the UDO for the reason that
the violation charged is transitory in nature. In this case, proceedings shall
not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted by a court. If
enforcement is not stayed, the appellant may file with the Zoning Administrator
a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board shall meet to
hear the appeal within 15 days after the request is filed.
   (F)   Decision. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or
partly) or may modify the order, requirement or decision or determination
appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision or determination
that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the
Board of Adjustment shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the
appeal is taken. Board of Adjustment action on appeal requests shall comply
with the voting requirements of §
159.08.
   (G)   Hearing. Evidentiary hearing procedures and notice requirements for
appeal requests are delineated in §§
159.07 et seq.
      (1)   The official who made the decision (or his or her successor if the
official is no longer employed by the City) shall be present at the hearing as
a witness. At the hearing, the appellant shall not be limited to matters stated
in the appeal notice. If any party or the City would be unduly prejudiced by
the presentation of matters not presented in the appeal notice, the Board shall
continue the hearing.

§ 159.01.1 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL APPEALS.
   (A)   Generally. The disapproval or modification of any proposed erosion
control plan by the Director of Planning and Inspections or designee as defined
by
Chapter 156, shall entitle the person submitting the plan to an evidentiary
hearing if the person submits written demand for an appeal and hearing within
15 days after receipt of written notice of disapproval or modification.
   (B)   Specifically. Appeals to the disapproval or modification of a proposed
erosion control plan shall follow the requirements and procedures of §§
159.01,
159.04 through
159.13, except as follows.
      (1)   Hearings shall be conducted by the Board of Adjustment within 30
days after the date of the receipt of the written demand for an evidentiary
hearing. The date of the hearing shall be advertised once in a newspaper of
general circulation prior to the date of the hearing.
      (2)   The person submitting the erosion control plan shall have 30 days
following the Board of Adjustment’s disapproval or modification of a proposed
erosion control plan to appeal the Board's decision to NC DEQ and the
Sedimentation Control Commission pursuant to G.S. § 113A-61(c).

§ 159.01.2 APPEALS FROM “THE NEUSE RIVER BASIN STORMWATER ORDINANCE FOR NEW
DEVELOPMENT.”
   (A)   Right of appeal. Except as provided in N.C.G.S. § 160D-1403.1, any
aggrieved person affected by any decision, order, requirement, or determination
relating to the interpretation or application of this chapter may file an
appeal to the Board of Adjustment within 30 days from receipt of the notice of
a determination.
      (1)   Appeals of variance requests shall be made as provided in the
section on variances. In the case of requests for review of proposed civil
penalties for violations of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment shall make a
final decision on the request for review within 90 days of receipt of the date
the request for review is filed.
      (2)   Procedures for appeals are set forth in §
159.01.
   (B)   Filing of appeal and procedures.
      (1)   Appeals shall be taken within the specified time period by filing a
notice of appeal and specifying the grounds for appeal on forms provided by the
City. All documents constituting the record on which the decision was appealed
shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment and a copy of the record shall be
provided to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject
of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
      (2)   The hearing conducted by the Board shall be conducted in the nature
of a quasi-judicial proceeding as provided in N.C.G.S. § 160D-406 and §
159.06 with all findings of fact supported by competent, material evidence.
(Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 159.02 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   An application for a variance along with the required filing fee
shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by filing a copy of the
application with the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   A variance may be granted by the Board of Adjustment if it
concludes that strict enforcement of the UDO would result in unnecessary
hardships for the applicant. The Board shall vary any provision of the zoning
regulation upon a showing of all of the following:
         (a)   If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of the
UDO, he or she will experience unnecessary hardship;
         (b)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability;
         (c)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant
or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-
created hardship; and
         (d)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose,
and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and
substantial justice is achieved.
      (3)   In granting variances, the Board of Adjustment may impose such
reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the
variance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding
properties. Appropriate conditions, which must be reasonably related to the
condition or circumstance that gives rise to the need for a variance, may be
imposed on any approval issued by the Board of Adjustment.
      (4)   A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a
specified duration only. Unless otherwise specified, any order or decision of
the Board of Adjustment granting a variance shall expire if the applicant does
not obtain a building permit or certificate of occupancy for such use within 60
calendar days from the date of the decision or if construction of the use has
not commenced within 180 calendar days from the date of the issuance of a
building permit.
      (5)   The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall
be entered on the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply
note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the
variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the
same manner as any other applicable requirement of the UDO.
      (6)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
      (7)   Evidentiary hearing procedures for variance requests are delineated
in §
159.06. Hearing notice requirements are outlined in §
159.07.
   (B)   Variances from Flood Hazard Overlay District requirements. The Board
of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the “appeal board”, is authorized to
review and decide upon request for variances from the Flood Hazard Overlay
District Requirements delineated in §
156.02 pursuant to the provisions delineated in this section.
      (1)   Variances may be issued by the Board of Adjustment for:
         (a)   The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
         (b)   Functionally dependent facilities if determined to meet the
definition as stated in
Chapter 163, provided the provisions of
Chapter 156 have been satisfied, and such facilities are protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety; or
         (c)   Any other type of development provided it meets the requirements
stated in this section.
      (2)   In passing upon variances, the Board of Adjustment shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in
other sections of the UDO, and:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as
defined under Chapter 163 as a functionally dependent facility, where
applicable;
         (f)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
      (4)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
the UDO, the Board of Adjustment may attach conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of the UDO.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25
per $100 of insurance coverage. The notification shall be maintained with a
record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
      (6)   The Zoning Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the state upon request.
      (7)   Conditions for variances:
         (a)   Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state or local laws, regulations or
ordinances;
         (b)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or
non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge;
         (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief;
         (d)   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval; and
         (e)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (8)   A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities,
hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage
facilities that are located in special flood hazard areas provided that all of
the following conditions are met. A floodplain development permit may be issued
for the development only if a variance is granted.
         (a)   The use serves a critical need in the community.
         (b)   No feasible location exists for the use outside the special
flood hazard area.
         (c)   The reference level of any structure is elevated or floodproofed
to at least the regulatory flood protection level.
         (d)   The use complies with all other applicable federal, state and
local laws.
         (e)   The city has notified the Secretary of the North Carolina
Department of Public Safety of its intention to grant a variance at least 30
days prior to granting the variance.
   (C)   Variances from "The Neuse River Basin Stormwater Ordinance for New
Development."
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the "Board", is
authorized to review and decide upon requests for major and minor variances for
the stormwater ordinance in
Chapter 53 pursuant to the provisions set forth in this section.
      (2)   Any person may petition the City for a variance granting permission
to use the person's land in a manner otherwise prohibited by the stormwater
ordinance in
Chapter 53.
      (3)   For all proposed variances from the stormwater ordinance, the Board
of Adjustment shall make findings of fact in accordance with the procedures set
forth in
Chapter 159 and §
153.03 showing that:
         (a)   There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that
prevent compliance with the strict letter of the ordinance;
         (b)   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of the stormwater ordinance and preserves its spirit; and
         (c)   In granting the variance, the project will ensure equal or
better protection of waters of the State than the requirements of 15A NCAC
02B.0711 (Neuse Storm Water Rule) and that the public safety and welfare have
been assured and substantial justice has been done.
      (4)   In the case of a request for a minor variance, as defined in
Chapter 53, the Board may vary or modify any of the regulations or provisions
of the chapter so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public
safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done may impose reasonable
and appropriate conditions and safeguards upon any variance it grants.
      (5)   The Board may attach conditions to the variance approval that
support the purpose of the stormwater ordinance.
      (6)   If the variance request qualifies as a major variance, as defined
in
Chapter 53, and the Board decides in favor of granting the major variance, the
Board shall then prepare a preliminary record of the hearing and submit it to
the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission for review and approval.
If the Commission approves the major variance or approves with conditions or
stipulations added, then the Commission shall prepare a Commission decision
which authorizes Board to issue a final decision which would include any
conditions or stipulations added by the Commission. If the Commission denies
the major variance, then the Commission shall prepare a decision to be sent to
the Board and the Board shall prepare a final decision denying the major
variance.
      (7)   Appeals from the Board's decision on a major or minor variance
request are made on certiorari to the local Craven County Superior Court.
Appeals from the Commission decision on a major variance request are made on
judicial review to Superior Court.
   (D)   Administrative action on insignificant or “de minimis” variances. The
Planning and Inspections Director, after consultation with the City Attorney,
shall be authorized to grant a “no action” letter to applicants for a variance
when the violation of set back or similar failure to meet ordinance standards
is less than 5% of requirements. The letter shall state that the city will not
take enforcement action based on the submitted violation. The applicant must
provide the Planning and Inspections Director with a plat or drawing clearly
illustrating the ordinance discrepancy and must also document that the
correction of the error would be cost prohibitive. No prospective actions may
be considered.

      (3)   The administrative materials may be provided in written or
electronic form.
      (4)   The Chair shall rule on objections to inclusion or exclusion of

§ 159.08 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT ACTION ON APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (A)   With respect to appeals, a motion to reverse, affirm or modify the
order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from shall include,
insofar as practicable, a statement of the specific reasons or findings of
facts that support the motion. If a motion to reverse or modify is not made or
fails to receive the four-fifths vote necessary for adoption, then the motion
is not approved.
   (B)   Before granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment must take a vote
and vote affirmatively (by a four-fifths majority) on the required findings
stated in §
159.02. Insofar as practical, a motion to make an affirmative finding on each
of the requirements set forth in §
159.03 shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact
supporting the motion.
   (C)   A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one or
more of the criteria set forth in §
159.02 are not satisfied or that the application is incomplete. Insofar as
practical, such a motion shall include a statement of the specific reasons or
findings of fact that support it. This motion is adopted as the Board of
Adjustment’s decision if supported by more than one fifth of the Board’s
membership.
   (D)   For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the Board and
members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi judicial matter shall not
be considered “members of the Board” for calculation of the requisite
supermajority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place
of the members.
   (E)   Pursuant to the requirements of G.S. § 160D-109(d), a member of the
Board of Adjustment shall not participate in or vote on any quasi judicial
matter in a manner that would violate affected persons’ constitutional rights
to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible conflicts include, but are not
limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is
not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close
familial, business or other associational relationship with an affected person,
or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised
to a member’s participation and that member does not recuse himself or herself,
the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection.

§ 159.09 EVIDENCE.
   (A)   The provisions of this section apply to all hearings for which a
notice is required by §
159.07.
   (B)   All persons who intend to present evidence to the Board of Adjustment,
rather than arguments only, shall be sworn.
   (C)   All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or denial of
the requested appeal or variance (crucial findings) shall be based upon
reliable evidence. Competent evidence (evidence admissible in a court of law)
shall be preferred whenever reasonably available, but in no case may crucial
findings be based solely upon incompetent evidence unless competent evidence is
not reasonably available, the evidence in question appears to be particularly
reliable, and the matter at issue is not seriously disputed.
   (D)   The Board of Adjustment may subpoena witnesses and compel the
production of evidence. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued
pursuant to this division (D), the Board of Adjustment may apply to the
Superior Court of Craven County for an order requiring that its order be
obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders after
notice to all proper parties. No testimony of any witness before the Board of
Adjustment pursuant to a subpoena issued in exercise of the power conferred by
G.S. § 160D-406(g) may be used against the witness in the trial of any civil or
criminal action other than a prosecution for false swearing committed on the
examination. Any person, who, while under oath during a proceeding before the
Board of Adjustment, willfully swears falsely, will be subject to enforcement
under §
162.04.

§ 159.10 MODIFICATION OF APPLICATION AT HEARING.
   (A)   In response to questions or comments by persons appearing at the
hearing or to suggestions or recommendations by the Board of Adjustment, the
applicant may agree to modify his or her application, including the plans and
specifications submitted.
   (B)   Unless the modifications are so substantial or extensive that the
Board cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the
proposed changes without revised plans before it, the Board of Adjustment may
approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued
until plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the Zoning
Administrator.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 159.11 RECORD.
   (A)   A record shall be made of all hearings required by § 159.07 and the
record shall be kept as provided by state law. Accurate minutes shall also be
kept of all the proceedings, but a transcript need not be made.
   (B)   Whenever practical, all documentary evidence presented at a hearing as
well as all other types of physical evidence shall be made a part of the record
of the proceedings.

variance shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant or appellant
and all other persons who make a written request for a copy.

disposition of the case and any other information deemed appropriate, the
written decision shall state the Board’s findings and conclusions, as well as
supporting reasons or facts.

(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 160.03 TECHNICAL REVIEW COMMITTEE AND PLANNING BOARD REVIEW AND
RECOMMENDATIONS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a petition for an amendment, the Zoning Administrator
shall forward the request to the Technical Review Committee for its review.
   (B)   The Technical Review Committee (TRC) shall review the proposed
amendment and submit its recommendation in writing to the Planning Board. The
TRC is not required to make a recommendation on a proposed amendment within any
specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practical on
petitions for amendments since inordinate delays can result in the petitioner
incurring unnecessary costs.
   (C)   The Planning Board shall review the proposed amendment and the
recommendation from the TRC and submit its own comments and recommendations in
writing to the Board of Commissioners including a written recommendation
addressing plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate. An
ordinance that amends any of the provisions of the UDO may not be adopted until
it has been referred to the Planning Board for its recommendation.
      (1)   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a “large-scale rezoning,”
the consistency statement may address the overall rezoning and describe how the
analysis and policies in the Land Use Plan and other relevant adopted plans
were considered in the recommendation made.
   (D)   The Planning Board is not required to make its recommendations on a
proposed amendment within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as
expeditiously as practical on petitions for amendments since inordinate delays
can result in the petitioner incurring unnecessary costs. However, if no
written report is received from the Planning Board within 30 days of referral
of the amendment to that Board, the Board of Commissioners may act on the
amendment without the Planning Board report.
   (E)   The Planning Board, at its discretion, may call for a legislative
hearing or other public meeting on any proposed amendment to the UDO. The
hearing shall be noticed consistent with §
160.05.
   (F)   In accordance with the requirements of G.S. § 160D-109(b), members of
the Planning Board shall not vote on recommendations regarding any zoning map
or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is
reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial and readily identifiable
financial impact on the member or if the landowner of the property subject to
the matter is a person with whom the member has a close familial, business or
other associational relationship.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 160.04 BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS REVIEW, VOTING AND ADOPTION.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Planning Board, the Board of
Commissioners shall set a date for a legislative hearing on the proposed
amendment. The public notice required for the legislative hearing shall be in
accordance with §
160.05.
   (B)   At the conclusion of a legislative hearing on the proposed amendment,
the Board of Commissioners may proceed to vote on the proposed amendment, refer
it to a committee for further study, or take any other action consistent with
its usual rules of procedure.
   (C)   The Board of Commissioners is not bound by any recommendations of the
Planning Board, Technical Review Committee or Planning Staff that are before it
at the time it takes action on a proposed amendment.
   (D)   When adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the Board of
Commissioners shall, in accordance with the provisions of G.S. § 160D-605,
adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted
comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable and
explaining why the Board considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the
public interest.
      (1)   Per G.S. § 160D-605(a), this requirement may also be met by a clear
indication in the minutes of the Board meeting that at the time of action on
the amendment, the governing board was aware of and considered the Planning
Board’s recommendations and any relevant portions of the Land Use Plan.
   (E)   When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment,
the Board of Commissioners shall also approve a statement analyzing the
reasonableness of the proposed rezoning, in accordance with the provisions of
G.S. § 160D-605(b). The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency
statement may be approved as a single statement.
   (F)   Any comments from the Planning Board that the proposed amendment is
inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or
approval of the proposed amendment by the Board of Commissioners. In addition,
this consistency statement is not subject to judicial review.
   (G)   If the proposed map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed
inconsistent with the City’s future land use plan, the amendment shall have the
effect of also amending the future land use map in the plan. No additional
request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. If the proposed
zoning amendment is denied by the Board of Commissioners based on its
inconsistency with the Land Use Plan, the applicant may request an amendment to
the Land Use Plan. It should be noted that because the City’s Land Use Plan is
its CAMA Land Use Plan, all proposed amendments to it must be approved by the
Coastal Resources Commission (as required under the Coastal Area Management
Act).
      (1)   If the Land Use Plan is deemed amended by virtue of adoption of a
zoning amendment that is inconsistent with the Land Use Plan, the amendment
shall be noted in the plan. However, since the City’s Land Use Plan is its CAMA
Land Use Plan, the amendment shall not be effective until reviewed and approved
by the Coastal Resources Commission (as required under the Coastal Area
Management Act and G.S. § 160D-501(c)).
   (H)   The Board of Commissioners is not required to take final action on a
proposed amendment within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as
expeditiously as practical on petitions for amendments since inordinate delays
can result in the petitioner incurring unnecessary costs.
   (I)   As required by G.S. § 160A-75, a development ordinance on which an
legislative hearing must be held pursuant to G.S. § 160D-601 before adoption of
the ordinance may be adopted on the day it is introduced by a simple majority.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 160.05 LEGISLATIVE HEARING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   An ordinance that amends any of the provisions of the UDO may not be
adopted until a legislative hearing has been held on the ordinance.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator shall publish a notice of the legislative
hearing on any ordinance that amends the provisions of the UDO once a week for
two successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the city. The
notice shall be published for the first time not less than ten days or more
than 25 days before the date fixed for the public hearing. In computing this
period, the date of publication shall not be counted but the date of the
hearing shall be.
   (C)   With respect to map amendments, the Zoning Administrator shall provide
first class mail notice of the legislative hearing to the record owners for tax
purposes of all properties whose zoning classification is changed by the
proposed amendment as well as the owners of all properties abutting the
property rezoned by the amendment. For purposes of this section, properties are
"abutting" even if separated by a street, railroad or other transportation
corridor. The first class mail notice shall be deposited in the mail at least
ten but not more than 25 days prior to the date of the hearing. The Zoning
Administrator shall also post notices of the hearing on the property proposed
to be rezoned in accordance with division (F) below and take any other action
deemed by the Zoning Administrator to be useful or appropriate to give notice
of the public hearing.
   (D)   The notice required in division (C) above shall not be required if the
zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning". In this instance,
the city may elect, in lieu of the mail notice specified in division (C) above,
to publish a notice of the hearing once a week for two consecutive weeks,
published for the first time not less than ten days nor more than 25 days
before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing this period, the date of
publication shall not be counted but the date of the public hearing shall be.
Each of the advertisements shall not be less than one half of a newspaper page
in size. The advertisement shall only be effective for property owners who
reside in the area of general circulation of the newspaper which publishes the
notice. Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation area,
according to the address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the
affected property, shall be notified according to the provisions of division
(C) above. The person or persons mailing the notices to abutting property
owners, as defined in G.S. § 160D-602, shall certify to the Board of
Commissioners that fact, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the
absence of fraud.
   (E)   The notice required or authorized by this section shall:
      (1)   State the date, time and place of the public hearing;
      (2)   Summarize the nature and character of the proposed change;
      (3)   If the proposed amendment involves a change in zoning district
classification, reasonably identify the property whose classification would be
affected by the amendment;
      (4)   State that the full text of the amendment and maps of the area
proposed to be rezoned can be obtained from the Zoning Administrator; and
      (5)   State that substantial changes in the proposed amendment may be
made following the public hearing.
   (F)   When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the city shall prominently
post a notice of the public hearing on the site proposed for rezoning or on an
adjacent public street or highway right-of-way within the same time period
specified for mailed notices of the hearing. When multiple parcels are included
within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is
not required, but the city shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable
notice to interested persons.
   (G)   Where an application for a zoning map amendment is not made by the
owner of the parcel of land to which the amendment would apply (except for
city-initiated rezoning), the applicant must certify to the Board of
Commissioners that the owner of the parcel of land as shown on the county tax
listing has received actual notice of the proposed amendment and a copy of the
notice of public hearing. The person or persons required to provide notice
shall certify to the Board of Commissioners that proper notice has been
provided in fact and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence
of fraud. Actual notice of the proposed amendment and a copy of the notice of
public hearing required shall be by any manner permitted under this section.
      (1)   No amendment to zoning regulations or a zoning map that down-zones
property shall be initiated without the written consent of all property owners
whose property is the subject of the down-zoning amendment, unless the
amendment is initiated by the City.
   (H)   For any property located within five miles of MCAS Cherry Point,
written notice of the proposed changes shall be given to the base commander not
less than ten (10) days nor more than 25 days in advance of any public hearing.
Notice shall be provided by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the
base commander provides comments or analysis regarding the compatibility of the
proposed development regulation or amendment with military operations at the
base, the Board of Commissioners shall take the comments and analysis into
consideration before making a final determination.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 160.06 ULTIMATE ISSUE ON AMENDMENTS; APPROVAL CRITERIA.
   (A)   Ultimate issue on amendments. In deciding whether to adopt a proposed
amendment to the UDO, the central issue before the Board of Commissioners is
whether the proposed amendment advances the public health, safety or welfare.
All other issues are irrelevant, and all information related to other issues at
the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the Mayor and excluded. When
considering proposed map amendments:
      (1)   Except for Conditional Zoning District requests submitted in
accordance with §
160.12, the Board of Commissioners shall not consider any representations made
by the petitioner that, if the change is granted, the property will be used for
only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested
classification. Rather, the Board of Commissioners shall consider whether the
entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more
appropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification.
      (2)   The Board of Commissioners shall not regard as controlling any
advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall
consider the impact of the proposed change on the public at large.
   (B)   Approval criteria for text amendments. In reviewing applications to
amend the text of the UDO, the Board of Commissioners should consider the
following criteria:
      (1)   Whether the proposed amendment corrects an ambiguity or error or
meets the challenge of some changing condition, trend or fact;
      (2)   Whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the city’s CAMA
Comprehensive Land Use Plan and the stated purposes of the UDO;
      (3)   Whether the proposed amendment will protect the health, safety,
morals or general welfare of the public; and
      (4)   Whether the proposed amendment will result in significant adverse
impacts on the natural environment, including air, water, noise, stormwater
management, wildlife and vegetation.
   (C)   Approval criteria for map amendments. In reviewing proposed rezonings,
the Board of Commissioners should consider the following criteria:
      (1)   Whether the proposed rezoning corrects an error or meets the
challenge of some changing condition, trend or fact;
      (2)   Whether the proposed rezoning is consistent with the city’s CAMA
Comprehensive Land Use Plan and the purposes set forth in the UDO;
      (3)   Whether the city and other service providers will be able to
provide sufficient public safety, educational, recreational, transportation and
utility facilities and services to the subject property, while maintaining
sufficient levels of service to existing development;
      (4)   Whether the proposed rezoning is unlikely to have significant
adverse impacts on the natural environment, including air, water, noise,
stormwater management, wildlife and vegetation;
      (5)   Whether the proposed rezoning will not have significant adverse
impacts on other property in the vicinity of the subject tract; and
      (6)   Whether the proposed zoning classification is suitable for the
subject property.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 160.07 CITIZEN COMMENTS.

written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or repeal to a
zoning regulation, including a text or map amendment that has been properly
initiated to the City Clerk at least two (2) business days prior to the date of
the legislative hearing, the City Clerk shall deliver such written statement to
the Board of Commissioners.
(Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)

petition and shall adhere to the submission and review requirements of §§
160.01 through

§ 160.09 PETITION RESUBMITTAL.
   (A)   In the event a proposed change in the zoning classification of a tract
or parcel of land shall be denied by the Board of Commissioners or has been
withdrawn by the applicant after notice has been given of the public hearing on
the application, a request for the same or substantially the same zoning
classification change may not be resubmitted for the same property or a portion
of the property, either to the Board of Commissioners or to the Planning Board,
until the expiration of 180 days following the date of the Board of
Commissioners action denying the proposed change or applicant’s withdrawal of
petition.
   (B)   The only exception to the waiting period defined in division (A) above
is a resubmitted petition that sufficiently amends the proposal to address the
comments and concerns expressed by the BOC in denying the initial submittal.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 160.10 NOTIFICATION OF DECISION.
   (A)   Within five working days of any action by the Board of Commissioners
on an amendment petition, notice of that action shall be sent by first-class
mail to the petitioner and any other persons who have indicated to the Zoning
Administrator, in writing, that they would like the decision mailed to them.
   (B)   Additionally, within 15 days after the effective date of a zoning
change to commercial or industrial zones within 660 feet of the right-of-way of
an interstate or primary highway, written notice by registered mail shall be
sent to the Raleigh offices of the State Department of Transportation in
accordance with G.S. §§ 136-136 and 136-153.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 160.11 CITY-INITIATED COMPREHENSIVE REZONINGS.
   (A)   City-initiated comprehensive rezonings shall follow the procedures and
notification requirements in §§
160.02 through
160.10.
   (B)   Repair of zoning map errors. In situations where errors are found to
exist on the official zoning map, the repair of these errors is not considered
to be a rezoning as described in §
160.01. As a result, repair of zoning map errors may be corrected through
review and recommendation by the Planning Board and then final approval of the
Board of Commissioners at a legislative hearing, and this hearing shall only
require published notice (see §
160.05).
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 160.12 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   Conditional zoning districts are applicable if the regulations and
restrictions of a general use zoning district are inadequate to ensure the
compatibility of the proposed development with the immediately surrounding
neighborhood in accordance with the principles of the City’s Comprehensive Land
Use Plan and the UDO. In these circumstances, a general zoning district
designation allowing a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular
property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate
for the property consistent with the objectives of the UDO and adopted land
development plan, comprehensive plan, transportation and corridor plans, small
area plans and other land use and transportation policy documents.
      (2)   The rezoning process established in this section provides for the
accommodation of the uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional
zoning district, subject to additional conditions which ensure compatibility of
the proposed use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. A
conditional zoning district bears the same designation as a general use zoning
district but is a conditional zoning district subject to additional conditions
in which limited uses are permitted and that are contained in the ordinance
approving the conditional zoning district. A conditional zoning district allows
a particular use or uses to be established only in accordance with specified
standards and conditions tailored to each individual development project. The
districts also can be used to implement environmental mitigation measures to
avoid or minimize the impacts of the project, as determined through the
analysis required in §
160.02(A). This is a voluntary rezoning procedure that is intended for firm
development proposals. It is not intended or suited for securing early zoning
for tentative proposals that may not be undertaken for some time.
      (3)   Conditional zoning districts parallel general use zoning districts.
Only those land uses (including uses by right, special uses and those uses
identified as CD in
Table 155-8 Table of Permitted Uses) permitted in a general use zoning district
to which a conditional zoning district corresponds shall be allowed. All
requirements of any corresponding general use district and all other
requirements of the UDO apply to a conditional zoning district except to the
extent that the approved rules, regulations and conditions included in the
petition for rezoning are more restrictive than the general use district
requirements.
   (B)   Process required.
      (1)   A person petitioning for rezoning of a tract of land may elect to
request a conditional zoning district for that tract. The conditional zoning
district application must specify the actual use or uses, and all other
development regulations authorized by state law, which are intended for the
property specified in the petition. The intended use or uses and development
regulations must be permitted in the corresponding general use district.
      (2)   The Board of Commissioners is to approve or disapprove the
application on the basis of the specific use or uses and development
regulations requested. Development in a conditional zoning district requires
approval of a single application similar to a general use district rezoning
application.
      (3)   Property may be placed in a conditional zoning district only in
response to a petition signed by the owners of all the property to be included
or by an agent authorized by all of the owners to file the application. A
petition for conditional zoning shall include:
         (a)   A master site plan prepared in accordance with
Appendix A;
         (b)   Written supporting documentation that specifies the actual use
or uses proposed for the property;
         (c)   Proposed rules, regulations, and conditions that, in addition to
all predetermined requirements of this UDO, will govern the development and use
of the property; and
         (d)   A statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed
rezoning.
      (4)   During its initial review of a conditional zoning petition, the
Planning Board shall consider whether or not a community informational meeting,
to be organized and conducted by the petitioner, would be beneficial to making
project information available to those most likely to be impacted by the
proposed zoning change. If the Planning Board concludes that a community
informational meeting should be held, the petitioner shall conduct such meeting
in accordance with the following provisions.
         (a)   The community informational meeting shall be held prior to the
date of the next Planning Board meeting at which the petition will be reviewed.
         (b)   Written notice of such a meeting shall be given to the property
owners and organizations entitled to notice as determined by policies
established by the city.
         (c)   The petitioner shall file a written report of the community
informational meeting with the Zoning Administrator. The petitioner’s report
shall include, among other things, a listing of those persons and organizations
contacted about the meeting and the manner and date of contact; the date; time
and location of the meeting; a roster of the names, mailing addresses, and
telephone numbers of the persons in attendance at the meeting; a summary of
issues discussed at the meeting; and a description of any changes to the
rezoning petition made by the petitioner as a result of the meeting.
         (d)   The purpose of the community informational meeting is to:
            1.   Provide specific information regarding the proposed
development including but not limited to a description of the proposed use(s)
of the property, the proposed density and intensity of land uses, the location
and arrangement of the proposed land use(s) on the property, the proposed
development schedule, and proposed regulations or conditions, in addition to
those required by this Ordinance, that will govern the development and use of
the property; and
            2.   To receive comments and input from citizens likely to be
impacted by the proposed zoning change and subsequent development of the
property.
         (e)   In the event the petitioner has not held at least one meeting
pursuant to this section, the petitioner shall file a report with the Zoning
Administrator documenting efforts that were made to arrange such a meeting and
stating the reasons such a meeting was not held.
         (f)   The adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant to this
section shall be considered by the Board of Commissioners but shall not be
subject to judicial review.
      (5)   Review and approval process. The review and approval process for
conditional zoning district petitions involves a legislative hearing and
legislative decision by the Board of Commissioners. The review of conditional
zoning district petitions shall be undertaken in accordance with the provisions
of §§
160.02 through
160.10, as modified by this section.
         (a)   In the course of evaluating the proposed use, the Board of
Commissioners may request additional information deemed appropriate to provide
a complete analysis of the proposal.
         (b)   Conditional zoning district decisions are subject to judicial
review using the same procedures and standard of review applicable to general
use district zoning decisions.
         (c)   Conditional zoning district decisions shall be made in
consideration of identified relevant adopted land use plans for the area,
including, but not limited to, land development plans, comprehensive plans,
strategic plans, district plans, small area plans, transportation and corridor
plans and other land development policy documents.
         (d)   If the conditional zoning district application is approved, the
Board of Commissioners shall authorize the requested use with reasonable
conditions as mutually agreed to in writing by the applicant and Board of
Commissioners and determined to be desirable in promoting public health, safety
and general welfare.
      (6)   Conditions to approval. Specific conditions applicable to the
conditional zoning districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the city or
its agencies, but only those conditions mutually agreed to in writing by the
city and the petitioner may be incorporated into the zoning regulations or
permit requirements.
         (a)   The conditional district rezoning application shall specify the
use or uses that are intended for the property, as well as any additional
conditions on the use of the property that the applicant may propose be
conditions of the rezoning. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a
conditional zoning district shall be limited to:
            1.   Those that address conformance of the development and use of
the site to ordinances and officially adopted plans and
            2.   Those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be
generated by the development or use of the site.
         (b)   Any such conditions should relate to the relationship of the
proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as
parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems,
screening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street and right-of-way
improvements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision
of open space, the mitigation of environmental impacts, and other matters that
the Board of Commissioners may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose.
         (c)   Such conditions to approval of the petition may include
dedication to the city or state, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or
easements for streets, water, sewer or other public utilities necessary to
serve the proposed development.
         (d)   No condition shall be less restrictive than the standards of the
general use district or the standards of any overlay district that applies to
the property.
         (e)   No condition shall be made part of the application, or shall be
attached to approval of the conditional zoning district, which specifies the
ownership status, race, religion or character of the occupants of housing
units, the minimum value of improvements, or any illegal exclusionary device;
or which states that the use of the property will not be subject to regulations
or restrictions set forth in the UDO which would apply to the property in any
event, such as the regulations for an overlay district which covers the
property.
         (f)   If for any reason any condition for approval is found to be
illegal or invalid or if the petitioner should fail to carry out any condition
in the written and signed agreement, the approval of the site plan for the
district shall be null and void and of no effect and proceedings shall be
instituted by the city to rezone the property to its previous zoning
classification or to another zoning district.
         (g)   The conditions shall be agreed upon, put in writing, and signed
by both the petitioner and City upon final approval of the rezoning by the
Board of Commissioners.
         (h)   After the city has delivered to the newspaper the notice of
public hearing for the application, the applicant shall make no changes in the
conditions that are less restrictive than those stated in the application,
including, but not limited to, smaller setbacks; more dwelling or rooming
units; greater height; more access points; new uses; and fewer improvements.
However, more restrictive conditions or additional conditions may be added to
the application if the conditions are received by the Planning and Inspections
Department in writing and signed by all owners of the property at least ten
working days before the date scheduled for final Board of Commissioners action
on the application.
      (7)   Effect of approval. If a petition for conditional zoning is
approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed by the
predetermined ordinance requirements applicable to the district’s
classification, the approved site plan or master plan for the district, and any
additional approved rules, regulations and conditions, all of which shall
constitute the zoning regulations for the approved district and are binding on
the property as an amendment to this Ordinance and to the zoning map.
         (a)   If a petition is approved, only those uses and structures
indicated in the approved petition and site plan shall be allowed on the
subject property. A change of location of the structures may be authorized
pursuant to division (B)(8) below provided that the change in building layout
does not result in an increase in the number of structures.
         (b)   Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning
district, the subject property shall be identified on the zoning map by the
appropriate district designation. A conditional zoning district shall be
identified by the same designation as the underlying general district followed
by the letters “CD” (for example, “R-20 (CD)”).
         (c)   No permit shall be issued for any development activity within a
conditional zoning district except in accordance with the approved petition and
site plan for the district.
         (d)   Any violation of the approved site plan or any rules,
regulations and conditions for the district shall be treated the same as any
other violation of the UDO and shall be subject to the same remedies and
penalties as any such violation.
      (8)   Alterations to approval. Except as provided in division (B)(8)(a)
below, changes to an approved petition or to the conditions attached to the
approved petition shall be considered a change to the conditional zoning
district and shall be processed as a new conditional zoning application in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.
         (a)   The Zoning Administrator shall have the delegated authority to
approve administrative minor modifications to an approved site plan. The Zoning
Administrator shall have no authority to amend the conditions of approval of a
petition. Any decision by the Zoning Administrator must be in writing stating
the grounds for approval or denial. Minor modifications shall be limited to
changes that the Zoning Administrator determines would not:
            1.   Change the gross square footage of nonresidential development
by more than 5%;
            2.   Change the lot coverage by more than 5%;
            3.   Change any use or density;
            4.   Adjust the landscaping requirements by more than 10%; or
            5.   Adjust the required parking more than 5%.
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator, however, shall always have the
discretion to decline to exercise the delegated authority either because he or
she is uncertain about approval of the change pursuant to the standard or
because a rezoning petition for a legislative hearing and Board of
Commissioners consideration is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If
the Zoning Administrator declines to exercise this authority, the applicant may
file a rezoning petition for a legislative hearing and Board of Commissioners
decision in accordance with the provisions delineated in §§
160.02 through
160.10.
         (c)   Any request for an administrative modification shall be pursuant
to a written letter, signed by the owners of all of the property affected by
the proposed change, detailing the requested change. Upon request, the
applicant shall provide any additional information as deemed necessary by the
Zoning Administrator. Upon an approval of an administrative modification, the
applicant shall file a sufficient number of copies of the revised site plan as
deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator.
         (d)   If the Zoning Administrator denies approval of the requested
administrative modification, the applicant may file a rezoning petition for a
legislative hearing and Board of Commissioners decision in accordance with the
provisions delineated in §§
160.02 through
160.10.
      (9)   Review of approved Conditional Zoning Districts. It is intended
that property shall be reclassified to a conditional zoning district only in
the event of firm plans to develop the property. Therefore, no sooner than two
years after the date of approval of the petition, the Planning Board may
examine the progress made toward developing the property in accordance with the
approved petition and any conditions attached to the approval.
         (a)   If the Planning Board determines that substantial progress has
not been made in accordance with the approved petition and conditions, the
Planning Board shall forward to the Board of Commissioners a report which may
recommend that the property be rezoned to its previous zoning classification or
to another zoning district. If the Board of Commissioners concurs with the
Planning Board’s recommendation, the Board of Commissioners may initiate the
rezoning of the property in accordance with the procedures delineated in §§
160.02 through
160.10.
         (b)   If the Planning Board determines that substantial progress has
been made to develop the property, the Planning Board may recommend that an
extension of time be granted. The Board of Commissioners, after reviewing the
recommendation of the Planning Board, may approve an extension of time not to
exceed an additional 12 months. Approval of such a time extension by the Board
of Commissioners may be made without conducting a formal public hearing.
         (c)   If, after the expiration of the extended time period, the
Planning Board determines that no substantial progress has been made and the
Board of Commissioners concurs with that determination, the Board of
Commissioners shall proceed to: conduct a legislative hearing on the matter to
evaluate whether or not another extension of time is warranted; or initiate the
rezoning of the property to its previous zoning classification or to another
zoning classification using the procedures delineated in §§
160.02 through
160.10.
         (d)   For purposes of this section, examples of substantial progress
may include: the approval of construction plans for streets, utilities and
other infrastructure; the initiation of land preparation activities such as
clearing and grading; the initiation of the construction of the principal
building(s); and the initiation of the construction of streets, utilities,
other infrastructure or required site amenities.

§ 160.13 NONTRADITIONAL RESIDENTIAL LOT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Purpose. 
      (1)   Nontraditional residential lot developments as listed in §
155.02(D), are intended to permit and encourage, on application and approval of
detailed development plans, establishment of new developments for specified
purposes where tracts of land suitable in location, area and character are to
be planned and developed as a whole and in a unified manner.
      (2)   The nontraditional residential lot development process established
in this section provides for the accommodation of the uses by a
reclassification of a property into a conditional zoning district, subject to
regulations and conditions specified in the developer’s master plan. The
approved master plan and associated preliminary and final site plans shall be
the basis for control of land development within the conditional zoning
district.
      (3)   Applications requesting a rezoning to a conditional zoning district
(CD) classification shall be submitted in accordance with the general rezoning
procedures set forth in §§
160.02 through
160.10, as modified by the specific procedures set forth in this section.
      (4)   Rezoning to a CD is a voluntary rezoning procedure that is intended
for firm development proposals. It is not intended or suited for securing early
zoning for tentative proposals that may not be undertaken for some time.
      (5)   The Technical Review Committee, Planning Board and Board of
Commissioners shall review the master land use plan, proposed CD change
application and preliminary and final site plans for consistency with the City
CAMA Comprehensive Land Use Plan, as well as compliance with this chapter and
all other chapters of the UDO, including 154 through 158. The nontraditional
lot development shall provide appropriate relationships between uses around the
boundaries and uses within the development so as to ensure that no property
will be adversely affected.
      (6)   A nontraditional residential lot development shall be approved as
Conditional Zoning District designation , pursuant to nontraditional lot
development regulations specified in §
154.03, the development standards and use regulations defined in
Chapter 155, all applicable environmental regulations of Chapters 50 through 54
and 156, and all applicable general regulations set forth in
Chapter 157.
      (7)   Where nontraditional residential lot developments are permitted,
regulations adapted to the unified development (through an approved master
plan) are intended to accomplish the purposes of zoning and subdivision
regulations and other applicable regulations to the same degree as in cases in
which those regulations are intended to control development on a lot-by-lot
rather than unified basis.
      (8)   Approval for construction of any on-site or off-site improvements
in a nontraditional lot development shall not be granted until a master plan
and preliminary and final site plans for the development are approved in
accordance with the procedures and requirements of this section.
   (B)   Process required.
      (1)   Conditional zoning district and master plan process.
         (a)   The applicant shall submit to the Zoning Administrator 11 copies
of a conditional zoning district application, a proposed master land use plan
containing all elements listed in division (B)(2) below, and all supplementary
materials requested by the Zoning Administrator.
         (b)   All requirements and provisions of §§
160.02 through
160.10 shall be followed, whereby the master land use plan shall be reviewed
concurrently with and approved as part of the nontraditional lot development
application.
         (c)   After the city has delivered to the newspaper the notice of
public hearing for the application, the applicant shall make no changes to the
conditions that are less restrictive than those stated in the application,
including, but not limited to, smaller setbacks; more dwelling or rooming
units; greater height; more access points; new uses; and fewer improvements.
However, more restrictive conditions or additional conditions may be added to
the application if the conditions are received by the Planning Department in
writing and signed by all owners of the property at least ten working days
before the date scheduled for final Board of Commissioners action on the
application.
      (2)   Master plan contents.
         (a)   The master plan shall be mapped to one inch equals 100 feet
scale or larger and show the proposed development and how it relates to its
surroundings, including the following information:
            1.   The location of major building types;
            2.   Total acreage of the development as well as each legal parcel
being combined to create the district, plus the acreage for each distinct
development area planned within the district;
            3.   Major traffic, parking and pedestrian circulation plans within
the development;
            4.   Major physical features including soils, topography, existing
structures and uses, drainage, flora and fauna, and other physical information
to help describe the suitability of the site for planned development;
            5.   Ownership arrangements for the development, both present and
planned;
            6.   Planned open space, parks and active recreation areas to be
preserved or developed either by the developer, through a homeowners
association, by dedication to the city or county for their development or by
reservation for the city or county as is required by the subdivision
regulations;
            7.   Landscaping (buffer yard/ street yard);
            8.   Sketch plans for construction of water and sewage disposal
systems to comply with city standards, and the appropriate state and county
authorizing agency;
            9.   Sketch plans for access of firefighting equipment and refuse

            10.   Sketch plans for underground utilities and lighting; and
            11.   Sketch plans for adequate underground storm drainage systems.
         (b)   A Letter of Intent, which describes the following:
            1.   Anticipated time frame for starting and completing any and all
phases of the development;
            2.   Number and types of buildings and uses anticipated in each;
            3.   Quantitative data, including acreages of all current and
proposed parcels, and acreages of each proposed land use and type;
            4.   A description (legal) of the total site proposed for
development including the names and addresses of adjacent property owners;
            5.   Planned organizational arrangements for providing for
ownership, maintenance and preservation of common open space, and other
property;
            6.   Anticipated gross and net residential densities (units per
acre);
            7.   Anticipated architectural housing style and mixing of types;
            8.   Anticipated commercial elements; and
            9.   Any other anticipated nonresidential elements such as:
               a.   Approximate percentage of land to be covered by buildings
and parking areas; and
               b.   Proposed uses, number, architectural style and types of all
buildings.
      (3)   Preliminary site plan process.
         (a)   Submittal.
            1.   After the required master plan has been approved by the Board
of Commissioners, the developer shall submit 11 copies of a preliminary site
plan, containing all elements listed in division (B)(4) below, to the Zoning
Administrator.
            2.   The Zoning Administrator shall forward the preliminary site
plan to the TRC for its review.
         (b)   Technical Review Committee (TRC). The TRC shall review the
preliminary site plan according to §
160.13(A)(5) as well as whether the plan is conforms to the adopted Master Plan
associated with the conditional zoning district request, and submit its
recommendation in writing to the Planning Board.
         (c)   Planning Board.
            1.   The developer or his or her agent shall come to the Planning
Board meeting to assist the Board in reviewing the preliminary site plan.
            2.   Before recommending approval of a preliminary site plan, the
Planning Board may make reasonable additional requirements in cooperation with
the developer and concerning, but not limited to: elements of the plan that are
not consistent with the master plan and conditional zoning district request,
the limitations of uses, unit densities, planned landscaping, paving and
location of access ways, taking into consideration the character of the
surrounding area so as to provide proper transition of land uses that will fit
into the city’s land development plan.
            3.   The Planning Board shall discuss with the developer changes
deemed advisable, if any, and the kind and extent of improvements to be made by
the developer. The Planning Board may require the developer to revise the plan
before it is submitted to the Board of Commissioners.
            4.   After discussing the proposed site plan with the developer,
evaluating the plan pursuant to G.S. § 160.13(A)(5), as well as the master plan
for the property, and considering the recommendations and comments from the
Technical Review Committee, the Planning Board will forward the preliminary
site plan along with its own comments and recommendations to the Board of
Commissioners which shall approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove the
preliminary plan.
         (d)   Board of Commissioners.
            1.   The Board of Commissioners shall approve, approve
conditionally, or disapprove the preliminary plan.
            2.   If the preliminary site plan is approved by the Board of
Commissioners, approval shall be noted on two prints of the plan by the Board
of Commissioners. One print of the plan shall be transmitted to the developer
and the second approved print shall be retained by the Board of Commissioners.
            3.   In the case of conditional approval, the reasons for
conditional approval and the conditions to be met shall be specified in
writing. One copy of the reasons and conditions, along with one print of the
plan, shall be retained by the Board of Commissioners and a print of the plan
with the reasons for conditional approval shall be given to the developer and
the Planning Board. The Board of Commissioners may require the developer to
submit a revised preliminary site plan including the recommended changes before
approving the plan.
            4.   Upon approval or conditional approval of the preliminary site
plan by the Board of Commissioners, the developer may proceed with the
installation or arrangement of the required improvements in accordance with the
preliminary site plan as approved and the requirements of this chapter, and
with the preparation of the final site plan.
            5.   When a preliminary site plan is disapproved, the Board of
Commissioners shall specify the reasons for the action in writing. One copy of
the reasons and one print shall be retained by the Board of Commissioners, and
a print of the plan with the reasons for disapproval shall be given to the
developer and the Planning Board.
         (e)   Timing. The Technical Review Committee, Planning Board and Board
of Commissioners are not required to make their recommendations or decisions on
a proposed preliminary site plan within any specific period of time, but it
should proceed as expeditiously as practical since inordinate delays can result
in the petitioner incurring unnecessary costs.
      (4)   Preliminary site plan contents.
         (a)   Phased development. When a nontraditional lot development is to
be developed in stages, the preliminary site plan shall be submitted for the
entire development. A final site plan (see division (B)(5)) may be submitted
for each stage.
         (b)   The preliminary site plan shall be prepared in accordance with
Appendix A.
         (c)   Supplementary materials that must accompany the preliminary site
plan:
            1.   A copy of the restrictive or protective covenants applicable
to the development;
            2.   The proposed plans for land clearance (unless waived by the
Planning Board);
            3.   Public water supply system plans, including the layout and
details of mains, approved by a registered engineer licensed to practice in the
state;
            4.   Method of surveying roads, access map, and parking areas;
            5.   An architectural design sketch of how a typical building will
look after completion, or a preliminary architectural design sketch of how the
whole project will look after completion, or a photographic display of a
similar completed development that the applicant has already been involved
with, or equivalent information;
            6.   Copies of any declaration to be recorded pursuant to the North
Carolina Condominium Act;
            7.   For all condominium projects or similar cooperative ownership
projects - a copy of the condominium documentation;
            8.   For all townhouses or row houses in condominium projects - a
copy of the proposed restrictive covenants, easements for the common walls and
a copy of the proposed deed for sale of a unit; and
            9.   For all rental or leased units or buildings - a declaration by

of the property, or approved section thereof.
      (2)   Upon approval and filing of final site plans and reports with the
Register of Deeds, building permits shall be issued in the same manner as for
building permits generally, provided that any requirements concerning the order
or location in which building permits are to be issued in the particular
nontraditional lot project area shall be observed. The intent of the building
permit is to enable the execution of the final site plan in the field. During
this phase, all field work shall be in accordance with the approved plan. It
shall be the responsibility of the developer to inform the various city and
county inspection officials as to the progress of field work so that timely
inspections may be made.
      (3)   The Planning and Inspections Director is authorized to issue a
certificate of compliance after completion of each section of the project. The

CHAPTER 161: NONCONFORMITIES
Section
   
161.01   General
   
161.02   Nonconforming lots
   
161.03   Nonconforming use of land
   
161.04   Extension, enlargement or replacement of a nonconforming use
   
161.05   Nonconforming structures
   
161.06   Miscellaneous nonconforming situations
   
161.07   Nonconforming projects
   
161.08   Nonconforming signs
§ 161.01 GENERAL.
   (A)   A nonconforming situation occurs when, on the effective date of the
UDO, an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does
not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to the district in
which the lot or structure is located. Among other possibilities, a
nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage
requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations, because the
relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matter as density
and setback requirement) is not in conformity with the UDO, because signs do
not meet the requirements of the UDO, or because land or buildings are used for
purposes made unlawful by the UDO.
   (B)   Unless otherwise specifically provided for in
Chapter 154 for specific districts, as well as other chapters of the city code
of ordinances, and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in
the remaining sections of this chapter, nonconforming situations that were
otherwise lawful on the effective date of the UDO may be continued.
   (C)   Whenever the UDO refers to the effective date of the UDO, the
reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to
the UDO if the amendment, rather than the UDO as originally adopted, creates a
nonconforming situation.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 161.02 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   Single lot of record with lot area and/or lot width nonconformity.
      (1)   When an undeveloped lot has an area or width which does not conform
to the dimensional requirements of the district where located, but the lot was
approved and of record at the time of adoption of the UDO or any subsequent
amendment which renders the lot nonconforming, then the lot may be used for a
use permitted in the district where located, provided that the setback
dimensions and other requirements, except area or width, are complied with.
      (2)   In residential zones, only a single-family detached dwelling shall
be permitted on the nonconforming lot.
      (3)   Nothing contained herein exempts a lot from meeting the applicable
provisions of the City Public Services Department or the County Environmental
Health Department regulations.
   (B)   Lots with contiguous frontage in one ownership.
      (1)   When two or more adjoining and vacant lots of record with
contiguous frontage are in one ownership at the time of the adoption of the UDO
or subsequent to adoption and the lots individually have a lot area or lot
width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the district
where located, the lots shall be combined to create one or more lots that meet
the standards of the district where located.
      (2)   Nothing contained herein exempts the contiguous lots considered as
a single buildable lot or lots from meeting the applicable provisions of the
City Public Services Department or the County Environmental Health Department
regulations.
   (C)   Reduction of a lot of record. A lot of record reduced to less than the
required area, width or setback dimensions as the result of a condemnation or
purchase by a local or state government agency shall become a nonconforming lot
of record.
   (D)   Lot of record with setback nonconformity. When the use proposed for an
undeveloped nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects
except that the applicable setback requirements cannot reasonably be complied
with, then the entity authorized by the UDO to issue a permit for the proposed
use (the Zoning Administrator, Board of Commissioners or Board of Adjustment)
may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that:
      (1)   The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed
without the deviations;
      (2)   The deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the
nonconforming lot; and
      (3)   The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly
adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 161.03 NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
   (A)   Continuance of nonconforming use of land. Any nonconforming use
legally existing at the time of adoption or amendment of the UDO may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to conditions provided
in this section.
   (B)   Conditions for continuance. The nonconforming use of land shall be
subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Nonconforming uses shall not be changed to another nonconforming
use unless such use is determined to be of equal or less intensity. In
determining whether a nonconforming use is of equal or less intensity, the
Board of Adjustment shall consider:
         (a)   Probable traffic of each use;
         (b)   Parking requirements of each use;
         (c)   Probable number of persons on the premises of each use at a time
of peak demand; and
         (d)   Off-site impacts of each use, such as noise, glare, dust,
vibration or smoke and other impacts on surrounding properties or the public
health or safety.
      (2)   The number of dwelling units in a nonconforming residential use
shall not be increased.
      (3)   Nonconforming uses shall not be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by the use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the UDO.
      (4)   If any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
continuous period of more than 180 days, any subsequent use of the land shall
be a permitted use in the district in which the land is located. Recontinuance
of any nonconforming use must be with the clear intent of being continuous and
permanent.
      (5)   The resumption of a nonconforming use of land shall not be
permitted if the nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use for any
period of time.
      (6)   No additional structure(s) not conforming to the requirements of
the UDO shall be erected in connection with the nonconforming use of land.
   (C)   Amortization of existing minor structures and junk materials.
      (1)   Where nonconforming uses of land involve minor structures (not
including signs), or stored junk materials such as storage yards, junk yards or
salvage yards, the minor structures and stored junk materials existing as of
the effective date of the UDO shall be removed according to the following
schedule (
Table 161-1):
 
Table 161-1
Appraised Value of Minor Structure or Time for Removal (from effective date of
Junk Material                         UDO)
Less than $500                        1 year
$500 to $999                          2 years
$1,000 to $1,999                      3 years

$3,000 or more                        5 years
 
      (2)   Prior to the time for removal indicated in division (C)(1) above,
the structure or material may remain in place subject to the following
requirements:
         (a)   The material or structure shall not be enlarged, expanded, moved
or relocated.
         (b)   The material or structure shall not be allowed to remain after
the activity, business or use to which it relates has been discontinued.
         (c)   If the material or structure is damaged in such a manner that
the estimated expense of repairs exceeds 50% of its replacement value, the
material or structure shall not be allowed to remain or be repaired, and must
be removed.
      (3)   Upon failure to comply with the requirements of divisions (C)(1)
and (2) above, the Zoning Administrator shall cause the removal of any
nonconforming minor structures or junk materials as hereafter provided:
         (a)   The Zoning Administrator shall give the owner of the
nonconforming structure or material notice of the violation by certified mail
with return receipt requested. Notice to the owner or the occupant of the
premises on which the structure or material is located shall be sufficient.
These notices shall contain a brief statement of the particulars in which this
section is violated and the manner in which such violation is to be remedied.
         (b)   Failure to correct the violation within 30 days of received
written notice of violation shall subject the offender to a civil penalty under
§
162.05.
         (c)   In addition to the above penalties, the city may apply to a
court of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of
abatement directing the owner, occupant or permittee to correct the violation
in accordance with G.S. § 160D-404.

§ 161.04 EXTENSION, ENLARGEMENT OR REPLACEMENT OF A NONCONFORMING USE.
   (A)   Except as provided below, nonconforming uses shall not be extended,
enlarged or replaced.
      (1)   Any single-family residential nonconforming use (which may be a
manufactured or modular home) may be enlarged or replaced with a similar
single-family residential structure of the same size or of a larger size, so
long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or
increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to setback
requirements.
      (2)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a
completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by the UDO, was
manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate the use. However, a
nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land
outside the original building unless specifically authorized in accordance with
§
161.07.
      (3)   A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more
land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a
use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand
pit) may be expanded to the limits of the site plan upon which the mining
permit was granted if 10% or more of the natural materials had already been
removed on the effective date of the UDO.
      (4)   The volume, intensity or frequency of use of property where a
nonconforming use exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used
at a location where a nonconforming use exists may be changed if these or
similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than
changes in kind or use and no violations of other sections of the UDO occur.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 161.05 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Continuance of nonconforming structure. Any nonconforming structure
legally existing at the time of adoption or amendment of the UDO may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
   (B)   Conditions for continuance. Nonconforming structures shall be subject
to the following conditions, in addition to those provided for specific zoning
districts pursuant to
Chapter 154.
      (1)   Nonconforming structures may not be enlarged or altered in any way
which increases its dimensional deficiencies (except as provided in division
(B)(2) below); however, any nonconforming structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its dimensional deficiencies. Any enlargement of the
structure shall conform to the current dimensional requirements.
      (2)   The only exception to division (B)(1) above is for mobile or
manufactured homes, where they may be replaced with a larger manufactured home.
This also means a “singlewide” may be replaced with a “doublewide”.
      (3)   In the event of damage by fire or other causes to the extent
exceeding 50% of its tax value prior to the damage as established by the
Building Inspector, reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be
permitted only in compliance with the dimensional provisions of the UDO.
      (4)   In the event of damage by fire or other causes to the extent
causing less than 50% of its tax value prior to the damage as established by
the Building Inspector, reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be
permitted, provided a building permit is issued within 180 days of the
structure’s destruction, and it is constructed:
         (a)   In the same manner in which it originally existed subject to
compliance with the requirements of the State Building Code; or
         (b)   In compliance with the dimensional requirements.
      (5)   Nonconforming structures shall not be moved or relocated unless it
is made to comply with the dimensional and use requirements of the district in
which it is relocated and with the requirements of the State Building Code.
   (C)   Vacant structure.
      (1)   When a nonconforming structure or any aspect of a structure that is
used in a nonconforming manner is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180
days, or greater than 180 days with good cause, the structure may thereafter be
used only for conforming purposes.
      (2)   When a structure or any aspect of the structure that is made
nonconforming by the UDO is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of the
UDO, the 180-day period as defined in division (C)(1) above begins to run at
the effective date of the UDO.
   (D)   Preservation of safe or lawful conditions. Nothing in the UDO shall
prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe or lawful condition any part
of any building declared unsafe or unlawful by the Building Inspector or other
duly authorized official.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 161.06 MISCELLANEOUS NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   (A)   Nonconforming situation resulting from governmental acquisition. Any
lot reduced in size by municipal, city or state condemnation or purchase of
land shall obtain nonconforming lot or building status to the extent that the
condemnation or purchase causes noncompliance with any provisions of the UDO.
   (B)   Nonconforming parking created by change of use. Whenever a change of
use that does not involve the enlargement of an existing structure is proposed
for a lot on which the parking requirements of the UDO for the proposed new use
cannot be met due to insufficient lot area, the proposed change of use shall
not be regarded as an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming
situation. However, the permit-issuing authority shall require that the parking
requirements be satisfied to the extent possible utilizing the lot area that is
available and may require that satellite parking space be obtained.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 161.07 NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.
   All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180
calendar days before the effective date of the UDO as well as all nonconforming
projects that are at least 10% completed in terms of the total expected cost of
the project on the effective date of the UDO may be completed in accordance
with the terms of their permits, so long as these permits were validly issued
and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to be
completed in stages, this section shall apply only to the particular phase
under construction. In addition, as provided in G.S. § 160D-108, neither the
UDO nor any amendment to it shall, without the consent of the property owner,
affect any lot with respect to which a building permit has been issued pursuant
to G.S. § 160D-1110 prior to the enactment of the Article making the change so
long as the building permit remains valid, unexpired and unrevoked.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)
§ 161.08 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Continuance of nonconforming signs.
      (1)   Signs in existence on the effective date of the UDO which do not
conform to the provisions of the UDO, but which were constructed, erected,
affixed or maintained in compliance with all previous regulations, shall be
regarded as nonconforming signs. Although it is not the intent of the UDO to
encourage the continued use of nonconforming signs, nonconforming signs shall
be allowed to continue and a decision as to the continued existence and use or
removal of the signs shall be controlled as follows:
         (a)   Nonconforming signs shall not be changed to another
nonconforming sign.
         (b)   Nonconforming signs shall not have any changes made in the words
or symbols used or the message displayed on the sign unless the sign is
specifically designed for periodic change of message.
         (c)   Nonconforming signs shall not be structurally altered so as to
change the shape, size, type or design of the sign other than to make the sign
a conforming sign.
         (d)   Nonconforming signs shall not be re-established after the
activity, business or use to which it relates has been discontinued and the
sign shall be removed.
         (e)   Nonconforming signs shall not be re-established and all remains
of the sign must be removed after damage or destruction, if the estimated
expense of repairs exceeds 50% of the estimated total value of the sign at the
time of destruction, as determined by the Building Inspector. If damaged by
less than 50%, but repairs are not made within 90 days of the time the damage
occurred, the nonconforming sign shall not be allowed to continue and must be
removed.
         (f)   Nonconforming signs shall not be relocated unless it is brought
into conformance with the requirements of the UDO.
         (g)   Normal maintenance and repair of a nonconforming sign is
permitted providing the shape, size, type or design of the sign is not altered.
      (2)   Any nonconforming sign that is structurally altered, relocated or
replaced shall immediately be brought into compliance with all the provisions
of the UDO.
      (3)   Any nonconforming sign which: is a menace to the public safety and/
or traffic; has been abandoned; has not been properly maintained, including
cleaning and painting of painted surface areas and replacement of damaged
parts; is not contributing to the aesthetic standards and development of the
city as determined by the Department of Planning and Inspections; has not been
appraised for tax purposes by the County Tax Assessor’s Office; or does not
comply with applicable standards for nonconforming use of land or minor
structure as set forth in this chapter, shall be removed after due notice has
been given by the Zoning Administrator.
   (B)   Violations of nonconforming sign provisions.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) below, the Zoning
Administrator shall order the removal of any sign maintained in violation of
the provisions of this section for which removal procedures are herein
prescribed, accordingly:
         (a)   The Zoning Administrator shall give 90 days written notice to
the owner or lessee to remove the sign or to bring it into compliance with the

after receipt of the written notice has been given, the Zoning Administrator
shall institute removal proceedings according to the procedures specified in
G.S. § 160D-404.
      (2)   Nonconforming fixed subdivision and Nontraditional Lot Development
signs may be removed by the city on approval of the Board of Commissioners
after a written notice recommending the removal is posted on the subject sign
by the Department of Planning and Inspections for a period of seven consecutive
days and a public hearing is held to consider the removal thereof. The written
notice shall describe the sign sufficiently to identify it, recite the
conditions causing the sign to be nonconforming, and state the date and time
(which cannot be prior to expiration of the aforementioned seven-day period)
set for the public hearing thereon.

    Any of the following shall be a violation of the UDO and shall be subject
to the enforcement remedies and penalties provided by this chapter and by state
law.
   (A)   Development without permit. A DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT A PERMIT VIOLATION
means to engage in any development, use, construction, remodeling or other
activities of any nature upon the land or improvements thereon subject to the
jurisdiction of the UDO without required permits, certificates or other forms
of authorization as set forth in the UDO. A “development without a permit
violation” shall result in the assessment of a fee per the city’s Fee Schedule.
   (B)   Development inconsistent with permit. A DEVELOPMENT INCONSISTENT WITH
A PERMIT VIOLATION means to engage in any development, use, construction,
remodeling or other activity of any nature in any way inconsistent with any
approved plan, permit, certificate or other form of authorization granted for
the activity.
   (C)   Violation by act or omission. A VIOLATION BY ACT OR OMISSION means to
violate, by act or omission, any term, variance or waiver, condition or
qualification placed by the Board of Commissioners or its authorized boards and
staff upon any required permit, certificate or other form of authorization for
the use, development or other activity upon land or improvements thereon.
   (D)   Use in violation. A USE IN VIOLATION means to erect, construct,
reconstruct, alter, repair, convert, maintain or use any building or structure
or to use any land in violation or contravention of the UDO, or any other
regulation made under the authority conferred thereby.
   (E)   Subdivide in violation. A SUBDIVIDE IN VIOLATION means to subdivide
land in violation of the UDO or transfer or sell land by reference to,
exhibition of, or any other use of a plat or map showing a subdivision of the
land before the plat or map has been properly approved under the UDO and
recorded in the county office of the Register of Deeds. The description by
metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the
process of selling or transferring land does not exempt the transaction from
violation of the UDO.
   (F)   Continue a violation. Each day’s violation of any provision of the UDO
is a separate and distinct offense.

   It is the intention of the UDO, unless otherwise provided, that all
questions arising in connection with the enforcement of the UDO shall be
presented first to the Zoning Administrator and that the questions shall be
presented to the Board of Adjustment only on appeal from the Zoning
Administrator’s final decision. An appeal from the decision of the Board of
Adjustment shall be by proceedings in the nature of certiorari to the Superior
Court as provided by law pursuant to §
162.07 and must be filed with the County Clerk of Court within the 30-day
appeal period described in §
162.07. It is further the intention of the UDO that the duties of the Board of
Commissioners in connection with the UDO shall not include the hearing and
passing upon disputed questions that may arise in connection with the
enforcement thereof.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 162.03 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
    When the Zoning Administrator or designee discovers a violation of the UDO
or receives a complaint alleging a violation of the UDO, it shall be his or her
duty to attempt to immediately notify the owner and occupant of the land,
building, structure, sign or use of the violation.
   (A)   Notice of Non-Compliance. Upon discovery of the existence of a
violation of the UDO, the Zoning Administrator shall by first-class mail,
telephone, electronic delivery, or personal service attempt to notify the
owner, occupant of the property or holder of the development approval of the
nature of the violation, provide a citation of the section(s) of the ordinance
violated, and describe the measures necessary to remedy the violation. The
Zoning Administrator may also request that the owner or occupant of the
property arrange a meeting with the Planning and Inspections Department staff
to further discuss the violation and options for remedying the violation. Any
recipient of notifications under this section shall not be considered a ‘person
aggrieved’ for appeal purposes.
   (B)   Notice of Violation. If the owner or occupant of the land, building,
sign, structure or use in violation fails to take prompt corrective action, the
Zoning Administrator shall issue a Notice of Violation to the holder of the
development approval, occupant of the property, and the property owner (if not
the older of the development approval).
      (1)   The Notice shall be issued by personal delivery, electronic
delivery, or first-class mail and may be provided by similar means to the
occupant of the property or the person undertaking the work or activity. The
Notice may be posted on the property.
      (2)   The staff member issuing the Notice of Violation shall certify to
the City that the Notice was provided, and the certificate shall be deemed
conclusive in the absence of fraud.
      (3)   The Notice of Violation shall state:
         (a)   The lands, building, sign, structure or use is in violation of
the UDO.
         (b)   The nature of the violation, and citation of the section of the
UDO violated; and
         (c)   The measures necessary to remedy the violation.
   (C)   Appeal. Any owner, occupant or holder of a development approval who
has received a Notice of Non-Compliance and Notice of Violation may appeal, in
writing, as a person aggrieved, the final decision of the Zoning Administrator
to the Board of Adjustment, in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 159 within 30 days following the date of receipt or posting of the
Notice of Non-Compliance and Notice of Violation. The Board of Adjustment shall
hear an appeal within a reasonable time, and it may affirm, modify or revoke
the Notice of Non-Compliance and Notice of Violation. In the absence of an
appeal, the remedies and penalties sought by the Zoning Administrator in the
Notice of Non-Compliance and Notice of Violation shall be final.
   (D)   Stop Work Orders.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator may issue a Stop Work Order whenever any
work or activity subject to UDO regulations is undertaken in substantial
violation of any State law or local ordinance, or in a manner that endangers
life or property. The order shall identify the specific part of the work or
activity that is in violation or presents such a hazard and order the work be
stopped. The Stop Work Order shall:
         (a)   Be in writing and directed to the person doing the work or
activity;
         (b)   Identify:
            1.   The specific work or activity to be stopped;
            2.   The reasons therefor; and
            3.   The conditions under which the work or activity may be
resumed.
      (2)   A copy of the order shall be delivered to the holder of the
development approval and to the owner of the property involved by personal
delivery, electronic delivery, or first-class mail.
         (a)   The staff member(s) delivering the stop work order shall certify
to the City that the order was delivered and the certificate shall be deemed
conclusive in the absence of fraud.
         (b)   The Stop Work Order may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment
as pursuant to §
159.01
         (c)   No further work or activity shall take place in violation of a
Stop Work Order pending a ruling on the appeal. Violation of a Stop Work Order
shall be enforced by any one or all of the procedures identified in §
162.04.
   (E)   Order of corrective action by the Board of Adjustment. If, upon a
hearing held pursuant to an appeal as prescribed above, the Board of Adjustment
shall find that the owner or occupant is in violation of the UDO, the Board of
Adjustment shall issue an order in writing to the owner or occupant affirming
the violation and ordering compliance.
   (F)   Failure to comply with an order. If the owner or occupant of a
property fails to comply with a Notice of Non-Compliance and Notice of
Violation from which no appeal has been taken, or an Order of Corrective Action
following an appeal, the owner or occupant shall be subject to such remedies
and penalties as may be provided for by the General Statutes and §
162.04. If the owner or occupant fails to comply with the remedies and
penalties prescribed, enforcement shall be sought through an order of a court
of competent jurisdiction.
   (G)   Emergency, dangerous or hazardous situations. In the event that the
Zoning Administrator determines that a violation creates an immediatehazard to
the public safety, health or welfare, the standard notice requirements
delineated in division (A) above may be waived. The Zoning Administrator is
authorized to make a reasonable attempt to notify the person responsible for
the violation, property owner, or other person that has an identifiable
relationship to the violation and/or property owner and to order the immediate
remedying of the violation. In the case of a safety hazard created by a sign or
sign structure, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to immediately remove
such sign or sign structure, at the expense of the property owner. In the case
of a safety hazard created by the use or occupancy of a building or land, the
Zoning Administrator shall consult with the city attorney for guidance
concerning immediate enforcement actions.

§ 162.04 PENALTIES AND REMEDIES.
   As authorized by G.S. §§ 160A-365, 160A-375, 160A-175 and 14-4, any one or
all of the following procedures may be used to enforce the provisions of the
UDO.
   (A)   Injunction. Any violation of the UDO or of any condition, order or
requirement, or remedy adopted pursuant hereto may be restrained, corrected,
abated, mandated or enjoined by other appropriate proceeding pursuant to state
law.
   (B)   Civil penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of the UDO
shall be subject to the assessment of a civil penalty under the procedures
provided in §
162.05.
   (C)   Denial of permit or certificate. The Zoning Administrator may withhold
or deny any permit, certificate, occupancy or other form of authorization on
any land, building, sign, structure or use in which there is an uncorrected
violation of a provision of the UDO or of a condition or qualification of a
permit, certificate or other authorization previously granted.
   (D)   Conditional approval. The Zoning Administrator may condition the
authorization of any permit or certificate upon the correction of the
deficiency, payment of civil penalties within a specified time, or the posting
of a compliance security approved by the city attorney.
   (E)   Revocation of permits. In accordance with §
162.06, permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved applications, plans or specifications; refusal or failure to comply
with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or
misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in
violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked.
   (F)   Other penalties. Any violation of the UDO shall result in a fine as
specified in the City Schedule.
   (G)   State and common law remedies. In addition to other enforcement
provisions contained in the UDO, the Board of Commissioners may exercise any
and all enforcement powers granted to it by state law or common law.
   (H)   Penalties for transferring lots in unapproved subdivisions. In
accordance with the provisions of G.S. § 160D-807, any person who, being the
owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the planning and zoning
jurisdiction of the city, subdivides his or her land in violation of the
requirements of the UDO or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition
of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the
plat has been properly approved under the provisions of the UDO and recorded in
the office of the appropriate Register of Deeds, shall be subject to the
penalties set forth herein. The description by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or
transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from these penalties. The
city may bring an action for injunction of any illegal subdivision, transfer,
conveyance, or sale of land, and the court shall, upon appropriate findings,
issue an injunction and order requiring the offending party to comply with the
provisions of the UDO. Building permits required pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1110
may be denied for lots that have been illegally subdivided. In addition to
other remedies, the city may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to
prevent the unlawful subdivision of land, to restrain, correct or abate the
violation, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct. The provisions of this
section shall not, however, prohibit any owner or its agent from entering into
contracts to sell or lease by reference to an approved preliminary plat for
which a final plat has not yet been properly approved or recorded with the
Register of Deeds, provided that the contract does all of the following:
      (1)   Incorporates as an attachment a copy of the preliminary plat
referenced in the contract and obligates the owner to deliver to the buyer a
copy of the recorded plat prior to closing and conveyance;
      (2)   Plainly and conspicuously notifies the prospective buyer or lessee
that a final subdivision plat has not been approved or recorded at the time of
the contract, that no governmental body will incur any obligation to the
prospective buyer or lessee with respect to the approval of the final
subdivision plat, that changes between the preliminary and final plats are
possible, and that the contract or lease may be terminated without breach by
the buyer or lessee if the final recorded plat differs in any material respect
from the preliminary plat;
      (3)   Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat does not
differ in any material respect from the plat referred to in the contract, the
buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any
earlier than five days after the delivery of a copy of the final recorded plat;
and
      (4)   Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat differs in
any material respect from the preliminary plat referred to in the contract, the
buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any
earlier than 15 days after the delivery of the final recorded plat, during
which 15-day period the buyer or lessee may terminate the contract without
breach or any further obligation and may receive a refund of all earnest money
or prepaid purchase price. The provisions of this section also shall not
prohibit any owner or its agent from entering into contracts to sell or lease
land by reference to an approved preliminary plat for which a final plat has
not been properly approved under these regulations or recorded with the
Register of Deeds where the buyer or lessee is any person who has contracted to
acquire or lease the land for the purpose of engaging in the business of
construction of residential, commercial or industrial buildings on the land, or
for the purpose of resale or lease of the land to persons engaged in that kind
of business, provided that no conveyance of that land may occur and no contract
to lease it may become effective until after the final plat has been properly
approved under the UDO and recorded with the Register of Deeds.

   (A)   Penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of the UDO shall be
subject to assessment of the maximum civil penalty allowed by law, as specified
in the City Fee Schedule.
   (B)   Notice. No civil penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to
be in violation has been notified of the violation in accordance with §
162.03(A). If after receiving a notice of violation under §
162.03(A), the owner or other violator fails to take corrective action, a civil
penalty may be imposed under this section in the form of a citation. The
citation shall be served in the manner of a Notice of Violation. The citation
shall state the nature of the violation, the civil penalty to be imposed upon
the violator and shall direct the violator to pay the civil penalty within 15
days of the date of the notice.
   (C)   Responsible parties. The owner or occupant of any land, building,
structure, sign or use of land or part thereof and any architect, builder,
contractor, agent or any other person who participates or acts in concert,
assists, directs, creates or maintains any condition that is in violation of
the requirements of the UDO may be held responsible for the violation and
subject to the civil penalties and remedies herein provided.
   (D)   Continuing violation. For each day the violation is not corrected, the
violator will be guilty of an additional and separate offense and subject to
additional civil penalty.
   (E)   Demand for payment. The Zoning Administrator shall make written demand
for payment upon the property owner or the person in violation, and shall set
forth in detail a description of the violation for which the civil penalty has
been imposed.
   (F)   Nonpayment. If payment is not received or equitable settlement reached
within 30 days, after demand for payment is made, the matter shall be referred
to legal counsel for institution of a civil action in the appropriate division
of the General Courts of Justice for recovery of the civil penalty. Provided
however, if the civil penalty is not paid within the time prescribed, the
Zoning Administrator may have a criminal summons or warrant issued against the
violator. Nothing herein shall preclude the Zoning Administrator from
exercising other enforcement rights simultaneously.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)
§ 162.06 PERMIT REVOCATION.
   (A)   General. A zoning, sign or special use permit may be revoked by the
permit-issuing authority (in accordance with the provisions of this section) if
the permit recipient fails to develop or maintain the property in accordance
with the approved plans, the requirements of the UDO, or any additional
requirements lawfully imposed by the permit-issuing authority. No person may
continue to make use of land or buildings in the manner authorized by any
zoning, sign or special use permit after the permit has been revoked in
accordance with this section.
   (B)   Special use permit revocation. Before a special use permit may be
revoked, all of the notice and hearing requirements of
Chapter 153 shall be complied with. The notice shall inform the permit
recipient of the alleged grounds for the revocation.
   (C)   Zoning or sign permit revocation. Before a zoning or sign permit may
be revoked, the Zoning Administrator shall give the permit recipient ten days
notice of intent to revoke the permit and shall inform the recipient of the
alleged reasons for the revocation and of his or her right to obtain an
informal hearing on the allegations. If the permit is revoked, the Zoning
Administrator shall provide to the permittee a written statement of the
decision and the reasons therefore.
(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)

upon all petitioners within three days after it is filed with the court.
   (J)   Hearing on the record. The court shall hear and decide all issues
raised by the petition by reviewing the record submitted in accordance with
division (I) above. Except that the court shall allow the record to be
supplemented with affidavits, testimony of witnesses, or documentary or other
evidence if, and to the extent that, the petition raises any of the following
issues, in which case the rules of discovery set forth in the North Carolina
Rules of Civil Procedure apply to the supplementation of the record of these
issues:
      (1)   Whether a petitioner or intervener has standing;
      (2)   Whether, as a result of impermissible conflict as described in G.S.
§ 160D-109, or
Chapter 153 of the UDO, the decision-making body was not sufficiently impartial
to comply with due process principles; and
      (3)   Whether the decision-making body erred for the reasons set forth in
divisions (K)(1)(a) and (b) below.
   (K)   Scope of review.
      (1)   When reviewing the decision of a decision-making board under the
provisions of this section, the court shall ensure that the rights of
petitioners have not been prejudiced because the decision-making body’s
findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions were:
         (a)   In violation of constitutional provisions, including those
protecting procedural due process rights;
         (b)   In excess of the statutory authority conferred upon the city or
the authority conferred upon the decision-making board by ordinance;
         (c)   Inconsistent with applicable procedures specified by statute or
ordinance;
         (d)   Affected by other error of law;
         (e)   Unsupported by substantial competent evidence in view of the
entire record; or
         (f)   Arbitrary or capricious.
      (2)   When the issue before the court is whether the decision-making
board erred in interpreting an ordinance, the court shall review that issue de
novo. The court shall consider the interpretation of the decision-making board,
but is not bound by that interpretation, and may freely substitute its judgment
as appropriate.
      (3)   The term COMPETENT EVIDENCE as used in this section, shall not
preclude reliance by the decision-making board on evidence that would not be
admissible under the rules of evidence as applied in the trial division of the
General Court of Justice if: the evidence was admitted without objection; or
the evidence appears to be sufficiently trustworthy and was admitted under
circumstances that it was reasonable for the decision-making board to rely upon
it. The term COMPETENT EVIDENCE as used in this section, shall not be deemed to
include the opinion testimony of lay witnesses as to any of the following:
         (a)   The use of property in a particular way would affect the value
of other property;
         (b)   The increase in vehicular traffic resulting from a proposed
development would pose a danger to the public safety; and/or
         (c)   Matters about which only expert testimony would generally be
admissible under the rules of evidence.
   (L)   Decision of the court. Following its review of the decision-making
board in accordance with division (K) above, the court may affirm the decision,
reverse the decision and remand the case with appropriate instructions, or
remand the case for further proceedings. If the court does not affirm the
decision below in its entirety, then the court shall be guided by the following
in determining what relief should be granted to the petitioners:
      (1)   If the court concludes that the error committed by the decision-
making board is procedural only, the court may remand the case for further
proceedings to correct the procedural error.
      (2)   If the court concludes that the decision-making board has erred by
failing to make findings of fact such that the court cannot properly perform
its function, then the court may remand the case with appropriate instructions
so long as the record contains substantial competent evidence that could
support the decision below with appropriate findings of fact. However, findings
of fact are not necessary when the record sufficiently reveals the basis for
the decision below or when the material facts are undisputed and the case
presents only an issue of law.
      (3)   If the court concludes that the decision by the decision-making
board is not supported by substantial competent evidence in the record or is
based upon an error of law, then the court may remand the case with an order
that directs the decision-making board to take whatever action should have been
taken had the error not been committed or to take such other action as is
necessary to correct the error. Specifically:
         (a)   If the court concludes that a permit was wrongfully denied
because the denial was not based on substantial competent evidence or was
otherwise based on an error of law, the court may remand with instructions that
the permit be issued, subject to reasonable and appropriate conditions; and
         (b)   If the court concludes that a permit was wrongfully issued
because the issuance was not based on substantial competent evidence or was
otherwise based on an error of law, the court may remand with instructions that
the permit be revoked.
   (M)   Ancillary injunctive relief. Upon motion of a party to a proceeding
under this section, and under appropriate circumstances, the court may issue an
injunctive order requiring any other party to that proceeding to take certain
action or refrain from taking action that is consistent with the court’s
decision on the merits of the appeal. (2009 421, s. 1(a).)

§ 163.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this UDO, the following definitions shall apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCELERATED EROSION. Any increase over the rate of natural erosion as a
result of land-disturbing activities.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use that: is clearly incidental to and customarily found in
connection with a principal use; is subordinate to and serves a principal use;

industry in the principal use served; and is located on the same lot as the
principal use served except as may be specifically provided for elsewhere in
the UDO.
   ACCESSORY BUILDINGS, ATTACHED. An accessory building is considered attached
to a principal building, and thus is subject to the dimensional requirements
that apply to the principal building, when sharing a common structural wall.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure, which is located
on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which
is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Garages, carports and
