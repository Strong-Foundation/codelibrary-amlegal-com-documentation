notice must also include arrangements for holding the recall election in
accordance with general law. The recall election shall be conducted, returned,
and the results declared as in other elections in Iredell County.
(c)   The question of recalling the Mayor or any number of the Town Council
members may be submitted at the same election, provided that a separate
petition is filed and there is an entirely separate question on the ballot for
each Town Council member and the Mayor.

proposition:

The recall of [name and title of the Mayor or Town Council member].”

Mayor or Town Council member are for recall, the Mayor or Town Council member
shall continue in office for the remainder of the unexpired term. If a majority
of votes are for the recall of the Mayor or Town Council member designated on

office and a vacancy shall be declared on the date the Iredell County Board of
Elections certifies the results of the recall election. The vacancy shall be
filled as provided in G.S. 160A-63. The Mayor or Town Council member removed

Mayor or Town Council member.

CROSS-CONNECTION AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION
§ 51.20 INTENT, PURPOSE, AND CONTROL.
   (A)   It is the intent of this subchapter to recognize that there are
varying degrees of hazard to potable water within the water main and water
supply systems. It is also the intent to apply the principle that the degree of
protection should be commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   (B)   The purpose of this subchapter is to:
      (1)   Protect the public potable water supply of the town against actual
or potential cross-connections, backflow, and backsiphonage by isolating within
the premises of private property contamination or pollution that has occurred
or may occur because of some undiscovered or unauthorized cross-connection on
the premises of private property;
      (2)   Eliminate cross-connections, backflow, and backsiphonage of any
other source of water or process water used for any purpose whatsoever which
may jeopardize the safety of the public potable water supply of the town; and
      (3)   Establish a cross-connection, backflow, and backsiphonage control
program.
   (C)   Cross-connection, backflow, and backsiphonage control requires
cooperation between the town and the consumer. The responsibilities and duties
of each shall be as set forth in this policy and other applicable regulations.
(Prior Code, § 28-504) (Ord. 05-03, passed 6-12-2003)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the town,
hereafter referred to as the “town,” and enables the town to comply with all
applicable state and federal laws including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§
1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 C.F.R. part 403).
The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge; (See 15A NCAC 2H.0900 et seq.)
      (2)   Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   Promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the municipal system;
      (4)   Protect both municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage,
sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as to protect
the general public;
      (5)   Provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance, and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and
      (6)   Ensure that the town complies with its NPDES or non-discharge
permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal
or state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject.
   (B)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the town wastewater system through the issuance of permits to
certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for
the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires
user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
   (C)   (1)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the town’s wastewater
system, as authorized by G.S. § 160A-312 and/or G.S. § 153A-275. The Mayor or
Town Manager shall designate an administrator of the POTW and pretreatment
program, hereafter referred to as the POTW Director. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the POTW Director shall administer, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Any powers granted to or imposed upon the POTW Director may be
delegated by the POTW Director to other town personnel. By discharging
wastewater into the town wastewater system, industrial users located outside
the town limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions established in
this chapter as well as any permits, enforcement actions, or orders issued
hereunder.

52.004 within the time limitations as specified by the EPA, the state, or the
POTW Director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained continuously and
efficiently at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the town for review
and shall be approved by the POTW Director before construction of the facility.
The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the
user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce
an effluent acceptable to the town under the provisions herein. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be approved by the POTW Director prior to the user’s initiation of the
changes.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the POTW Director may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of chapter.
      (2)   The POTW Director may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. In order to
promote equalization of flows over a 24-hour period, each person discharging a
waste into the town’s sanitary sewers having the following average daily
volumes over a period of his or her normal processing period in any one week
shall construct and maintain, at his or her own expense, a suitable storage
facility of the corresponding minimum volumes:

                                            discharged)
Volume of Waste Discharged (average gallons Minimum Volume of Storage Tank (in
per day)                                    percentage of daily volume of waste
                                            discharged)
0 to 20,000                                 0
20,001 to 30,000                            50
30,001 to 40,000                            60
40,001 to 50,000                            70
50,001 to 60,000                            80
60,001 to 70,000                            90
70,001 and above                            100
 
      (3)   The storage facility shall have its outlet to the sewer controlled
by an approved device, the setting of flow rates being as directed by the POTW
Director. When the processing period is less than seven days in any week, the
person discharging the waste shall arrange the discharge rate so that his or
her storage facility shall be substantially full at the end of his or her
processing period. The storage facility shall be discharged during the period
of shutdown unless otherwise directed by the POTW Director. Storage facility
requirements may be waived by the POTW Director in cases where a constant rate
of flow is discharged provided:
         (a)   The normal operating day extends over a 24-hour period, and the
rate of waste flow and load discharged is such that, in the opinion of the
approving authority, the installation of a storage tank would not improve sewer
and treatment plant loading conditions; and
         (b)   All other requirements of this chapter are fulfilled.
      (4)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the POTW Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, sand, or flammable
wastes; except, such interceptors shall not be required for residential users.
All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the POTW
Director and shall be so located as to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired
regularly, as needed or deemed necessary by the POTW Director, by the user at
his or her expense.
      (5)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas-detection meter.

      (1)   The user charge shall reflect, at least, the cost of debt service,
operation, and maintenance (including replacement) of the POTW.
      (2)   Each user shall pay its proportionate cost based on volume of flow,
concentration of wastewater, and percentage of maximum allowable headworks
loading.
      (3)   The Town Manager shall review annually the sewage contributions of
users, the total costs of debt service, operation, and maintenance of the POTW
and will make recommendations to the Town Council for adjustments in the
schedule of charges and fees as necessary.
      (4)   Charges for flow to the POTW not directly attributable to the
users, including all extraneous flows (infiltration, inflow, and the like),
shall be distributed among all users of the POTW based upon the volume of flow
of the users.
(Prior Code, § 28-198) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.047 SURCHARGES.
   The amount of the surcharges will be based upon the following.
   (A)   The volume of flow used in determining the total discharge of
wastewater for payment of user charges and surcharges shall be based on the
following:
      (1)   Metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter readings
maintained by the town;
      (2)   If required by the town or at the individual discharger’s option,
other flow-monitoring devices which measure the actual volume of wastewater
discharged to the sewer. Such devices shall be accessible and safely located,
and the measuring system shall be installed in accordance with plans approved
by the town. The metering system shall be installed and maintained at the
user’s expense according to arrangements that may be made with the town;
      (3)   Where any user procures all or part of his or her water supply from
sources other than the town, the user shall install and maintain, at his or her
own expense, a flow-measuring device of a type approved by the town; and
      (4)   If a person discharging wastes into the sanitary sewer system
produces evidence to the Director that more than 10% of the total annual volume
of water used for all purposes does not reach the town sanitary sewer, an
estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges
may be agreed upon between the Director and the person discharging industrial
wastes into the sewer.
   (B)   The determination of the character and concentration of the
constituents of the wastewater used in determining surcharges shall be
collected in such a manner as to be representative of the actual discharge and
shall be analyzed using procedures set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 136.
   (C)   The determination of the character and concentration of the
constituents of the wastewater discharge by the POTW Director or his or her
duly appointed representatives shall be binding as a basis for charges.
   (D)   Users discharging industrial wastewater into the sanitary sewer shall
pay a surcharge amounting to the costs enumerated in division (E) below for
treating all wastewater having a COD in excess of 700 ppm, a suspended solids
concentration in excess of 300 ppm, or an NH3 in excess of 15 ppm by weight.
This surcharge shall be in addition to any existing sewer service charge and is
based on the quarterly monitoring sample.
   (E)   The surcharge shall be computed as follows: When the concentration of
COD, suspended solids, or NH3 in the industrial waste discharged to the town’s
sanitary sewers exceeds the prescribed limits, a monthly surcharge shall be
imposed upon the offending industrial user’s sewage flow when the excess is
calculated using the industrial plant water flow and the difference between the
actual COD, suspended solids, or NH3 concentration and the permissible limits
of 700 mg/l, 300 mg/l, and 15 mg/l respectively.
      (1)   (a)   The sewer surcharge shall be established by the town at a
regular Council meeting in November for the following calendar year. This
surcharge shall be invoked, as herein provided, in addition to the existing
regular sewer service charge. The sewer surcharge shall be applied beginning
with the December utility billing and during subsequent months during the
calendar year. The surcharge shall reflect the total cost of treating the
excess pounds of industrial waste including necessary cost of administration of
the sewage plant and this chapter.
         (b)   In addition, each industrial user affected by the surcharge
shall submit to the POTW Director a current list of raw chemicals and other
materials used in their manufacturing process. The method used to determine the
surcharge amount shall consist of dividing the total treatment plant, which is
affected by COD, SS, or NH3 (including the applicable administrative and plant
debt service), for the preceding fiscal year by the total treatment plant
design poundage of COD, suspended solids, or ammonia. The POTW Director shall
make a report to the Council each quarter of all activities conducted
hereunder.
      (2)   (a)   The surcharge shall be billed and payable monthly on a
separate bill rendered to the proper users by the Town Water Department. Said
bills will be sent through the United States mail notifying all users of the
amount and date due. Failure to receive notice is not an excuse for nonpayment
of bills. Users not having paid their bills within 15 days of date of billing
will be delinquent. Notice shall be sent to them through the United States
mails.
         (b)   If after ten days’ notice, given as above, a bill remains
unpaid, the water connection serving the premises will be severed and will not
be turned on again until said bill is paid. In case a user discharging wastes
into the town sanitary sewer system does not procure his or her water supply
from the town and becomes delinquent in his or her payment of the aforesaid
surcharge, his or her connection with the town sewer system will be severed and
will only be reconnected at his or her expense.
      (3)   (a)   Surcharge bills for a user having a private water supply
remaining unpaid within 30 days of the date of billing shall be delinquent.
         (b)   A notice shall be mailed to the user informing him or her of the
delinquent status of his or her account, and if, after five days from the date
of mailing, the notice of the bill remains unpaid, the user’s connection with
the wastewater treatment system will be severed and will only be reconnected at
the user’s expense and upon payment of all charges due.
         (c)   Upon the severing of the connection with the sanitary sewer, the
Director shall notify the State Division of Water Quality of his or her action
and the resulting possibility of a discharge to the surface waters of the
state.
      (4)   All applications for the discharge of industrial wastes into the
public sewers shall be made to the POTW Director. Approval will be granted to
such applications when evidence is submitted by the applicant that the
discharge of wastes into the public sewer will comply with this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 28-199) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.048 PRETREATMENT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION CHARGES.
   (A)   (1)   Total costs incident to the supervision, inspection, and
sampling of wastes shall be included in the charge made to industries or
businesses discharging wastes into the town’s sanitary sewers.
      (2)   Industries subject to the pretreatment program shall pay applicable
permit application fees and annual permit fees, as approved by the Town
Council. Industries subject to the pretreatment program shall pay for any
analyses which are performed by private laboratories.
   (B)   The schedule of charges and fees may include charges and fees for:
      (1)   Reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the pretreatment
program;

   (A)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the POTW
Director a report containing the information described in §
52.075(B)(4) through (B)(6).
   (B)   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c), this
report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production
rate.
   (C)   For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or
other measure of operation), this report shall include the user’s actual
production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must
be signed and certified in accordance with §
52.061(B)(3).
(Prior Code, § 28-256) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)

   (A)   In the case of any discharge (including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges; discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature; a non-
customary batch discharge; or a slug load) that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW Director
of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken
by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the POTW Director, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this subchapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
(Prior Code, § 28-259) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.081 REPORTS OF UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the POTW Director, as the POTW Director may require.
(Prior Code, § 28-260) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.082 NOTICE OF VIOLATIONS.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the POTW Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the POTW Director within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation. The user is not required to resample if the POTW Director monitors
at the user’s facility at least once a month or if the POTW Director samples
between the user’s initial sampling and when the user receives the results of
this sampling.
(Prior Code, § 28-261) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.083 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail

notified of a longer retention period by the POTW Director.
(Prior Code, § 28-266) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.095 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The town requires the user to provide and operate, at the user’s own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The control
manhole shall be equipped with a permanent-type volume-measuring device such as
a nozzle or other device approved by the POTW Director. The facility, sampling,
and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe, accessible,
and proper operating condition at all times at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the requirements and
approval of the town and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the town.
   (D)   When more than one user discharges into a common sanitary sewer, the
Director may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each
user. When there is a significant difference in constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the Director
may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate
discharge.
(Prior Code, § 28-296) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.096 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   (1)   The town will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the town, approval authority, and EPA or its
representative ready access, at all reasonable times, to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, and
copying or in the performance of any of their duties.
      (2)   The town approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations.
      (3)   Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town, approval
authority, and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the POTW Director/
Superintendent’s, approval authority’s, or EPA’s access to the user’s premises
shall be a violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial
of access.
   (B)   Compliance determinations may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite
samples may be taken over a 24-hour period or over a longer or shorter time
span, as determined necessary by the Director, to meet the needs of specific
circumstances.
(Prior Code, § 28-297) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.097 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   The POTW Director, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the Twenty-Second District Judicial Court if the POTW Director,
approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or
property or any part thereof and:
   (A)   Is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter;
   (B)   There is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder; or
   (C)   To protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community.
(Prior Code, § 28-298) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.098 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits, monitoring programs, and from inspections shall
be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the POTW Director/Superintendent, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be
asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available, upon
written request, to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the
national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, non-discharge
permit, and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, such portions of a
report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial
review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
   (C)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall
be made available to officials of the approval authority and EPA upon request.
(Prior Code, § 28-299) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.099 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW Director finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, wastewater permit,
or any prohibition, limitation, or requirements contained therein or any other
pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 15 days from the
date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the town by the user.
Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to division (D) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this chapter, or is in
noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW Director
determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be
made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §
52.999 nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director/Superintendent
under this section subject to an administrative appeal under §
52.061(B)(8).
   (D)   Administrative orders. When the POTW Director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter, permits or orders
issued herein, or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may
issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons
in noncompliance to do any of the following:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
the order;
      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation; and/or
      (4)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/
or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW, or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the POTW Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary
(including immediate severance of the sewer connection) to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW Director
shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon
proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user
shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the
POTW Director prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit. Any user who violates the following conditions
of this chapter or applicable state and federal regulations is subject to
having its permit terminated:
      (1)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his or her discharge;
      (2)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
   (G)   Noncompliance. Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the
proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an
opportunity to show cause, under § 52.093(A), why the proposed action should
not be taken.
(Prior Code, § 28-327) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.100 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Remedies, in addition to those previously mentioned herein, are
available to the POTW Director who may use any single one or combination
against a noncompliant user.
   (B)   Additional available remedies include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Criminal violations. The District Attorney for Judicial District 22
may, at the request of the town, prosecute noncompliant users who violate the
provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B. Under state law, it is a crime to negligently
violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit or
negligently fail to apply for a pretreatment permit issued by local governments
(G.S. § 143-215.6B(f)); to knowingly and willfully violate any term, condition,
or requirement of a pretreatment permit or knowingly and willfully fail to
apply for a pretreatment permit issued by local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B
(g)); to knowingly violate any term, condition, or requirement of a
pretreatment permit issued by local governments or knowingly fail to apply for
a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that a person is placed in imminent
danger of death or serious bodily injury (G.S. § 143-215.6B(h)); and to falsify
information required under G.S. Chapter 143, Article 21 (G.S. 143-215.6B(i)).
      (2)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user is in violation of the
provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, the POTW
Director, through the Town Attorney, may petition the Superior Court of Justice
for the issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent
injunction which restrains or compels the activities in question.
      (3)   Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user is in violation
of the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, water
service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence,
at the user’s expense, after he or she has satisfactorily demonstrated ability
to comply.
      (4)   Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent
limitations of this chapter or of a permit or order issued hereunder is hereby
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the
POTW Director. Any person creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions of the appropriate ordinances of the town governing such nuisances
including reimbursing the POTW for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or
remedying said nuisance.

§ 52.101 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this subchapter are not exclusive. The POTW
Director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the enforcement response plan of the town. However, the POTW
Director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the POTW Director is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user.
(Prior Code, § 28-330) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.102 ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF NONCOMPLIANCE.
   At least annually, the POTW Director shall publish in the largest daily
newspaper circulated in the service area, a list of those industrial users
which were found to be in significant noncompliance, also referred to as
reportable noncompliance in 15A NCAC 2H.0903(b)(31), with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements during the previous 12 months.
(Prior Code, § 28-331) (Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.103 DEFENSES TO VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (A)(2) below are met.
      (2)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or
other relevant evidence, that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW
Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset; if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (3)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (4)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (5)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Prior Code, § 28-356)
   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards defense.
      (1)   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
52.004(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
52.004(B)(2), (B)(3), (B)(5) through (B)(7), and (B)(9) through (B)(23) if it
can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone
or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through
or interference and that either:
         (a)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass-through
or interference; or
         (b)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit and, in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
      (2)   Pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(a)(2), the affirmative defense
outlined in this section cannot apply to the specific prohibitions in §
52.004(B)(1), (B)(4), and (B)(8).
(Prior Code, § 28-357)
(Ord. 11-00, passed 9-7-2000)
§ 52.104 BYPASS.
   (A)   Allowable bypass conditions. A user may allow any bypass to occur
which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of divisions (B) and (C) below.
   (B)   User requests for bypass submission.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the user shall
submit prior notice to the POTW Director/Superintendent at least ten days
before the date of the bypass if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time he, she, or it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of this time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain:
         (a)   A description of the bypass and its cause;
         (b)   The duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and
         (c)   Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass.
      (3)   The POTW Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case
basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   Bypass prohibition; exceptions.
      (1)   A bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director/Superintendent may
take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed, in the

determined to have been activated by adverse weather conditions, a failure in
the electrical power to the alarm, or other conditions beyond the control of
the alarm user.
      (2)   An alarm is false within the meaning of this chapter when, upon
inspection by the Troutman Police Department, evidence indicates that no

any such incident shall be $50 for all such responses after the two initial
responses.

alarm system when notified by the Troutman Police Department or an alarm
answering service that such alarm has been activated. When an alarm sounds

the alarm, every subsequent 30-minute period or portion thereof that such alarm
continues to sound shall be considered a separate false alarm. The alarm user
shall reimburse the town for police services for false alarms under this
division (E) at a flat rate of $25 for each false alarm resulting from the

   (A)   If, after the notice and hearing, the Enforcement Officer determines
that the dwelling under consideration is unfit for human habitation in
accordance with the standards set forth in §
150.21, he or she shall state, in writing, his or her findings of fact in
support of that determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the
owner thereof an order:
      (1)   If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling can be
made at a cost of less than 50% of the value of the dwelling requiring the
owner within the time specified, to repair, alter, or improve the dwelling in
order to render it fit for human habitation or to vacate and close the dwelling
as a human habitation, based upon the Enforcement Officer’s standards for
closing dwellings; or
      (2)   If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling cannot be
made at a cost of less than 50% of the value of the dwelling requiring the
owner within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve the
dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation or to remove or
demolish such dwelling.
   (B)   Whenever a determination is made pursuant to this subchapter that a
dwelling must be vacated and closed or removed or demolished, under the
provisions of this section, notice of the order shall be given by first-class

organization that has filed a written request for such notices may raise the
issue of failure to mail such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order
requiring the Enforcement Officer to wait 45 days before causing removal or
demolition.

§ 150.23 FAILURE TO COMPLY.
   (A)   (1)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or
improve or to vacate and close the dwelling, the Enforcement Officer may:
         (a)   Cause the dwelling to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be
vacated and closed; and/or
         (b)   Cause to be posted on the main entrance of any such dwelling, a
placard with the following words: “This building is unfit for human habitation;
the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and
unlawful.”
      (2)   Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a violation of
this subchapter.
   (B)   (1)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or
improve or remove or demolish the dwelling, the Enforcement Officer may:
         (a)   Cause such dwelling to be vacated and removed or demolished;
and/or
         (b)   Cause to be posted on the main entrance of any such dwelling, a
placard with the following words: “This building is unfit for human habitation;
the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and
unlawful.”
      (2)   Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a violation of
this subchapter.
   (C)   The duties of the Enforcement Officer set forth in divisions (A) and
(B) above shall not be exercised until the Town Council shall have, by
ordinance, ordered the Enforcement Officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose
of this subchapter with respect to the particular property or properties which
the Enforcement Officer shall have found to be unfit for human habitation and
which property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. No such
ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a dwelling unit until the
owner has first been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity
with the Housing Code. For the purposes of this division (C), a period of 90
days following the date of the Enforcement Officer’s order shall constitute a
reasonable opportunity. The ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the
Register of Deeds in the county wherein the property or properties are located
and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index.
   (D)   The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations, or improvements;
vacating and closing; or removal or demolition by the Enforcement Officer shall
be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred, which
lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected as the lien for
special assessment provided in G.S. §§ 160A-216 et seq. If the dwelling is
removed or demolished by the Enforcement Officer, he or she shall sell the
materials of the dwelling, and any personal property, fixture, or appurtenances
found in or attached to the dwelling and shall credit the proceeds of the sale
against the cost of the removal or demolition; any balance remaining shall be
deposited in the Superior Court by the Enforcement Officer, shall be secured in
a manner directed by the Court, and shall be disbursed by the Court to the
persons found to be entitled thereto by final order of the decree of the Court.
   (E)   (1)   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a
dwelling, the Enforcement Officer may file a civil action in the name of the
town to remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the
nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint
naming, as parties-defendant, any persons occupying such dwelling. The Clerk of
Superior Court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a
Magistrate at a certain time, date, and place not to exceed ten days from the
issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint
shall be served as provided in G.S. § 42-29.
      (2)   The summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its
return it appears to have been duly served and if at the hearing the
Enforcement Officer produces the certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the
Town Council pursuant to division (C) above authorizing the Enforcement Officer
to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the Magistrate shall enter judgment
ordering that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The
judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be enforced in the same
manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under G.S. § 42-30. An
appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the Magistrate may be taken as
provided in G.S. § 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be stayed as
provided in G.S. § 7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is
a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment
proceeding pursuant to this division (E) unless such occupant was served with
notice at least 30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding
that the Town Council has ordered the Enforcement Officer to proceed to
exercise his or her duties under divisions (A) through (C) above to vacate and
close or remove and demolish the dwelling.
   (F)   If the Town Council shall have adopted an ordinance or the Enforcement
Officer shall have issued an order ordering a dwelling to be repaired or
vacated and closed, as provided in §
150.22 and this section, and if the owner has vacated and closed such dwelling
and kept such dwelling vacated and closed for a period of one year pursuant to
the ordinance or order, then (if the Town Council shall find that the owner has
abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the dwelling in
order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the
dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health,
safety, morals, and welfare of the town in that the dwelling would continue to
deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to
children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities,
would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in
the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might
otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent
and affordable housing in the town), in such circumstances, the Town Council
may, after the expiration of such one-year period, enact an ordinance and serve
such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following.
      (1)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then-
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
      (2)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the
then-current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days. The ordinance shall be
recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds in the county wherein the
property is located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in
the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with the ordinance, the
Enforcement Officer shall effect the purpose of the ordinance.

§ 150.24 SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)   Complaints or orders issued by the Enforcement Officer pursuant to an
ordinance adopted under this subchapter, except those being prosecuted under
this code, shall be served upon persons either personally or by registered or
certified mail. When service is made by registered or certified mail, a copy of
the complaint or order may also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be
deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused
but the regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten days after
the mailing; if regular mail is used, a notice of the pending proceedings shall
be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected.
   (B)   If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Enforcement Officer in the exercise of
reasonable diligence and the Enforcement Officer makes an affidavit to that
effect, then the serving of the complaint or order upon the unknown owners or
other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general
circulation in the town by at least once no later than the time at which
personal service would be required under the provisions of this subchapter.
When service is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall
be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises thereby affected.
(Prior Code, § 6-157) (Ord. 29-08, passed 11-13-2008)
§ 150.25 APPEALS.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment is hereby appointed as the Housing Appeals
Board to which appeals from any decision or order of the Enforcement Officer
may be taken. Except where this subchapter provides for different rules or
procedures, the Board of Adjustment, acting as the Housing Appeals Board, shall
follow its rules of procedure, which may be amended to provide specifically for
this function.
   (B)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Enforcement Officer may be
taken by any person aggrieved thereby or by any officer, board, or commission
of the town. Any appeal from the Enforcement Officer shall be taken within ten
days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order by filing with
the Enforcement Officer and with the Board a notice of appeal which shall
specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any
notice of appeal, the Enforcement Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from
was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the Enforcement Officer refusing
to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any such act, his or her decision
shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a
decision of the Enforcement Officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any
act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the
hearing by the Board unless the Enforcement Officer certifies to the Board
after the notice of appeal is filed with him or her that, because of facts
stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a
suspension of his or her requirement would cause imminent peril to life or
property. In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a
restraining order which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than
one day’s written notice to the Enforcement Officer, by the Board, or by a
court of record upon petition made pursuant to division (E) below.
   (C)   (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing
appeals, shall give due notice to the parties, and shall render its decision
within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
decision or order appealed from and may make any decision and order that, in
its opinion, ought to be made in the matter, and to that end, it shall have all
the powers of the Enforcement Officer, but the concurring vote of four-fifths
of the members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any
decision or order of the Enforcement Officer.
      (2)   The Board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, when
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out
the strict letter of this subchapter, to adopt the application of this
subchapter to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this
subchapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and
substantial justice done.
   (D)   Every decision of the Board shall be subject to review by proceedings
in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the decision of the
Board but not otherwise.
   (E)   Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the Enforcement Officer or
a decision rendered by the Board may petition the Superior Court for an
injunction restraining the Enforcement Officer from carrying out the order or
decision, and the Court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction
restraining the Enforcement Officer pending a final disposition of the case.
The petition shall be filed within 30 days after issuance of the order or
rendering of the decision. Hearings shall be had by the Court on a petition
within 20 days and shall be given preference over other matters on the Court’s
calendar. The Court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall enter
such final order or decree as law and justice may require; it shall not be
necessary to file bond in any amount before obtaining a temporary injunction
under this division (E).

§ 150.26 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Nothing in this subchapter nor any of its provisions shall be
construed to impair or limit, in any way, the power of the town to define and
declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary
proceedings or otherwise nor shall enforcement of one remedy provided herein
prevent the enforcement of any other remedy provided herein or in other
ordinances or laws. In addition to the remedies provided for herein, any
violation of the terms of this subchapter shall subject the violator to the
penalties and remedies, either criminal or civil or both, pursuant to state
statutes and ordinances of the town.
   (B)   No dwelling shall be hereafter erected, altered, moved, or changed in
occupancy without a certificate of occupancy in any case where the Enforcement
Officer (after notice and hearing as required herein) finds that a dwelling or
dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, he or she shall withhold issuance
of a certificate of occupancy for such dwelling or dwelling unit until such
time that he or she determines that it is fit for human habitation; in
addition, in any case where the Enforcement Officer, after preliminary
investigation (as provided for herein), concludes that (based upon that
investigation) a dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation and
believes that the occupancy of such dwelling or dwelling unit could cause
imminent peril to life or property from fire or other hazards, he or she shall
withhold issuance of a certificate of occupancy for such dwelling or dwelling
unit until such time that he or she determines that it is fit for human
habitation.
   (C)   If any dwelling is erected, constructed, altered, repaired, converted,
maintained, or used in violation of this subchapter or of any valid order or
decision of the Enforcement Officer or Board made pursuant to any ordinance or
code adopted under authority of the ordinance from which this subchapter is
derived, the Enforcement Officer may institute any appropriate action or
proceedings to prevent the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or occupancy; to restrain, correct, or abate the violation; to
prevent the occupancy of the dwellings; or to prevent any illegal act, conduct,
or use in or about the premises of the dwelling.

   In the event any provision, standard, or requirement of this subchapter is
found to be in conflict with any provision of any other ordinance or code of
the town, the provision which establishes the higher standard or more stringent
requirement for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the
residents of the town’s jurisdiction shall prevail. The State Building Code,
current edition, shall serve as the standard for all alterations, repairs,
additions, removals, demolitions, and other acts of building made or required
pursuant to this subchapter.

§ 150.28 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   In addition to the conditions, acts, or failures to act that
constitute violations specified herein, it shall be unlawful for the owner of
any dwelling or dwelling unit to fail, neglect, or refuse to repair, alter, or
improve the same, or to vacate and close or vacate and remove or demolish the
same, upon order of the Enforcement Officer duly made and served as herein
provided, within the time specified in such order. It shall be unlawful for the
owner of any dwelling, with respect to which an order has been issued pursuant
to §§
150.22 through
150.24, to occupy or permit the occupancy of the same after the time prescribed
in such order for its repair, alteration, or improvement or its vacation and
closing or vacation and removal or demolition.
   (B)   Upon determination of a violation of any section of this subchapter,
the penalty for which is a civil penalty, the Enforcement Officer of the town
shall cause a warning citation to be issued to the violator. Such citation
shall set out the nature of the violation, the section violated, the date of
the violation, and shall contain an order to immediately cease the violation.
If the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an order of
abatement would be appropriate in the civil proceeding, a reasonable period of
time must be stated during which the violation must be abated. The warning
citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty,
together with costs and attorney fees.
   (C)   An appeal from a warning citation shall be taken within ten days from
the date of said warning citation to the Board of Adjustment. Except, in any
case where the ordinance violated (which is the subject of the warning
citation) specifically grants to the Board of Adjustment other powers in
considering appeals and such appeal is applied for, the Board of Adjustment, in
considering appeals of warning citations, shall have power only in the manner
of administrative review and interpretation where it is alleged that the
Enforcement Officer has made an error on the application of an ordinance, in
the factual situation as it relates to the application of this subchapter, or
both.
   (D)   Where the Enforcement Officer of the town determines that the period
of time stated in the original warning citation is not sufficient for abatement
based upon the work required or consent agreement, the Enforcement Officer may
amend the warning citation to provide for additional time.
   (E)   Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation, a civil
citation shall be issued by the appropriate official of the town and either
served directly on the violator or his or her duly designated agent or
registered agent, if a corporation, either in person or posted in the United
States mail service, by first-class mail, and addressed to the last known
address of the violator, as contained in the records of the town or obtained
from the violator at the time of issuance of the warning citation. A violator
shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of said citation. The
citation shall direct the violator to appear before the Town Manager or his or
her designee within 15 days of the date of the citation or, alternatively, to
pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must
have been corrected by the time the citation is paid; otherwise, other
citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense
continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated.
   (F)   Within 15 days from the date the first civil citation is served, the
Town Manager or his or her designee shall have the authority, upon written
request by the violator, to void the civil citation issued to date and relieve
the violator of any civil penalties due. The written request shall state the
reasons why the violator believes that the civil citation should be voided.
Prior to any civil citations being voided, the violation for which the citation
was issued must be fully corrected. The Town Manager or designee shall use
extreme discretion in voiding civil citations, and such action shall be taken
only under extraordinary circumstances. Such circumstances may include, but are
not limited to, an error by an official of the town, civil citations not
reaching the violator due to mail delivery difficulties, and extreme weather
constraints. After 15 days from the first civil citation being served, the Town
Manager or designee may only exercise said authority when correcting an error
by an official of the town. In those circumstances involving an error by an
official of the town, the Town Manager may exercise such authority without a
written request by the violator but must consider the recommendation of the
official making the error.
   (G)   If the violator fails to respond to a citation within 15 days of its
issuance, as prescribed herein, or receive relief from the Town Manager, as
described in this section, the town may institute a civil action in the nature
of debt in the appropriate division of the state general court of justice for
collection of the penalty, costs, attorney fees, and such other relief as
permitted by law.

§ 150.40 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Duty of Enforcement Officer.
      (1)   Any building, structure, or part thereof partially destroyed or
otherwise which is found by the Enforcement Officer to be in such a dilapidated
or substandard condition as to be dangerous to life, health, or other property
or to constitute a fire or safety hazard or a public nuisance shall be declared
by the Enforcement Officer to be unsafe. Such unsafe condition may be caused by
defective construction, overloaded structural parts, decay, susceptibility to
fire, exits, or any other hazardous conditions or circumstances.
      (2)   The Enforcement Officer shall have the authority, and it shall be
his or her duty to declare all such buildings or structures unsafe and to take
appropriate action to have such conditions corrected or removed. Such
declaration by the Enforcement Officer shall constitute an order of
condemnation for the purposes of this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 6-46)
   (B)   Duty to enforce provisions relating to unfit dwellings. The
Enforcement Officer or other person designated by the Town Council shall be
responsible for the enforcement of any ordinances or codes adopted by the Board
of Aldermen relating to the repair, closing, and demolition of dwellings unfit
for human habitation, pursuant to G.S. §§ 160D-111.9 et seq.

§ 150.41 RESPONSIBILITY OF OWNER.
   Whenever any building or structure has been condemned by the Enforcement
Officer and the existence of such building or structure in a dilapidated state
of disrepair or other substandard condition is found and determined by the
Enforcement Officer or upon appeal from or report by the Enforcement Officer,
as hereafter provided by the Town Council, to be dangerous to life, health, or
other property or is in such condition as to constitute a fire or safety hazard
or a public nuisance, the owner of such building or structure shall be required
to demolish and remove the same and remedy such conditions under the
regulations and procedures herein provided. In the event such owner fails or
refuses to do so within the time directed by the Enforcement Officer or the
Town Council, as hereinafter provided, the Town Council may, in its judgment,
cause the same to be demolished and removed or such other steps taken as it may
find to be necessary to suppress and abate the nuisance and remove the fire or
safety hazard and the danger to life, health, or other property found to exist
and specially assess the cost and expense of doing said work against the lot or
parcel of land on which the same building or structure is located.
(Prior Code, § 6-47) (Ord. 4-78-1, passed 4-8-1978)
§ 150.42 NOTICE AND HEARING.
   Before any building or structure may be ordered to be demolished and
removed, as provided in §
150.41, the Enforcement Officer shall notify the owner thereof, in writing, by
certified or registered mail to the last known address of such owner by
personal service of such notice by said Enforcement Officer or his or her
assistant or by posting notice, as hereinafter provided, that said building or
structure is in such condition as appears to constitute a fire or safety hazard
or a danger to life, health, or other property or to be a public nuisance and
that a hearing will be held before said Enforcement Officer at a designated
place at a time not less than ten days after the date of such written notice,
at which time and place the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by
counsel upon all legal or factual questions relating to the matter and shall be
entitled to offer such evidence as he or she may desire which is relevant or
material to the questions sought to be determined or the remedies sought to be
affected. If the name or whereabouts of the owner cannot, after due diligence,
be discovered, the notice herein referred to shall be considered properly and
adequately served if a copy thereof is posted on the outside of the building or
structure in question at least ten days prior to the date fixed for the hearing
and a notice of the hearing is published on time in a newspaper having general
circulation in the town at least one week prior to the date fixed for such
hearing. Such notice shall state the address or location of the building or
structure and the time, place, and purpose of the hearing.
(Prior Code, § 6-48) (Ord. 4-78-1, passed 4-8-1978)
§ 150.43 ORDER TO REMEDY OR DEMOLISH.
   If, upon such hearing, the Enforcement Officer shall find that the building
or structure in question is in such a dilapidated or substandard state of
disrepair as to constitute a fire or safety hazard or a danger to life, health,
or other property or is a public nuisance, he or she shall make an order in
writing directed to the owner of said building or structure requiring them to
remedy such conditions so found to exist by demolishing and removing said
building or structure or taking such other steps as may be necessary to abate
the nuisance and remove the hazards within such period, not less than 60 days,
as the Enforcement Officer may prescribe.

   The owner of any building or structure ordered by the Enforcement Officer to
be demolished and removed or who is directed by the Enforcement Officer to take
any other steps to abate a nuisance or remove hazards found by the Enforcement
Officer to exist shall have the right of appeal from such orders to the Town
Council provided such owner gives notice of appeal to the Enforcement Officer
at the time of the hearing at which the order is made or, within ten days after
such order is made, files with the Enforcement Officer a written notice of such
appeal. A notice of appeal shall state the grounds therefor. Unless an appeal
is taken within the time and in the manner herein prescribed, the action of the
Enforcement Officer shall be deemed final, subject only to such action as the
Council may take, as herein elsewhere provided. Where an appeal has been
properly taken and notice thereof given in accordance with the provisions of
this section, it shall be the duty of the Enforcement Officer to report same to
the Town Clerk who shall cause the matter to be placed on the agenda for action
by the Council at its next ensuing regular meeting. The Council shall have the
right to continue the hearing of the appeal from time to time, in its
discretion.

Enforcement Officer requiring that the building or structure be demolished and
removed or the taking of such other steps as may be required to abate the
nuisance and remove the hazards and fails or refuses to comply with such order
and direction, it shall be the duty of the Enforcement Officer to file a
written report thereof with the Town Clerk, who shall cause such report to be
placed on the agenda for action by the Town Council at its next ensuing regular
meeting or to some subsequent meeting to which the Council may continue same.
The Enforcement Officer shall mail a copy of said report by certified or
registered mail to the owner at his or her last known address or have a copy of
said report delivered to said owner. Said report shall specify the date of the
meeting of the Council for which the matter will be docketed for action.

   In all cases referred to in this subchapter which reach the Town Council for
action, either upon appeal of the owner from the ruling of the Enforcement
Officer or upon report of the Enforcement Officer that the owner fails or
refuses to comply with his or her order or direction, the Council shall hear
the matter. If the Council finds and determines that the building or structure
in question is in such a dilapidated or substandard state of disrepair as to
constitute a fire or safety hazard or to be dangerous to life, health, or other
property or is a public nuisance and the owner of said building or structure
has failed or refused to have such building or structure demolished and removed
or has failed or refused to take such steps as may be necessary to abate the
nuisance and remove the hazards found to exist, the Council may cause the
demolition and removal of such building or structure to be done or effect such
other remedies as may be necessary to abate the nuisance and remove the hazards
and specially access the cost of such work against the lot or parcel of land on
which the building or structure was situated, and such assessment shall
constitute a specific lien upon said lot or parcel of land, which may be
enforced by an action instituted in the name of the town in the nature of an
action to foreclose a mortgage, as provided by G.S. § 160A-233, in the case of
ad valorem taxes and local improvement assessments.

   In cases in which the Enforcement Officer has been unable to give the owner
actual notice by posting and publishing same (as required in the manner
hereinabove provided) and has given such notice by posting and publishing same
(as authorized in § 150.42), the owner has failed or refused to comply with the
order or direction of the Enforcement Officer to demolish and remove the
building or structure or to take such other remedial action as will remove the
hazards, and such case is referred to the Town Council for action, the Council
shall, before taking such action, cause to be posted on the outside of the
building or structure in question, at least ten days prior to the date fixed
for the hearing and published one time in a newspaper having general
circulation in the town (at least one week prior to the date fixed for such
hearing), a written notice stating the address or location of the building or
structure involved and the time, place, and purpose of the hearing and such
other information as the Council may deem advisable.

   In all cases in which the Town Council, under authority of this subchapter,
causes the demolition and removal of any building or structure to be carried
out or directs such other remedial steps to be taken as may be necessary to
abate the nuisance and remove the hazards, it shall be conclusively presumed
that the public nuisance and the fire and safety hazard and danger to life,
health, or other property created and maintained by the continued presence of
said building or structure in such condition as is found to exist constitutes a
clear and present danger amounting to a situation of emergency involving the
public health, safety, and general welfare which requires entry upon private
property for the summary abatement and removal of such danger in the public
interest.

his or her representative. It shall be unlawful for any person to neglect,
refuse, or fail to comply with any provision of this section after notice from
the Town Manager or his or her representative. Each day’s continuance shall

openings have been made shall be rebuilt at the expense of the person making or
causing such excavation in a skillful and permanent manner, and the service of

was made. All work so done shall be done and performed under the direction of
the Town Manager or his or her representative. Persons making or causing
excavations on streets or other places, when ordered by the Town Manager or his
or her representative to re-pave or replace any such street in as good a
condition as found, shall proceed, with all reasonable dispatch, to properly
complete such work. It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse, fail, or
neglect to comply with this division (I). Where such failure, refusal, or
neglect is continuous, each day’s continuance shall constitute a separate
offense.

reasonable period of time, which time shall be set in consideration of the harm
or risk created by the obstruction and the effort and expense for removal.
   (B)   In addition, the town may summarily remove said obstruction and charge
the expense of the removal, restoration, and repair to the person who placed or
maintained the obstruction. Said charge shall be a civil liability in favor of
the town, for which the town can seek a civil judgment against said person or

cost and expense and in a manner approved by the town) replace and restore all
paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping, or surface of any street or alley
disturbed in as good a condition as, or better than, before said work was
commenced and in a good workmanlike, timely manner in accordance with standards
for such work set by the town. Such restoration shall be undertaken within no
more than ten days after the disturbance is incurred and shall be completed as
soon as possible thereafter.
   (D)   Restoration of the facilities. In the event that, at any time during
the period of this franchise, the town, county, or state shall lawfully elect
