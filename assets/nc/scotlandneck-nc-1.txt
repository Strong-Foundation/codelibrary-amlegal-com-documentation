from the municipal system;
      (4)   To protect both municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage,
sludge and effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting the
general public;
      (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and
      (6)   To ensure that the municipality complies with its NPDES or non-
discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other
federal or state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject.
   (C)   The sewer provisions of this chapter provide for the regulation of
direct and indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through
the issuance of permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement
of general requirements for the other users, authorize monitoring and
enforcement activities, require user reporting and provide for the setting of
fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program
established herein.
   (D)   The sewer provisions of this chapter shall apply to all users of the

   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division (A) need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
53.094  of the sewer provisions of this chapter. The notification requirement
in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject

during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 251.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulation under § 3001 of RCA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW Director/
Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90
days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by the sewer provisions of this chapter, a
permit issued thereunder or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. passed 9-27-1994)
§ 53.099  ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. passed 9-27-1994)
§ 53.100  SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the POTW Director/
Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum
of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 53.115  MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The town requires the user to provide and operate at the user’s own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the town’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the town.
(Ord. passed 9-27-1994)
§ 53.116  INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The town will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of the sewer provisions of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the town, approval authority
and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The town,
approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user’s
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into his, her or their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with his, her or their security guards so that upon presentation
of suitable identification, personnel from the town, approval authority and EPA
will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities. Denial of the POTW Director/Superintendent’s,
approval authority’s or EPA’s access to the user’s premises shall be a
violation of the sewer provisions of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may

ENFORCEMENT
§ 53.130  ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation.  Whenever the POTW Director/Superintendent
finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating the sewer
provisions of this chapter, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation
or requirements contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement the
POTW Director/Superintendent may serve upon such a person a written notice
stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the date of this
notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction thereof shall be submitted to the town by the user. Submission of
this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders.  The POTW Director/Superintendent is hereby empowered
to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by
the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an
administrative order issued pursuant to division (D) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.  The POTW Director/Superintendent may order any
industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has
violated the sewer provisions of this chapter or is in noncompliance with a
wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. In the event the POTW Director/Superintendent determines
that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why this
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any
agent or officer of a corporation.
      (1)   The POTW Director/Superintendent shall review the evidence
presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action
is appropriate.
      (2)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §
53.999 nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director/Superintendent
under this section subject to an administrative appeal under §
53.074.
   (D)   Administrative orders.  When the POTW Director/Superintendent finds
that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the sewer
provisions of this chapter, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director/Superintendent may issue an order
to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in
noncompliance to do any of the following:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
the order;
      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation; or
      (4)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions. 
      (1)   The POTW Director/Superintendent may suspend the wastewater
treatment service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or
the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the POTW Director/Superintendent shall take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The POTW Director/Superintendent shall reinstate the wastewater
permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of
the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW Director/Superintendent
prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit.  Any user who violates the following conditions
of the sewer provisions of this chapter, or applicable state and federal
regulations, is subject to having its permit terminated:
      (1)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his or her discharge;
      (2)   Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater
constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
   (G)   Notification of termination.  Noncompliant industrial users will be
notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be
offered an opportunity to show cause under this section why the proposed action
should not be taken.
(Ord. passed 9-27-1994)
§ 53.131  OTHER AVAILABLE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Remedies, in addition to those previously mentioned in the sewer
provisions of this chapter, are available to the POTW Director/Superintendent
who may use any single one or combination against a noncompliant user.
   (B)   Additional available remedies include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Criminal violations.  The District Attorney for the County Judicial
District may, at the request of the town, prosecute noncompliant users who
violate the provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B. Under state law, it is a crime to
negligently violate any term, condition or requirement of a pretreatment
permit, or negligently fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local
governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B(f)); to knowingly and willfully violate any
term, condition or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or knowingly and
willfully fail to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments
(G.S. § 143-215.6B(g)); to knowingly violate any term, condition or requirement
of a pretreatment permit issued by local governments; or knowingly fail to
apply for a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that a person is placed in
imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury (G.S. § 143-215.6B(h)); and
to falsify information required under G.S. Chapter 143, Article 21 (G.S. § 143-
215.6B(i)).
      (2)   Injunctive relief.  Whenever a user is in violation of the
provisions of the sewer provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued
hereunder, the POTW Director/Superintendent, through the Town Attorney, may
petition the Superior Court of Justice for the issuance of a restraining order
or a preliminary and permanent injunction which restrains or compels the
activities in question.
      (3)   Water supply severance.  Whenever an industrial user is in
violation of the provisions of the sewer provisions of this chapter or an order
or permit issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed
and service will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated ability to comply.
      (4)   Public nuisances.  Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent
limitations of the sewer provisions of this chapter, or of a permit or order
issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected
or abated as directed by the POTW Director/Superintendent. Any person(s)
creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of Section 94 of
the Town Code of Ordinances, including reimbursing the POTW for any costs
incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.
(Ord. passed 9-27-1994)
§ 53.132  REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in the sewer provisions of this chapter are not
exclusive. The POTW Director/Superintendent may take any, all or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the town’s
enforcement response plan. However, the POTW Director/Superintendent may take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the POTW
Director/Superintendent is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. passed 9-27-1994)
§ 53.133  ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   At least annually, the POTW Director/Superintendent shall publish in the
largest daily newspaper circulated in the service area, a list of those
industrial users which were found to be in significant noncompliance, also
referred to as reportable noncompliance in 15A NCAC 2H .0903(b)(10), with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, during the previous 12
months.
(Ord. passed 9-27-1994)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 53.145  UPSET.
   (A)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (B) below are met.
   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW
Director/Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (C)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (D)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(Ord. passed 9-27-1994)
§ 53.146  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS DEFENSE.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
53.045(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
53.045(B)(2), (B)(3), (B)(5) through (7) and (B)(9) through (23) if it can
prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone
or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through
or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass-through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the town was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. passed 9-27-1994)
§ 53.147  BYPASS.
   (A)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (B) and (C) below.
   (B)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW Director/Superintendent, at least ten days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director/Superintendent
of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards
within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW Director/Superintendent may waive
the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within 24 hours.
   (C)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director/Superintendent may
take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) above.
      (2)   The POTW Director/Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if he or she determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(1) above.

GREASE AND OIL CONTROL
§ 53.160  SCOPE AND PURPOSE.
   The scope and purpose of this subchapter is to aid in the prevention of
sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions from contributions and accumulations
of fats, oils and grease into said sewer system from industrial or commercial
establishments, particularly food preparation and serving facilities.
(Ord. passed 4-24-2012)
§ 53.161  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COOKING ESTABLISHMENTS.  Those establishments primarily engaged in
activities of preparing, serving or otherwise making available for consumption
foodstuffs and use one or more of the following preparation activities: cooking
by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie
cooking, broiling, blanching, roasting, toasting or poaching. Also included are
infrared heating, searing, barbecuing and any other food preparation activity
that produces a hot, non-drinkable food product in or on a receptacle that
requires washing.
   FATS, OILS AND GREASES.  Organic polar compounds derived from animal and/or
plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules. These
substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures
established in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, as may be amended from time to time. All are
sometimes referred to herein as GREASE or GREASES.
   GREASE TRAP INTERCEPTOR.  A device for separating and retaining waterborne
greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and
entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices also
serve to collect solids, generated by and from food preparation activities,
prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection
and treatment system. GREASE TRAPS and INTERCEPTORS are sometimes referred to
herein as GREASE INTERCEPTORS.
   MINIMUM DESIGN CAPABILITY.  The design features of a grease interceptor and
its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and retain greases from
grease-laden wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer.
   NON-COOKING ESTABLISHMENTS.  Those establishments that primarily engaged in
the preparation of precooked foodstuffs that do not include any form of
cooking. These include cold dairy and frozen foodstuff preparation and serving
establishments.
   USER.  Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional limits
of the town, who contributes, causes or permits the contribution or discharge
of wastewater into the POTW, including persons who contribute such wastewater
from mobile sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
(Ord. passed 4-24-2012)
§ 53.162  GREASE INTERCEPTOR MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING AND GREASE REMOVAL.
   (A)   Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by the
Director of Public Works or his or her designee. Grease interceptors shall be
installed at the user’s expense, when such user operates a cooking
establishment. Grease interceptors may also be required in non-cooking or cold
dairy and frozen foodstuff establishments when they are deemed necessary by the
Director of Public Works for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing
grease. All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design and capacity
approved by the Director of Public Works or his or her designee and shall be
readily and easily accessible for user cleaning and town inspection. All such
grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content
as required in order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume
of the grease interceptor, but not less often than once every other month.
Users who are required to, based on solids, pass water through a grease
interceptor shall:
      (1)   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at
actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as
predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent
and effluent baffles with 20% of the total volume of the grease interceptor
being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified hereafter as a
“sludge pocket”;
      (2)   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required,
but at intervals of not longer than every other month at the user’s expense.
Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as
grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags
and the like which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the
effective volume of the grease interceptor;
      (3)   Accept the following conditions: if any skimmed or pumped wastes or
other materials removed from the grease interceptor are treated in any fashion
onsite and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and
after said onsite treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment
of established grease numerical limits consistent with and contained in
division (A) above on all discharges of wastewater from said grease interceptor
into the town sanitary sewer collection and treatment system;
      (4)   Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said
device such that attainment to the grease limit is consistently achieved.
CONSISTENT shall mean any wastewater sample taken from said grease interceptor
shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described in division
(A) above. If an establishment desires, because of documented space
constraints, an alternate to an out of building grease interceptor, the request
for an alternative location shall contain the following information:
         (a)   Location of town sewer main and easement in relation to
available exterior space outside the building; and
         (b)   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for
all services at that site.
      (5)   Understand and agree that the use of biological additives as a
grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon approval by the
Director. Any establishment using this method of grease abatement shall
maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner that attainment of the grease
wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the trap’s outlet, is consistently
achieved;
      (6)   Understand and agree that the use of automatic grease removal
systems is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the
Director, County Plumbing Inspector of the town and the County Department of
Health. Any establishment using this equipment shall operate the system in such
a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured
from the unit’s outlet, is consistently achieved; and
      (7)   Understand and agree that the Director reserves the right to make
determinations of grease interceptor adequacy and need, based on review of all
relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site
and building plan review and to require repairs to, or modification or
replacement of such traps.
   (B)   The user shall provide a written record of maintenance to the Director
for three years. All such records will be available for inspection by the town
at all times.
   (C)   No non-grease-laden sources are allowed to be connected to sewer lines
intended for grease interceptor service.
   (D)   Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following adoption
of this subchapter, although installation of grease interceptors will be
required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
subchapter for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges interceptors. If,
during this one-year period, an obstruction of a town sewer main(s) occurs that
causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is
realized and that said overflow or failure of sanitary sewer collection system
to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of
grease in the town’s sewer main(s), the town will take appropriate enforcement
actions, as stipulated in the town’s industrial pretreatment enforcement plan
and sewer use ordinance codified in this chapter, against the generator or
contributor of such grease.
   (E)   Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches, shall be
provided over each chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes shall extend
at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water
inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily removable covers
to facilitate inspection, grease removal and wastewater sampling activities.

§ 53.999  PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99.
   (B)   (1)   Any user who is found to have failed to comply with any
provision of the sewer provisions of this chapter, or the orders, rules,
regulations and permits issued hereunder, may be fined up to $10,000 per day
per violation.
      (2)   In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the POTW Director/
Superintendent shall consider the following:
         (a)   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to
the public health, or to public or private property resulting from the
violation;
         (b)   The duration and gravity of the violation;
         (c)   The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or on
air quality;
         (d)   The cost of rectifying the damage;
         (e)   The amount of money saved by noncompliance;
         (f)   Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally;
         (g)   The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to
comply with the pretreatment program; and
         (h)   The costs of enforcement to the town.
      (3)   Appeals of civil penalties assessed in accordance with this section
shall be as provided in §
53.074.

possession of the vehicle. In the case of a nuisance vehicle or a junked motor
vehicle, if the names and mailing addresses of the registered owner or person
entitled to possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee or occupant of the
real property upon which the vehicle is located, can be ascertained in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given by first class
mail. The person who mails the notice shall retain a written record to show the
name and address to which mailed, and the date mailed. If such names and
addresses cannot be ascertained or if the vehicle to be removed is an abandoned
motor vehicle, notice shall be given by affixing on the windshields or some
other conspicuous place on the vehicle a notice indicating that the vehicle
will be removed on a specified date (no sooner than seven days after the notice
is affixed). The notice shall state that the vehicle will be removed on a
specified date, no sooner than seven days after the notice is affixed or
mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by the owner or legal possessor prior to
that time.
   (B)   With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property, nuisance
vehicles and junked motor vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if
the registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the
vehicle, but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is an
abandoned or nuisance vehicle or, in the case of a junked motor vehicle, that
the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, such
appeal shall be made to the Board of Commissioners in writing, heard at the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Commissioners, and further
proceedings to remove the vehicle shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and
decided.
(1992 Code, § 90.06)  (Ord. passed 2-27-1990)
§ 90.07  EXCEPTIONS TO PRIOR NOTICE REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an
abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle may, as determined by the
authorizing official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a
special need for prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to
otherwise maintain and protect the public safety and welfare. Such finds shall,
in all cases, be entered by the authorizing official in the appropriate daily
records.
   (B)   Circumstances justifying the removal of vehicles without prior notice
include:
      (1)   Vehicles abandoned on the streets.  For vehicles left on the public
streets and highways, the Board of Commissioners hereby determines that
immediate removal of such vehicles may be warranted when they are:
         (a)   Obstructing traffic;
         (b)   Parked in violation of an ordinance prohibiting or restricting
parking;
         (c)   Parked in a no-stopping or standing zone;
         (d)    Parked in loading zones;
         (e)   Parked in bus zones; or
         (f)   Parked in violation of temporary parking restrictions imposed
under code sections.
      (2)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles.  With respect to abandoned or
nuisance vehicles left on town-owned property other than the streets and
highways, and on private property, such vehicles may be removed without giving
prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing official finds a
special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health,
safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation, such
circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to
businesses and residences, vehicles parked in such a location or manner as to
pose a traffic hazard, and vehicles causing damage to public or private
property.
(1992 Code, § 90.07)  (Ord. passed 2-27-1990)
§ 90.08  REMOVAL OF VEHICLES; POST-TOWING NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Any abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle which has been ordered
removed may, as directed by the town, be removed to a storage garage or area by
the tow truck operator or towing business contracting to perform such services
for the town. Whenever such a vehicle is removed, the authorizing town official
shall immediately notify the last known registered owner of the vehicle. The
notice shall include the following:
      (1)   The description of the removed vehicle;
      (2)   The location where the vehicle is stored;
      (3)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;
      (4)   The procedure the owner must follow to redeem the vehicle; and
      (5)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable cause
hearing on the removal.
   (B)   The town shall attempt to give notice to the vehicle owner by
telephone; however, whether or not the owner is reached by telephone, written
notice, including the information set forth in division (A) above, shall also
be mailed to the registered owner’s last known address unless this notice is
waived in writing by the vehicle owner or his or her agent.
   (C)   If the vehicle is registered in this state, notice shall be given
within 24 hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the state, notice shall be
given to the registered owner within 72 hours from the removal of the vehicle.
   (D)   Whenever an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle is removed,
and such vehicle has no valid registration or registration plates, the
authorizing city official shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the
vehicle identification number, to determine the last known registered owner of
the vehicle and to notify him or her of the information set forth in division
(A) above.
(1992 Code, § 90.08)  (Ord. passed 2-27-1990)
§ 90.09  RIGHT TO PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING BEFORE SALE OR FINAL DISPOSITION OF
VEHICLE.
   After the removal of an abandoned vehicle, nuisance vehicle or junked motor
vehicle, the owner or any other person entitled to possession is entitled to a
hearing for the purpose of determining if probable cause existed for removing
the vehicle. A request for hearing must be filed in writing with the magistrate
designated by the Chief District Court Judge to receive such hearing request.
The magistrate will set the hearing within 72 hours of receipt of the request,
and the hearing will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of G.S. §
153A-132, as amended.
(1992 Code, § 90.09)  (Ord. passed 2-27-1990)
§ 90.10  REDEMPTION OF VEHICLE DURING PROCEEDINGS.
   At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause
hearing, the owner may obtain possession of the removed vehicle by paying the
towing fee, including any storage charges, or by posting a bond for double the
amount of such fees and charges to the tow truck operator or towing business
having custody of the removed vehicle. Upon regaining possession of a vehicle,

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 110.001  ENACTMENT.
   This chapter is enacted for revenue purposes only. Therefore, it should be
construed to require payment of the maximum tax permitted under its terms. In
addition, issuance of a license pursuant to this chapter does not excuse a
licensee from compliance with any other applicable ordinance or statute. This
chapter does not prevent the town from imposing license taxes on additional
businesses, from increasing or decreasing the amount of any license tax, or
from regulating any business taxed.
(1992 Code, § 110.01)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)
§ 110.002  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BUSINESS.  Each trade, occupation, profession, business and franchise taxed
under this chapter.
   ELECTRONIC GAMING OPERATIONS.  A business enterprise, whether principal or
accessory, where persons utilize electronic machines, including but not limited
to computers and gaming terminals, to conduct games of odds or chance,
including sweepstakes, and where cash, merchandise or other items of value are
redeemed or otherwise distributed, whether or not the value of such
distribution is determined by electronic games played or by predetermined odds.
ELECTRONIC GAMING OPERATIONS do not include operations associated with the
official North Carolina Lottery.
   PERSON.  Any individual, trustee, executor, other fiduciary, corporation,
unincorporated association, partnership, sole proprietorship, company, firm or
other legal entity.
   SEASONAL.  A business is seasonal in nature when it is conducted for profit
six months out of the year or less.
(1992 Code, § 110.02)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982; Ord. passed 6-30-2010)
LEVY
§ 110.015  LEVY OF TAX.
   An annual privilege license tax is hereby levied on each business conducted
within this town listed in
Appendix A to this chapter, in the amounts set forth in that section.
(1992 Code, § 110.15)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)
§ 110.016  WHO MUST PAY TAX.
   Each person who conducts a business within this town is subject to this
chapter. A person “conducts business” when he or she engages in one act of
business taxed under this chapter. He or she conducts the business “within the
town” if he or she maintains a business location within the town; or if, either
personally or through agents, he or she solicits business within the town
limits, or picks up or delivers goods or delivers services within the town
limits.
(1992 Code, § 110.16)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)
§ 110.017  PERIOD OF LICENSE; DUE DATE.
   (A)   Annual licenses.  Unless the section of this chapter levying the
privilege license tax applicable to a particular business provides otherwise, a
license issued pursuant to this chapter is good for the 12-month period
beginning July 1 and ending June 30. The tax is due on July 1 of each year.
However, if a person begins a business after July 1 of a year, the tax for that
year is due before the business is begun.
   (B)   Licenses for periods shorter than one year.  If the section of this
chapter levying the privilege license tax applicable to a particular business
so provides, a license may be issued for a period of one day, one week or some
comparable period of less than a full year. A person may not commence a
business conducted within the town and taxed under such a provision until the
privilege license tax due is paid, and may not continue such a business beyond
the period for which the license is issued.
(1992 Code, § 110.17)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)
§ 110.018  PRORATION OF TAX.
   If a business is begun after January 31 and before July 1, the amount of tax
due is half the amount otherwise due. If a business is seasonal in nature and
if the amount of tax is not based on gross receipts, the amount of tax due is
half the amount otherwise due.
(1992 Code, § 110.18)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)
§ 110.019  REFUNDS.
   If for any reason a licensee discontinues his or her business during the
license year, he or she is not entitled to a refund.
(1992 Code, § 110.19)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)
§ 110.020  LICENSE REQUIRED FOR EVERY SEPARATE BUSINESS.
   A separate license is required and a separate privilege license tax must be
paid for each place of business unless two or more places of business under
common ownership, each conducting a business subject to the same tax under this
chapter, are contiguous to each other, communicate directly with and open into
each other and are operated as a unit. In addition, a separate privilege
license tax must be paid for each business taxable under this chapter conducted
by the taxpayer at any one location; however, the Tax Collector may issue a
single license for all taxable businesses conducted at one location by a single
taxpayer.
(1992 Code, § 110.20)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)  Penalty, see §
110.999
§ 110.021  COMPUTATION OF TAX BASED ON GROSS RECEIPTS.
   (A)   Whenever this chapter levies a privilege license tax computed on the
basis of gross receipts, GROSS RECEIPTS means the amount reported as gross
receipts on a business’s state income tax return, or on the federal income tax
return filed with the state income tax return if the state return does not
separately state gross receipts, for the most recently completed tax year.
   (B)   (1)   If a business has not been in operation long enough for the
information required in division (A) above to be available, the Tax Collector
shall estimate gross receipts for the business on the basis of gross receipts
of comparable businesses, or any other information that the Tax Collector
considers useful.
      (2)   On or before the July 31 immediately after the license year, each
licensee for whom the tax paid in the license year just concluded was based on
estimated gross receipts shall submit to the Tax Collector a sworn final report
showing the amount of gross receipts for the license year. If the amount shown
is more than estimated gross receipts, the licensee shall pay the amount of
additional tax that would have been due had the estimate been accurate. If the
amount shown is less than estimated gross receipts, the town shall refund to
the licensee the difference between the actual tax paid and the amount of tax
that would have been due had the estimate been accurate.
(1992 Code, § 110.21)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)
§ 110.022  EXEMPTIONS.
   Except as otherwise provided in this section or by state law, no person is
exempt from the payment of a privilege license tax levied by this chapter.
   (A)   Charitable organizations.  A person who operates a business for a
religious, educational, civic, patriotic, charitable or fraternal purpose, when
the entire gross income of the business is used for such a purpose, is exempt
from paying any privilege license tax levied by this chapter.
   (B)   Blind persons and members of the armed forces and merchant marine.
Blind persons and persons who serve in the United States armed forces or the
merchant marine are exempt from paying any privilege license tax levied by this
chapter to the extent provided by G.S. §§ 105-164.13(20) and 105-164.13(17).

issue the license. At the applicant’s request, the Tax Collector shall,
pursuant to §
110.046, give him or her a written statement of the reason for refusing the
license. The applicant may, within ten days after the day he or she receives
this statement, request a conference to discuss the refusal. In his or her
request he or she shall specify why his or her application for a license should
not be refused. The Tax Collector shall arrange the conference within a
reasonable time.
   (B)   If the Tax Collector refuses to issue a license, the applicant may
reapply for a license at any time thereafter. If the reason for which the
application was refused no longer exists, and if no other reason exists for
refusing to issue a license, the Tax Collector shall issue the license pursuant
to §
110.038.

applicant of that amount. The Tax Collector shall not issue a license until the
tax is paid.
(1992 Code, § 110.38)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)
§ 110.039  AMOUNT OF TAX DISPUTED.
   If the applicant disputes the amount the Tax Collector determines to be due,
he or she may either refuse to pay and request a conference with the Tax
Collector to discuss the determination, or pay the amount and request a
conference to discuss his or her right for a refund.  If a conference is
requested, the Tax Collector shall arrange it within a reasonable time.
(1992 Code, § 110.39)  (Ord. passed 5-13-1982)
§ 110.040  PROCEDURE FOR REVOCATION OF LICENSE.

it as set forth in §

Collector when reporting the change.
      (1)   Changes affecting the amount of tax due.  If there are no reasons

110.036 and the change results in the imposition of a separate or additional
tax, the Tax Collector shall reissue a license reflecting the change upon
payment of the separate or additional tax.
      (2)   Changes not affecting the amount of tax due.  If there are no
reasons for revoking the license under §

upon payment of a fee of $1.

§ 117.01  PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter shall be to set forth the regulatory and
licensing requirements for adult establishments located within the town. Adult
establishments, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious
objectionable operational characteristics. Studies and experiences that are
relevant to this state have shown that lower property values and increased
crime rates tend to accompany and are brought about by adult establishments.
The Board of Commissioners finds that regulations of these uses is necessary to
ensure that these adverse secondary effects do not contribute to the blighting
of surrounding neighborhoods and to regulate acts, omissions or conditions
detrimental to the health, safety or welfare and the peace and dignity of the
town. Regulation to achieve these purposes can be accomplished by the
procedures set forth hereinafter.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. This chapter represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of
the community by imposing an incidental, content-neutral place, time and manner
regulation of sexually oriented businesses, without limiting alternative
avenues of communication and at the same time requiring the business to carry
its share of financing administrative and enforcement activities.

ABANDONED STRUCTURES
§ 151.01  FINDING; INTENT OF SUBCHAPTER.
   It is hereby found that there exist within the town abandoned structures
which the Board of Commissioners finds to be hazardous to the health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the town due to the attraction of insects or
rodents, conditions creating a fire hazard, dangerous conditions constituting a
threat to children or frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the
absence of sanitary facilities. Therefore, pursuant to the authority granted by
G.S. § 160A-441, it is the intent of this subchapter to provide for the repair,
closing or demolition of any such abandoned structures in accordance with the
same provisions and procedures as are set forth by law for the repair, closing
or demolition of dwellings unfit for human habitation.

   The Building Inspector is authorized to exercise such powers as may be
necessary to carry out the intent and the provisions of this subchapter,
including the following powers in addition to others herein granted:
   (A)   To investigate the condition of buildings within the town in order to

   (C)   To administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses and receive
evidence; and
   (D)   To designate such other officers, agents and employees of the town as
he or she deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.
(1992 Code, § 151.03)  (Ord. passed 12-16-1977)
§ 151.04  STANDARDS FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Every abandoned structure within the town shall be deemed in violation
of this subchapter whenever such structure constitutes a hazard to the health,
safety or welfare of the town citizens as a result of:
      (1)   The attraction of insects or rodents;
      (2)   Conditions creating a fire hazard;
      (3)   Dangerous conditions constituting a threat to children; or
      (4)   Frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the absence of
sanitary facilities.
   (B)   In making the preliminary determination of whether or not an abandoned
structure is in violation of this subchapter, the Building Inspector may, by
way of illustration and not limitation, consider the presence or absence of the
following conditions:
      (1)   Holes or cracks in the structure’s floors, walls, ceilings or roof
which might attract or admit rodents and insects, or become breeding places for
rodents and insects;
      (2)   The collection of garbage or rubbish in or near the structure which
might attract rodents and insects, or become breeding places for rodents and
insects;
      (3)   Violations of the State Building Code, the State Electrical Code
and the Fire Prevention Code, which constitute a fire hazard in such structure;
      (4)   The collection of garbage, rubbish or combustible material which
constitutes a fire hazard in such structure;

interest in such structure a complaint stating the charges and containing a
notice that a hearing will be held before the Inspector at a place therein

determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an
order directing and requiring the owner to either repair, alter and improve
such structure or else remove or demolish the same within a specified period of

ordering the Inspector to cause such structure to be removed or demolished, as
provided in the original order of the Inspector, and pending such removal or
demolition, to placard such dwelling as provided by G.S. § 160A-443.
   (D)   Petition to superior court by owner.  Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the Inspector shall have the right, within 30 days after issuance of

that effect, and the serving of such complaint or order upon such person may be

Procedure. Where service is made by publication, a notice of the pending

   (A)   In this interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety and general welfare. Wherever the requirements of
lawfully adopted rules and regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions or
covenants are at variance with the requirements of this chapter, the most
restrictive, or that imposing the highest standards, shall govern.
   (B)   This chapter and the various parts, sections, divisions and clauses
thereof are hereby declared to be severable. If any part, sentence, paragraph,
division, section or clause is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid, it is
hereby provided that the remainder of the chapter shall not be affected
thereby. If any part, sentence, paragraph, division, section or clause is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid as applied to a particular property,
buildings or structures shall not be affected hereby. Whenever any condition or
limitation is included in an order authorizing a zoning permit, special use
permit, conditional use permit, variance, certificate of zoning compliance,
certificate of occupancy or site plan approval, it shall be conclusively
presumed that the authorizing officer or body considered such condition or
limitation necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter or the
requirements of some provisions hereof, and to protect the public health,
safety and welfare, and the officer of the Board would not have granted the
authorization to which the condition or limitation pertains except in the
belief that the condition or limitation was lawful.

§ 152.021  SPECIAL USE DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The purpose of these districts is to promote greater land use
compatibility by allowing landowners to voluntarily place their property into
classifications in which a special use permit is required as a prerequisite to
any use or development. More specifically, the purpose of these districts is
identical to that of corresponding general use districts as indicated below,
except that a special use permit is required as a prerequisite to any use or
development, as provided in this chapter.

   (B)   A special use district corresponds to each of the other districts
authorized in this chapter. It is recognized that certain types of zoning
districts would be inappropriate at particular locations in the absence of
special conditions. Where the applicant desires property to be rezoned to such
a district in such situations, the special use district is a means by which
such special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the purposes of
this chapter. The special use district classification will be considered in
response to a petition by the owners of all of the property to be included. If,
for any reason, any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to
be illegal or invalid, of if the applicant should fail to accept any condition,
it is the intent of this chapter that the authorization of such special use
permit shall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings be
instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification.
   (C)   Within a special use district, only those uses authorized by this
chapter as permitted, conditional or special uses within the zoning district
with which the special use district corresponds shall be permitted, and all
other requirements of the corresponding district and other requirements of this
chapter shall be met. If the use would be conditional or special use in the
corresponding district, all of the requirements in §§
152.060 through
152.078 for all special or conditional uses and the applicable special or
conditional use shall be met. In addition, within a special use district, one
use shall be permitted except pursuant to a special use permit authorized by
the Town Board of Commissioners which shall specify the use or uses authorized.
The special use permit may further specify conditions based on the issues
raised concerning special uses in §§
152.060 through
152.078 and any other reasonable and appropriate conditions.
   (D)   The authorization of a special use in the district shall preclude any
requirements for obtaining a conditional use permit from the Board of
Adjustment.

permitted by law, such a boundary shall be construed as moving with the actual
shoreline.
      (7)   Boundaries indicated as following the contours of certain elevation
of soils of a particular type shall be construed as following the actual height
or soil contour as determined by accepted survey practices.

the map a certification indicating the alteration and citing the date of
adoption and the effective date of the amendment, as well as the book and page
of record of the ordinance amending the map.

(1992 Code, § 152.020)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.026  REPLACEMENT AND PRESERVATION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP AND TRUE COPY.

in part, the Board of Commissioners may adopt the true copy in whole or in part
as the Official Zoning Map, and the Zoning Administrator and Town
Administrator/Clerk shall promptly prepare or cause to be prepared a new true
copy of the Official Zoning Map. From time to time, the governing body may
adopt a new Official Zoning Map if the prior map becomes difficult to interpret
due to the number of amendments or other matters shown thereon, or if the
governing body desires to replace the map for other reasons, provided that the
new map is an exact copy of the prior map. If a new map is to be adopted which
is not an exact copy of a prior map, it shall be adopted in accordance with the

structure or part thereof shall be erected, moved or structurally altered
except in compliance with the regulations of this chapter for the district in
which it is located.
   (B)   No structure shall hereafter be erected or altered so as to exceed the
height limit or density regulations of this chapter for the district in which
it is located.
   (C)   No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of
record in single ownership, shall be reduced in size so that the lot area per
dwelling unit, lot width, yard and lot and coverage requirements and other
requirements of this chapter are not maintained. This prohibition shall not be
construed to prevent the purchase of condemnation of narrow strips of land for
public utilities or street right-of-way purposes.
   (D)   No part of a yard or other open space required about any structure or
use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall be
included as a part of a yard or other open space similarly required for another

amendment.
   (B)   Regulations set forth by this chapter shall be minimum regulations. If
the requirements set forth in this chapter are at variance with the
requirements of any other lawfully adopted uses, regulations or ordinances, the
more restrictive or higher standard shall govern.
   (C)   Unless restrictions established by covenants with the land are
prohibited by or contrary to the provisions of this chapter, nothing herein

(1992 Code, § 152.036)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.042  EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The minimum front yard requirements of this chapter for dwellings
shall not apply on any lot where the average front yard of existing dwellings
located wholly or in part within 100 feet on each side of such lot within the
same block and zoning district and fronting on the same side of the street is
less than the minimum required front yard. In such cases, the front yard on
such lot may be less than the required front yard, but not less than the
adjacent dwelling with the greatest front yard depth or the average front yard
of existing dwellings located wholly or in part within 100 feet on each side,
whichever is greater.
   (B)   In any residential district for corner lots, the side yard
requirements along the side street(s) shall be the same as the front yard
requirement for that district. Yards shall be measured as indicated in §
152.004.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment shall review, as a conditional use, structures
such as church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes not intended for human
occupancy, monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission towers,
chimneys, smokestacks, conveyors, flagpoles, radio towers, mast, aerials, dish
antennas and similar structures which exceed the height limitations of this
chapter.

may project into any yard, but such projections may not exceed six feet, and
may not be closer than ten feet to any lot lines.
   (E)   Architectural projections, such as chimneys, flues, sills, eaves, belt
courses and ornaments may project into any required yard, but such projections
may not exceed three feet.
   (F)   The yard requirements of this chapter do not apply to roads, water,
sewer, gas, electric, telephone and similar utility lines, except as
specifically mentioned in this chapter.
   (G)   Lot width on lots which front on the turnaround circle of a cul-de-sac
may be measured at the lines formed by connecting the midpoint of the side lot
line of the shorter side with a point on the longer side lot line which is the
same distance from the front lot line as the midpoint of the shorter side, or
if both side lot lines are the same length, at the line connecting the
midpoints of the side lot lines. All yard requirements must be met on such
lots. If a lot has more than two sides, the side lot lines to be used are the
two which connect with the front lot line.
(1992 Code, § 152.037)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.043  VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS.

grow in such a manner as materially to impede vision between a height of two
and one-half and ten feet in a triangular area formed by a diagonal line
between two points on the right-of-way lines, 20 feet from where they
intersect, except where there is a curb, by a diagonal line between two points
on the curb line, 25 feet from where they intersect.

be a conditional use subject to approval by the Board of Adjustment.
   (D)   No more than 25% of the total actual floor area of the dwelling or 500
square feet, whichever is less, shall be used in the conduct of the home
occupation. In addition, one accessory building, not exceeding 1,000 square
feet, shall be a conditional use in connection with the home occupation to
house commercial vehicles and/or for storage of materials used in connection
with the home occupation, and/or for use as an administrative office for the
home occupation. The accessory building may not be used for manufacturing,
processing, instruction, sales, service or other work in connection with the
home occupation. All lot coverage, dimensional and other requirements of this

   (H)   The use may not emit smoke beyond that which normally occurs in the
applicable zoning district, nor shall it emit dust, vibration, odor, smoke,
fumes, glare, electrical interference, interference to radio and television
reception, radiation or other nuisance, and shall not be volatile or present a
fire hazard; nor may the occupation discharge into any waterway, stream, lake
or into the ground or a septic tank any waste which will be dangerous or a
nuisance to persons or animals, or which will damage plants or crops.
   (I)   No home occupation shall involve the use of electrical or mechanical
equipment that would change the fire rating of the structure in which the home
occupation is conducted.
   (J)   There shall be no more than two deliveries per day to the premises of
materials to be used in conjunction with the home occupation, and these shall
take place between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.

antenna may extend within three feet of a lot line, nor within 20 feet of a
street right-of-way line.
   (I)   Recreational uses and buildings accessory to multi-family dwellings
complexes shall be in accordance with §
152.027. For swimming pools and tennis courts as accessory uses to any
residential use, measurement for location and spacing shall be from the edge of
the pool for in-ground pools, without raised decks, from the edge of the court
markings from tennis courts, and from the edge of the raised portion of the
deck for above-ground pools or pools with raised decks.
   (J)   Fences and walls are permitted as accessory uses, provided that they
comply with the following:
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, a FENCE is a barrier composed of
wire, wood, metal, plastic or a similar material, and a WALL is a barrier
composed of brick, stone, rock, concrete block or a similar masonry material.
      (2)   No fence or wall more than three feet in height, or retaining wall
more than five feet in height, which is more than 75% solid, may be placed in
any front yard, including along the side lot line or in the yard to the front
of any principal building, unless required or specifically authorized in
another section of this chapter.
      (3)   Fences may not exceed seven feet in height, except that in
commercial and industrial districts, a fence may not exceed ten feet in height.
Fences greater than seven feet in height shall be of an open type similar to
woven wire or wrought iron. Fences and walls may exceed the height requirements
of this section if required or specifically authorized in another section of
this chapter.
      (4)   Fences and walls are exempt from the setbacks requirements of this
chapter.
      (5)   No fence or wall shall impede vision as regulated in §
152.043.
      (6)   Fences, if replaced, shall meet the requirements of this section.
   (K)   Because the proliferation of private satellite dish antennas raised
substantive concerns of aesthetics and safety, because their size and
appearance differs from other antennas in widespread use, and because they have
special reception requirements, special regulations are needed to deal with
them. Dish antennas (earth stations) are permitted as accessory uses, provided
that they comply with the following regulations.
      (1)   General requirements.
         (a)   A building permit is required when installing, moving or
substantially constructing or reconstructing a dish antenna.
         (b)   A dish antenna must be installed in compliance with the
manufacturer’s specifications at a minimum.
         (c)     No dish antenna shall be installed in any public right-of-way
or in any drainage or utility easement.
      (2)   Location in yards. A dish antenna shall be installed in the rear
yard only, in all districts.
      (3)   Setback requirements.
         (a)   The minimum required setback for dish antennas, from the side
line, shall be the same as for the principal building, except on corner lots;
on the side abutting the street, the minimum required setback shall be the same
as the required front yard setback along that street.
         (b)   The minimum required setback for dish antennas from the rear lot
line shall be six feet or the same as accessory buildings, whichever is
greater, but in no case shall any part of the antenna come closer than three
feet to the property line.
         (c)   In districts where there are no side or rear requirements, a
minimum setback of six feet from the side and rear lot lines shall be required
of dish antennas, but in no case shall any part of the antenna come closer than
three feet to the property line.
         (d)   In all cases, no dish antenna shall be located within ten feet
of any street right-of-way.

152.999
§ 152.046  BUFFERS.
   Whenever a buffer is required by this chapter, such buffer shall meet the
following specifications, unless different specifications are given in the
section where the buffer is required.
   (A)   A buffer shall consist of a fence with a minimum height of eight feet,
which shall start a maximum distance of one inch above the ground, and shall be
of such material as to present a visual barrier between the different property
uses. The fencing must be approved by the Building Inspector.
   (B)   Buffers shall be required in the following situations, as well as in
any others specified in other sections of this chapter: whenever a
manufacturing, processing, retail, wholesale trade or warehousing use of public
utility installation is established, a buffer shall be provided wherever the
lot on which the use is established abuts or is across an easement or right-of-
way from land zoned to any R classification.
   (C)   All buffers shall become part of the lot(s) on which they are located,
or in the case of commonly owned land, shall belong to the homeowners’ or
property owners’ association.
   (D)   The buffers shall be maintained for the life of the development.
Maintenance shall be the responsibility of the property owner or, if the
property is rented, the lessee.
   (E)   If a natural screen is already in place which will adequately fulfill
the purpose of a buffer, the Zoning Administrator may, in writing, allow a
substitution of all or part of this screen for the buffer. Written permission
of the Zoning Administrator shall be obtained before removing an existing
natural buffer in the location of the required buffer strip.
   (F)   Where it is clear that a planting screen would thrive and provide
adequate screening, the Zoning Administrator may allow a buffer strip to be
planted instead of the fence. A buffer strip shall consist of a planted strip
of land at least six feet in width, composed of deciduous and/or evergreen
trees spaced not more than four feet apart, and not less than one row of dense
evergreen shrubs spaced not less than five feet or more in height after one
growing season, and maintained in a healthy, growing condition. No building or
part of a building, driveway or parking area shall occupy any part of the
buffer strips.
   (G)   For special and conditional uses, the Board may require a maintenance
bond for the buffers as a condition of approval.
(1992 Code, § 152.041) 
§ 152.047  NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   (A)   Generally.  A nonconforming situation occurs when, on the effective
date of this chapter or any amendment hereto, an existing lot or structure or
use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the
regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is
located. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this chapter and subject
to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in the remainder of this
section, nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective
date of this section may be continued, whenever this section refers to the
effective date of any amendments to this section if the amendment, rather than
this chapter as originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots.
      (1)   Single lot of record with lot area and/or lot width nonconformity.
         (a)   When an undeveloped lot has an area or width which does not
conform to the dimensional requirements of the district where located, but such
lot was approved and of record at the time of adoption of this section or any
subsequent amendment which renders such lot nonconforming, then such lot may be
used for a use permitted in the district where located, provided that the
setback dimensions and other requirements, except area or width, are complied
with.
         (b)   In residential zones, only a single-family dwelling shall be
permitted on the nonconforming lot.
         (c)   Nothing contained herein exempts a lot from meeting the
applicable provisions of the County Board of Health regulations.
      (2)   Reduction of a lot of record.  A lot of record reduced to less than
the required area, width or setback dimensions as the result of a condemnation
or purchase by a local or state government agency shall become a nonconforming
lot of record.
      (3)   Lot of record with setback nonconformity.  When the use proposed
for an undeveloped nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all respects
except that the applicable setback requirements cannot reasonably be complied
with, then the entity authorized by this section to issue a permit for the
proposed use (the Zoning Administrator, Board of Adjustment or Board of
Commissioners) may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements,
if it finds that:
         (a)     The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use
proposed without such deviations;
         (b)   The deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the
nonconforming lot; and
         (c)   The property can be developed as proposed without any
significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or
safety.
   (C)   Nonconforming use of land.
      (1)   Continuance of nonconforming use of land.  Any nonconforming use
legally existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this section may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to conditions
provided in this section.
      (2)   Conditions for continuance.  Such nonconforming use of land shall
be subject to the following conditions.
         (a)    No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming
use unless such use is determined to be of equal or less intensity. In
determining whether a nonconforming use is of equal or less intensity, the
Board of Adjustment shall consider:
            1.   Probable traffic of each use;
            2.   Parking requirements of each use;
            3.   Probable number of persons on the premises of each use at a
time of peak demand; and
            4.   Off-site impacts of each use, such as noise, glare, dust,
vibration or smoke and other impacts on surrounding properties or the public
health or safety.
         (b)   The number of dwelling units in a nonconforming residential use
shall not be increased.
         (c)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this section.
         (d)   If any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
continuous period of more than 180 days, any subsequent use of such land shall
be a permitted use in the district in which such land is located.
         (e)   The resumption of a nonconforming use of land shall not be
permitted if such nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use for any
period of time.
         (f)   No additional structure(s) not conforming to the requirements of
this section shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of
land.
      (3)   Extension, enlargement or replacement of a nonconforming use.
         (a)   Except as provided for in divisions (C)(3)(b) through (C)(3)(f)
below, no nonconforming use shall be extended, enlarged or replaced.
         (b)   Any single-family residential nonconforming use (which may be a
manufactured home) may be enlarged or replaced with a similar single-family
residential structure of the same size or of a larger size, so long as the
enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the
extent of existing nonconformities with respect to setback requirements.
         (c)   1.   Any other nonconforming use may be extended, enlarged or
replaced only upon the issuance of a special use permit if the Board of
Adjustment finds that, in completing the extension, enlargement or replacement
work:
               a.   There is no increase in the total amount of lot area
devoted to the nonconforming use;
               b.   There is no greater nonconformity with respect to
dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations or
density requirements or other requirements such as parking, loading and
landscaping requirements; and
               c.   There is no significant adverse impact on surrounding
properties or the public health or safety.
            2.   In issuing a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment may
affix other reasonable and appropriate conditions, such as but not limited to
landscaping and buffering, to separate dissimilar uses or to screen parking and
loading areas.
         (d)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a
completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this section,
was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, a
nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land
outside the original building unless specifically authorized in accordance with
division (C)(3)(c) above.
         (e)   A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover
more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except
that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a
sand pit) may be expanded to the limits of the site plan upon which the mining
permit was granted if 10% or more of the natural materials had already been
removed on the effective date of this section.
         (f)   The volume, intensity or frequency of use of property where a
nonconforming use exists may be increased, and the equipment or processes used
at a location where a nonconforming use exists may be changed if these or
similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than
changes in kind or use and no violations of other sections of this subchapter
occur.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures.
      (1)   Continuance of nonconforming.  Any nonconforming structure legally
existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this section may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
      (2)   Conditions for continuance.  Such nonconforming structures shall be
subject to the following conditions.
         (a)   No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way
which increases its dimensional deficiencies. Any enlargement of the structure
shall conform to the current dimensional requirements.
         (b)   In the event of damage by fire or other causes to the extent
exceeding 60% of its tax value prior to such damage as established by the
Building Inspector, reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be
permitted only in compliance with the dimensional provisions of this section.
         (c)   In the event of damage by fire or other causes to the extent
causing less than 60% of its tax value prior to such damage as established by
the Building Inspector, reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be
permitted, provided it is constructed:
            1.   In the same manner in which it originally existed subject to
compliance with the requirements of the North Carolina State Building Code; or
            2.   In compliance with the dimensional requirements.
         (d)    No nonconforming structure shall be moved or relocated unless
it is made to comply with the dimensional and use requirements of the district
in which it is relocated and with the requirements of the North Carolina State
Building Code.
      (3)   Preservation of safe or lawful conditions.  Nothing in this section
shall prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe or lawful condition
any part of any building declared unsafe or unlawful by the County Building
Inspector or other duly authorized official.
   (E)   Miscellaneous nonconforming situations.
      (1)   Nonconforming situation resulting from governmental acquisition. 
Any lot reduced in size by municipal, county or state condemnation or purchase
of land shall obtain nonconforming lot or building status to the extent that
said condemnation or purchase causes noncompliance with any provisions of this
section.
      (2)   Nonconforming parking created by change of use.  Whenever a change
of use that does not involve the enlargement of an existing structure is
proposed for a lot on which the parking requirements of this section for the
proposed new use cannot be met to insufficient lot area, the proposed change of
use shall not be regarded as an impermissible extension or enlargement of a
nonconforming situation. However, the permit-issuing authority shall require
that the parking requirements be satisfied to the extent possible utilizing the
lot area that is available and may require that satellite parking space be
obtained.
   (F)   Nonconforming projects.  All nonconforming projects on which
construction was begun at least 180 days before the effective date of this
section, as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least 10% completed
in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of
this section, may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits,
so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and
unexpired. If a development is designed to be completed in stages, this section
shall apply only to the particular phase under construction. In addition, as
provided in G.S. § 160A-385(b), neither this section nor any amendment to it
shall, without the consent of the property owner, affect any lot with respect
to which a building permit has been issued pursuant to G.S. § 160A-417 prior to
the enactment of the ordinance making the change so long as the building permit
remains valid, unexpired, and unrevoked.
   (G)   Nonconforming signs.
      (1)   Continuance of nonconforming signs.
         (a)   Signs in existence on the effective date of this section which
do not conform to the provisions of this section, but which were constructed,
erected, affixed or maintained in compliance with all previous regulations,
shall be regarded as nonconforming signs, shall be allowed to continue and a
decision as to the continued existence and use or removal of such signs shall
be controlled as follows.
            1.   No nonconforming sign shall be changed to another
nonconforming sign.
            2.   No nonconforming sign shall have any changes made in the words
or symbols used or the message displayed on the sign unless the sign is
specifically designed for periodic change of message.
            3.   No nonconforming sign shall be structurally altered so as to
change the shape, size, type or design of the sign, other than to make the sign
a conforming sign.
            4.   No nonconforming sign shall be re-established after the
activity, business or use to which it relates has been discontinued, and such
sign shall be removed.
            5.   No nonconforming sign shall be re-established and all remains
of the sign must be removed after damage or destruction, if the estimated
expense of repairs exceeds 50% of the estimated total value of the sign at the
time of destruction, as determined by the Building Inspector. If damaged by
less than 50%, but repairs are not made within three months of the time such
damage occurred, the nonconforming sign shall not be allowed to continue and
must be removed.
            6.   No nonconforming sign shall be relocated unless it is brought
into conformance with the requirements of this section.
            7.   Normal maintenance and repair of a nonconforming sign is
permitted, providing the shape, size, type or design of the sign is not
altered.
         (b)   Any nonconforming sign which is structurally altered, relocated
or replaced shall immediately be brought into compliance with all the
provisions of this section.
         (c)   Any nonconforming sign which is a menace to the public safety,
has been abandoned or which has not been properly maintained, including
cleaning and painting of painted surface areas and replacement of damaged
parts, shall be removed after due notice has been given by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)   Violations of nonconforming sign provisions.  The Zoning
Administrator shall order the removal of any sign maintained in violation of
the provisions of this section for which removal procedures are herein
prescribed, accordingly: the Zoning Administrator shall give 90-days’ written
notice to the owner or lessee to remove the sign or to bring it into compliance
with this section. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign within 90
days after the 90-day written notice has been given, the Zoning Administrator
or his or her duly authorized representative may institute removal proceedings
according to the procedures specified in G.S. § 160A-175.

CONDITIONS TO BE MET BY SPECIAL AND CONDITIONAL USES
§ 152.060  SPECIAL USES AND CONDITIONAL USES.
   The provisions of this chapter permit some uses to be established by right
in the appropriate district, while other uses are listed which require a permit
from the Board of Adjustment or Town Board. Those which require a permit from
the Board of Adjustment are termed CONDITIONAL USES by this chapter, while
those which involve broader policy considerations and therefore require a
permit from the Town Board, are termed SPECIAL USES. Both types of uses, in
some circumstances, may be compatible with and desirable in the districts in
which they are designed as special or conditional uses, but they may also have
characteristics which could have detrimental effects on adjacent properties, or
even the entire town area, if not properly designed and controlled. Special and
conditional uses shall be in accordance with the requirements of §
152.162 and this subchapter shall apply to those special use permits issued in
special use districts only as indicated in §
152.162. The procedure for obtaining a special use permit in a special use
district shall be that required in §§
152.135 through
152.138.
(1992 Code, § 152.055)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.061  GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR GRANTING SPECIAL AND CONDITIONAL USES.
   In order for any special or conditional use to be granted, the applicant, at
the hearing, shall present sufficient evidence to enable the Board to find that
the following conditions exist where applicable.
   (A)   All applicable specific conditions pertaining to the proposed use have
been or will be satisfied.
   (B)   Access roads or entrance and exit drives are or will be sufficient in
size and properly located to ensure automotive and pedestrian safety and
convenience, traffic flow and control and access in case of fire or other
emergency.
   (C)   Off-street parking, loading, refuse and other service areas are
located so as to be safe, convenient, allow for access in case of emergency,
and to minimize economic, glare, door and other impacts on adjoining properties
and properties in the general neighborhood.
   (D)   Utilities, schools, fire, police and other necessary public and
private facilities and services will be adequate to handle the proposed use.
   (E)   The location and arrangement of the use on site, screening, buffering,
landscaping and pedestrian ways harmonize with adjoining properties and the
general area and minimize adverse impacts.
   (F)   The type, size and intensity of the proposed use, including such
consideration as the hours of operation and number of people who are likely to
utilize or be attracted to the use, will not have significant adverse impacts
on adjoining properties or the neighborhood.
(1992 Code, § 152.056)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.062  ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS.
   If the appropriate Board approves a special or conditional use, it may, as
part of the terms of such approval, impose any additional reasonable conditions
and safeguards as may be necessary to ensure that the criteria for the granting
of such a permit will be complied with, and to reduce or minimize any
potentially injurious effect of the use on adjoining properties, the character
of the neighborhood or the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the
community. Where appropriate, such conditions may include requirements that
street and utility rights-of-way be dedicated to the public and that provision
be made of recreational space and facilities.
(1992 Code, § 152.057)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.063  SPECIFIC CONDITIONS.
   In addition to the general conditions in §
152.066, conditional uses shall meet specific conditions for the type of use as
indicated in this subchapter.

§ 152.064  MULTI-FAMILY DWELLINGS AS A CONDITIONAL USE IN R-1, R-2 AND R-3M
DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The maximum density shall be ten dwelling units per acre.
   (B)   Where more than one building is to be located on the site, building
separation shall be determined as follows: the minimum horizontal distance
between the vertical projections of any points on two adjacent buildings shall
be determined according to the following table. The vertical projections for
each building shall be drawn from that point on each building which is
horizontally closest to the other building.
 
Height of Taller Building       Minimum Horizontal Distance Between Vertical
                                Projections

perimeter of the site, with the exception of driveways. Parking spaces and
accessory buildings shall not be allowed in the required yard.
   (E)   Access for emergency vehicles to all parts of the complex and to each
dwelling unit shall be provided.
   (F)   Accessory buildings and uses for multi-family dwellings shall not be
placed in the 50-foot yard around the perimeter of the site.
   (G)   The Board may approve the inclusion of leasing offices and of coin-
operated laundry facilities, swimming pools, snack bars and similar service
uses for residents of the multi-family dwelling, provided that they are
intended to serve residents of the dwelling or complex only, and will not
attract outside traffic to the site.
   (H)   In complexes having more than ten units, one-half acre or 5% of the
gross acreage in the tract shall be set aside for the recreation space.
(1992 Code, § 152.059)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)  Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.065  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS AS A SPECIAL USE IN R-A, R-1, R-2 AND R-
3 DISTRICTS.
   (A)   A planned unit development is a project which is at least 40,000
square feet gross acres in size to be located on land under unified control,
planned as a whole and developed in a single development operation or in a
definitely programmed series of units or stages of development according to
comprehensive and detailed plans, with a program for the provision, operation
and maintenance of any areas, improvements and facilities provided for the
common use of the occupants or users of the development.
   (B)   A planned unit development may contain any of the permitted or
conditional uses listed for the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Districts, subjected to
approval of the plans by the Town Board. Dimensional requirements for single-
family dwellings within a planned unit development shall be as indicated in §
152.028. Overall density in a planned unit development shall not exceed two
dwelling units per acre in the R-A and R-1 Districts, three dwelling units per
gross acre in the R-2 District, and four dwelling units per gross acre in the
R-3 District. Dimensional and density requirements for multi-family dwellings
and townhouses in a planned unit development shall be as indicated for multi-
family dwellings and townhouses in §
152.028 and in this section. No individual subdivision, section, development or
development phase within a planned unit development shall exceed ten dwelling
units per gross acre. Dimensional requirements for nonresidential uses in a
planned unit development shall be those listed for other principal uses in §
152.028 for the district in which the planned unit development is located.
Shopping centers and neighborhood businesses are also permitted in a planned
unit development. Uses allowed in such shopping centers and/or businesses are:
grocery stores, drugstores, laundry and dry cleaning establishments, shoe
repair shops, offices, gift shops, card shops, camera and photography shops,
barber and beauty shops and restaurants. Shopping centers in planned unit
developments must meet the requirements for shopping centers in this section.
   (C)   In addition to the uses allowed in the R-2 and R-3 Districts and
shopping centers, the following uses are allowed in planned unit developments,
provided that the applicant shall establish setback lines for these uses which
shall be recorded in the Register of Deeds’ office, and shall include
regulations for accessory building uses. The setback lines shall be recorded in
the Register of Deeds’ office with the subdivision plats, or separately if the
property is not a subdivision. The regulations for accessory buildings and uses
shall be included within the restrictive covenants for the planned unit
developments. These setbacks and rules when approved as part of the special use
permit shall apply instead of the dimensional requirements and requirements
concerning accessory buildings and uses in this section.
      (1)   Clustered detached single-family dwellings are dwellings in which
the lot size for each individual dwelling may be reduced, but may not be less
than 6,000 square feet, provided that the difference between the required
dimensions for the district, as indicated in §
152.028 and the reduced dimensions, is dedicated to a homeowners’ association
as common open space.
      (2)   Zero lot line dwellings are detached single-family dwellings on
lots without a side yard requirement on one side of the lot. The lot for a zero
lot line dwelling may be reduced, but may not be less than 6,000 square feet,
provided that the difference between the required dimensions for the district,
as indicated in §
152.028, and the reduced dimensions is dedicated to a homeowners’ association
as common open space.
   (D)   In planned unit development projects, 25% or more of the land acre
shall be reserved as common open space. Common areas and common open space
shall be deeded to a homeowners’ association, and the developer or owner shall
file with the Zoning Administrator, and record in the County Register of Deeds’
office a declaration of covenants and restrictions, as well as regulations and
bylaws that will govern the open space. Provisions shall include but not be
limited to the following.
      (1)   The association shall be established before the homes, buildings or
uses are sold.
      (2)   Membership shall be mandatory for each buyer and all successive
buyers, unless another arrangement is approved by the Town Board which
adequately protects the interests of the community and the owners.
      (3)   The association shall be responsible for the liability insurance,
local taxes and maintenance of recreation and other facilities.
      (4)   Any sums levied by the association that remain unpaid shall become
a lien on the individual owner’s property, which shall be subordinate only to
tax and mortgage liens unless another arrangement is approved by the Town Board
which adequately protects the interests of the town and the owners.
      (5)   An owner of each dwelling unit or each homeowner or other building
owner shall have voting rights in an association.
      (6)   Uses of common property shall be appropriately limited.

      (6)   A safe means of ingress and egress shall be provided for all
parking spaces and driveways for uses other than single- and two-family
residential shall be at least 24 feet wide.
      (7)   When off-street parking for more than five vehicles is provided,
the following regulations shall apply in addition to all other regulations in
this chapter:
         (a)   Surfacing.  All such parking lots shall be graded and surfaced
with crush and run, blacktop, concrete, brick or other such surfacing material
to ensure a dustless surface condition. All shopping centers and commercial and
office establishments providing off-street parking for more than 20 vehicles,
and all nonresidential uses in the B-1 District providing off-street parking,
shall have paved parking lots with blacktop, concrete or brick as paving
material.
         (b)   Markings.  Each parking space shall be maintained so as to be
distinguishable.
         (c)   Lighting.  Any lighting shall be so arranged as to direct the
light and glare away from streets and adjacent property.
         (d)   Yards.  All such parking lots shall observe a minimum front yard
of not less than five feet and a side yard on a corner lot of not less than
five feet. Parking lots in residential-agricultural and residential districts
shall have front yards of not less than 15 feet, and side and rear yards of not
less than five feet. Yard surrounding parking lots shall be planted and
maintained in lawn or other appropriate planting, or shall be improved
otherwise in keeping with the charter of adjacent property. When a parking lot
is adjacent to residential-agricultural or residential zoned or used property
and a buffer as defined in §
152.046 is not required, natural planting, hedges or a decorative fence to a
height of at least six feet shall screen the parking lot from the residential
property. In addition, the parking lot shall be landscaped in accordance with §
152.046.
         (e)   Curbs or bumpers.  The required yards shall be set off from
parking areas by either continuous curb or one non-continuous stationary bumper
for each parking space abutting on a yard, which curb or bumper shall not be
less than five inches or more than two feet high.
         (f)   Drainage.  Parking lots shall not drain onto or across public
sidewalks, or into adjacent property except into a natural watercourse of a
drainage easement. In already developed areas where this condition would be
impossible to meet, the Zoning Administrator may exempt the developer from this
requirement, provided that adequate provision is made for drainage.
         (g)   Separation of bumper and walkways.  In the event any parking
stall abuts upon a walkway there shall be a space of three and one-half feet
between the wheel bumper or curb and the edge of the walkway.
         (h)   Entrance and exits.  On all corner lots, all vehicular openings
shall be located at least 20 feet from the point of intersection of the
established street right-of-way lines. No entrance or exit, whether on a corner
lot or not, shall exceed 30 feet in width at the property line or 40 feet at
the curb line. There shall be a minimum distance between driveways of 25 feet
measured along the curb line, unless such driveways are less than five feet
apart.
         (i)   Internal circulation.  Sufficient area shall be provided within
the property lines of the parking lot, exclusive or required yards, so that all
vehicles may enter and leave the lot in a forward motion.
      (8)   Exceptions include the following.
         (a)   The Zoning Administrator may withhold a permit or certificate of
occupancy if a parking layout not specifically prohibited by this section would
be likely to cause avoidable safety or traffic congestion problems until
modification is made. The applicant may appeal the Zoning Administrator’s
decision to the Board of Adjustment under the normal procedure for an appeal.
         (b)   If a peculiar characteristic of an establishment makes the
requirements in this section clearly unrealistic, the Board of Adjustment may
grant the applicant a parking modification.
         (c)   In the Central Business District, the Zoning Administrator may
allow a new use to be established in an existing building even if all parking
requirements of this chapter cannot be met for the new use, provided that as
much off-street parking as can reasonably be provided is provided by the use,
and no foreseeable traffic congestion problems will be created.
      (9)   The minimum number of required off-street parking spaces shall be
calculated as provided in division (B)(10) below. In the case of a building or
use not expressly provided for, the number of off-street spaces shall be the
same as for a similar use or inclusive category which is provided for. Where
there is more than one use in a single structure, or on a single tract, for two
or more instances of the same use, the minimum number of required off-street
parking uses, except for shopping centers which are expressly provided for.
      (10)   The following shall be the minimum number of off-street parking
spaces which shall be provided:

(1992 Code, § 152.120)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.136  APPLICATION.
   (A)   Except for amendments initiated by the Town Board, Planning Board or
Board of Adjustment, no proposed amendment shall be considered by the Town
Board, nor a public hearing held until an application containing the following
information is submitted by the applicant:
      (1)   A statement of the present zoning regulations or district boundary;
      (2)   The name and signature of the applicant; and
      (3)   If an amendment to the zoning map is proposed, the tax parcel

   (B)   The applicant shall provide any additional information related to the
proposed amendment requested in writing by the Zoning Administrator, Planning
Board or Town Board. If the proposed change involves rezoning to a special use
district, the applicant shall simultaneously apply for a special use permit,
and shall, as part of the special use permit application, present a site plan
in accordance with the requirements of §
152.177 of the proposed use for the district, and/or if the request involves
other conditions, a detailed description of the proposed conditions.
   (C)   The Zoning Administrator, Planning Board and Town Board may require
any information and plan details necessary to determine whether the property
will be developed consistent with the purposes of this chapter as a part of the
special use permit application, including any information required in §§

152.078, if the use could be a special or conditional use in the corresponding
district. The Zoning Administrator shall transmit the original application to
the Town Board and a copy to the Planning Board. The original application shall
be filed in the office of the Zoning Administrator after consideration by the
Town Board. A fee in accordance with the town’s fee schedule shall be paid to
the town for each application not initiated by an agency of the town. If a
detailed site plan is not submitted as part of the application for a special
use permit in a special use district, such site plan shall be submitted to and
approved by the Zoning Administrator and/or the Planning Board, and/or the Town
Board, as required by the Town Board as part of the conditions for the special
use permit, before construction can begin.

§ 152.137  PUBLIC HEARING; ZONING CLASSIFICATION ACTION.
   (A)   No amendment shall be adopted by the Town Board of Commissioners until
they have held a public hearing on the amendment, and shall have given the
Planning Board at least 30 days after the public hearing to make a
recommendation concerning the amendment. In the case of a rezoning to a special
use district, the Planning Board shall be given 30 days before the hearing to
review and make a recommendation on both the rezoning and the special use
permit application, and the Town Board shall hold a public hearing on both the
proposed rezoning and the special use permit request. Notice of the hearing
shall be given as follows.
      (1)   Notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the town area at least once a week for two successive calendar
weeks prior to the hearing.
      (2)   The initial notice shall appear not more than 25 days, nor less
than ten days prior to the hearing date. In computing such period, the day of
publication is not to be included, but the day of the hearing shall be
included.
   (B)   Whenever there is a zoning classification action after October 1, 1985
involving a parcel of land, the owner of that parcel of land as shown on the
county tax listing, and the owners of all parcels of land abutting that parcel
of land as shown on the county tax listing, shall be mailed a notice of the
proposed classification by first class mail at the last addresses listed for
such owners on the county tax abstracts. The person or persons mailing such
notices shall certify to the Town Board that fact, and such certificate shall
be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud. This provision shall not apply
when a total rezoning of all property within the corporate boundaries of the
town takes place.
(1992 Code, § 152.122)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.138  EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   (A)   The applicant for a zoning map change to any district other than a
special use district shall be prohibited from offering any testimony or
evidence at the hearing concerning the specific manner in which the property is
to be used or developed.
   (B)   If the applicant believes that development of the property in a
specific manner will lessen adverse effects upon surrounding properties, or
otherwise make the zoning map change more in accordance with the principles
underlying this chapter, the applicant may apply for a zoning map change to the
appropriate special use district and simultaneously apply for a special use
permit, in accordance with §
152.136, and shall specify the nature of the proposed development. No permit
shall be issued for any development within a special use district except in
accordance with an approved special use permit.
(1992 Code, § 152.123)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.139  SPECIAL USE PERMIT REQUESTS AS PART OF CHANGE TO SPECIAL USE
DISTRICT.
   Request for special use permits as part of a requested change to a special
use district shall be processed and considered simultaneously with the zoning
map change requests for the special use district, and the voting procedure
shall be the same as that required for zoning map change requests. Procedures
shall be specified in this subchapter. In considering such application for a
special use permit, the town shall find that the conditions in §
152.061 will be met. If the Town Board should find, after the hearing, that the
proposed special use permit should be granted, the Board may authorize the
issuance of such permit. If the Town Board should find, after the hearing, that
the proposed special permit should not be granted, such proposed permit shall
be denied. In granting a special use permit, the Town Board may impose such
reasonable and appropriate special requirements upon such permit as it may deem
necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this chapter is served,
public welfare secured and substantial justice done. If all requirements and
conditions are accepted by the applicant, the Town Board shall authorize the
issuance of the special use permit; otherwise, the permit shall be denied. Any
special use permit so authorized shall be perpetually binding upon the property
included in such permit unless subsequently changed or amended by the Town
Board after a public hearing by the procedures in this section.

§ 152.140  EFFECT OF DENIAL.
   Once a proposed change to the Zoning Code or Zoning Map, or special use
district is denied by the Town Board, said proposal may not be resubmitted
within a period of two years from the date of denial by the Town Board unless
the Town Board shall first determine in a separate and subsequent resolution
that the circumstances related to a determination of the proper zoning for a
specific area have so substantially changed from the date of the Town Board’s
previous consideration that a petition for rezoning should be accepted, in
which case it will be treated as a new proposal and application.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.141  PROTEST TO ZONING DISTRICT CHANGES.
   (A)   If a petition opposing a change in the zoning classification of any

proposed amendment may be adopted only by a favorable vote of three-fourths of
the Town Board membership.
   (B)   To trigger the three-fourths vote requirement, the petition must:
      (1)   Be signed by the owners of 20% or more either of: the lots included
in a proposed change; the lots within 100 feet of either side or the rear of
the tract to be rezoned; or the lots directly opposite the tract to be rezoned
and extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots;
      (2)   Be in the form of a written petition actually bearing the signature
of the requisite number of property owners, stating that the signers do protest
the proposed change or amendment; and
      (3)   Be received by the Town Administrator/Clerk in sufficient time to
allow the town at least two normal working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays
and legal holidays) before the date established for a public hearing on the
proposed amendment to determine the sufficiency and accuracy of the petition.

   (C)   The initial membership was appointed as follows: one member for one
year; two members for two years; and two members for three years.
   (D)   Town members of the Board may be removed by action of the Town Board

action to be held.
(1992 Code, § 152.135)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.156  PROCEEDINGS; ELECTION OF OFFICERS; HEARINGS.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall elect a chairperson and vice chairperson
who shall serve for one year or until re-elected, or until their successors are

appropriate records of the Board’s proceedings. Current officers shall continue
to serve until the normal time of election of officers. The Board shall adopt
rules and bylaws in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and of G.S.
Chapter 160A, Article 19. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of
the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. The
Chairperson, or in his or her absence, the Vice Chairperson, may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoena. All meetings of the
Board shall be open to the public.
   (B)   The concurring vote for four-fifths of the members of the Board of
Adjustment is necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of any administrative official charged with the enforcement of
this chapter, or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it
is required to pass under this chapter, or to grant a variance from the
provision of this chapter.
   (C)   Hearings by the Board of Adjustment shall be conducted in accordance
with §
152.162.
(1992 Code, § 152.136)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.157  DECISIONS OF BOARD TO BE FILED WITH ZONING ADMINISTRATOR; APPEALS.
   Every decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be filed in the office of
the Zoning Administrator and a written copy thereof shall be delivered to the
appellant by personal service or registered mail. Every decision by the Board
shall be subject to review by Superior Court by proceeding in the nature of
certiorari. Any appeal to the Superior Court shall be taken within 30 days
after the decision of the Board is filed in the office of the Zoning
Administrator, or after a written copy thereof is delivered to the appellant by
personal service or registered mail or certified mail, return receipt
requested, whichever is later.
(1992 Code, § 152.137)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.158  ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power and duty to hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement
of this chapter. An appeal may be taken by a person aggrieved or by an officer,
department, board or bureau of the town. Appeals shall be taken within times
prescribed by the Board of Adjustment by general rule, by filing with the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board of Adjustment, a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the
appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An
appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless
the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment,
after notice of appeal has been filed with him or her, that because of facts
stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent
peril to life or property, or that because the violation charged is transitory
in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of this chapter.
In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order,
which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of record on
application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due
cause shown. The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of the appeal, give due notice thereof to the parties and decide it
within a reasonable time. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly
or partly, or may notify the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from, and shall make any order, requirement, decision or determination
that, in its opinion, ought to be made in the premises. To this end, the Board
shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
(1992 Code, § 152.138)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.159  VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall have any duty to authorize, upon appeal
in specific cases, such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be
contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will, in an individual case,
result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of
this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and
substantial justice done. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring
land, building or structure in the same district, or of permitted or
nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the
requested variance. Such variance may be granted in such individual cases,
unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Board of Adjustment that the
following conditions exist.
      (1)   There are exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece
of property in question because of its shape, size or topography that are not
applicable to other lands or structures in the same district, or there is a
peculiar characteristic of an establishment which makes the parking and/or
loading requirements of this chapter unrealistic.
      (2)   Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant
any special privileges that are denied to other residents in the district in
which the property is located.
      (3)   A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other residents of the
district in which the property is located.
      (4)   The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and
intent of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the
general welfare.
      (5)   The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the
applicant.
      (6)   The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make
possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
      (7)   The variance is not a request to permit a use which is not a
permitted or conditional use in the district involved.
   (B)   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards to ensure that substantial justice has
been done and that the public safety and welfare has been assured. Such
conditions may be imposed by the Board regarding the location, character and
other features of the proposed building, structure or use as may be deemed by
the Board to protect property values and general welfare of the neighborhood.
Nonconformance with such conditions and safeguards, when part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter.
(1992 Code, § 152.139)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)  Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.160  BOARD TO DETERMINE AND GRANT CONDITIONAL USES.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power and duty to hear and decide
whether to allow specific conditional uses to be established in the districts
indicated; to decide such questions as are involved in determining whether a
conditional use should be granted; to grant conditional uses with such
conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this chapter, or to deny
conditional uses when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this
chapter. Application for conditional uses shall be decided in accordance with
the provisions of this subchapter, §§
152.060 through
152.078 and §§
152.175 through
152.187.
(1992 Code, § 152.140)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.161  BOARD TO INTERPRET ZONING MAP.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power and duty to interpret the
Official Zoning Map in accordance with §
152.023.
(1992 Code, § 152.141)  (Ord. passed 11- -1988)
§ 152.162  BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT TO CONDUCT HEARINGS ON APPEALS, VARIANCES AND
CONDITIONAL USES; TOWN BOARD TO CONDUCT HEARINGS ON SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   The applicant shall submit the appropriate appeal for administration
review or for a variance, or an application for a special or conditional use
permit accompanied by a site plan prepared in accordance with §
152.177 in the number of copies established by and along with any other
information required by the Zoning Administrator for proper review of the
application. The Board of Adjustment or Town Board of Commissioners for special
uses shall cause a public hearing to be held on the application, and shall give
due notice of the hearing to the parties involved.
   (B)   In the case of a special use permit application or a mobile home park,
the Planning Board shall be given 30 days to review the application before the
hearing. The hearing shall not be held until a Planning Board recommendation
has been received or 30 days have elapsed. The Planning Board shall give due
notice to the applicant of any meetings at which the application will be
considered.
   (C)   The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the general law and
court decisions of the state. More specifically, any interested party must be
given the opportunity to present evidence or testimony, to cross-examine
witnesses, to inspect documents, and to offer evidence or testimony in
explanation or rebuttal. Findings shall be based on substantial evidence or
testimony which is competent, relevant and material. Findings as to the
existence or nonexistence of crucial facts shall be based on sworn evidence or
testimony unless the party or parties before the Board stipulate the facts or
waive this requirement. Although a four-fifths majority is necessary for the
Board of Adjustment to grant a permit, the Town Board does not have to meet
this requirement in issuing special use permits. The Administrator/Clerk of the
Board of Adjustment shall keep minutes of the proceedings, showing the vote of
each member upon every question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating
that fact.
   (D)   A fee in accordance with the town’s fee schedule shall be paid for
each application, for an administrative review, for variance or special or
conditional use permit not initiated by an officer or agency of the town, to
cover costs of advertising and other administrative expenses involved. No
application will be processed until the above fee has been paid.
