   The governing body, after a removal hearing and an affirmative vote of five
of its members, may remove from office a member of the Town Council or the

Carolina Constitution. A member of the Town Council or the Mayor may initiate
removal by making, at a meeting of the governing body, a motion calling for the
removal of an officer. The motion shall specify the grounds on which removal is
sought. The Town Clerk shall cause written notice of the motion and a copy of
the charges to be given to the officer against whom removal is sought at least
10 days before the removal hearing. At the removal hearing, the officer shall

shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 160A-63, provided
that any officer so appointed must meet the qualification requirements of
Section 3-7 of this Charter.
Section 6-2. Recall.
   The Mayor and members of the Town Council are subject to removal pursuant to
this section. An officer is removed upon the filing of a sufficient recall
petition and the affirmative vote of a majority of those voting on the question
of removal at a recall election. A recall petition shall be filed with the Town
Clerk, who shall immediately forward the petition to the board of elections
that conducts elections for the Town of Lewisville. A petition to recall the
Mayor or a member of the Town Council shall bear the signatures equal in number
to at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the registered voters of the Town of
Lewisville. The board of elections shall verify the petition signatures. If a
sufficient recall petition is submitted, the board of elections shall certify
its sufficiency to the governing body, and the governing body shall adopt a
resolution calling for a recall election to be held not less than 60 days nor
more than 100 days after the petition has been certified to the governing body.
The election may be held by itself or at the same time as any other general or
special election within the period established in this section, and shall be
held as otherwise provided in G.S. 163-287. The board of elections shall
conduct the recall election. The proposition submitted to the voters shall be
substantially in the following form:
FOR the recall of [name of officer]
AGAINST the recall of [name of officer]
The registered voters of the Town of Lewisville are eligible to vote in an
election to recall the Mayor or a member of the Town Council.
If less than a majority of the votes cast on the question are for the officer's
recall, the officer continues in office. If a majority of the votes cast on the
question are for the officer's recall, the officer is removed on the date the
board of elections certifies the results of the election. A vacancy created by
removal of a member of the Town Council or the Mayor shall be filled in
accordance with the provisions of G.S. 160A-63, provided that any officer so
appointed must meet the qualification requirements set forth in Section 3-7 of
this Charter.
No petition to recall an officer may be filed within six months after the

expiration of the officer's term. No more than one election may be held to
recall an officer within a single term of office of that officer.

of the Town of Lewisville. The vote on the proposed ordinance or the referred

adoption of the approved form of government as the government of the Town of
Lewisville.

approve the repeal of the referred ordinance, it is repealed on the date the

recreational facilities be used for the benefit of its residents, the enjoyment
of family-oriented activities, and the enrichment of the town’s culture.
   B.   Basic policy. The Lewisville Town Council desires to continue the
historical use of the G. Galloway Reynolds Community Center in as much as is
practical and beneficial to the town. In order to establish authorization and
fees for use of this public facility, the Town Council directs the Town Manager
to maintain standard policies and procedures designed to accommodate fair

persons without discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, sex,

   D.   Historical use. In 1978, the G. Galloway Reynolds Community Center was
built by the Lewisville Community Center Board, Incorporated, as the Lewisville
Community Center. The Center was built to serve as a civic building for the
Lewisville community, Forsyth County, North Carolina, to be used principally by
nonprofit, charitable organizations, such as the Lewisville Civic Club, school
groups, garden clubs, scouting groups, and other such organizations whose
activities benefit the community at large, in order to assist the organizations
in the performance of their charitable functions. (Articles of Incorporation of
Lewisville Community Center, Inc., 03-08-1976)
   E.   User fees. Fees for renting the G. Galloway Reynolds Community Center
are set annually in the budget. Fees are required upon rental application

attributable to the user’s abuse, the cleaning deposit will be forfeited. If
damage exceeds the deposit, additional costs will be incurred by the renter/
user.
   F.   User fee exemptions.  Organizations may be exempted from the payment of
user fees and deposits as approved by the Town Council. Exemption requests will
be reviewed by the Special Projects Review Committee. Upon completion of review
by the Special Projects Review Committee, a recommendation will be made to Town

harmless from any and all liability caused by the user’s negligence during

liability insurance as determined, on a case by case basis, by the Town Manager
or designee. No sub- contracting is allowed.

opportunity, at the beginning of each fiscal year, to reserve the Community
Center for its programs, followed by scouting organizations, the Lewisville
Civic Club, and other recurring, nonprofit, or government users. Users can
reserve the facility, based on availability, on a first come, first served
basis. The town reserves the right to suspend usage for maintenance.
   I.   Reservations. Those desiring use of the G. Galloway Reynolds Community
Center must fill out a rental application and submit it, with appropriate fees,
to an official at Town Hall. Reservation dates and times may be changed by
renters/users prior to the event, subject to availability. Refunds will be
given according to the Cancellation Policy. Exempt organizations and paid
reservations have priority over non-reserved use.

by the organization and a responsible party named. Refunds will be refunded to

§ 16-15 SPECIAL EVENTS OPERATING POLICY.
   Organizations hosting large events at Shallowford Square are required to
meet the following provisions:
   A.   A site plan for the event will be required and submitted to Town Hall
for approval including a time table of arrival and departure of equipment. The
site plan includes where and when activities will be conducted, parking, vendor
locations and any other required information.
   B.   Law enforcement may be required depending on the type and size of the
event, whether streets are to be closed and/or the duration of the event. The
charge per deputy is set by the Sheriff’s Department and is on the town’s Fee
Schedule. A minimum of 2 deputies are required. If deputies are required, it
will be the user/renter’s responsibility to contact Lewisville Town Hall to
make arrangements. A community policing officer must sign the rental
application form confirming law enforcement coverage and that form must be
returned to Town Hall 30 days prior to the event.
      1.   Additional officers will be required for crowds in excess of 300
attendees. The exact number will be based on the crowd size and at the
discretion of the Town Manager and/or Lewisville deputies.
      2.   Events where streets will be closed require at least 2 deputies.
Others will be required at the discretion of the Town Manager and/or Lewisville
deputies.
      3.   Events where a crowd of more than 500 is expected, at least 2
deputies are required. The exact number of deputies will be determined at the
discretion of the Town Manager based on expected attendance.
   C.   1.   Portable toilets may be required depending on the size of the
crowd expected to attend the event and the duration of the event. Verification
of the vendor being used must be provided to Town Hall 1 week prior to the
event.
      2.   Events with crowd estimates that exceed 300 attendees and that will
continue for more than 3 hours require portable toilet facilities. The number
required is related to the number of attendees and is set at the discretion of
the Town Manager.
   D.   1.   If streets are to be closed, the Lewisville Fire Department must
be notified and sign off on such closures. Event organizers should check with
fire officials regarding requirements related to tent sizes, fire extinguishers
and the need to have emergency personnel in attendance. A Fire Department
official also must sign approval on the rental application form.
      2.    If the crowd is estimated to be 2,000 or more, a medical stand-by
must also be approved by the Lewisville Fire Department and the approval
submitted along with the site plan.
   E.   1.   As Shallowford Square is located adjacent to residential property,
user/renters are required to keep noise levels as reasonable as possible. The
intended audience should be those in Shallowford Square, and not the community
at large.
      2.   Square operating hours. The acceptable sound level for events during
regular square hours will be 80 decibels with readings taken at the
intersection of David McKee Street and Belnette Drive. Based on crowd size and
weather conditions, the Town Manager and deputies will have some discretion in
determining what constitutes excessive noise. Event organizers may be asked to
turn the sound down and noncompliance may result in loss of power.
      3.   Events must end at 10:00 p.m. unless the event is town-sponsored. If
an event is to extend beyond that time, permission to continue must be obtained
in advance from the Town Manager. The Town Manager or deputies also will have
discretion in determining if the noise level is excessive for the number of
attendees and the hour. User/renters will be asked to turn the sound levels
down. Not complying may result in an event being shut down.
   F.   1.   While exempt organizations are allowed to reserve town facilities
at no charge, should there be a change of plans and an event cancelled, the
town staff should be notified if possible so the facility is available to other
users. If the renter notifies the town 2 to 4 weeks in advance, only 1/2 of the
fee (based on regular rental rates per hour) will be charged. If the event is
cancelled less than 2 weeks in advance, the full fee will be charged. When an
event is cancelled due to inclement weather or some other “act of God,” no
charge will be levied.
      2.   If the inclement weather is considered a weather emergency, the
following persons are authorized to cancel the event: Events Coordinator, Fire
Chief, on-site deputy, or Town Manager or designee.
   G.   The user/renter is responsible, as spelled out in the rental agreement,
for all cleanup and repairs. A $200 cleaning deposit is required unless the
user is on the town’s exempt list. If the facility is left dirty or in
disrepair and the charges exceed the cleaning deposit, the additional funds
will be assessed against the user/renter.
   H.   Organizations or groups who are not charged a rental fee or cleaning
deposit to use town facilities are also responsible for clean up and repairs.
Failure to do so will prohibit the user from rent free use of the facility
until payment to cover clean up or repair expenses are made.
   I.   All operating policies for Shallowford Square are in effect.
   J.   If none of the conditions above apply to your event, the special events
rental form will not be required. Copies of the special events rental form are
on file at the town office.
   K.   The term Town Manager as used herein shall include a designee if the
Town Manager is not available.
(Res. 2003046, passed 09-11-2003)
   L.   All rental applications are available at Town Hall or on the town’s
website for downloading and printing. Rentals must be made in person.
   M.   User/renters of large events and user/renters of events open-to-the-

§ 22-12 PUBLIC HEARINGS ON CONDEMNATION OF FARMLAND.
   A.   Condemnation proceedings. No state or local public agency or

the Advisory Board to hold a public hearing on the proposed condemnation.
   B.   Procedure.
      1.   The Advisory Board shall have 30 days after receiving a request to
hold the public hearing and submit its findings and recommendations to the
agency requesting the condemnation.

         a.   Whether the need for the property has been satisfactorily
established by the agency or unit of government involved, including a review of
any fiscal impact analysis conducted by the agency involved; and
         b.   Whether there are alternatives to the proposed action that have
less impact and are less disruptive to the agricultural activities of the
district within which the proposed action is to take place.
      3.   The Advisory Board shall consult with the county cooperative
extension director, the natural resources conservation service district
conservationist, and any other individuals, agencies, or organizations deemed
by the Advisory Board to be necessary for its review of the proposed action.

meaning.
      ALARM. Any electronic or mechanical device which omits any signal,
whether electronic, audible, silent, or recorded, and which is designed,
intended, or used for the detection of an unauthorized intrusion or an
attempted intrusion into a building, structure, or premises or to signal an
actual or attempted robbery. Shall include any device which initiates a
telephone call and delivers a recorded message to any emergency telephone
number assigned to the designated police communications center of the Town of
Lewisville; any procedure by which a third party telephones any emergency
telephone number and requests service on the basis of having received an alarm
signal from a subscriber of the person or an alarm business represented by the
person; or an audible signal or siren that when sounded is detected by a third
party that results in a police response.
      ALARM TEST. Alarms activated during alarm system testing procedures.
      AUTHORIZED ALARM TEST. Alarm testing procedures noticed and acknowledged
by the Town of Lewisville prior to conduct of testing.
      FALSE ALARM. Any alarm signal communicated by any means that solicits
police response and to which; the responding officer finds no evidence of
unauthorized intrusion, attempted unauthorized intrusion, robbery, or attempted
robbery; or police response was canceled by the alarm subscriber or his or her
agent. FALSE ALARM includes negligently activated signals; signals which are
the result of faulty or malfunctioning equipment, and signals which are
purposely activated to summon police personnel in non-emergency situations.
      SUBSCRIBER. Any person, firm, corporation, or partnership owning or
leasing an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for
the protection of the premises or property.
   B.   False alarms.

period, the Forsyth County Sheriff's Deputies report that they have responded
to 3 false alarms at the same premises or location, the Town Manager or his or
her designee, shall send a letter to the subscriber informing him or her of the
false alarms and requesting that he or she initiate action to stop further
false alarms and informing him or her of the consequence of continued false
alarms, specifically the civil penalty fee. There will be no fee assessed for

continuous activation.
   D.   Issuance of tickets and civil penalties.
      1.   Any town official authorized by the Town Manager may issue to the
known owner of or person having control of any place of business or residence a
civil penalty citation giving notice of the violation of divisions B. or C.
above. Any such official shall be authorized to secure the name and address of
the owner or person in control of the place of business or residence found to
be in violation of exceeding the number of false alarms allowed.
      2.   Citations so issued may be delivered in person or mailed by
registered mail to the person charged if he or she cannot readily be found.
Each citation issued shall impose upon the owner or person in charge a civil
penalty of $50 which shall be paid to the Town Revenue Collector within 14 days
of receipt in full satisfaction of the assessed civil penalty. If the civil
penalty is not paid within the time prescribed in the citation, the appropriate
personnel of the town may initiate a civil action in the nature of debt to
collect the civil penalty.

§ 30-2 PETITIONERS’ COMMITTEE.
   In each initiative referendum or recall petition there shall be named a

§ 30-3 REFERENDUM PETITIONS; SUSPENSION OF ORDINANCE AFTER FILING.
   When, within the time allowed, a referendum petition is filed with the Town
Clerk, the ordinance to which that petition is directed shall immediately be

§ 30-4 INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, AND RECALL PETITIONS; FORM AND SUFFICIENCY.
   A.   Initiative, referendum, and recall petitions shall be governed by the
rules regarding form and sufficiency set out in this section.
   B.   The signatures to a petition shall be executed in ink or indelible
pencil and need not all be affixed to 1 paper, but all papers of a petition
shall be of uniform size and style and shall be assembled as 1 instrument for
filing with the Town Clerk. Each signature shall be followed by the address of
the signer. Petitions or petition papers which reasonably comply with these
requirements shall be accepted by the Clerk without delay upon presentation and
their filing shall be completed by the Clerk’s acceptance. Noncomplying
petitions or papers may be rejected by the Clerk until they are brought into
reasonable compliance.
   C.   The Clerk shall not accept any petition until it indicates:
      1.   By name and address, the petitioners who constitute the petitioners’
committee for that petition; and
      2.   The address to which all notices for the petitioners’ committee are
to be sent.
   D.   Any petition shall be certified or determined insufficient which:
      1.   Is validly signed by less than the required number of registered
voters of the town;
      2.   Proposed, or requests repeal of, an ordinance not subject to the
power under which the petitioners are proceeding;
      3.   If a referendum petition is not filed within the time allowed by the
Charter; or
      4.   If a recall petition seeks the removal of an official not subject to
recall under the Charter.
   E.   No signature on a petition paper shall be counted in support of the
petition involved if that paper:
      1.   Being part of an initiative petition, has not contained or had
attached to it throughout its circulation the full text of the proposed
ordinance;
      2.   Being part of a referendum petition, has not contained throughout
its circulation a clear, concise designation and description of the ordinance
concerned; or
      3.   Being part of a recall petition has not contained or had attached to
it throughout its circulation a copy of the recall petition identifying the
Council member concerned and stating the grounds alleged for his or her
removal.
   F.   No signature on a petition paper shall be counted in support of the
petition involved if that paper at the time of filing does not have attached to
it an affidavit, executed by the circulator of that paper, to the effect:
      1.   That he or she personally circulated the paper;
      2.   That each signature on the paper was affixed in his or her presence;
      3.   That he or she believes each signature to be the genuine signature
of the person whose name it purports to be;
      4.   If an initiative petition is concerned, that the full text of the
proposed measure was attached to or contained in the accompanying paper
throughout its circulation, and that each signer of the accompanying paper had
an opportunity before signing to read the full text of the ordinance attached;
      5.   If a referendum petition is concerned, that a clear, concise
designation of the ordinance concerned was attached to or contained in the
accompanying paper throughout its circulation and that each signer of the
accompanying paper had an opportunity before signing to read the designation
and description of the ordinance in question; and
      6.   If a recall petition is concerned, that a copy of the recall
petition was attached to or contained in accompanying paper throughout its
circulation, and that each signer of the accompanying paper had an opportunity
before signing to read the full text.
   G.   Upon receipt of a petition that complies with the requirements of
divisions B. and C. above, the Clerk shall examine the petition to determine
whether, on its face, it is insufficient under divisions D.1., D.2., or D.3.
above. If he or she finds the petition insufficient on its face for any of
these reasons, he or she shall so certify to the Town Council at the next
regular Council meeting occurring not sooner than 5 days after the filing of
the petition, and the determination shall be subject to review in the manner
provided in § 30-5E. If he or she does not find the petition insufficient for
these reasons, the Clerk shall determine which signatures on the petition
papers may be counted in support of the petition under § 30-4E. and F. He or
she shall then clearly mark the signatures that may be so counted. Within 10
days after the filing of the petition, he or she shall deliver the petition
papers with signatures marked to the Forsyth County Board of Elections for a
checking of the marked signatures against the registration books. The Board of
Elections shall complete its check within 15 days after receipt of the petition
papers; except that the Board shall not be obligated to conduct a check in any
30-day period immediately preceding, or in any 30-day period immediately
following, any election conducted by the Forsyth County Board of Elections.
Upon completion of its check, the Board of Elections shall forthwith certify to
the Town Council: the total number of registered voters of the town at the time
of receipt of the petition by the Town Clerk based on the most recent monthly
report received by the Forsyth County Board of Elections; and the number of
voters registered in the town whose signatures, marked by the Clerk, appear on
the petition papers that the Board found it necessary to examine. If it was
found unnecessary to check all names on the petition papers, this fact shall be
indicated on the certificate. The petition papers shall be returned to the Town
Clerk by the Board of Elections together with its certificate executed by the
Chairperson.
§ 30-5 INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, AND RECALL PETITIONS; PROCEDURE AFTER FILING.
   A.   Within 5 days after the return of the petition papers by the County
Board of Elections, the Town Clerk shall complete a certificate as to whether
the petition is sufficient for reasons other than those addressed by the Board
of Elections certificate. If the Clerk certifies a petition insufficient, his
or her certificate shall show the particulars wherein the petition is
defective. As soon as he or she has completed his or her certificate, the Clerk
shall notify the committee of petitioners of the contents of the Clerk’s
certificate and the Board of Elections certificate (the "Certificates"). If a
petition is certified sufficient by the Clerk and the Board of Elections, the
Clerk shall present his or her certificate to the Town Council at its next
meeting and that certificate shall be a final determination as to the
sufficiency of the petition. If a petition certified sufficient is a recall
petition, the Clerk shall also give written notice of the action taken to the
Council member whose removal is sought. If a petition is certified insufficient
under § 30-4D.1., a majority of the committee of petitioners may elect to amend
the petition; but if a majority does not so elect to amend the petition, the
Clerk shall present the Certificates to the Council at its next meeting and
that certificate shall be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the
petition.
   B.   If a majority of the committee of petitioners elects to amend the
petition, then within 10 days after notice of the contents of the Certificates,
the committee may file, for purposes of amendment, a supplementary petition
upon additional papers. The supplementary petition shall be governed by the
same requirements as an original petition with respect to such matters as
uniformity and assembly of papers, listing of the petitioners’ committee, text
or designation and description of measures, circulation affidavits, the writing
and counting but not the number of signatures; and the Clerk shall proceed as
in the case of an original petition. Within 2 days after receipt of a
supplementary petition complying with the requirements of § 30-4B. and C., the
Clerk shall deliver the supplementary petition papers to the Forsyth County
Board of Elections for a checking of the marked signatures against the
registration books. The Board of Elections shall complete its check within 5
business days after receipt of the petition papers; except that the Board shall
not be obligated to conduct a check in any 30-day period immediately preceding,
or in any 10-day period immediately following, any election conducted by the
Forsyth County Board of Elections. Upon completion of this check, the Board of
Elections shall forthwith certify to the Town Council the number of voters
registered in the town whose signatures, marked by the Clerk, appear on the
supplementary petition papers that the Board found it necessary to examine. If
it was found unnecessary to check all names on the supplementary papers, this
fact shall be indicated in the certificate. The supplementary petition papers
shall be returned to the Town Clerk by the Board of Elections together with the
certificate.
   C.   Within 2 days after the return of the supplementary petition papers by
the Board of Elections, the Clerk shall complete a second certificate as to
whether the original petition, as amended by the supplementary petition, is
sufficient. If the Clerk certifies the amended petition insufficient, his or
her second certificate shall show the particulars wherein the petition is still
defective. As soon as he or she has completed his or her second certificate,
the Clerk shall notify the petitioners’ committee of the contents of the Board
of Elections certificate and the Clerk’s certificate and shall present that
certificate to the Council at its next meeting and that certificate shall be a
final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition.
   D.   If a petition has been certified insufficient and there is no election
to amend it, or if an amended petition is certified insufficient, the Clerk
shall present the Board of Elections’ latest certificate and his or her latest
certificate on the petition to the Council at its next meeting.
   E.   If, in any 1 of the ways provided in this section, a final
determination has been made that a petition is insufficient, that determination
shall be subject to judicial review, but no further action shall be taken on
the petition unless the reviewing court directs otherwise. Such a final
determination, even if sustained upon review, shall not prejudice the filing of
a new petition for the same purposes.
§ 30-6 CONSIDERATION BY THE TOWN COUNCIL AND SUBMISSION TO THE VOTERS.
   A.   When the Town Council has been presented with, or has an initiative or
referendum petition which has been finally determined sufficient in accordance
with the preceding sections, it shall proceed at once to consider that
petition. If an initiative petition is concerned, the ordinance it proposes
shall at once be introduced and shall undergo all other procedures required for
ordinances of the same kind, however, not later than 30 days after the date on
which the petition proposing the ordinance is finally determined to be
sufficient, the Council shall complete its consideration of the proposed
ordinance and shall adopt it with or without amendment or reject it. If a
referendum petition is concerned, the ordinance to which that petition is
directed shall be reconsidered by the Council and, not later than 30 days after
the date on which the referendum petition was finally determined sufficient,
the Council shall repeal or sustain the ordinance.
   B.   If the Council fails to adopt, or adopts with amendment, a proposed
initiative ordinance, or if the Council fails to repeal an ordinance
reconsidered pursuant to a referendum petition, it shall submit the originally
proposed initiative ordinance or refer the reconsidered ordinance concerned to
the voters of the town.
   C.   When the Council has been presented with, or has a recall petition
which has been finally determined sufficient in accordance with the preceding
sections of this chapter, it shall thereupon fix a day for holding a recall
election after consultation with the Forsyth County Board of Elections, unless,
prior to Council consideration of the matter, the Council member whose removal
is sought has resigned and his or her resignation has been accepted by the
Council.
   D.   Any such initiative, referendum, or recall election shall be held not
sooner than 60 days and not later than 75 days after the petition has been
finally determined sufficient unless the election would occur within 30 days of
any election at which registered voters in the Town of Lewisville could vote,
in which case the election hereunder can be consolidated with the previously
scheduled election. It may be held at the same time as any other general or
special election within the period, but if no other election is to be held
within the period the Council shall call a special initiative, referendum, or
recall election (or combination thereof).
§ 30-7 BALLOTS FOR INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, AND RECALL ELECTIONS.
   A.   Any initiative or referendum ordinance to be voted on in accordance
with this Charter shall be presented for voting by ballot title. The ballot
title shall be prepared by the Town Attorney. The ballot title may differ from
the legal title and shall be a clear, concise statement describing the
substance of the ordinance without argument or prejudice. If the ballot used in
voting is a paper ballot, it shall have below the ballot title the following
instructions: "Place a cross (x) in only one of the squares below." Below this
instruction shall appear, in the order indicated, the following propositions:
"For the Ordinance" and "Against the Ordinance." Immediately at the left of
each of the 2 propositions set out, there shall be a square in which by making
a cross (x) the voter may cast his or her vote.
   B.   The ballots used in a recall election, if a paper ballot is used, shall
contain the following instructions: "Place a cross (x) in one of the squares
below." Below the instruction shall appear, in the order indicated, the
following propositions: "For the Recall of _____" and "Against the Recall of
_____." Immediately at the left of each of the 2 propositions thus set out,
there shall be a square in which by making a cross (x) the voter may cast his
or her vote.
   C.   If voting machines are used for an initiative, referendum, or recall
election, the ballot title shall have below it the same 2 propositions
appropriate to its nature as prescribed for the paper ballot, 1 above the other
or 1 preceding the other, in the order indicated, and the voter shall have an
opportunity to vote in favor of either of the 2 propositions and thereby to
vote his or her preference.
   D.   Any number of initiative, referendum, or recall proposals may be voted
on at the same election and may appear on the same ballot. Paper ballots used
for voting on 1 or more of the proposals shall be used for that purpose only.
If more than 1 proposal appears on the same paper ballot or if voted on by
paper ballot at the same election, each 1 shall be presented for voting with
ballot title, instruction, propositions, and voting squares as prescribed for
single proposals. If voting machines are used, each proposal shall be presented
for voting as prescribed for single proposals on voting machines.
§ 30-8 WITHDRAWAL OF INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM PETITIONS.
   A.   A petitioners’ committee may withdraw an initiative or referendum
petition at any time after the Town Council, if an initiative petition is
concerned, has finally rejected or has adopted with amendment the ordinance
proposed; or, if to repeal the ordinance to which the petition is directed; but
the Town Clerk shall retain the petition papers as part of the official records
of the town; provided, however, in no event may the petition be withdrawn later
than the fifteenth day immediately preceding the day scheduled for a vote in
the town on the proposal concerned.
   B.   No petition shall be withdrawn except by written request for its
withdrawal filed with the Council within the time limits prescribed for
withdrawal and signed by at least 80% of the members of the petitioners’
committee for that petition. The filing of the request immediately withdraws
the petition and there shall be no further action on or under that petition and
no town vote or further action pursuant to the petition on the proposal
concerned.
   C.   If a person subject to a recall petition resigns prior to the election
on the recall petition then the recall election shall be canceled.
§ 30-9 RESULTS OF ELECTION.
   A.   If a majority of the voters of the town voting upon a proposed
initiative ordinance shall vote in favor of it, the ordinance involved shall
thereupon be an ordinance of the town. A referred ordinance not approved by a
majority of the voters voting on it shall thereupon be repealed.
   B.   If a majority of the votes cast on the question of recalling a Council
member be against his or her recall, he or she shall continue in office for the
remainder of the unexpired term, but subject to recall as before. If a majority
of the votes be for the recall of the Council member designated on the ballot,
he or she shall be removed from office.
   C.   If a Council member in regard to whom a sufficient recall petition is
submitted to the Council shall resign before the election and his or her
resignation be accepted by the Council, or shall be removed as a result
thereof, the vacancy shall be filled in the manner provided in the Charter for
filling vacancies in the office, except as otherwise provided in division D.
below. But a Council member removed by the voters as the result of a recall
election, or resigning after a sufficient petition for his or her recall has
been submitted to the Council shall not be reelected to fill the vacancy caused
by his or her own removal or resignation.
   D.   If the recall of a majority of the members of the Town Council,
including the Mayor as 1 of the members, shall be effected at a single recall
election, the successors of the Council members recalled shall be elected by
the registered, qualified voters of the town at a special municipal election,
and the successors shall serve for the unexpired part of the term of the
Council members recalled. The members of the Town Council who have not been
recalled are empowered to call the special election and to make all necessary
provisions regarding the same in conformity with the constitution and general
laws of North Carolina. If the recall of all of the members of the Town
Council, including the Mayor, shall be effected at a single recall election,
they shall be continued in office for the sole purpose of calling a special
municipal election for the election of their successors as above provided; and
of ascertaining and declaring the results thereof.
§ 30-10 PUBLICATION OF ORDINANCES; REPEAL AND AMENDMENT; CONFLICTS.
   A.   Ordinances adopted under the initiative procedure by the Town Council
or by the voters of the town shall be published and shall take effect as
prescribed for ordinances generally.
   B.   Any ordinance so adopted and any ordinance approved by the voters of
the town under the initiative procedure may be amended or repealed by the
Council as are other ordinances of like nature.
   C.   If 2 or more clearly conflicting ordinances are adopted or approved at
the same town election, then as soon as practicable thereafter, the Council
shall enact the amendments or repeals or both as may be necessary to remove the
conflicts between these ordinances. In making these amendments or repeals or
both, the Council shall preserve, and wherever possible preserve intact, the
provisions of that ordinance which, among those in conflict, was adopted or
approved by the greatest number of affirmative voters.

§ 31-7 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS IMPROVEMENTS POLICY AND REGULATION.
   A.   Purpose. The general purpose of the Streets and Sidewalks Improvements
Policy and Regulation (SSIPR) is to provide information and guidance with
respect to maintaining and assuming maintenance for roads which have been
accepted for maintenance by the town or previously maintained by the North
Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT). The SSIPR provides information
to citizens and guidance to the town staff necessary for the continued general
improvement of the town’s publicly-maintained streets systems. The SSIPR also
expresses the Town Council’s desire to allocate the appropriate resources to
the continued improvement of public travelways. The standards for acceptance of
privately-maintained roads which are offered to the town to accept for
maintenance are governed by §§ 31-1 through 31-5.
   B.   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions

owner of property and vest it in the possessor of the power against the will of

      LOCAL RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION ROAD; CUL-DE-SAC. Very short road, open at
1 end only, with a special provision for turning around. Road has a bulb end
design with a specific turning radii and a limited number of lots. Does not

   C.   General policies.
      1.   The general policy concerning the overall streets program is that
the town will maintain a plan of continued improvement and maintenance of the
town’s public transportation systems. The basis of this overall policy provides
for the construction, reconstruction, repair, and maintenance of streets,
sidewalks, walkways, bikeways, and storm drainage systems related to travelways
at either the full cost of the town, assessment of property owners as
specifically established in this chapter, or voluntary financial participation
by property owners.
      2.   The policy provides provisions allowing the financial participation
of property owners at their request (petition).
      3.   The town’s maintenance plan shall provide for proper maintenance
necessary to meet the defined or designated service levels.
   D.   Permanent improvements for existing streets.
      1.   It shall be the policy of the town to resurface all paved streets
which are maintained by the town or are accepted for maintenance in the future
with the cost of paving being borne entirely by the town.
      2.   It shall also be the policy of the town to install curb and gutter
and storm water drainage on all downtown streets where needed for the proper
maintenance of the street and control of storm water.
      3.   The Town Council may find that the installation of curb, gutter, and
storm water drainage is necessary on an existing paved street or in connection
with the paving of an unpaved street, and may order the installation of the
curb and gutter and storm water drainage system with an appropriate amount of
the cost, as determined or approved by the Town Council, of these facilities
being assessed against the abutting property owners in accordance with the
provisions of G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10.
      4.   The town shall determine the priority of streets for improvement
except where a valid assessment petition is received in compliance with G.S.
Chapter 160A, Article 10, from the property owners on a street. Street
improvements so petitioned shall be given priority based on total cost to the
town of all prioritized transportation improvement projects. In cases where
more than 1 valid assessment petition is received, priority shall be determined
by the date the petition was received by the town.
   E.   Waiver of assessment requirement. The Town Council may waive all or
part of the assessment requirements of this chapter where a federal or state
grant has been awarded and the funds from the grant will pay the portion of the
project costs which normally would have been assessed.
   F.   Limitation of town’s cost sharing. The town shall not share in the cost
of street paving and related facilities to serve developments which are subject
to the Forsyth County subdivision regulations. The town shall not share in the
costs of street facilities where a person, firm, or corporation owns more than
1 established building lot on a street. In such cases, 1 lot on the street
shall be treated under division D. above for assessment purposes and the
remaining lots will be assessed the total cost of the improvements on a front-
foot basis.
   G.   Sidewalk installations.
      1.   The Town Council declares it to be the policy of the town to
participate in the costs of sidewalk installations to the extent of 1/2 the
total cost, provided funds are available under current appropriations. This
section shall apply to sidewalks on existing streets and new streets and shall
apply both for new sidewalks and for existing sidewalks.
      2.   Sidewalks shall be constructed of an approved standard concrete with
a minimum width of 4 feet and a minimum thickness of 4 inches except across a
driveway in which case the minimum thickness shall be 6 inches. A dirt planting
strip may be reserved between the sidewalk and the back of the curb. Where no
curb exists then there shall be set by the Town Manager a distance away from
the center of the street taking into consideration the probable width between
curbs that the street will eventually be constructed depending on the amount
and type of traffic.
      3.   Major repair or replacement of defective sidewalks shall be at the
expense of the town unless the town determines that the needed repair or
replacement is the fault of willful damage or negligence attributed directly to
the property owner(s).
      4.   Sidewalk damage, as determined by the town to be the result of
willful damage or negligence by the property owner(s) shall be repaired at the
expense of the property owner(s) involved. The property owner may, after
receiving written permission of the town, repair the sidewalk with all repairs
meeting the town’s standards for construction and repair of sidewalks. Property
owner(s) will be notified of the town’s intent to repair damaged sidewalks with
the cost of repair to be borne by the property owner(s). Actual cost of repairs
will be charged to the property owner(s) and if payment is not received within
90 days the unpaid amount shall become a lien upon the property and shall be
collected in the same manner as provided for the collection of delinquent taxes
(G.S. § 160A-193).
      5.   The town shall determine the priority of sidewalk improvement
projects except where a valid assessment petition is received in compliance
with G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10, from the property owners on a street.
Sidewalk improvements so petitioned shall be given priority based on total cost
to the town of all prioritized transportation improvement projects. In cases
where more than 1 valid assessment petition is received, priority shall be
determined by the date the petition was received by the town.
   H.   Improvement of private driveways. The Town Manager shall not perform
any work, use any labor or material, nor authorize any expenditure of funds on
any private driveway serving any individual property in the town, either where
curbing is already installed or where curbing is not installed, except where
full settlement and payment in full is made by the individual property owner
served or that a public good can be demonstrated and/or served.
   I.   Petitions for curbs, gutters, and storm drains. Prior to the acceptance
of any street which is offered for dedication to the public after 03-02-1995,
the Town Manager shall have in his or her possession a petition pursuant to
G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10, with signatures of the abutting property owners
who represent ownership of a majority of frontage on the street requesting that
the town install curbs, gutters, and necessary storm water drains in the
proposed street and assess the entire cost against the abutting property
owners.
   J.   Opening of streets. If an individual property owner who owns property
on a street which has not been accepted by the town wishes to have that street
opened and improved, but has been unsuccessful in obtaining a proper petition
in accordance with division I. above, then that property owner may directly
petition the Town Council. If after an investigation of the facts of the case,
the Town Council finds that the opening of this street meets the other
requirements of this chapter and its opening would be in the public interest,
the Town Council may order that the street be opened if the owner of the street
consents to its dedication to the public. Any street which is offered for
dedication after 03-02-1995 shall be accepted in accordance with town standards
as prescribed by §§ 31-1 through 31-5 and shall include paving and the
provision of appropriate curbs, gutters, and necessary storm water drains where
necessary. The town shall assess the total cost of the curbs, gutters, and
necessary storm drains against the abutting property owners as described in
division I. above.
   K.   Option of town. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require
that the town accept any street or share in the cost of any street or to pursue
any of the policies contained herein, except on the finding of the Town Council
that it is in the public interest to do so and that the necessary funds are
available. The town retains the right to reject any or all petitions and to
schedule all transportation improvement work pending the availability of funds.
   L.   Obstructions. It shall be unlawful for any person to obstruct any
public street, alley, bikeway, or sidewalk in the town by any means whatsoever.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the Town
Manager from giving permission for temporary obstruction of any street, alley,
bikeway, or sidewalk in cases that are reasonably necessary.
   M.   Signs, awnings, and the like. No person shall erect, project, or
suspend over the sidewalks of the town, or any portion thereof, any sign, shed,
awning, or other structure unless it is erected under the supervision of the
appropriate Building Inspector and except on a written permit issued by the
Building Inspector. Any sign, shed, awning, or other structure shall be
securely fastened and shall be not less than 7 feet above the sidewalk at any
point.
   N.   Project procedure.
      1.   Upon the receipt of a petition for street improvements, the Town
Clerk shall examine the petition and certify as to its sufficiency to the Town
Council.
      2.   If the petition from the property owners is found to be sufficient,
the Town Council shall direct the Town Manager to estimate the total cost of
the street project in accordance with street specifications, to determine the
cost per foot of property frontage and the total cost to the town for
intersections, other improvements and the town’s share of the front foot
benefit.
      3.   When cost estimates are received, the Town Council shall consider
the availability of funds for street improvements, the degree of development
along the street proposed to be improved and any other factor deemed relevant
to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry and may approve the street
improvement project as they deem best.
      4.   When a street improvement project is approved, the property owners
abutting the improvement shall be notified of the total estimated cost per foot
of frontage.
      5.   Street improvement assessment procedure as authorized in G.S. §§
160A-223 through 160A-236 shall be followed and assessments shall be made
against the properties abutting upon the improvement according to an equal rate
per front foot. In accordance with the requirements of the General Statutes,
property owners not paying within 30 days after the publication of notice of
confirmation of assessment roll (G.S. § 160A-229) shall pay their assessments
in 5 equal annual installments which shall bear interest at a rate which shall
be set from time to time by the Town Council or by General Statute as may be

for restoring private driveways which may be damaged during the construction or
repair of public roadway, curb and gutter, and sidewalks.
         b.   Shoulder section. Driveway entrances and aprons at the shoulder
will be constructed by the town at the location designated by the property
owner. The town shall be responsible for the construction of driveway entrances
and aprons at the shoulder, the cost of which may be included in the

time of construction will be responsible for improvements of their driveways
beyond the driveway entrances and aprons, for driveways located in the right-
of-way and/or on private property. The town shall be responsible for restoring
private driveways which may be damaged during the construction or repair of

      3.   Drainpipes and the like. Drainage pipes and other material on the
right-of-way at the time of construction which were purchased by the property
owner will be removed and placed on the lot of the owner for his or her
disposition. The town will haul away the items if requested by the owner and

of motorists in the safe and responsible operation of motor vehicles.
   R.   Improving streets without petition. When in the opinion of the Town
Council a town-maintained street should be widened, extended, paved, or
otherwise improved and no petition is filed asking for the assessment of the
cost thereof, and when the Town Council is of the opinion that the public
benefit will be greater than the benefit to abutting property owners, the Town
Council may direct that the improvement be made and the total cost paid by the
town.
   S.   Resurfacing improvements. Whenever it is necessary to resurface any
street which has been surfaced under the provisions of this article, the town

      2.   The Town Manager may approve funds to conduct necessary right-of-way
surveys in order to obtain the appropriate documentation to be signed by
property owners granting temporary and permanent rights-of-way to the town. As
rights-of-way relate to petitioned transportation improvement projects, the
petitioning property owners are expected to donate the necessary rights-of-way
and to share equally among themselves the total costs of acquiring other
necessary rights-of-way. The costs incurred by the town obtaining the necessary
minimum rights-of-way shall be added to the total assessment of the project.
   U.   Priority rating procedure. The Town Manager shall present for approval
a numerical rating procedure for determining priority for improving town
transportation systems. The rating system may address the total transportation
network or parts thereof.

penalty due to delinquency, has not been paid.

prima facie rule of evidence shall not apply to the registered owner of a
leased or rented vehicle parked in violation of the provisions of this chapter
when said owner can furnish sworn evidence in the form of a lease or rental
agreement, or has reported to the Division of Motor Vehicles of this state that
the vehicle was, at the time of the parking violation, leased or rented to
another person; in such instances the owner of the vehicle shall, within a
reasonable time after being so requested, furnish the town with the name and
address of the person, firm, or corporation who was leasing or renting the
vehicle at the time of the parking violation. In that event, it shall be prima
facie evidence in any court in this state that the vehicle was parked in
violation of the provisions of this chapter by the person, firm, or corporation
who leased or rented the vehicle at the time of the parking violation as
reported to the town or the Division of Motor Vehicles of this state by the
registered owner of said vehicle.
   H.   The civil penalties imposed herein and the proceeds therefrom, as
collected by payment, civil action, or otherwise, shall belong to the town and
shall be paid into the general fund of the town under the conditions, if any,
as prescribed in the Town of Lewisville’s annual budget.

A Citizens’ Vision of the Future
October 2015
FORWARD
   This document encompasses the efforts of many Lewisville residents who have
contributed substantially to a year-long effort to refine and update
Lewisville’s Comprehensive Plan. This document contains the guidelines that
address community issues such as land use, transportation, natural environment,
community character, housing, neighborhoods, community facilities, community
services, governance, health, safety and wellness, commercial districts and
citizen engagement.
   This Comprehensive Plan is designed to provide direction to the Town for the
next five years. Findings and recommendations within this document may serve as
the basis for possible new ordinances, regulations and policies that will be
used to shape our community.
   In reviewing these proposed changes, four themes are prevalent throughout
the document: fiscal responsibility, sustainable growth, livable design and 
the overall health, safety and well- being of the Town and its citizens.
   This document is intended to be dynamic in nature and flexible enough to
adapt to the changes that are inevitable in a growing community.
   The Mayor and Council of the Town of Lewisville acknowledge with gratitude
the work of  the numerous residents who participated on the various Citizen
Input meetings and citizen surveys associated with the development of this
document.
STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY
   From its first days as a community where rugged pioneers loaded Nissen
wagons with provisions preparing to cross the Shallow Ford as they embarked on
a great adventure westward, Lewisville has embodied, in its very essence, a
sense of community, a spirit of independence and a determination to guide its
own future.
   It was from this foundation of community spirit and involvement that
residents, in 1991, took steps to incorporate the town.The goal was not to keep
Lewisville from being annexed by another municipality, but rather it was so our
residents could guide our future, manage our growth and preserve our unique
character that was being threatened by unplanned, often irresponsible
development.
   In developing our Town Charter, our founding residents held three principles
as the foundation for our community.
   First was the unwavering belief that governing begins with our residents,
not dictated to them from elected officials. That’s why today Lewisville has a
number of committees and boards that are specifically created to develop and
review policy recommendations for the elected Council to consider. In those
instances when issues come before the Council for consideration independent of
the committee/board process, the Council will generally refer them to a
committee or board for review or recommendation prior to taking any action.
Participation on committees and boards is open to all residents and, like
during our earliest days as a community, it is volunteers who share a genuine
concern for our town, who are helping to chart our community’s future.
Lewisville is truly unique in this respect.
   The second principle is the almost sacred commitment to retain and preserve
as much of Lewisville’s small town character and charm as possible.  Our
community has some of the most demanding requirements for development of any
community in North Carolina. We are very specific about what types of
development we will allow and how we will allow that development to occur. One
of the very first tasks we tackled as a community was to develop our
Comprehensive Plan setting the vision for our future. Guided by community
volunteers the plan serves as our blueprint for growth and is revised every
five years with significant community engagement.
   From this plan we have developed a number of innovative tools to manage
growth including our Lewisville Downtown Overlay, Vienna Business District and
our Rural Overlay. Each is crafted to allow growth yet preserve the natural
character and “essence” of our community.
   The third principle our founders had in mind was a limited government – one
that was empowered only to manage the essential services desired by our
residents. Land planning, road and facility maintenance, public safety, solid
waste collection, recycling and parks & recreational activities for our
citizens are among those services that our residents deem appropriate to be
provided by the town. Others may be added in the future, but only after they
receive a critical review and recommendation by our citizen committees and
boards.
   This document, “The Town of Lewisville Comprehensive Plan” embodies the
principles on which our town was chartered and it serves as a guide to help
those who choose to lead our community, stay on a path charted by its people.
It represents the hopes of our residents, the aspirations of our community and
the vision of a town as it strives to be the type of place all of us are proud
to call our home.

INTRODUCTION
Lewisville has demonstrated its commitment to visionary thinking in its short
history as an organized town. Incorporated in 1991, the first Comprehensive
Plan was adopted shortly thereafter in December of 1992. The plan provided the
essential guidance and framework for the young town. It assessed the town’s
strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, values and goals, and set forth
policies by which strategic decisions were made for shaping the town.
Continuing its visionary trend, community officials recognized the need to
update the town’s policy statement for its future every five years. Key
recommendations of the first comprehensive plan were fully embraced by the
town. The town square project and the Downtown Overlay District were two of the
most notable.

A community survey was conducted in the summer of 1996 to gain fresh insight
into community desires and needs. Then, in the fall of 1996, Lewisville
citizens were asked to help update the town’s future plans. A 40- member Task
Force of community volunteers took on the job. Lewisville’s planning staff from
the City-County Planning Board (CCPB) provided professional guidance.
Visioning was the process used for updating existing policies and developing
new recommendations. The visioning process allowed citizens to collaboratively
decide what they wanted their community to become, and then to set the course
on how to get there. Their emphasis was on preserving what they liked about
Lewisville in the face of community changes and challenges.

decide what they wanted their community to become, and then to set the course
on how to get there. Their emphasis was on preserving what they liked about
Lewisville in the face of community changes and challenges.
Meetings were held in November and December to present background information.
Then, in January 1997 a public forum, a telephone hotline, and a visioning
workshop were held to gather ideas to determine what Lewisville should be in
the year 2015. The ideas generated during those events and the community survey
were used to produce a long-range vision which expressed the ideals of the
community. This vision provided the framework to update the plan. In all, 164
people were involved in preparing the next iteration of the Comprehensive Plan.
Over the next several months, the Task Force worked in subcommittees to revise,
update and develop new policies to help achieve the community vision.
Developing a vital downtown, while preserving the rural, pastoral character of
Lewisville were the essential elements of the citizens’ vision for 2015.
The 2000 Process
The next update to the Comprehensive Plan was undertaken by the Lewisville
Planning Board as part of their annual plan of work. Their goal was to:
•   review each item in the plan;
•   determine whether it had been completed or whether it was in the process of
being completed;
•   determine whether the completion goal was still the same;
•   determine whether the action should be referred to another town board or
committee; and/or
•   determine whether an item should be added.
Results of the 1997 survey were also used as background information for this
update. 
The 2005 Process
Three Task Forces were formed in the summer of 2004 to review and revise the
20-year Comprehensive Plan. Each Task Force consisted of citizens, supported by
staff, who utilized the results of a town-wide survey as one of the resources.

The Comprehensive plan Update for 2005 contained three main sections:
   1.   Introduction with process, plan organization, community profile and
community vision.
   2.   Nine chapters which presented action plans covering topics facing
Lewisville at that time:
      •    Land Use
      •   Transportation
      •   Downtown
      •   Natural Environment
      •   Community Character
      •   Housing and Neighborhoods
      •   Community Facilities and Services
      •   Governance
      •   Health, Safety and Wellness (New chapter for 2005)
Each chapter was organized around a specific vision statement on the topic.
Then background, goals and recommended actions were  presented.
At the end of each of these chapters was an Implementation Program. This
section stated specific action steps for achieving the recommended actions and
ultimately the community vision. Timing of implementation steps is a critical
component of long- range planning. The highest priority recommendations were
those indicated by the specific year for implementation or by defining it as
short term. This plan assumed that short term implementation should occur
within five years. Long term implementation should occur within a five to ten
year period. Additionally, many recommendations were to be implemented on an
ongoing basis. The Implementation Program also assigned responsibilities to
specific agencies capable of carrying out the recommended actions.
   3.   An appendix was  attached with additional information on specific
subjects.
The recommendations of the task forces were sent to the Comprehensive Plan
Review Committee which took these recommendations and created the final draft
of the new Comprehensive Plan. The Plan was forwarded to the Town Council for

The 2010 Process
The Planning Board prepared a plan for the 2010 update. It consisted of a
Stakeholders Committee, Coordinating Committee, Task Forces (4), and a Review
Committee.

The Stakeholders consisted of Town Council Members, Planning Board members,
chairs of the town’s boards and committees, the town attorney and various staff
members. The chapter titled Downtown was changed to
Chapter 7 Commercial Districts; and a new chapter titled Chapter 10 Citizen
Engagement was added. The
Chapter 6 Land Use was expanded to include the Vienna Business District and
Rural Overlay areas. The committee suggested the members of the Coordinating
Committee and Review Committee. (Task Force members were volunteers who had
attended the public kick-off meeting.)  A proposed time line for completion was
approved.
The Coordinating Committee was responsible for providing Task Force oversight,
management, guidance,  background information, conflict resolution, and the
process for completing their assigned chapters.
The Task Forces were charged with reviewing their assigned chapters and
updating as necessary.

The Review Committee was established to review the work of the Task Forces so
that the completed document would be uniform and consistent.

The 2015  Process
In early spring of 2014, the Planning Board determined that the first step in
updating and informing the 2015 Comprehensive Plan process would be to review
and assess the 2010 process. Specifically, the goals were to reinforce past
successes and modify future actions based on lessons learned. The Planning
Board reviewed the 2011 After Action Report, solicited input from previous Plan
participants and had robust discussions and brainstorming. Three key goals
emerged from the assessment:  1) To ensure consistent and equal review across
chapters; 2) To maximize public input utilizing multiple methods and  tools;
and 3) To tap relevant reference documents gathered, published, adopted, and/or
engaged over the past 5 years. Based on those imperatives, the Planning Board
outlined a procedure with timeline for 2014/2015; submitted it to Town Council;
and began its update in the fall of 2014.
Although the Planning Board served as the primary review committee, its key
responsibility was to advocate for and collate the wishes and desires of the
public based upon feedback received over the previous five years. Public
priorities were gathered based on the results of the 2014_Town_Survey, as well
as three separate Citizen Input Sessions held February through April of 2015.

IMAGES/0-0-0-68.jpg]
The Citizen Input Sessions were very well attended with most meetings having
over sixty (60) participants. Each session was facilitated by a representative
of the Piedmont Triad Council of Governments (PTRC). Prior to the beginning of
each session, participants were asked to complete a mini-survey covering key
topics to be discussed.
This information, along with the responses given at the session, were indexed
by PTRC staff and was used to create a matrix of all available information that
could be used to update the Comprehensive Plan. Other information used within
this matrix was from WS/FC_Legacy_Plan, Lewisville Greenway and Pedestrian
Connection Plan, Citizen_Survey and the EPA Downtown Workshop results.
Additionally, the Planning Board reached out to existing boards and committees
to gather any specific input from their various perspectives. Content experts,
stakeholders, relevant documents, and town staff provided ongoing input and
expertise.
In early May, 2015, the Planning Board began a detailed chapter by chapter
review, inserting this information into the 2010 text as well as updating other
statistical information found within the document.  Final formatting and the
addition of new pictures, maps and other graphics were completed in August of
2015.
Changes made for this document were:
   •   moving the Vision statement to the end of each chapter;
   •   combining Housing & Neighborhoods and Commercial Districts into Land
Use;
   •   renumbering the chapters to accommodate the chapter changes;
   •   expanding demographics; and
   •   amending the Environmental Quality and Sustainability in the Appendix 
to reference chapters in this Plan, Legacy, and the UDO.
The final draft was submitted to the Town Council for their review in September
2015.

Our Community Vision of the Future
Lewisville in the year 2035 will continue to be a desirable place to live, work
and recreate. Lewisville’s rural landscape, featuring  woodlands, open fields,
lakes, rolling hills and small streams, has been preserved through
conscientious conservation efforts in the face of growth pressures. Quality of
life will be enhanced through efforts by the town, citizens and businesses by
managing growth and will be guided by citizen-developed long-range plans.
Development will be carefully managed to minimize impacts on the environment
and costs to the community and will continue to enhance the character of the
town. Cooperative relationships with Winston-Salem, Clemmons, Tobaccoville and
other surrounding communities will continue to benefit Lewisville. Downtown’s
small-town atmosphere will continue to reflect the town’s rich heritage, and
its diverse and dynamic spirit. Our transportation system will provide a wide
variety of transportation options, resulting in advantages which include
improved traffic flow and air quality, safety, health and well-being.
Lewisville will continue its commitment to improving the quality of protecting
its pastoral character and maintaining strong, diverse housing and
neighborhoods while sustaining a low overall tax rate for community residents.
This vision will guide decision makers into the future.

GOVERNANCE
The Town of Lewisville incorporated in 1991 with a council-manager form of
government. The town is governed by a mayor and six council members who oversee
the management of the town. (See Town of Lewisville Organization Chart and
Board and Committee Chart.)

IMAGES/0-0-0-76.jpg]
In order to be more actively involved in town planning, the Lewisville Planning
Board was established in 1994 and the Zoning Board of Adjustment in 1995. The
establishment of these boards gives citizens more direct input into the
oversight, control and guidance of future growth and development of the town.
The Planning Board has increased in size from five members to seven as the town
has expanded its boundaries. The town hired a full time planner in 2004.
Lewisville currently contracts most of the services it provides its residents,
such as traffic engineering, road maintenance, sanitation, recycling, police
and emergency management, social and housing services, and some planning
services. This plan recommends that the town continually evaluate its service
contracts in order to continue to provide cost-effective services. The town
must also evaluate the cost of service provision in light of the desire of
residents to maintain the lowest possible tax rate.

IMAGES/0-0-0-78.jpg]
The town’s charter limits expansion to the east and south without the approval
of the City of Winston-Salem and the Village of Clemmons, respectively. In
2003, a 20-year annexation agreement with the City of Winston-Salem was
reached. (See
Map 3 Annexation Agreement Map.) Expansion in this manner would demonstrate a
logical, orderly and desirable expansion of the town.

IMAGES/0-0-0-80.jpg]
Every five years, citizens participate in the review and update of the Town’s
Comprehensive Plan and make recommendations for the Town’s Comprehensive Plan.
These dedicated citizens give their time to ensure that as Lewisville develops,
the quality of life is not compromised, but enhanced. Volunteer boards and
committees were established to keep citizens actively involved in governance of
the town. Citizen volunteers should continue to assist in improving the
physical, social and economic well-being of Lewisville. Following is a current
list of Lewisville’s standing boards and committees:

•   Lewisville Utilities Committee (LUC)
•   Public Safety Advisory Committee (PSAC)
•   Recycling Committee (RC)
•   Stormwater Advisory and Education Committee (SAEC)
•   Student Leadership Committee (SLC)
Vision
Lewisville, in the year 2035, will provide its citizens with the necessary
services to maintain a vibrant quality of life for both residents and
businesses. The Town will maintain an appropriate tax rate while providing the
benefits and services to the population it serves, while also making the
community attractive to prospective new residents and businesses. The council-
manager form of government and its own citizen boards and committees serve to
provide Lewisville residents with a voice in government.

COMMUNITY CHARACTER
Although Lewisville incorporated in 1991, it has functioned as a community
longer than most residents can remember. A small town, steeped in rich history,
Lewisville’s roots date back to the mid 1700s when men the likes of Daniel
Boone migrated from Pennsylvania to this area’s Bryan Settlement, finally
settling in the Yadkin Valley and blazing the famous “Wilderness Road” to
Kentucky. In 1753, the Moravians came to Salem and in 1754, completed this
area’s portion of the Great Philadelphia Wagon Road which ran from Pennsylvania
to Georgia. Because of this area’s fertile land and abundant game, early
pioneers used this vicinity as a stopover or rest area before crossing the
Shallow Ford of the Yadkin River. Other pioneers settled in the area and homes
of many original settlers are still standing and inhabited by direct
descendants.
In the 19th century, this area was settled by Lewis Case Laugenour. In 1857,
after returning from California, Mr. Laugenour acquired land and in 1860
completed building the brick house which still stands today on Shallowford
Road. In addition, he also sold property to Lewisville Baptist Church,
Lewisville United Methodist Church and New Hope A. M. E. Zion Church at very
reasonable prices. Because of his generosity, he was honored by having the town
named after him. During this era, a number of small businesses flourished;
however, the area remained mostly rural and residential.
This plan continues to recommend identifying and preserving significant symbols
of this heritage. A 1979 Forsyth County inventory included historic homes and
other  buildings in Lewisville. Most of these houses and churches were
constructed in the mid to late 1800s. The Roller Mill was the only commercial
structure documented. There are also a number of significant sites in need of
protection which do not have a standing structure. In 2010, the Forsyth County
Historic Commission updated the information.

Open space preservation and design guidelines are in place to continue to
maintain the town’s pastoral, small town character.

Vision
Lewisville in the year 2035 will remain a pedestrian friendly town. We will
continue to encourage the completion of the Great Wagon Road and the further
development of unique commercial ventures in downtown in a thoughtful and
historically respectful manner while preserving Lewisville’s, small town
character for future generations. The town will promote well designed
development and redevelopment that creates a pleasing, healthy, livable and
sustainable community. Lewisville will continue to maintain its pastoral, small
town feeling throughout the 21st century.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The natural environment and resources define Lewisville’s community character.
Scenic vistas, stands of tall trees, creeks, small lakes and quaint country
lanes illustrate this character.
This document speaks to the continued protection of these elements; however,
the natural environment is due to change as a result of existing state
development regulations and accepted practices. Examples of negative impacts of
development include degradation of local air quality due to increasing traffic
volumes, pollution of water bodies due to runoff from building sites, and the
loss of woodlands and open space to make room for development.
There are a few natural barriers to development in Lewisville. State
regulations restrict development of wetlands and floodplains, however, these
areas are usually unsuitable for development anyway. State watershed
regulations do restrict the intensity of development where they apply. Other
areas of importance to Lewisville include existing woodlands and open space,
located just outside the town’s jurisdiction, which are not protected by state
or county regulations. Without protection, these areas might be lost due to
development.
Lewisville is situated at the headwaters of a number of small streams, many of
which drain into larger waterways, such as the Yadkin River. The western
portion of the town is classified as a WS-IV watershed by the North Carolina
Division of Environmental Management. That classification limits the amount of
development that can occur on a lot in order to protect water quality. The goal
is to protect the Yadkin River so that it can be used for drinking water
without endangering public health. (See
Map 5 Environmental Constraints.) In addition, many of the town’s neighborhoods
are interspersed with small lakes. Improper construction practices and existing
development causes sedimentation and erosion of stream and lake banks, which
degrade water quality and the visual appearance of the lakes. This plan seeks
to preserve water quality by directing development away from streams and lakes.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/501b7de96233b9f69583d1bf3e9f92151cf307f6/
IMAGES/0-0-0-131.jpg]
The plan also recommends that woodlands be preserved, especially around
streams, to minimize erosion and protect water quality. Stands of trees also
help define the Lewisville landscape, providing a patchwork of woodlands
between open fields and subdivisions. Moreover, these forests are home to local
wildlife and help reduce air pollution by absorbing carbon monoxide and
producing oxygen.
The North Carolina Wildlife Commission provides a Green Growth Toolkit that can
help the town understand where important wildlife areas are located, create
land use plans and policies that balance future development with natural
resource protection and help design development projects that protect wildlife
habitat alongside built areas.
This plan promotes the use of native tree species. Native plant materials are
generally longer lived, better acclimated and more consistent with the visual
character of the established community.
Open pastures are essential to the town’s character, however, they are the most
difficult natural feature to protect because they are well suited for
development. This plan seeks to preserve pasture lands and the scenic vistas
they afford through policies that create an open space network. An example of
this is the use of Planned Residential Developments (PRD’s) which minimizes the
impact of new residential development by clustering it away from known view
sheds or other environmentally sensitive areas. Not all development can or
should be prevented, but development can and should be designed in accord with
the natural environment.
Currently, there is a need for alternative transportation such as bike lanes,
greenways, and sidewalks. Most trips within Lewisville are made by car. This
plan calls for bike lanes, a network of greenways, and additional sidewalks. As
more trips are made on foot or by bike, the corresponding reduction in
vehicular travel will help to reduce air quality problems by lowering
automobile carbon monoxide emissions. (See
Chapter 7 Health, Safety and Wellness.) Drainage and stormwater has become an
issue in the town. While Lewisville does not currently have a major problem
with stormwater, it has become an issue because of increased development and
mandated federal stormwater management requirements. Lewisville manages its
stormwater management program through the enforcement of a federal National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) “Phase II” stormwater permit.
The town is actively engaged in the development of new stormwater management
facilities as well as the maintenance of existing stormwater facilities town
wide to remove harmful sediments and other pollutants. These measures will help
to  mitigate the rate of runoff into existing drainage ways. These facilities
help to reduce the potential and risk of flooding downstream properties within
the town. Solutions which use natural drainage patterns instead of hardened,
engineered systems will help protect the environment.
Vision
Lewisville in the year 2035 will protect and preserve the natural environment
and will be good stewards of the public lands and private property. To do this,
planners and citizens will value sustainability, therefore provide open space,
wildlife habitats and woodlands. Air quality and water resources such as
streams, lakes and watershed are protected by using sound environmental
principals in planning and development. The town will focus on these things to
protect native species, to preserve  natural resources for the enjoyment of our
citizens, and to maintain a rural feeling for the community.

FACILITIES & SERVICES
Lewisville’s list of community facilities and services continues to grow. Today
the town is responsible for solid waste collections which consists of household
garbage and recycling. In addition, the town provides an avenue for the
disposal of building and demolition materials, household hazardous waste and
bulky items via a Bulky Item Disposal Permit which can be obtained from Town
Hall (see Bulky Item Permit on page 31 and Bulky Item Disposal Locations on
page 32) and curbside pickup. The town is also responsible for the maintenance
of roads, downtown street lamps, sidewalks, downtown streetscapes, the G.
Galloway Reynolds Community Center, Shallowford Square, Jack Warren Park,
community policing, the Veterans’ Monument, Town Hall, Town Hall Annex and
recreational and entertainment activities for residents. Town administration
includes stormwater control and planning and zoning functions. The City-County
Inspections Division provides enforcement services on a contractual basis.
Several City-County governmental agencies operate within Forsyth County
providing services and facilities for municipalities and the county. Public
schools, sewer and water service, tax collections, fire prevention and
emergency services, and elections all operate under this collaborative system.
Additionally, Forsyth County manages the public library system, and regional
parks and recreational facilities. Maintaining strong relationships with these
agencies is, and will continue to be, an important aspect of community
management and services.
One of the highest priority needs for Lewisville in 2005 was the building of a
larger public library, which was completed in 2008 following the town’s
donation of the land to Forsyth County. This new facility provided more space,
more books, more amenities, more equipment and more meeting space to better
serve Lewisville residents (See
Map 6 Community Facilities).

IMAGES/0-0-0-137.jpg]
Additionally, the Community Center is widely used by the town, church and civic
organizations, schools, Scouts and other non-profit groups, and residents
indicating the need for additional recreational space for community activities.
The large meeting room on the first floor has a capacity of 48 persons and the
small meeting room on the second floor has a capacity of 19. Additionally,
there is a senior exercise room on the second floor for use free of charge to
any Lewisville senior over the age of 60.

An important issue facing Lewisville is the provision of sanitary sewer service
for all residents. Sanitary sewer service is a function of the City-County
Utilities Commission for Forsyth County. Lewisville is located within the
water/sewer service district of the City-County Utilities Commission.
Presently, only a portion of the community is serviced by a sanitary sewer
system as shown on
Map 7 Sewer Utilities. Eighty percent of households in Lewisville still depend
on septic systems. Failure of septic systems within the town is, and will
continue to be, an issue for many residents. Proper maintenance of septic
systems could help extend their life and residents are encouraged to actively
maintain their systems.
A special task force was appointed by the Council in December 2001 and
recommended at that time that the town move forward with a sewer system. In
order to pro- actively address this issue, a Sanitary Sewer Feasibility Study
was updated in September 2003 by Cavanaugh & Associates with the assistance of
a citizen committee to determine the potential for extending sewer service
throughout the community including the proposed (at the time of the study)
annexed area of Vienna. Map 7A shows the proposed sewer plan. Because of
topographic features and constraints and land use patterns, the cost for
providing community-wide service was determined to be prohibitive.
Many residents were and remain, however, extremely concerned about the
potential expense of developing a town-wide sanitary sewer system in Lewisville
in terms of both monetary, environmental and unintended developmental costs.
Sewer has been installed on Shallowford Road with a pumping station behind the
Oaks Shopping Center.  However, the Lewisville Town core has limited sewer
availability.Properties facing Shallowford Road have access to an existing line
located within the roadway.Service is restricted to only those parcels that
adjoin Shallowford Road due to the line’s depth and lack of capacity. This line
and others that serve several nearby residential neighborhoods are owned and
maintained by the CCUC Department.These lines connect to their main outfall
system located along Muddy Creek being just east of the Town. Due to the price
of providing the sewer for the rest of the town, consideration has been on
hold.
In the spring of 2010, a new study of the sewer system was due from CCUC but
was not completed until 2013. In 2014, the Town completed an agreement with
CCUC and the City of Winston-Salem for CCUC to provide future extensions of
water and sewer services. In addition, the Town is participating with CCUC in
the Harper Road Lift Station which is intended to provide service to residents
in the area south of HWY 421. This agreement will allow Lewisville to have
access to 750,000 gallons per day of sewer treatment out of this lift station.
Additionally, the Town of Lewisville is developing a plan to extend sewer
capacity town wide.
Unfunded federally mandated regulations implemented by the Clean Water Act have
had a significant impact on local governments. In compliance with these
regulations, Lewisville has a Phase II Stormwater Permit which requires the
Town to maintain a Stormwater Management Program. This permit was first
received in 2004 and is applied for every five years.
Law enforcement is provided through the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office. Six
Community Policing Officers are assigned to Lewisville. In addition, Lewisville
residents receive policing service from the County zone officers. Fire and
emergency medical service (EMS) are provided by the Lewisville Volunteer Fire
Department and the Vienna Volunteer Fire Department through contracts with the
county.

Residents of Lewisville can determine in which public school zone they reside
by visiting the Winston-Salem Forsyth County School’s web site or by calling
the student assignment office. While Lewisville Elementary School is the only
public school located within Lewisville, other elementary schools in the area
include Vienna, Southwest, and Meadowlark. Area middle schools include
Jefferson and Meadowlark. West Forsyth High School and Ronald Reagan High
School are within the Lewisville District. Several private schools are also
located in the area including Forsyth Country Day School located within the
town limits.

In 2015, parks, greenways and recreational facilities were identified during
the most recent citizen input sessions held, to update this plan as being very
important to Lewisville residents. Currently there are four parks available to
Town residents.
Shallowford Square, operated by the Town of Lewisville, currently provides
amenities for outdoor events including concerts, theatrical productions,
community celebrations, arts and crafts fairs, and church and civic events.

Another park operated by the Town of Lewisville is Jack Warren Park on
Lewisville-Clemmons Road. The fifteen acres of land was donated by Mary Alice
Warren in memory of Jack Warren. Phase I has bocci ball courts, horse shoe
pits, a covered pavilion, children’s play park, walking trails, a ten (10)
station par course, rest rooms and an open field for recreational activities.

Operated by the Forsyth County Department of Recreation and Parks, Joanie Moser
Park offers Lewisville residents a variety of recreational opportunities. This
facility has a softball field, tennis courts, a tot lot and a covered picnic
area.
421 River Park on Old Yadkinville Road, outside the Town limits, is county-
operated. It has volleyball courts, horse shoes, picnic areas and river access
for canoes and kayaks.
Greenways are often defined as linear parks. They can be used for open space,
recreation or traveling to a specific destination. Forsyth County already has a
Greenway Plan and a long-range goal of expanding the system throughout the
county. The aim is to form a system connecting parks, open space, neighborhoods
and employment centers. Lewisville residents have expressed a desire to be a
part of this system. They noted special emphasis on connecting downtown to
Lewisville’s neighborhoods, and for connecting open space and environmentally
significant lands. (See
Chapter 3 Natural Environment for more information on greenways.)
A long-range greenway plan for Lewisville has been accepted but not adopted and
is shown on
Map 11 Transportation Facilities with Proposed Improvements. Greenways are
proposed primarily along creeks where future sewer extension may occur. This
plan suggests obtaining greenway easements when and where sewer lines are to be
developed, thereby providing a more economical use of land and funds.
Air quality regulations will not allow open burning during Code Orange, Red,
and Purple conditions. Fire department officials desire stricter enforcement of
these regulations, or a ban on open burning for greater fire protection and
safety.
Vision
Lewisville in the year 2035 will be responsive to the community service needs
and objectives of Lewisville residents. All services will be provided in a
timely, cost- effective and environmentally sensitive manner. Citizens have
been, and will continue to enjoy, and widely support, quality public
facilities, enhancing their sense of community life.

LAND USE
Land use plans establish the long range direction for communities.
Map 9 Preferred Land Use in the map section shows the ideal form Lewisville
should take over the next 20 years. This plan reflects the desires of citizens
to preserve the town’s rural residential nature as the predominant land use
feature of the community. Retail and office development are strongly favored
for the current designated commercial districts.
This plan was prepared in the context of a changing environment. Several key
policies and future plans were considered during the development of these
guidelines. The Northern Beltway and subsequent potential development around
the anticipated schools at Robinhood Road and Lewisville-Vienna Road, sewer
extensions, stormwater/impervious surface regulations, watershed regulations,
growth management, existing land use patterns and the potential for annexation
were all important factors in developing the future land use plan for
Lewisville.
The recommendations shown on
Map 9 Preferred Land Use are intended to help the town, property owners and
residents make zoning and development decisions that are in the best interest
of the community. Other policies created by the Town Council should be
consistent with this plan.

IMAGES/0-0-0-155.jpg]
Lewisville existed as a rural community long before the 1991 incorporation as a
small town, and the land use patterns seen today still reflect those early
provincial roots. As the
Map 8 Existing Land Use shows, residential uses are the predominant feature in
the landscape. Small scale commercial and institutional uses are and should be
clustered in the town’s designated commercial districts.

Satellite commercial areas will continue to be located at US 421/Lewisville-
Clemmons Road interchange and the Vienna Business District. A small pocket of
industrial uses is located behind the Roller Mill along Jennings Road. There
are other commercial locations in the town that were existing prior to
incorporation that the town does not wish to further develop or expand.
Home-based, nonresidential land uses dot Lewisville’s residential landscape.
These “home-grown” uses pre- dated incorporation and exemplify Lewisville’s
rural heritage. The community acknowledges and respects the unique diversity
these business services provide and wishes to protect their continued
viability.
There is a common desire to have Lewisville remain a residential community.
This plan goes beyond the 1992 land use recommendations and envisions
diversifying Lewisville’s residential land use patterns in several different
ways. These include the possibility of increasing density in certain areas,
encouraging clustering options, and expanding multifamily districts as sewer
availability increases. (See
Map 8 Existing Land Use,
Map 9 Preferred Land Use and
Map 7 Sewer Utilities.)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/501b7de96233b9f69583d1bf3e9f92151cf307f6/
IMAGES/0-0-0-161.jpg]
Areas generally outside the watershed, where sewer exists or can be extended,
and where existing development patterns based on current zoning already allow
slightly higher density development are recommended for more intense
development than indicated in the previous Plan. All lands within the
Lewisville Rural Overlay (LRO) area shall be eligible to receive both water
and/or sewer services if the owner chooses to be annexed into the Town of
Lewisville.
Clustering homes using enhanced Planned Residential Development (PRD) standards
can be a useful method for preserving open space and gaining additional
amenities for residents. (See
Chapter 3 Natural Environment and Housing and Neighborhoods in this chapter for
more on clustering.)  Residents have indicated an interest in seeing clustered
housing located near the downtown as a way of increasing activity in the area
while also preserving the open space character.
Housing and Neighborhoods
In 1996 there were 3,147 households in Lewisville. With the annexation of the
northern area, the number of households increased from 3,147 to 4,992 which
increased the population to more than 12,500.
This newly annexed area consisted of a mix of larger working farms and lower
density residential subdivisions approved under county zoning subdivision
regulations. These regulations required a minimum lot size of 20,000 square
feet for homes with septic tanks. There are also several established mobile
home parks located within the area along Robinhood Road and individual mobile
homes on scattered sites throughout the planning area.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/501b7de96233b9f69583d1bf3e9f92151cf307f6/
IMAGES/0-0-0-163.jpg]
The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools have purchased more than 72 acres
along Robinhood Road to construct potential new schools. As proposed, a new
sewer line is to be built having additional capacity that will allow
undeveloped land(s) immediately around the school site to be developed to
densities not permitted by conventional septic tanks. Existing residences may
benefit also by the location of this line allowing property owners to convert
from their residential septic systems to public sewer.
The Preferred Land Use Plan (see
Map 9 Preferred Land Use) recommends increasing residential density around the
downtown by encouraging clustering design. The plan also recommends maintaining
the large lot patterns for the remaining portions of the community where
existing development patterns are firmly established and where sewer may not be
practical or attainable. Future plans to sewer other basins by CCUC or the town
could, however, significantly change the overall residential density and
lotting patterns.

The character of Lewisville depends greatly on its open, pastoral nature. To
control sprawl and preserve open space and environmentally significant land,
this plan encourages the clustering of housing (PRDs) and sets mandatory open
space requirements within subdivisions. (See Figures 1 & Figure 2.) These
policies, combined with landscaping standards found in the UDO, will help
ensure that the character and identity of Lewisville are not compromised.
The clustering of housing units will also help provide for a variety of housing
types, making Lewisville’s housing stock more available and more affordable to
a variety of residents.
Commercial Districts
Recognizing the opportunity for increasing the intensity of development within
the downtown, this Plan recommends that a mix of office, retail and residential
uses be established.
Since the first Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 1992, many projects have been
undertaken to create an attractive, traditional downtown commercial area in
keeping with the vision of Lewisville citizens. The downtown is now formally
defined as the stretch of road between Williams and Shallowford Roads from US
421 on the west and Lowes Foods Drive to the east which encompasses
approximately 177 acres. This area is considered the focal point or heart of
Lewisville.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/501b7de96233b9f69583d1bf3e9f92151cf307f6/
IMAGES/0-0-0-167.jpg]
Lewisville’s desire for an attractive downtown led the town to adopt additional
regulations for governing new development. These guidelines are intended to
enhance and protect Lewisville’s unique, small town character. (Refer to
Map 8 Existing Land Use.) These standards provide guidance on the style and
character of new development and help to assure an aesthetically pleasing
environment.
A prior critique of these standards reaffirmed the community’s position that
aesthetically pleasing design is critical to creating a successful downtown.
The ideals of the community are reflected in the objectives of the Overlay
District standards. (See the Lewisville Unified Development Ordinances.) The
group stressed that site design, compatible scale, landscaping and other
amenities are as important as the type of land use. Residents do not want strip
development in downtown Lewisville. This plan reinforces the commitment of this
community for consistent design by recommending additional standards for public
space in downtown and that downtown standards be applied to other commercial
areas in Lewisville.
This mixed-use development pattern is also proposed for the Vienna Business
District.
The Lewisville 2015 Plan, originally prepared in 1997, and renamed the Parallel
Road Plan in 2005, set forth a vision for improving Shallowford Road and
developing a new parallel street to Shallowford Road. The new road, named the
Great Wagon Road, and the proposed cross street extensions were proposed to be
developed in phases as warranted by increased activity in the area. The
Parallel Road Plan calls for providing pedestrian sidewalks when the roads are
improved and developed. Sidewalks are an important feature in any vital
downtown and are strongly desired by residents. This plan provides the physical
framework for ensuring orderly downtown growth and achieving adequate traffic
circulation patterns throughout Lewisville.

The downtown needed a catalyst and Shallowford Square provided the needed focus
to spur additional development. Surveys show that residents would like to see
development oriented to the Square, with street landscaping, and pedestrian
amenities, all shaping the center of town.

Update 2000 built upon existing plans, policies and the desires of this
community for a strong downtown. During the public visioning process, residents
expressed desires for increasing retail, office, entertainment, and housing.
Making downtown accessible and safe for pedestrians is also a top priority.
Further extension of sidewalks would be especially valuable in the downtown
area.
A review by the Planning Board in 2014 created the Downtown Development
Guidelines that create/ establish an expectation on behalf of the town of what
the (1) downtown should look like and (2) how the district should expand and
look given certain architectural preferences.
The major goals embodied in the Parallel Road Plan and Update 2000 have been
reaffirmed as presented in this Comprehensive Plan. Because of this, the 2015
Parallel Road Plan is still viable and will be extended to the year 2035.
A critical aspect of land use planning centers around future commercial
development in Lewisville. The merits of expanding commercial areas outside the
downtown commercial district, particularly at the eastern end of Shallowford
Road where an interchange of the Northern Beltway is proposed, was debated as
well as expansion of the Vienna Business District. Commercial development is
appropriate for these types of locations; however, Lewisville is determined to
set a different standard in order to preserve its residential character, avoid
strip development and support a mixed use downtown. As
Map 9 Preferred Land Use shows, commercial development is slated only for
downtown and the VBD and is slightly expanded at the existing satellite areas.
While the Land Use Plan recommends some appropriate zoning districts, each
development proposal must be considered on its own merit. Compatible or lower-
intensity uses will be encouraged.
Vision
Lewisville in the year 2035 will continue to be committed to preserving and
enhancing its character as a residential community. A variety of land uses will
work together in a harmonious and sustainable fashion providing citizens with
needed services for achieving a high quality of life.
Lewisville will continue to provide a variety of attractive, quality
residential areas for all income levels and age groups. Open space, which
defines the community’s character, is preserved through environmentally
sensitive development models which balance the health and well being of all of
its citizens.
Downtown Lewisville will continue to be the heart of the community. Downtown
will be pedestrian friendly and will offer a variety of retail and
entertainment attractions. The parcels neighboring Shallowford Square within
and surrounding the Downtown Core and downtown corridor have been designated as
special emphasis areas, given their proximity and importance to their
relationship to the Town’s center. Appropriate and sensitive development
continues to be encouraged within these areas, with an emphasis on respecting
and supporting the town’s core value as a historically unique small town with
an articulated pedestrian oriented character and scale.

Lewisville’s Downtown Core will be comprised of those parcels bounded by Tom
Voss Street, the Great Wagon Road, the extension of Lewisville-Clemmons Road to
the Great Wagon Road and Shallowford Road. Shallowford Square, although not
physically located in the exact center of Lewisville, will continue to be
considered the heart of the town’s core. Lewisville’s downtown corridor will be
comprised of parcels on either side of Shallowford Road and the future Great
Wagon Road between the Oaks Shopping Center to the west and the extension of
Lewisville-Clemmons Road to the Great Wagon Road to the east.
Lewisville’s downtown core, the parcels generally to the east of Shallowford
Square to the future extension of Lewisville-Clemmons Road to the Great Wagon
Road, will continue to be the  extent of cultural, governmental, entertainment
and open space uses. The Laugenour House will continue to be a critical
component to remain extant within this area, re-purposed as an historic
property, a symbol of the genesis of our town. With the closing of a portion of
North Street, Shallowford Square has been extended to include the Laugenour
House with the placement of a walkway and the inclusion of a water feature.
The parcels to the west of Shallowford Square are mixed use commercial and
business, comprised of assorted retail shops, offices and restaurants in a
compact and contiguous single development.
The parcels to the north of the Great Wagon Road from Shallowford Square west
to Shallowford Road are transitional urban residential, comprised of lower
density live/work units and/or multi-family, either as a contiguous single
development or a phased project.

The parcels to the south of Shallowford Road from Shallowford Square west to
Shallowford Road are a continuation of the development of small office uses
within a new or re-purposed development.

Truly unique to Lewisville’s downtown is its use as a staging point for area
cyclists, both  recreational as well as the more experienced riders. The Town
of Lewisville recognizes its responsibility as the chosen cycling hub with the
larger context of connectivity with Forsyth, Davie and Yadkin counties and
encourages a more synergistic alliance between the town and the riders.
Owing to a strong sense of place and history, the Vienna Business District will
become a focal point for commercial activity in the northern area of the town.
The commercial area located at the interchange of Styers Ferry Road/Lewisvile-
Clemmons Road/US 421, will continue to be an important addition to commerce in
Lewisville.  Visitors from surrounding areas will continue to be attracted to
Lewisville’s charming small town businesses and village-like  atmosphere.

LAND USE TERMINOLOGY
Residential
Conservation
This residential land use classification calls for preserving the pastoral
character of Lewisville by recommending a minimum lot size of three (3) acres.
The Conrad Road area and areas along the Yadkin River are  designated as the
only locations for this designation. These areas epitomize the rural, agrarian
character which defines Lewisville. The community strongly desires to preserve
this feeling as much as possible.

IMAGES/0-0-0-181.jpg]
Rural
This classification preserves the large lot residential patterns for outlying
sections of town which cannot be easily served by sanitary sewer. The minimum
lot size is two (2) acres, one (1) acre if clustered and 20% of the site is
left in open space. These areas are not served by sewer, and lie within the
Yadkin River watershed.

IMAGES/0-0-0-183.jpg]
Low Density Single Family
This classification includes primarily low density single family housing with a
minimum lot size of 20,000 sq. ft., 10,000 sq. ft. if clustered with 30% of the
site left in open space. The overall maximum  allowable density is 2.2 units
per acre. Sewer service is expected where the clustering option is utilized.

IMAGES/0-0-0-185.jpg]
Medium Density Single Family
This classification is intended to include existing single family residential
neighborhoods where sewer is already available or is proposed in the near
future. The minimum lot size is 9,000 sq. ft. with a density of 4.8 units per
acre. Cluster housing options (Planned Residential Development - PRD) are
appropriate for this area. Affordable housing is desirable here. Generally,
sewer service and lack of watershed restrictions in most areas make this more
appropriate for higher density development.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/501b7de96233b9f69583d1bf3e9f92151cf307f6/
IMAGES/0-0-0-187.jpg]
High Density/Multifamily
The multifamily classification is located on the edge of downtown where higher
density housing is appropriate due to existing multifamily developments, the
availability of sewer and the desire for more activity around the downtown.
Appropriate uses include condominiums, duplexes, twin homes and townhouses,
with a maximum density of eight (8) units per acre (UDO districts RM5 and RM8
are allowable). RSQ, which allows slightly higher density, may be appropriate
as infill near or in the downtown on sites less than one acre size. Clustering
is appropriate here.

IMAGES/0-0-0-189.jpg]
Mixed Use Residential/Office
This classification has been developed for those areas where residential
structures are predominant, but would also be appropriate for limited office
and institutional uses, especially since residents have expressed the need for
low cost retirement facilities. Duplexes, twin homes, townhouses and low
intensity office and institutional uses are desired, with a maximum density of
12 units per acre. UDO districts RSQ on lots less than one acre, RM5, RM8 and
RM12, NO and LO are appropriate. Building size restrictions are needed to
ensure that the scale of new development is compatible with the established
residential character of the area. Clustering is also an option.

Commercial
Commercial/Office
This plan recommends maintaining several primary commercial areas outside of
the downtown mixed use commercial area each with specific classifications.
1. South of US 421/Concord Church Road Satellite
Located within the Downtown  Gateway Area (DGA), design standards appropriate
for vehicle dependent highway uses should be utilized to create projects that
are convenient to and serve both local and highway traffic.

2. Corner of Lewisville-Clemmons Rd./Styers Ferry Rd./HWY 421 Satellite
This area is suitable for more intense commercial and office development. The
existing HB zoning is satisfactory in this location. Additional development
activity is expected to occur as properties are developed.

3. Vienna Business District (VBD)
The Vienna Business District encompasses the area between Glenn Ferry and
Needham Road off Yadkinville Road. The VBD is a compact business district
located around the historic crossroad area of Lewisville-Vienna Road and
Yadkinville Road (Old US 421) and offers a mix of retail and other
institutional uses.

Site Development Checklist
This checklist provides additional development standards to regulations and
guidelines found in the Unified Development Ordinances (UDO) andDowntown
Overlay_District_Planning_Guideto guide certain aspects of site development,
such as design and landscaping. These standards will ensure that the town’s
character is protected and enhanced in accordance with the goals and objectives
of the comprehensive plan.
These standards are intended to be used by developers, land owners, and
planning staff when designing, preparing, and reviewing zoning requests and
development proposals. These criteria will be applicable to special use zoning
requests.
LANDSCAPING/TREE PRESERVATION
(See the UDO for specific details)
Encourage the use of native species trees and plants, especially for buffering
and landscaping requirements.
Prohibit the removal of trees in restricted areas of floodplains and wetlands.
Development plans should incorporate into their designs identified woodlands,
mature, and existing specimen trees.
Encourage the protection and replanting of native tree specimens.
Discourage the removal of specimen trees within required setbacks and buffers.
Encourage the preservation of mature and specimen trees elsewhere.
Where feasible, protect mature and specimen trees in non-buildable areas of a
site, including setback areas, by fencing-off during site preparation and
construction.
Discourage clear cutting of trees from construction and development sites where
feasible.
It shall be the property owners responsibility to abide by stormwater
management regulations and principles.
Encourage landscaping at the entrance to residential developments.
SITE DESIGN
All new on-site infrastructure street, curb and gutter, water, sanitary sewer,
and stormwater management and extensions to the site shall be provided by the
developer.
Place utilities underground where possible.
Prohibit construction that negatively impacts streams, lakes or wetlands.
Prohibit development within floodplains.
Develop stormwater management plans to minimize runoff volumes and pollutants.
These should be prepared in conjunction with site plans.
Design in accord with natural drainage systems. Promote the use of grassy
swales and other bioengineering techniques for stormwater management.
Encourage development guidelines for environmental protection.
Minimize cut and fill in developments by working with terrain and using
sensitive, topographically responsive building architecture.
Encourage the protection of identified scenic views and vistas.
Discourage development from encroaching on any mapped route.
Encourage residential development where homes are clustered to preserve open
space.
Encourage the identification and marking of historical sites throughout
Lewisville.
Site all parking to the rear or side of the buildings whenever possible.
Seek greenway easements in new developments where designated on the Greenway
and Pedestrian Plan.
Encourage the use of vegetative screens rather than solid, constructed fencing.
Screen mechanical equipment and commercial solid waste disposal containers from
general public view.
Install exterior lighting at a height of more than 8 feet above the finished
grade. All lighting in excess of 12 feet shall be “shoebox” style.
BUILDING DESIGN
Infill construction shall be complimentary to existing buildings of the same
classification.
Limit building height to 48 feet (height of the Roller Mill) except churches
and municipal buildings. (For development in the downtown area, refer to height
guidelines in the Downtown Overlay District Planning Guide.)
Maintain human scale in building size and spacing.
Discourage structures with exposed metal or CMU walls.
TRANSPORTATION/CIRCULATION
Developers shall be required to repair or pay for damage to roads caused by
construction.
Discourage transportation network improvements, water, sewer, gas and cable
extensions in environmentally sensitive areas to those which are required to
protect the general public safety.

TRANSPORTATION
Development in Lewisville is expected to  continue to increase. Land in and
around Lewisville is regarded as one of the most desirable areas to develop
single-family homes. Vision 2005 (the countywide comprehensive plan) and its
update, Legacy, state that this trend will continue. Additional traffic is a
natural outgrowth of development, and Lewisville is experiencing its share.
Residents are now realizing the need to balance and diversify Lewisville’s
transportation system. They also understand that countywide transportation
needs must be met through the implementation of the Thoroughfare Plan (see
Map 10  Thoroughfare Plan), of which Lewisville is a critical component due to
the town’s location adjacent to the proposed Northern Beltway.
Since its incorporation, Lewisville has been a member of the Winston-Salem/
Forsyth County Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC). The TAC consists of
elected officials from each governmental jurisdiction in Forsyth County and one
member representing the North Carolina Board of Transportation. Their charge is
to provide continuing, comprehensive and coordinated transportation planning
throughout the county. The Town of Lewisville has been a valuable member of the
TAC and continues to be a member.
Over the years, Lewisville has received over $2 million dollars from the MPO
for street and sidewalk projects.
Residents of Lewisville are interested in enhancing the visual character of the
town while providing a safe, efficient and diverse transportation system. All
roadway improvements recommended in this plan propose landscaped medians and/or
street trees or landscaping.
Residents of Lewisville recognize that transportation choices can affect the
quality of their health, the health of the environment, and traffic congestion.
The Lewisville Greenway and Pedestrian Connection Plan was completed in 2011
and was received but not adopted by Town Council.
The citizens of Lewisville have expressed a desire to study how alternative
modes of transportation, such as safe bicycling, can be accommodated. On any
given day, there are numerous bicyclists and pedestrians traveling the streets
of Lewisville. There are no bike lanes in Lewisville. The citizens propose that
thoroughfare improvements should be considered and consistent with Complete
Streets during road improvements.
Map 11  Transportation Facilities with Proposed Improvements shows proposed
sidewalks and bike lanes.
The town recognizes that there may be a need to encourage public transportation
in the future. Public transportation could help improve air quality by
decreasing pollution as well as reduce congestion. A number of options are
available and should be evaluated for suitability to Lewisville’s needs. These
options include Park and Ride lots, and bus and van service to the hospitals,
Hanes Mall, and other shopping and employment destinations.
In the future, Lewisville may have improved access to the countywide
transportation network. The proposed Northern Beltway, located just east of the
town limits, and US 421 will provide more convenient access to shopping, and
employment centers throughout the county and the Triad.
Map 11 Transportation Facilities with Proposed Improvements shows proposed road
improvements.
Vision
Lewisville in the year 2035 will continue to  enjoy a transportation system
which meets the needs and desires for access to people and places within and
outside the town. The transportation system will be safe, economical, reliable,
comfortable, convenient, and environmentally friendly. It will provide for the
movement of people and the movement of goods and services. Because this vision
is consistent with the Complete Streets concept being implemented as
appropriate throughout the state of North Carolina, the residents of Lewisville
desire consistency with these principles to ensure that transportation planners
and engineers consistently design and operate the entire roadway with all users
in mind - including bicyclists, public transportation vehicles and riders, and
pedestrians of all ages and abilities. 
There is now a greater recognition that our transportation system needs to go
beyond single-function roads and become a multimodal network, providing people
with integrated transportation choices.
In addition to being multimodal, we also now recognize that our transportation
system needs to be highly connected: streets need to be connected to other
streets as well as other modes, providing a connected network of transportation
options. Benefits of connectivity include decreased traffic on arterial
streets, fuel efficiency and shorter travel distances, more direct routes that
encourage walking and bicycling, quicker emergency vehicle response times, and
more efficient trash and recycling collection.

HEALTH, SAFETY & WELLNESS
Important to any community is the health, safety and well-being of its
citizens. Throughout the history of Lewisville, multiple organizations and
civic entities have provided and continue to provide services to raise
awareness for and promote public health, safety, and community hygiene.

Since the adoption of this chapter in 2005, the Lewisville Comprehensive Plan
continues to reflect the important link between issues of public health,
safety, and wellness to the overall quality of life of town residents. Recent
polling reflects resident interest in facilities and services that support a
safe, healthy and active lifestyle.

Prioritizing and weighing the competing goals of having a low tax rate against
services and infrastructural needs required for safe, active, and healthy
lifestyles is a challenge. Leadership and dialogue is key to finding the
balance between town/residents’ needs for fiscal moderation and an investment
in health and well-being. Efficiencies and economies of scale may be gained
through the mutual reinforcement across land use and transportation decisions.
The intent of this chapter is to address how new and existing services and
infrastructure may be continually enhanced to promote resident health, safety,
wellness and town well-being.
Vision
Lewisville in the year 2035 will continue to actively promote  the health,
safety and well-being of our residents and town. This will be accomplished by
connecting community planning goals across departments, boards, committees and
Council to consider what efforts and/or initiatives are needed to create a more
healthy and complete community. Examples of items for inclusion will be area
plan recommendations, rezoning decisions, facility planning and adaptive reuse
efforts.
The residents of Lewisville understand that the long term robustness, viability
and general well being of the town is dependent upon the overall health, safety
and quality of life enjoyed by its residents. Key to safe, healthy and active
lifestyles is ensuring equal access to services, facilities, natural
environments and infrastructure.
As such, future land development codes shall encourage smart growth land use
codes to serve as a catalyst for neighborhood revitalization, environmental
protection and economic vitality. These new practices will provide
opportunities to improve the built environment and increase physical activity
by promoting healthier communities.

CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT
Lewisville’s uniqueness and charm is displayed in part in its desire to engage
its citizens in a welcoming way that is both entertaining and inventive. This
desire to be a community that truly embraces its citizens sets Lewisville apart
and positions it as a flagship model for towns across America. In so doing,
Lewisville gives its citizens a purpose for being involved, as well as a sense
of belonging and shared ownership in their community. This feeling of propriety
leaves them with the overwhelming feeling that Lewisville is the “place to be.”
Citizen Engagement remains at the very heart of Lewisville’s Comprehensive Plan
and has existed so since its inception.
Design and fund-raising efforts of residents and the town have paid off —
Shallowford (Town) Square received tremendous community support. The design for
this park provides a variety of interesting amenities for residents of all
ages  Shallowford Square also gained state-wide recognition and has received
grant money from the state Parks and Recreation Trust Fund (PARTF). The project
received acclaim for its uniqueness and the value it affords the community.
Soon after incorporation, Lewisville set aside tax dollars for programming and
functions in the Town Square. These events not only serve to entertain the
citizens of Lewisville, but also to educate and build social capital, exposing
citizens of all age groups and social strata to a variety of enriching
experiences. Past and present events have included musical plays, 4th of July
celebrations, movie nights, musical presentations, family fun days, and special
seasonal events, such as Street Party, Shalloween and Christmas Tree lighting
ceremony.

IMAGES/0-0-0-222.jpg]
To produce these events and celebrations, the Town has wisely partnered with
local non-profits, further enhancing their desire for building social capital,
as well as supporting goal-oriented and hard working local citizens. Such
groups include the the Lewisville Civic Club, the Lewisville Area Arts Council,
the Lewisville Historical Society, the American Legion and many other local,
registered non-profits.

IMAGES/0-0-0-224.jpg]
In the future, events will continue to be funded by the town and new events
added or deleted as demand changes.
In keeping with the standard established in 1991, the Town annually reviews the
current per citizen rate designed to cover costs of funded events, and adjusts
accordingly. The standard is based on the “going rate’ of the average movie
ticket, established at that time as $5.50 per citizen. Since the 2015 average
movie ticket price is $8.50, this review is needed in order to maintain the
current level of events and new opportunities.
To further engage its citizens and in conjunction with funded events, the Town
has developed an array of communication means designed to reach all of its
current and projected citizens, keeping the Town current with modern
technology, informing them of proposed upcoming events, and offering them
maximum opportunities for citizen engagement.  Examples of these communications
are Time Warner cable channel 6 (Lewisville’s local news and information
channel), a YouTube channel, Facebook, Twitter and the Town’s phone

DEFINITIONS
Ambient Air Quality - The general air quality surrounding buildings or other
structures.
Bikeway - A bicycle path, in the form of a special reserved lane on a street or
separate facility, such as in connection with a greenway.
Bufferyard - The portion of a yard where special plantings may be required by
an Ordinance to separate and partially screen adjacent land uses providing more
compatibility between uses.
Built Environment - One’s surroundings, including any alterations to the
natural environment other than those due to natural processes.
Capital Improvements Program(CIP) - A detailed schedule of capital improvements
that the local government expects to undertake within a given period (five
years is a usual period).
Clustered Development - As it refers to subdivisions, a clustered development
is one where building lots are grouped together through a transfer of allowable
density within the subdivided tract. Lots smaller than those allowed in a
regular subdivision are allowed, provided the remaining land is reserved as
open space. Such a layout provides for more efficient provision of public
services and infrastructure, and preserves open space.
Collector Streets - Streets within neighborhoods which collect traffic from
local streets and channel it into the arterial system. Collector streets should
be designed so as not to be used as shortcuts by non neighborhood traffic.
Complete Streets - A complete street is a road that is designed to be safe for
drivers; bicyclists; transit vehicles and users; and pedestrians of all ages
and abilities. The complete streets concept focuses not just on individual
roads but on changing the decision-making and design process so that al users
are routinely considered during the planning, designing, building and operating
of all roadways. It is about policy and institutional change.
Comprehensive Plan - Compiled policies adopted by the Town Council, related to
various aspects of the town, including: land use, housing, transportation,
water/sewer, community facilities, natural environment, etc. Comprehensive Plan
policies are used by the Council, boards and committees, developers and land
owners, to guide the growth and development of the community.
Conservation Easement - The granting of a limited interest in property rights
to achieve conservation objectives.
Critical Root Zone - The area under a tree which includes all land within the

out of neighborhoods, not through them.
Locally Designated Landmarks -  Landmarks designated by the Town Council to be
of historic value.
Low Density Residential Development - Is defined in this plan as a ratio of 0
to 4.8 housing units per acre of land.
Low Impact Development (LID) - is a term used to describe a land planning and
engineering design approach to managing stormwater runoff. LID emphasizes
conservation and use of on-site natural features to protect water quality.

performed by the municipality or its contractor within a given area.
Solid Waste Disposal - The final placement of refuse that is not salvaged or
recycled.
Special Intense Development Allocation (SIDA) - Also known as the 10/70 Rule.
This watershed regulation allows the town to designate 10% of its land area
within the Yadkin River Watershed IV to be developed at an impervious surface
coverage of 70%, rather than the standard requirements of 24% or 36% allowable
impervious surface coverage for watershed lands. (See Water Supply Watershed

range from two-lane streets carrying minor traffic volumes to major
thoroughfares with four or more traffic lanes.
Thoroughfare, Minor - A category of streets identified on the Forsyth County
Thoroughfare Plan, which collect traffic from collector and local streets and
carry it to the major thoroughfares. They may supplement major thoroughfares by
facilitating minor traffic movements. These streets may also provide access to
abutting property.
Thoroughfare Plan - A map adopted by each municipality, Forsyth County, the
Transportation Advisory Committee, and the North Carolina Department of
Transportation, contained in Vision 2005 as subsequently amended and showing
the location of existing and proposed freeways/expressways, major thoroughfares
and minor thoroughfares. The Thoroughfare Plan map is on file in the office of
the Winston-Salem Department of Transportation.
Transit Corridor - An area of land on either side of fixed bus or fixed
