membership in open session.

shall cast a vote for his or her preferred nominee. The votes of a majority of
the total number of members voting shall be required to fill the appointment.
If no one receives a majority, then those nominees who receive zero votes will
be removed from consideration and each member shall cast a vote for his or her
preferred nominee remaining for consideration a second time. If no one receives
a majority a second time, then those nominees who receive the least votes will
be removed from consideration so that the two nominees with the highest number
of votes are left for consideration and each member shall cast a vote for his
or her preferred nominee remaining for consideration a third time. The voting
shall continue until a nominee receives a majority of votes cast during a

vote for the same candidate for the same vacancy during a single balloting.
   (E)   Duty to vote. It is the duty of each member to vote for as many
appointees as there are appointments to be made, but failure to do so shall not
invalidate a member's ballot.

by written ballot in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Secret ballots prohibited. The Council may not vote by secret
ballot.

FALSE ALARMS
§ 35.35 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish regulations governing
burglary, robbery and fire alarm systems and to reduce the number of false
alarms in the city, and the resulting waste of the city’s Police and Fire
Department’s resources.
(Code 2019, § 15-10) (Ord. passed 5-12-2003)
§ 35.36 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALARM SYSTEM. Any electronic or mechanical device which emits any signal
(electronic, visible, audible, silent, recorded or otherwise) which is
designed, intended or used to detect an unauthorized entry into a building,
structure or premises, or to signal an attempted robbery or holdup, or to alert
others of the commission of an unlawful act, or to detect the presence of fire
or smoke in or around a building, structure or premises.
   ALARM USER. Any person, corporation, partnership, governmental or
educational entity owning or leasing an alarm system which is maintained for
the protection of such premises.
   CHIEF OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT and the CHIEF OF THE FIRE AND RESCUE
DEPARTMENT. Includes their respected designee.
   FALSE ALARMS. The activation of an alarm system through mechanical or
electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation or the negligence of the
subscriber, his, her or their employees or agents. A FALSE ALARM shall not
include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been activated by
adverse weather conditions, a failure in the electrical power to the alarm or
other condition beyond the control of the alarm user. An alarm is false within
the meaning of this subchapter when, upon inspection by the Fire Department,
evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery or other such crime was
committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a
properly functioning alarm system. FALSE FIRE ALARMS would be without evidence
of fire, smoke or other emergencies that require the response of fire units or
personnel.
(Code 2019, § 15-10.1) (Ord. passed 5-12-2003)
§ 35.37 FALSE ALARMS.
   (A)   Second false alarms. If, within any 60-day period, the city’s Police
or Fire Departments respond to two false alarms at the same premises or
location, the Chief of Police/Fire may send a letter to the alarm user
informing him or her of the false alarms and encouraging the prevention of
future false alarms. If a third or subsequent false alarm occurs within a 60-
day period, a chargeable false alarm violation exists.
   (B)   Third and subsequent alarms. If, within any 60-day period, the city’s
Police and/or Fire Department is dispatched and arrives upon the premises or
location of a third or subsequent false alarm, without having the call
cancelled before arrival, the alarm user at this premises or location shall
reimburse the city. The reimbursement for any such incident shall be $50 for
all such responses. The alarm user will continue to be in violation for each
subsequent false alarm activation until 60 sequential days have elapsed without
a false alarm. The alarm user is entitled to begin a 60-day period for false
alarms as spelled out in division (A) above.
   (C)   Maintenance. Each alarm user in the city, on the effective date of
this subchapter, shall furnish and maintain to the city’s Police and/or Fire
Departments, or to an alarm answering service, a current list of the person(s)
name(s), address(es) and telephone number(s) who may be able to deactivate the
alarm system. After the effective date of this subchapter, it shall be unlawful
to activate an alarm system without first notifying the city’s Police and/or
Fire Department, or alarm answering service of the name(s) and telephone number
(s) of person(s) authorized and able to deactivate the alarm system. Failure to
comply with this division (C) will result in a $50 civil penalty for each alarm
incident.
   (D)   Audible alarms to discontinue emitting alarms after set time. On or
after, May 12, 2003, it shall be unlawful for any person to install or maintain
any audible alarm which does not automatically discontinue emitting an audible
alarm sound within 30 minutes after activation. Failure to comply with this
division (D) will result in a $50 civil penalty.
   (E)   Continuing alarm. An alarm user or his or her representative shall
reset an alarm system when notified by the city’s Police or Fire Department
that such alarm has activated. When an alarm sounds continuously for a period
of 30 minutes from the time units respond to the alarm, due to the failure of
the alarm user or their representative to reset the alarm, every subsequent 30-
minute period or portion thereof that such alarm continues to sound shall be
considered a separate false alarm. The alarm user shall reimburse the city for
police and/or fire services for false alarms under this division (E) at a flat
rate of $10 for each false alarm resulting from the continuous operation of an
alarm, not to exceed $100 for any 24-hour period.
(Code 2019, § 15-10.2) (Ord. passed 5-12-2003)
§ 35.38 AUTHORITY TO WAIVE REIMBURSEMENT.
   The Chief of Police or the Fire Chief shall have the power to waive any fee
charged to an alarm user when such alarm user submits in writing to the Chief
of Police/Fire evidence that the false alarms was not the result of negligence,
and that it occurred in spite of a prior test period of at least 30 days for
reasonable training and maintenance, or when such alarm user submits evidence
to the Chief of Police/Fire which indicates that an alarm to which any city
unit responded was not a false alarm.
(Code 2019, § 15-10.3) (Ord. passed 5-12-2003)
§ 35.99 PENALTY.

penalty is provided, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of §
10.99.

50.056(B).
(Code 2019, § 8-15) (Ord. passed 1-28-2019)
§ 50.056 REMOVAL OF GRAFFITI BY CITY.
   (A)   Notice. Whenever the city becomes aware of the existence of graffiti
on any property, the city is authorized to remove the graffiti as set forth in
this section after giving, or causing to be given, written notice to remove or
effectively obscure such graffiti to the property owner, such property owner’s
manager or agent, or any other person in possession or control of the property.
Whether to remove graffiti from public or private property shall be in the sole
discretion of the city.
   (B)   Method of notice. If the name and address of the property owner,
manager or agent of the property owner, or person in possession or control of
the property can be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence,
written notice shall be provided by personal service; or by certified mail; or
by any manner of mailing that will establish confirmation of the delivery of
the notice. Notice to any one of the individuals set forth above shall be
deemed sufficient notice to remove or effectively obscure the graffiti. If such
address information cannot be so ascertained, written notice shall be affixed
to the property in a conspicuous place.
   (C)   Entry onto premises. If graffiti is not removed or effectively
obscured within 30 calendar days from receipt of the notice described in
division (B) above, the city may cause the graffiti to be removed or
effectively obscured. In the interest of public welfare, the city is authorized
to enter upon any public or private premises for the purpose of removing
graffiti without obtaining additional process or authorization to do so,
provided that notice to remove or effectively obscure the graffiti has been
given as described in division (B) above.
   (D)   Obstruction. It shall be unlawful for any person to intentionally
obstruct the city or the city’s agent from entry onto any premises for the
purpose of removing or obscuring graffiti after written notice as described in
division (B) above has been provided.
   (E)   Appeal procedure. A property owner, his or her agent or manager, or
other person in possession or control of the property, may, within seven
calendar days from receipt of the notice described in division (B) above, file
an appeal with the City Manager or his or her designee. Appeals shall be in
writing and shall state the reasons for the appeal. If the party filing the
appeal requests a hearing, such hearing shall be held by the City Manager or
his or her designee. If, on appeal, the City Manager or his or her designee
determines that the graffiti must be removed, the City Manager or his or her
designee may set a new deadline date for compliance or alternatively, authorize
the city to proceed to remove or obscure the graffiti. The city shall not
remove or obscure any graffiti during the pending of an appeal.
   (F)   Emergency removal. If the City Manager or his or her designee
determines that any graffiti is a danger to the health, safety or welfare of
the public, he or she may immediately, without notice, abate the public
nuisance, and the city may cause the graffiti to be removed at the owner’s
expense.
   (G)   Obstructing emergency removal of graffiti. It shall be unlawful for
any person to intentionally obstruct the city or the city’s agent from entry
onto any premises for the purpose of removing or obscuring graffiti on an
emergency basis.
   (H)   No emergency appeal procedure. When the City Manager or his or her
designee determines that emergency removal is justified under this section,
there is no appeal process regarding the decision to remove or obscure the
graffiti.
   (I)   Repair/restoration. In no case shall the city paint or repair any area
obscured by graffiti more extensively than where the graffiti itself is
located. The city shall not be required to restore the obscured area to its
original condition (i.e., color, texture and the like).
   (J)   Charges for abatement by the city concerning graffiti. The actual
costs incurred by the city in removing or otherwise remedying graffiti pursuant
to these sections shall be charged to the owner of the offending property, and
the owner shall pay these charges within 30 days after receiving from the city
a statement of charges. In the event charges for the removal or abatement of
graffiti are not paid within 30 days after the receipt of a statement of
charges as listed in this section, such charges shall become a lien upon the
land or premises where the graffiti existed and shall be collected as unpaid
taxes, as provided in G.S. § 160A-193.

is used, a copy of the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
premises affected.
   (C)   The Administrator may also give notice to a chronic violator of the
overgrown vegetation regulations in §§
50.035 through

of the citation, then the city may recover from the violator any such unpaid
civil penalty in a civil action in the nature of a debt, pursuant to G.S. §
160A-175(c).
   (C)   Each day that any violation of any provision of this chapter continues

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection add treatment system for the city
and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws,
including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 C.F.R. part 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge

C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type
of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharge during the
calendar month and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division (A) need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
52.079. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
52.075,
52.077 and

ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.130 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW Director finds that any
industrial user or commercial business has violated or is violating this
chapter, wastewater permit or any prohibition, limitation or requirements
contained therein, or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may
serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation.
Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the
city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to division (D) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user or commercial
business who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has
violated this chapter or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit
to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the
event the POTW Director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a
notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action and a
request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days
before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a
corporation.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §
52.999, nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director under this
section subject to an administrative appeal under §
52.061(H).
   (D)   Administrative orders. When the POTW Director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter, permits or orders
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may
issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons
in noncompliance to do any of the following:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
the order;
      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation; and/or
      (4)   Disconnect, unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/
or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the POTW Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW Director
shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon
proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user
shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the
POTW Director prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit or permission to discharge.
      (1)   The POTW Director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or
permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the
following reasons:
         (a)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his or her discharge;
         (b)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
         (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
         (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to
discharge, conditions of this chapter or any applicable state and federal
regulations.
      (2)   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to
show cause under this section why the proposed action should not be taken.

that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or
interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged, and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. passed 9-12-2021)
§ 52.162 BYPASS.
   (A)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (B) and (C) below.
   (B)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW Director, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24

enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) above.
      (2)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Director determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(1) above.

§ 53.01 SCOPE AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   To ensure compliance with
Chapter 52 of this code, this chapter provides specific standards for fats,
oils and grease interceptors’ location, type, size, installation, construction
and maintenance. This chapter regulates grease discharges to the publicly owned
treatment works (POTW) and may require the issuance of permits to certain non-
domestic users and enforcement of general requirements for all users
(commercial and residential).
   (B)   The city’s goal with this chapter is to prevent excessive introduction
of oil and grease into the sewer system and wastewater treatment plant. Fats,
oils and grease have the potential for creating sanitary sewer overflows
(SSOs), hazardous conditions in the collection system, treatment plant
inhibitions, increased treatment cost, fines and other costs to the city.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2021)
§ 53.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   FATS, OILS AND GREASES. Organic polar compounds derived from animal and/or
plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules. Other
substances may include oils, fats, cellulose, starch, proteins, wax or grease,
whether emulsified or not. These are substances that may solidify or become
viscous at temperatures between 32°F and 150°F (0°C and 65°C). These substances
are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures in 40 C.F.R.
part 136, as may be amended from time to time. All are sometimes referred to
herein as GREASE or GREASES.
   FIXTURES. Any point source of discharge from within a business or kitchen
which includes, but is not limited to, sinks, basins, mop sinks, dishwasher,
can wash, glass sink, prep sinks and the like. Floor drains are not considered
a point source unless it is located within a janitorial closet.

operations. Such definition normally includes any establishment that has a food
service license.
   GREASE TRAP OR INTERCEPTOR. A device for separating and retaining waterborne
greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and
entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices also
serve to collect settleable solids, generated by and from food preparation
activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer
collection and treatment system. Such traps or interceptors may be of the
outdoor or underground type, normally of a 1,000-gallon capacity or more, in
addition to under-the-counter package units which are typically less than 100-
gallon capacity. For the purpose of this definition, the terms TRAP and
INTERCEPTOR are used interchangeably. GREASE TRAPS and INTERCEPTORS are
sometimes referred to herein as GREASE INTERCEPTORS.
   HAULER. The company chosen by the customer to transfer waste from their
business to an approved site for disposal or treatment. The hauler is
responsible for assuring that all federal, state and local regulations are
followed regarding waste transport.
   INTERFERENCE. Any discharge which, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, inhibits and/or disrupts the POTW; its treatment processes
and/or operations; and/or its sludge processes, use and/or disposal.
INTERFERENCE includes, but is not limited to, a discharge which, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, causes, in whole or in part, a
violation of one or more of the city’s NPDES permits and/or non-discharge
permits, and/or to the prevention of sewage sludge use or disposal in
compliance with any of the following statutory/regulatory provisions or permits
issued thereunder, or any more stringent state or local regulations: § 405 of
the Act (33 U.S.C. § 1345), or any criteria, guideline or regulations developed
pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 6901 et seq.),

seq., or more stringent state criteria, including those contained in any state
sludge management plan prepared pursuant to Title IV of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, applicable to the method of disposal or use employed by the POTW.
   MINIMUM DESIGN CAPACITY. The design features of a grease interceptor and its
ability or volume required to effectively arrest and retain greases from
grease-laden wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer system.
   NON-COOKING ESTABLISHMENTS. Those establishments primarily engaged in the
preparation of precooked food items that do not include any form of cooking.
These include cold dairy frozen food item preparation and serving
establishments. Such definition also normally includes any establishment that
has a food service license.

thereof, as defined by § 212 of the Act (33 U.S.C. § 1292), which is owned by
the city. This definition includes any devices or systems used in the
collection, storage, treatment, recycling and reclamation of sewage or
industrial wastes of a liquid nature; any conveyances which convey wastewater
to the POTW treatment plant; plant and sewer maintenance personnel; and
microorganisms associated with the treatment process itself.
   USER. Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional limits
of the city, who contributes, causes or permits the contribution of discharge
of wastewater into the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), including persons
who contribute such wastewater from mobile sources, such as those who discharge
hauled wastewater.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2021)
§ 53.03 GREASE INTERCEPTOR MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING AND GREASE REMOVAL.
   (A)   Grease interceptors shall be installed by users, as required by §
52.024(C). Grease interceptors shall be installed, at the user’s expense, when
such user operates a cooking establishment. Grease interceptors may also be
required in non-cooking or cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments and
other industrial, commercial, or institutional establishments when they are
deemed necessary by the City Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease.
   (B)   No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from subject
grease interceptor to exceed 150 milligrams per liter, as identified by Chapter
52.
   (C)   All grease interceptors/traps shall be designed, installed and located
in accordance with this chapter and local building codes. Specifications will
allow for complete access to inspection, cleaning, maintenance and the like.
All outdoor grease interceptors shall have a locking mechanism on all manhole
covers, as deemed acceptable by the Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator. No grease
interceptor shall be less than 1,000 gallons or greater than 1,500 gallons.
When the required capacity exceeds 1,500 gallons, the Pretreatment/FOG
Coordinator will look at all details of facility size and grease production,
and may give special approval for a bigger trap if deemed necessary.
   (D)   All grease interceptors shall be subject to review, evaluation and
inspection by the Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator during normal working hours.
Results of inspections will be made available to facility owners, lease holders
or operators. The Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator may make recommendations for
correction and improvement.
   (E)   All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of
accumulated waste content, as required in order to maintain minimum design
capacity or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not to exceed every
90 days. In-floor and under-the-counter grease traps shall be cleaned not less
than every 30 days.
   (F)   Users who are required to pass water through a grease interceptor
shall:
      (1)   Provide a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at actual
peak flow of 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate, as
predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent
and effluent baffles, with 20% of the total volume of the grease interceptor
being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified hereafter as
“sludge pocket”;
      (2)   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required,
but at intervals not to exceed 90 days for all outdoor grease interceptors and
30 days for all indoor units at the user’s expense. Grease interceptors shall
be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, sand, gravel,
eating utensils, shells, cigarettes, towels, rags and the like, which could
settle into the sludge pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the
grease interceptor;
      (3)   Accept the following conditions: If any skimmed or pumped wastes
removed from the grease interceptor are treated in any fashion on-site and
reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and after said
on-site treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment of the
established grease numerical limit consistent with and contained in division
(C) above on all discharges of wastewater from said grease interceptor into the
city sanitary sewer collection and treatment system;
      (4)   Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain the
device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently achieved.
CONSISTENT shall mean any wastewater sample taken from said grease interceptor
shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described in division
(C) above. If an establishment desires to use an alternative to an out-of-
building grease interceptor, because of documented space restraints, the
request for an alternative location shall contain the following information:
         (a)   Location of city sewer main and easement in relation to
available exterior space outside building.
         (b)   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for
all services at that site.
      (5)   Understand and agree that the use of chemicals, grease solvents,
emulsifiers or thermal sources to temporarily dissolve fats, oils and grease in
lieu of physical cleaning is not considered acceptable grease trap maintenance
practice and is prohibited;
      (6)   Understand and agree that the use of enzymes and special bacteria
formulations to reduce grease trap accumulations may be allowed in certain
cases. A temporary approval may be given for a maximum of six months to prove
their effectiveness. Pump out frequency may be reduced at the discretion of the
Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator if products used prove to be effective. The burden
of documenting these findings is the responsibility of the discharger and will
require monthly service reports detailing the service provided and products
used. If inspection by the pretreatment staff determines this treatment to be
unsatisfactory, normal pumping frequency shall be resumed, as provided for
elsewhere in this chapter;
      (7)   Understand and agree that garbage grinders shall not be discharged
into a grease removal device. Special approval of garbage grinders by the
Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator will be determined on a case by case basis and
must discharge directly into the sewer system. It is not recommended that
garbage grinders/disposals be used in commercial food establishments due to the
amount of solid waste that is discharged into the sewer collection system. The
debris creates sewer blockages and increased maintenance and repair of the
wastewater plant and equipment;
      (8)   Dishwashers shall not discharge into under-the-counter grease traps
or underground interceptors less than 1,500-gallon capacity. If the trap is
sized to provide the manufacturer’s recommended detention time and the trap is
located far enough away from the dishwasher to allow cooling of the water to
less than 110°F, the Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator may grant an exception. A
request shall be made to the Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator, and only after
approval has been given can the dishwasher be installed accordingly. All
wastewater from the dishwasher’s pre-rinse station must be discharged into the
grease removal system;
      (9)   Understand and agree that the Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator reserves
the right to make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy and need, based
on review of all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance,
facility site and building plan review, and to require repairs to,
modifications or replacement of such traps;
      (10)   Understand and agree that the Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator will
conduct facility inspections at a minimum of once every quarter or otherwise at
his or her discretion. Every effort will be made to schedule inspections at a
time that will be convenient to the management staff of said facility. The
Pretreatment Staff will coordinate with the user during regular quarterly
pumping to inspect the condition of the grease interceptor walls, bottom, top,
cover, inlet and outlet pipes, and baffles; and
      (11)   Understand and agree that disposal of fryer oil into the city
sewer system or stormwater system is specifically prohibited. The city strongly
encourages the recycling of used cooking oil. Facility owners may contact the
Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator for a list of renderers/haulers.
   (G)   The user shall submit a grease interceptor maintenance log form
provided by the city to the Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator at the time of each
inspection. The user shall maintain a written record of grease interceptor
maintenance for a period of three years. All such records shall be made
available for inspection by the Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator upon request. The
following information must be maintained: receipt for job performed signed by
the contractor, clean out date, owner or manager of the facility, name and
license number of firm performing the clean out, disposal method and final
destination of material removed.
   (H)   No non-grease laden sources are allowed to be connected to sewer lines
intended for grease interceptor service.
   (I)   Except as provided herein, for a period of three months following
adoption of this chapter, although installation and maintenance of grease
interceptors will be required, no enforcement actions will be pursued under
this chapter for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from said
grease interceptors. If, during this three-month period, an obstruction of a
city sewer main(s) occurs or a sewer lift station problem occurs that causes a
sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and
that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey
sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease from
the establishment in the city’s sewer main(s) or lift station, the city will
take appropriate enforcement actions and may hold responsible the user liable
for costs related to service calls for sewer line blockages, line cleaning,
line and pump repairs, fines and the like, including all labor, materials and
equipment. Failure to pay all service related charges may also be grounds for
sewer service discontinuance.
   (J)   Grease interceptor access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24
inches, shall be provided over each chamber and sanitary tee. The access
manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained
to prevent water inflow and infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily
removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal and wastewater
sampling activities.

53.99
§ 53.04 EXISTING FACILITIES.
   (A)   All existing cooking establishments (or renovated or expanded
establishments) shall have grease interceptors approved by the City
Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator. Cooking establishments without grease
interceptors will be given a deadline not to exceed six months from the date of
notification to have approved and installed grease-handling equipment in
compliance with this chapter.
   (B)   Failure to comply within the specified time frame will be considered a
violation of this chapter, as well as
Chapter 52, and such facilities may be subject to penalties and corrective
actions. Said installations shall meet the same requirements for design as new
facilities.
   (C)   In the event a cooking establishment’s grease interceptor is either
under-designed or substandard in accordance with this policy, the owner(s) will
be notified in writing of the deficiencies and improvements, and given a
compliance deadline not to exceed six months to conform to the requirements of
this policy.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2021) Penalty, see §
53.99
§ 53.05 NEW FACILITIES.
   (A)   All new cooking establishments that require a grease interceptor to be
installed shall be installed outdoors in accordance with this chapter and
guidelines. Grease interceptors shall be adequately sized, based on the formula
given in §
53.06, with no interceptor less than 1,000-gallon total capacity, unless
otherwise approved by the Pretreatment/FOG Coordinator or the Utilities
Director. New facilities that will need grease traps and not interceptors must
have a trap adequately sized in accordance with the sizing guidelines in this
chapter.
   (B)   No new food service establishments will be allowed to initiate
operations until an adequate grease interceptor or grease trap is installed and
approved by the city.
   (C)   Site plans must be submitted for all new food service establishments.
Site plans must be signed and sealed by a state-licensed professional engineer
to certify the plan meets all requirements of §
53.06.
   (D)   All grease interceptors, whether singular or two tanks series, must
have each chamber directly accessible from the surface to provide means for
servicing and maintaining the interceptor in working and operating condition.
(Ord. passed 9-13-2021) Penalty, see §
53.99
§ 53.06 SIZING CHART FOR INDOOR GREASE TRAP.
   (A)   Indoor grease traps should be appropriately sized, as determined by
the following steps:
      (1)   Determine cubic content of the fixture. Multiply length by width by
depth. When a fixture has multiple compartments, the user must add all the
cubic content together to get the total cubic content;
      (2)   Determine capacity in gallons. One gallon equals 231 cubic inches;
      (3)   Determine actual drainage load. The fixture is normally filled to
about 75% of capacity with water. The items being washed displace about 25% of
the fixture content. Thus, the actual drainage load equals 75% of the fixture
capacity;
      (4)   Determine the time that is required to completely drain the
fixture. In general, good practice dictates a one-minute drainage period.
However, where conditions permit, a two-minute drainage period is acceptable.
Flow rate equals actual drainage load;
      (5)   Determine the correct size grease trap based on the flow rate
determined by the chart in division (A)(6) below. Select a properly sized
grease trap. If the size that is determined by this chart is not available,
select the next larger sized grease trap; and
      (6)   Sizing of grease trap.The selections of standard certified grease
traps applicable to various sized fixtures commonly used in domestic,
commercial and industrial installation listed below are based on the formula
provided above, and are commonly used when a grease trap is needed.

   (B)   Outdoor grease traps should be appropriately sized, as determined by
the Manning Formula described below.
      (1)   The Manning Formula. Interceptor size (in gallons) is equal to flow
rate multiplied by the sum of the fixture rating and the discharge rate from
any mechanical washer (i.e. dishwashers, glass washers, laundry machines and
the like) and multiplied by the 24-minute retention time. (Interceptor=[(Fr)x
(R)+(D)]xT)
      (2)   Flow rate. Flow rate is measured in GPM and determined based on the
slope, pipe texture and pipe diameter. The following rates are pre-calculated.
         (a)   One-half foot pipe equals eight-tenths GPM per fixture.
         (b)   One-foot pipe equals five GPM per fixture.
         (c)   One and one-half foot pipe equals 15 GPM per fixture.
         (d)   Two-foot pipe equals 33 GPM per fixture.
         (e)   Two and one-half foot pipe equals 59 GPM per fixture.
         (f)   Three-foot pipe equals 93 GPM per fixture.
      (2)   Fixture ratings. Fixture ratings of grease-laden waste stream are
pre-determined values for specific kitchen drainage points, such as sinks, wash
basins and floor drains. Essentially, these values represent factors by which
you can multiply the flow rate of a drainage pipe to get the potential rate of
water movement out of the fixture.
         (a)   Two-, three-, and four-compartment sinks have a fixture rating
of one.
         (b)   One- and two-compartment meat prep sinks have a fixture rating
of three- quarters.
         (c)   Pre-rinse sinks have a fixture rating of one-half.
         (d)   One- and two-compartment vegetable prep sinks have a fixture
rating of one-quarter.
         (e)   Can wash/mop sinks have a fixture rating of one-quarter.
      (3)   Discharge rate. The discharge rate from dishwashers, laundry
machines, glass washers and the like must be added to the Manning Formula
calculation because of their potential for introducing large quantities of
water down the discharge rate in GPMs, or you can call the manufacturer
directly.
      (4)   Twenty-four-minute retention time. Twenty-four-minute retention
time is a pre- calculated amount of time that engineers have determined to be
necessary for grease to separate from water.

property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection and
compliance monitoring operations. Denial of the city’s access to the user’s
property shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
   (D)   Users receiving unsatisfactory evaluations during inspections shall be
sampled at the grease interceptor discharge by the Pretreatment/FOG
Coordinator, and said sample shall be analyzed by a certified laboratory for
oil and grease. Users shall be charged a fee to cover the cost of sample
analysis. Any user found to be in violation shall be notified in writing of any
noncompliance and will be required to provide a schedule whereby corrections
will be accomplished. In addition, a re-sample fee may be charged to the user
for each additional sample collected and analyzed until the user has re-
established compliance with this chapter.

§ 54.01 GENERAL POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is:
      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by containing within the consumer’s internal distribution system or
private water system contaminants or pollutants which could backflow through
the service connection into the public potable water supply system;
      (2)   To promote the elimination, containment, isolation or control of
existing cross- connections, actual or potential, between the public or
consumer’s potable water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing
fixtures and industrial-process systems; and
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
   (B)   Application. This chapter shall apply to all person(s)/certified
testers and all premises served by the public potable water system of the city.
      (1)   Tester.
         (a)   A person wishing to be put on a list of approved testers for the
city must provide the Cross-Connection ORC with a letter of request with their
full name, address, phone number, name of the school from which the
certification was obtained and the certificate number.
         (b)   The tester wishing to be put on the list of approved testers for
the city must provide his or her test kit certifications for the last two
years. Thereafter, the test kit results must be submitted to the city after
every re-certification.
      (2)   Businesses/residents.
         (a)    BPAs must be tested by a certified tester who has been
certified by an approved school in the testing and repair of backflow
prevention assemblies. All testers must adhere to the test procedures for
reduced pressure principle assemblies as listed in the current procedures from
the University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection and
Hydraulic Research Manual of Cross-Connection Control.
         (b)   All BPAs must be tested and inspected at least annually. It is
the responsibility of the BPA owner to secure a certified tester. Copies of the
inspection report must be submitted to the City ORC to be kept on file by the
city and by the owner of the BPA for not less than five years.
         (c)   If the annual test reveals that repair or replacement is
necessary, the work shall be performed within ten days. A report of such shall
be forwarded to the City Cross-Connection ORC for their records.
         (d)   In the event that a BPA installed inside a vault shows signs of
having operated either through visual inspection or activation of the leak
detection alarm system, the BPA shall be re-tested within ten days.
   (C)   Policy. This chapter will be reasonably interpreted by the water
purveyor. It is the water purveyor’s intent to recognize the varying degrees of
hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of protection shall be
commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   (D)   Responsibility. The water purveyor shall be primarily responsible for
protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination
or pollution due to backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water
service connection. The cooperation of all consumers is required to implement
and maintain the program to control cross-connections. The water purveyor and
consumer are jointly responsible for preventing contamination of the water
system.
   (E)   Notice. If, in the judgment of the water purveyor or their authorized
representative, cross-connection protection is required through either piping
modification or installation of an approved backflow prevention device, due
notice shall be given to the consumer. The consumer shall immediately comply by
providing the required protection at his or her own expense, and failure,
refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to provide such protection
shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until
such protection has been provided.

§ 54.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AIR GAP SEPARATION. The unobstructed vertical distance through the free
atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water
to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the overflow level rim of the
receptacle, and shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe
measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel, but in no case
less than one inch.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water source or system, other than the public
water supply, that may be available in the building or premises.
   BACKFLOW. The flow other than the intended direction of flow of any foreign
liquids, gases or substances into the distribution system of a public water
supply.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. Any double check valve or reduced pressure
principle backflow preventer having resilient-seated shut-off valves on both
the upstream and downstream end and the necessary test cocks as integral parts
of the assembly.
   BACK PRESSURE. Any pressure on water, other liquid, gas, other substances or
any combination thereof in a private water system that is connected in any
manner to the public water system under circumstances in which such pressure is
greater than the pressure on the water in the public water system so that
backflow may occur.
   BACK SIPHONAGE. Any circumstance in which the pressure on the water in the
public water system is less than the atmospheric pressure, which causes a sub-
atmospheric condition on water, other liquid, gas, other substances or any
combination thereof in a private water system that is connected in any manner
to the public water system so that backflow may occur.
   BPA. Backflow Prevention Assembly.
   CERTIFIED TESTER. An individual person who has proven his or her competency
to test, repair and overhaul backflow prevention assemblies of all types and to
prepare reports on such assemblies as evidenced by the successful completion of
a certified training course and on the approved testers list for the city.
   CONSUMER/CUSTOMER. The owner or person in control of any premises supplied
by or in any manner connected to a public water system.
   CONTAINMENT. Protection of the public water supply by installing a backflow
prevention assembly or air gap separation on the main service line to a
facility.

fluids or other wastes to a degree which could create an actual hazard to the
public health through poisoning or through spread of disease by exposure.
   CROSS-CONNECTION. Any physical link between a potable water supply and any
other substance, fluid or source which makes possible contamination of the
potable water supply due to the reversal of flow of the water in the piping or
distribution system.
   DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY. An assembly that consists of two check valves
assembled in a series. This employs two operating principles: first, one check
valve will still act, even if the other is jammed open. Second, the closure of
one valve reduces the pressure differential across the other, allowing a more
reliable seal. The DOUBLE CHECK ASSEMBLY is suitable for prevention of back
pressure and back siphonage, but is not suitable for high hazard applications.
   FDC. Fire Department Connection.
   HAZARD, DEGREE OF. An evaluation of the potential risk to public health and
the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system.
      (1)   HAZARD, HEALTH. Any condition, device or practice in the water
supply system and its operation which could create or may create a danger to
the health and well-being of the water consumer.
         (a)   HAZARD, HIGH. An actual or potential threat of contamination of
the public water system or a customer’s potable water system that could cause
serious illness or death.
         (b)   HAZARD, IMMINENT. An actual threat of contamination to the
public water system that could cause serious illness or death.
         (c)   HAZARD, MODERATE. An actual or potential threat of damage to the
physical components compromising the public water system or a customer’s
potable water system, or of pollution to the public water system or to a
customer’s potable water system.

potable water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker,
air gap separation or backflow prevention assembly.
      (3)   HAZARD, POLLUTIONAL. An actual or potential threat to the physical
properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the
consumer’s potable water system, but which would constitute a nuisance or be
aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its
appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.
      (4)   HAZARD, SYSTEM. An actual or potential threat of severe damage to
the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer’s
potable water system, or of a pollution or contamination which would have a
protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
   INDUSTRIAL PROCESS SYSTEM. Any system containing a fluid or solution which
may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form
or concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional or
plumbing hazard if introduced into the potable water supply.
   ISOLATION. Protection of a facility’s internal plumbing system by installing
a backflow prevention assembly, air gap separation or other backflow prevention
device on an individual fixture, appurtenance or system.
   POLLUTION. The presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic or
biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a
hazard or impair the usefulness of the water to a degree which does not create
an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably
affect such waters for domestic use.
   PUBLIC POTABLE WATER SYSTEM. Any publicly or privately owned water system
supplying water to the general public which is satisfactory for drinking,
culinary and domestic purposes, and meets the requirements of the State
Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
   PVB (PRESSURE VACUUM BREAKER). A backflow prevention device that uses
mechanical springs to prevent non-potable water from entering the water supply.
This unit is a testable and serviceable unit. There are two test cocks to allow
the inspector to verify proper operation of the unit.
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE ASSEMBLY.
      (A)   The device consists of two independent check valves, plumbed in
series, with a pressure monitored chamber between (also known as the zone). The
chamber is maintained at a pressure that is lower than the water supply
pressure, but high enough to be useful downstream.
      (B)   The reduced pressure is guaranteed by a differential pressure
relief valve, which automatically relieves excess pressure in the chamber by
discharging to a drain. Four test cocks are installed to allow an inspector to
verify proper operation of the valve with a differential pressure meter. Two
valves (one before and one after the RPZD) are provided to allow for testing
and repair. A REDUCED PRESSURE ASSEMBLY is considered suitable for high hazard
applications.
   SERVICE CONNECTION. The terminal end of a service line from the public water
system. If the meter is installed at the end of the service, then the service
connection means the downstream end of the meter.
   WATER PURVEYOR. The owner, operator or individual in responsible charge of a
public water system.
(Ord. 07-14-03B, passed 8-8-2022)
§ 54.03 CROSS-CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   No water service connection shall be installed or maintained to any
premises where actual or potential cross-connections to the public potable or
consumer’s water system may exist unless such actual or potential cross-
connections are abated or controlled to the satisfaction of the water purveyor,
and as required by the laws and regulations of the State Department of
Environmental Quality, Public Water Supply.
   (B)   No connection shall be installed or maintained whereby an auxiliary
water supply may enter a public potable or consumer’s water system unless such
auxiliary water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply

      (3)   Accessibility; clearances. Minimum side, end and top clearances are
as follows:
         (a)   One-quarter-inch through one-inch shall have a clearance of four
inches from the end walls to ball valves, eight inches clearances on the side
utilizing the test cocks and four inches on the opposite side.
         (b)   Two-inch through ten-inch shall be installed in a sealed H-20
traffic rated vault. The two-inch BPA shall have a clearance of four inches
from the end walls to ball valves, 12 inches minimum clearance on the test side
of the assembly and eight inches minimum clearance on the opposite side.
         (c)   Three-inch through ten-inch BPA shall have a clearance of eight
inches from the end walls to the ball valves, 30 inches clearances on the test
side of the assembly and 12 inches clearances on the opposite side.
         (d)   The clearance requirements under §
54.08(I) may be waived if:
            1.   Adequate access to all parts of the BPA (including the shut
off valves) is readily provided; and
            2.   Access provided allows testing and maintenance activity to be
completed without having to enter the enclosure, and the enclosure is
lightweight (i.e., each section requires no more than three or four men to
remove) and is fully removable intact or in panels.
      (4)   Drainage. Adequate drainage for reduced pressure principle BPAs
shall be provided via drain ports along the bottom of one of the side walls of
the enclosure.
      (5)   Restrictions on placement. Above ground installations must be
located outside of all required sight triangles, rights-of-way and easements.
They shall not impair line of sight or legal movement for vehicular or
pedestrian traffic. There may be other project-specific conditions that, in the
opinion of the ORC, warrant additional constraints on the location of the BPA.
      (6)   Below grade installations.
         (a)   Below grade installations of BPAs are not recommended. They are
classified as confined spaces and are at increased risk of flooding due to
clogged or undersized drains. Also, leaky or damaged assemblies are not as
evident as they are in above ground installations. BPAs may be installed below
grade if the design engineer for the project can demonstrate that an above
grade installation is infeasible due to space availability of other
constraints. Every attempt must be made by the design engineer to provide for
above ground installation of BPAs. Approval of below grade installations will
be at the discretion of the Backflow ORC.
         (b)   All below grade installations shall be in a vault with a water-
tight hatch or door and shall drain to grade or to a stormwater catch basin.
The drain pipe must be fitted with a vermin screen at each end.
         (c)   The following clearances shall be maintained around the BPAs
within the vault.
            1.   Three-quarter-inch through one-inch shall have a clearance of
four inches from the end walls to ball valves, eight inches clearance on the
side utilizing the test cocks and four inches on the opposite side.
            2.   Two-inch through ten-inch shall be installed in a sealed H-20
traffic rated vault. The two-inch BPA shall have a clearance of four inches
from the end walls to ball valves, 12 inches minimum clearance on the test side
of the assembly and eight inches minimum clearance on the opposite side.
            3.   Three-inch through ten-inch BPAs shall have a clearance of
eight inches from the end walls to the ball valves, 30 inches clearance on the
test side of the assembly and 12 inches clearances on the opposite side.

§ 55.01 INTRODUCTION.
   It is the responsibility of the city (NPDES NC0021156) to enforce all
applicable federal, state and local pretreatment regulations. These regulations
are outline in federal regulation 40 C.F.R. part 403 and state regulation 15A
N.C. Admin. Code 02H.0900, and
Chapter 52 of this code. This Enforcement Response Plan (ERP) has been
established as an element of the POTW’s pretreatment program. The purpose of
the ERP is to provide for fair and equitable treatment of all users for
anticipated enforcement situations. In general, enforcement actions will be
taken in accordance with this Enforcement Response Plan. However, the
enforcement actions available are not exclusive (NG Model SUO § 8.4).
Therefore, any combination of the enforcement actions can be taken against a
noncompliant user.
(Ord. passed 2-14-2022)
§ 55.02 ENFORCEMENT ACTION AVAILABLE TO THE POTW.
   (A)   The Director of the POTW is empowered through G.S. § 143-215.6A and
Chapter 52 of this code to take a wide variety of enforcement actions. The
following is a list of those actions and the corresponding section of this code
that describes each:

provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B may be referred by the Director to the District
Attorney for possible criminal prosecution.
   (C)   In determining the amount of civil penalties for a particular
violation, the Director shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to the
public health, or to public or private property resulting from the violation;
      (2)   The duration and gravity of the violation;
      (3)   The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality, or on
air quality;
      (4)   The cost of rectifying the damage;
      (5)   The amount of money saved by noncompliance;

   The staff of the POTW will generally investigate user compliance with
permits or the provisions of
Chapter 52 in three ways:
   (A)   On-site inspections of the user to include scheduled and unscheduled
visits;
   (B)   Scheduled and unscheduled sampling of the user’s effluent; and
   (C)   Review of self-monitoring data, if required, from the user.

55.99
§ 55.05 RESPONSES: TIMEFRAME, RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS, ESCALATED ACTIONS.
   (A)   The Enforcement Response Plan contains an Enforcement Response Guide
(ERG) which outlines types of violations and specifies the city’s actions, both
internal and escalated, timeframes, and the person(s) responsible for
completing the actions. The city uses a tiered response approach geared to a
six-month reporting period to enforce
Chapter 52, however, for ongoing noncompliance and/or situations with severe
impacts, the city will consider the user’s previous history, violations that
occur but are not contained in this ERP will be evaluated on a case by case
basis.
   (B)   Responses to violations that the city determines have or may:
      (1)   Affect the operation of the POTW;
      (2)   Cause adverse impact to the POTW;
      (3)   Result in interference;
      (4)   Result in inhibition;
      (5)   Result in pass through;
      (6)   Cause POTW, NPDES, collection system or other state and/or
federally issued permit violations; or
      (7)   Result in environmental harm or endangerment to human health will
be taken immediately following discovery.
   (C)   Certain cases may be referred to the state or federal government for
possible criminal investigation and enforcement. Reference
Chapter 52 for further guidance.
(Ord. passed 2-14-2022) Penalty, see §
55.99
§ 55.06 ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE GUIDE.
   (A)   Special notes for the Enforcement Response Guide (ERG).
      (1)   Unless otherwise noted, FIRST TIME means the first violation
incident in a five- year period and SECOND TIME means the second violation
incident in the same five-year period from the date of the initial violation.
      (2)   For users in the fats, oils and grease program, FIRST TIME refers
to commercial compliance period while SECOND TIME refers to at least ten
business days following initial discovery of the deficiency. Each subsequent
violation during the same commercial compliance period would be elevated to the
next tier. The incident “time clock” would begin again during the next
commercial compliance period.
      (3)   Violations marked with three asterisks (***) are severe violations.
Due to the severity of these violations, first time and second time, and
subsequent violations, refer to the life of the operations. The incident “time
clock” does not reset or begin again during the next reporting period for these
violations.
      (4)   Certain violations list two different tiers to address the
possibility of any significant noncompliance (SNC) issues.
      (5)   Any violation falling under more than one category in the
Enforcement Response Guide may be addressed using the highest tier.
      (6)   Three or more Tier 2 or lower violations within the same reporting
period may result in elevated enforcement action at the discretion of the city.
These violations do not have to be violations of the same section of the
chapter.
      (7)   Violations committed by users subject to 40 C.F.R. part 441 may be
reviewed on a case by case basis. Any subsequent enforcement response will be
at the discretion of the city. Matters taken into consideration may include,
but are not limited to, interference with the operation of the POTW and the
reclamation of municipal sludge, pass-through and harm to POTW personnel or the
general public. Formal enforcement remedies available to the city can be found
in Chapter 52.

   (D)   Enforcement responses are as follows.
      (1)   Phone calls or other communications may be used immediately upon
the recognition of a violation in an attempt to expedite correction of the
violation at the lowest level possible. These actions may be documented in the
user’s file.
      (2)   Notices of deficiency (NODs) may be used for minor or infrequent
violations that can be resolved in short order.
      (3)   Conferences may be used where NODs, phone calls or other
communication do not result in a return to compliance. Generally, they will be
held at the System Protection office with a user representative and
Pretreatment ORC personnel present.
      (4)   Agreements and orders.
         (a)   Compliance agreements (CAs) are typically used as a toll in
responding to continued significant noncompliance. The terms and conditions of
CAs may be negotiated, depending upon the circumstances involved; and
         (b)   Compliance orders (COs) are typically used in place of or in
addition to CAs, depending on the nature and severity of the violations
involved. The terms and conditions of COs may not be negotiated.
      (5)   Civil penalties are to be used as a punitive deterrent to continued
noncompliance and/or failure to meet established milestones.
      (6)   Show cause orders may be issued to initiate notions leading to
formal hearings in cases of continued significant noncompliance or where the
Pretreatment ORC determines that emergency enforcement actions are necessary.
      (7)   Civil action may be used in cases of continued significant
noncompliance or where the Pretreatment ORC determines that emergency actions
are necessary.
      (8)   Criminal action may be used where there is evidence of criminal
intent, or in extreme recurring cases.
      (9)   Service suspension or termination may be used in recurring or
emergency cases where there may be damage or adverse impact to the city, the
POTW or the environment.
      (10)   The responses listed are non-exclusive. Other responses may be
taken based on the nature and severity of the violations. Responses not listed
here will be determined based on the same factors used to determine civil
penalty amounts.
      (11)   Multiple violations or any combination of violations or
deficiencies may lead to elevated enforcement actions.
   (E)   Timeframes shall be as follows.
      (1)   Violations will be identified and documented within 30 days of
receiving information.
      (2)   Initial enforcement responses will occur within 15 days of
violation identification.
      (3)   Violations meeting the criteria for significant noncompliance may
be addressed with an enforceable order within 45 days of the identification of
significant noncompliance.
      (4)   Violations which present imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of any person or the environment, cause interference or
cause the city to violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge or any
other state and/or federally issued permits may result in the issuance of a
“cease and desist” order. This order will be issued immediately upon discovery
of the violation.
(Ord. passed 2-14-2022) Penalty, see §
55.99
§ 55.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Penalties are assessed by the city to serve as an economic deterrent
against violations to the sewer use regulations. The city has categorized
various types of violations and assigned a tiered penalty system. The specific
penalty is based on the type of violation (Tier 1 through Tier 7). Civil
penalties may be assessed up to the maximum of $25,000 per violation, per day,
for as long as the violation continues. Each day on which a violation shall
occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.
   (B)   In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the city shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   The extent of harm caused by the violation;
      (2)   The magnitude and duration of the violation;
      (3)   Any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation;
      (4)   Corrective actions by the user;
      (5)   The compliance history of the user;
      (6)   The cost of enforcement to the city;
      (7)   Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally; and
      (8)   Any other factor, as justice requires.
   (C)   In addition to any civil penalties that the city may impose against a
user in accordance with §
52.999, the city may assess against and recover from a responsible user any
repair, restoration or maintenance cost and any damage incurred by anyone for
which the city is liable, if such repair, restoration or maintenance cost or
damage arises in any manner from the responsible user’s violation(s). For
purposes of this section, repair or maintenance includes, without limitation,
the removal of any accumulation of any pollutant from the POTW that the user’s
violation(s) has caused or contributed to. Such assessments may be added to the
user’s next scheduled sewer service charges, and the city shall have such
remedies for collection of such assessments as it has for collection of other
charges.
   (D)   The city reserves the right to assess the maximum penalty for any
violation.
   (E)   Tiered enforcement actions are as follows. In lieu of monetary
penalties, other remedies may be approved as determined by the City System
Protection:
      (1)   Tier 1: Phone call or other communication; site visit for
discussion; violation noted in the EMP (Evaluation of Monitoring Performance)
letter; notice of deficiency (NOD);
      (2)   Tier 2: Meeting with user representatives; NOD; written report
detailing corrective measures provided by the user;
      (3)   Tier 3: $100 to $500 civil penalty; NOV; significant noncompliance
(SNC); public notice; compliance agreement;
      (4)   Tier 4: $500 to $1,000 civil penalty; NOV; SNC; public notice;
compliance agreement or compliance order;
      (5)   Tier 5: $1,000 to $5,000 civil penalty; NOV; SNC; public notice;
compliance agreement or compliance order; administrative order;
      (6)   Tier 6: $5,000 to $10,000 civil penalty; NOV; SNC; public notice;
compliance agreement or compliance order; administrative order; suspension of
services; and
      (7)   Tier 7: $10,000 to $25,000 civil penalty; NOV; SNC; public notice;
compliance agreement or compliance order; administrative order; termination of
services.

§ 56.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect and promote the public
health, safety and welfare by preventing the introduction of potentially
harmful materials into the city storm drainage system; to protect property from
potential stormwater damage; to maintain and enhance water quality; to meet the
requirements of the city’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Permit; and
to establish the administration and enforcement procedures through which the
purposes can be fulfilled.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter are supplemental to regulations
administered by federal and state governments. The city’s stormwater management
needs are met through programs designed to protect and manage water quality and
water quantity before discharge to receiving streams.
   (C)   The City Council makes the following findings: Stormwater poses a
serious threat to public health, safety and welfare. This threat cannot be
eliminated entirely. Factors affecting this threat which are beyond the city’s
control include: frequency and intensity of precipitation; the topography in
and around the city; the types of soils and other geologic structures found in
and around the city, body of law established under state and federal authority
concerning water rights generally and including, but not limited to, navigable
and non-navigable waters, surface waters, and underground waters; unauthorized
interference with the city’s stormwater drainage system; and the amount of
impervious surfaces associated with a reasonable level of development. The
management of stormwater can reduce this threat through constructing, operating
and maintaining facilities; and regulating and controlling the use and
development of land to reduce the adverse effects of stormwater.

junked vehicle which is to be removed shall be towed only after notice to the
registered owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle. In the case
of a nuisance vehicle or a junked motor vehicle, if the names and mailing
addresses of the registered owner or person entitled to the possession of the

the notice shall be sent by first class mail. The person who mails the notice
(s) shall retain a written record to show the name(s) and address(s) to which
mailed, and the date mailed. If such names and addresses cannot be ascertained,

specified date, no sooner than seven days after the notice is affixed or
mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by owner or legal possessor prior to that

required to be given, if the registered owner or person entitled to possession
does not remove the vehicle but chooses to appeal the authorizing official’s
determination that the vehicle is abandoned, a safety or health hazard, or, in
the case of a junked vehicle, that the aesthetic benefits of removing the
vehicle outweigh the burdens, he or she may submit a written request to do so
to the authorizing official before the seven-day period has expired.
      (2)   Such appeal shall be made to the Zoning Board of Adjustments in
writing, heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting, provided that the
requirements for notification of adjacent property owners are met. Further
proceedings to remove the vehicle shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and
decided.
   (C)   (1)   The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an
abandoned, junked or nuisance vehicle may, as determined by the authorizing
official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a special need for
prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to otherwise maintain and
protect the public safety and welfare.
      (2)   By way of illustration and not of limitation, such circumstances
include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to business and
residences, vehicles parked in such a location or manner as to pose a traffic
hazard, and vehicles causing damage to public or private property. Such
findings shall, in all cases, be entered by the authorizing official in the

registration is removed, the authorizing official shall immediately notify the
last known registered owner of the vehicle, such notice to include the
following:
         (a)   The description of the removed vehicle;
         (b)   The location where the vehicle is stored;

hearing.
      (2)   If the vehicle is registered in the state, notice shall be given
within 24 hours from removal of the vehicle. Otherwise, notice shall be given
to the registered owner within 72 hours from removal of the vehicle. Notice
shall be sent to the owner at his or her last known address of the registered
owner unless he or she, or his or her agent, waives this notice in writing.
   (C)   Whenever an abandoned, junked or nuisance vehicle is removed and such
vehicle has no valid registration or registration plate, the authorizing
official shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the vehicle
identification number to determine the last known registered owner and to
notify the owner of the information listed in division (B) above. If the last
known registered owner cannot be determined, the notice posted on the vehicle
as required in §
75.07(A) shall be deemed reasonable efforts to determine the last known owner.

§ 75.09 PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING PRIOR TO DISPOSITION.
   (A)   (1)   After removal of an abandoned, junked or nuisance vehicle and
within 20 days from the date of mailing of the notice set forth in §

request with the county magistrate for a hearing to determine if probable cause
existed for removing the vehicle.

of the request, and the hearing will be conducted in accordance with G.S. § 20-
219.11 as amended.

city shall:
      (1)   If the hearing is held before the vehicle is reclaimed, notify the
person in possession of the vehicle to release it and pay all charges, if any;
or
      (2)   If the hearing is held after the vehicle is reclaimed, reimburse
the owner for all charges incurred incident to the towing and storage of the
vehicle.
   (C)   Any aggrieved party may appeal the magistrate’s decision to District
Court.

§ 75.10 RIGHT TO REDEEM.
   (A)   At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause
hearing, the owner may obtain possession of the removed vehicle by paying all
towing and storage fees accrued to date or by posting bond for double the
amount of such fees and charges to the tow truck operator or towing business
having custody of the removed vehicle.
   (B)   Upon regaining possession of a vehicle, the owner or person entitled
to the possession of the vehicle shall not allow or engage in further
violations of this chapter.

§ 76.01 AUTHORITY TO REGULATE.
   Pursuant to G.S. § 160A-300.6, the city is authorized, by ordinance, to
require the registration of and to regulate the operation of golf carts upon
any public street or road within the city.
(Code 2019, § 13-72)
§ 76.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The establishment of a golf cart chapter is necessary to address the
interests of public safety. Golf carts are not designed or manufactured to be
used on public streets, roads and highways, and the city in no way advocates or
endorses their operation on roads. The city, by regulating such operation, is
merely trying to address obvious safety issues, and the adoption of this
chapter is not to be relied upon as a determination that operation on roads is
safe or advisable if done in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   All persons who operate or ride upon carts on roads do so at their own
risk and peril, and must be observant of and attentive to the safety of
themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists
and pedestrians. The city has no liability under any theory of liability for
permitting carts to be operated on roads under special legislation granted by
the state legislature. Any person who operates a cart must procure liability
insurance sufficient to cover the risks involved in using a cart on the roads
of the city.
(Code 2019, § 13-73) Penalty, see §
76.99
§ 76.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CERTIFIED GOLF CART ROADS. Those roads defined in §
76.06 below.
   GOLF CART. A vehicle designed and manufactured for operation on a golf
course for sporting or recreational purposes and that is not capable of
exceeding speeds of 20 mph, as defined by G.S. § 20- 4.01(12b).
   OPERATE. To drive, or to be in physical control of a golf cart that is
moving or has its engine on.
(Code 2019, § 13-74)
§ 76.04 OPERATION ON PUBLIC STREETS AND ROADS.
   It is unlawful to operate a golf cart on a public street or road within the
city unless the following requirements are met.
   (A)   The golf cart may only be operated on certified golf cart roads that
meet the requirements of §
76.06, except as provided in division (J) below.
   (B)   The operator of the golf cart must have a valid, issued registration,
issued by the Police Department in accordance with §
76.05.
   (C)   Any person who operates a golf cart must be responsible for all
liability associated with operation of the golf cart, and must have liability
insurance coverage which will cover the use of a golf cart in an amount not
less than required by state law for motor vehicles operated on public highways
in the state, and must carry proof of insurance when operating the golf cart.
   (D)   (1)   Except as set forth in division (D)(2) below, no person may
operate a golf cart unless that person is at least 16 years of age and licensed
to drive upon the streets and highways of the state, and then, only in
accordance with such person’s valid driver’s license. Golf cart operators must
carry their driver’s license on their person at all times while operating a
golf cart on public roads.
      (2)   A person wishing to operate a golf cart who is 18 years of age or
older with a medical or physical condition that prevents that individual from
being able to obtain a valid state driver’s license may provide to the Chief of
Police a letter from a physician certifying that the medical or physical
condition preventing such person from obtaining a driver’s license does not
impair his or her ability to safely operate a golf cart. The Chief of Police
will review the physician’s letter and other relevant factors to make a
determination as to whether there is sufficient evidence of the person’s
ability to safely operate a golf cart, and if so, the Chief of Police shall
issue a letter of exemption from the driver’s license requirement. The
physician’s letter, however, does not automatically entitle the person to such
exemption. Any person that is exempt from the requirement of a valid state
license must carry with him or her, while operating the golf cart on a public
street, his or her letter of exemption and a valid state identification card.
   (E)   An operator may not allow the number of people in the golf cart at any
one time to exceed the maximum capacity specified by the manufacturer. The
operator shall not allow passengers to ride on any part of a golf cart not
designed to carry passengers, such as the part of the golf cart designed to
carry golf bags. The operator shall not allow any passenger to ride on any part
of a golf cart who would be required to ride in a car seat if riding in a car.
   (F)   No golf cart may be operated at a speed greater than reasonable and
prudent for the existing conditions, and in no instance at a speed greater than
20 mph.
   (G)   No golf cart may be operated in a careless or reckless manner.
   (H)   Golf carts must be operated to the right edge of the roadway and must
yield to all vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
   (I)   Golf carts not equipped with WORKING LIGHTS (as defined herein) may
only be operated on public streets from 7:00 a.m. to sundown. Golf carts
properly equipped with WORKING LIGHTS may be operated on public streets only
between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. To be properly equipped with
WORKING LIGHTS, golf carts shall have two operating headlights directed
forward, one on each side of the front of the golf cart, and two operating tail
lights, one on each side of the rear of the cart; all four lights must be
visible from a distance of 500 feet.
   (J)   Golf carts shall not be operated on any sidewalk, pedestrian walkway,
jogging path, greenway, park or trail, except by city personnel while on city
business. Application may be made to the City Manager, or his or her designee,
for a waiver of this provision for a period of one or two days for the express
purpose of undertaking a specific project benefitting a greenway, park or
trail.
   (K)   Golf carts may only be parked in the same manner and at the same
places designated for the parking of motor vehicles. The stopping, standing or
parking of golf carts in an area where parking is not allowed or in any place
that impedes the flow of traffic or pedestrian walkways is prohibited.
   (L)   Golf carts must be operated in accordance with all applicable state
and local laws and ordinances, including all laws, regulations and ordinances
pertaining to the possession and use of alcoholic beverages.
   (M)   Golf carts must have the basic equipment supplied by the manufacturer,
including a vehicle identification number. Such equipment must include all
safety devices as installed by said manufacturer, including rear view mirror,
50 square inches of reflective tape on the rear or rear triangle reflector of
the type required by state law, and lights, if the vehicle is to be operated at
any time before sunrise or after sunset, as provided in division (I) above. In
addition, golf carts must start with a key and be equipped with a non-manually
operated horn.

76.99
§ 76.05 REGISTRATION, INSPECTION AND FEE.
   (A)   Registration required. No golf cart may be operated on any public
street or road within the city unless the golf cart has first been registered
with the Police Department as required herein. The registration shall be
renewed thereafter in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Application. The application for registration shall be made to the
Police Chief, or to some other person designated by him or her, on forms
provided by the Police Department. Along with the application, the applicant
shall provide a valid driver’s license and proof of liability insurance, as
required by §
76.04(D). A registration fee in the amount of $35 shall be paid to the city at
the time the application for registration is filed or at the time of filing any
renewal of the application.
   (C)   Inspection. Prior to issuing the initial registration permit, an
inspector from the Police Department must perform an inspection at the Police
Department, or under special circumstances and with the approval of the Chief,
at the location of the golf cart within the city limits of the city, to
determine that:
      (1)   The golf cart is equipped with all mechanical systems and safety

(Code 2019, § 7-12D) (Ord. passed 1-25-2016)
§ 93.27 GATED COMMUNITIES.
   (A)   In accordance with G.S. § 20-158.3, any legal entity having
responsibility for a controlled access system on a road that is a public
vehicular area, as defined in G.S. § 20-4.01(32), to include a road within a
gated subdivision or community whether or not the road has been dedicated to
the public, shall provide a means of immediate access to all emergency service
vehicles, which shall include law enforcement, fire, rescue, ambulance and
first responder vehicles. The intent of this section is to regulate the
installation and construction of emergency access roads into developments and
commercial properties which are restricted by gates to provide consistency in
emergency response access for the health and safety of citizens who live or
work on private roads restricted by gates.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful to obstruct ingress and egress to a public street
by a gate.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, install or maintain
any blocking device, such as a gate or any other type of barrier, across any
public vehicular area without providing emergency access routes in accordance
with this section and obtaining a permit from the Fire Department.
   (D)   The location of any emergency access routes and gate(s) shall comply
with the development requirements for the city.
   (E)   Emergency access routes shall have an unobstructed width of not less
than 20 feet and an unobstructed vertical clearance of not less than 13 feet
six inches.
   (F)   Gates across emergency access routes shall be electrical in operation.
All electrical vehicular gates shall be provided with access control using a
radio transceiver for public safety personnel and authorized users. This
transceiver will allow emergency vehicles to open the gate from a mobile or
portable radio. In order to provide for consistent access, the type of device
must be approved by the City Fire Department.
   (G)   All electrical vehicular gates must be provided with a fail-open
device to open it during power failures. During a power failure, the gates will
open and remain open. These devices usually restore the gate(s) to the closed
position after the power is restored. In the event a mechanical malfunction
prevents a gate from opening as intended, sufficient access to any mechanism
allowing a manual override must be provided.
   (H)   Gates need to be opened for appropriate personnel to enter the
community during an emergency. A Knox dual key activating switch or padlock
shall be installed to allow emergency personnel access through vehicular gates.
   (I)   An approved Knox dual key lock box shall be installed to allow
emergency personnel access through all pedestrian gates.
   (J)   If the vehicular gate is a swing-type or roll-type gate, it should be
designed so that, when the gate is fully opened, it does not obstruct the path
of travel for vehicles or pedestrians.
   (K)   If there are two or more gates in any single development, all gates
must be operated in the same fashion. The egress gate should be constructed so
that, when the apparatus approaches the gate, it will automatically open. If
this option is not feasible, then the gate must be activated by an approved
radio transceiver device.
   (L)   Gate activation shall not be altered or placed out of service without
prior notification to the Fire Department.
   (M)   In instances where a gate fails to operate in its intended operational
capacity and such failure results in damage to the gate, or causes the
responding emergency agency to alter normal entrance procedures, the responding
agency, mutual aid departments and the city shall not be held liable for
damages incurred.
   (N) In order to receive a permit under this section, the applicant must
submit a detailed plan, including, but not limited to, scaled drawings showing
the location of the gates, turn radius, dimensions of the gates, pavement,
sidewalks and curbs. Information such as topography lines, vegetation, sight
triangles and the like will also need to be included with the submittal.
   (O)   All applicable permits for the construction of gates will be required
to be obtained from the county.
   (P)   (1)   The gate across emergency access routes, along with the exterior
gates encompassing the development, shall be kept in working order and shall be
repaired and/or replaced in the event they are disabled and/or damaged.
      (2)   The Fire Department shall be notified immediately when the gate is
inoperable and after the repairs have been completed. It is not the
responsibility of the city to maintain these gates. Gates shall be inspected by
the City Fire Department annually to verify the gates are in operable condition
in the event of an emergency.
   (Q)   Violators will be notified in writing by the city and will be required
to remedy the problem immediately.
   (R)   Violation determinations appeals and requests for variance of the
requirements of this section may be heard and a final determination made by the
Board of Adjustments.

§ 150.037 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ORDERS.
   (A)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair the building or
structure, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer may:
      (1)   Cause such structure to be repaired, and pending such repairs, may
order the building to be vacated and closed; and/or
      (2)   Cause to be posted on the main entrance of any structure so closed,
a placard entitled, “notice of condemnation” with the following words: “Notice
is hereby given that this building is unsafe and in a dangerous condition; may
constitute a fire hazard by reason of structural defects and general state of
decay, deterioration and disrepair; may be hazardous or dangerous to children
or members of the public generally, or may be dangerously infested with vermin,
rodents or insects. Such building has been condemned under the building laws of

building, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer may:
      (1)   Cause such structure to be removed or demolished; and

dangerous condition; may constitute a fire hazard by reason of structural
defects and general state of decay, deterioration and disrepair; may be
hazardous or dangerous to children or members of the public generally, or may
be dangerously infested with vermin, rodents or insects. Such building has been
condemned under the building laws of the State of North Carolina and the City
of Mount Holly.”
   (C)   The duties of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer set forth in
divisions (A) and (B) above shall not be exercised until:
      (1)   The City Attorney shall institute in the General Court of Justice
an appropriate action to seek an order of the court directing such owner to

to order him or her, by an ordinance specifically describing the subject
property, to do the following:
            1.   Cause such building to be repaired, altered and improved to
comply with the standards established by this subchapter; or
            2.   Cause such building to be vacated, closed and removed or
demolished.
         (b)   The Council, in ordering one of the aforesaid alternatives,
shall order the specific action that will best effectuate the purposes of this
subchapter. Once the ordinance is adopted by the Council, a true copy of such
ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of the
county, and the Registrar shall index the name of the property owner in the
“grantor index”.
   (D)   The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations and improvements, or
vacating, closing and removal or demolition shall be a lien against the real

same priority and be collected as the lien for special assessment provided in
G.S. Article 10, Chapter 160A, being G.S. §§ 160A-216 et seq. If the unsafe
building is removed or demolished by the Chief Code Enforcement Officer, he or
she shall, if possible, sell in any commercially reasonable manner the
materials of the unsafe building and shall credit the proceeds of the sale, if
any, against the cost of the removal or demolition. Any balance remaining shall
be deposited by the Chief Code Enforcement Officer with the Clerk of Superior
Court for subsequent disbursement by the court to the persons found by the
court to be entitled thereto.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any
way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their
removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise, nor provided herein
or otherwise.

§ 150.038 APPEALS.
   (A)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer pursuant to this subchapter may be taken by any person aggrieved
thereby. Any appeal from the Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall be taken
within ten days from the rendering of the decision, or if either the owner or
his or her attorney was not present when the decision was rendered, then within
ten days of service of such order. Such appeal shall be taken by filing with
the Chief Code Enforcement Officer and with the Board of Adjustment created in
Chapter 12 of the Zoning Code (hereinafter called “the Board”) a notice of
appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the
filing of any notice of appeal, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the decision appealed was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the
Chief Code Enforcement Officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby
to do any act, his or her decision shall remain in force until modified to
allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his or her decision shall
remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision
of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any
act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the
hearing by the Board, unless the Chief Code Enforcement Officer certifies to
the Board after the notice of appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason
of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to
the appellant), a suspension of his or her requirement would cause imminent
peril to life or property. In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended
except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause upon not less
than one day’s written notice to the Chief Code Enforcement Officer by the
Board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to division (D)
below. All regulations, fees and other rules of the board shall apply to these
appeals as stated in §
151.51.
   (B)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals,
shall give due notice to all the parties and shall render its decision within a
reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The
Board may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or
order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion
ought to be made in the matter, and to that end, it shall have all the powers
of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer, but the concurring vote of four-fifths
of the members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any
decision or order of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer. The Board shall have
power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict
letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance to the
necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done.
   (C)   If the Board determines that the building is a building of historical
value, the Board may enter an order holding the matter in abeyance, provided
that the owner repairs the building on a timely basis. Such repairs shall
commence within six months of the Board’s order and shall be completed within
two years of said date. All such repairs shall be completed in such a way as to
maintain the historic character of the building and shall comply with the
United States Secretary of Interior standards for the treatment of historic
rehabilitation. If the repairs are not commenced and completed within the time
periods set out in the order, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall proceed
to enforce his or her original order.
   (D)   Every decision of the Board shall be subject to review by the Superior
Court of the county by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted
within 15 days of the decisions of the Board, but not otherwise.
   (E)   Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer or a decision rendered by the Board shall have the right, within 30
days after the issuance of the order or rendering of a decision, to petition
the Superior Court for a temporary injunction, restraining the Chief Code
Enforcement Officer pending a final disposition of the cause.

refuse to repair, alter and improve the same; or to fail to vacate, close and
remove or demolish the same, upon order of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer
duly made and served as herein provided, within the time specified in such
order, and each day that such failure, neglect or refusal to comply with such
order continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. It shall be
unlawful for the owner of any building with respect to which an order has been
issued pursuant to this subchapter to occupy or permit the occupancy of the

Code Enforcement Officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the
appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by
the Council, unless the Chief Code Enforcement Officer certifies to the
Council, after the notice of the appeal is filed with him or her, that by
reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be
furnished to the appellant), a suspension of his or her requirement would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be
suspended except by a restraining order granted by the Council for due cause
shown upon not less than one day’s written notice to the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer or by a restraining order of any court of record.

the compliance period specified in the order of compliance. If a person fails
to pay the civil penalty within ten days of receipt of the citation, the city
may seek to collect it in a civil action in the nature of a debt.

§ 151.51 PROCEDURE FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. 
      (1)   Whenever a petition is filed with the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city
charging that any building, dwelling unit or rooming unit is unfit for human
habitation, or whenever it appears to the Chief Code Enforcement Officer, upon
inspection, that any building, dwelling unit or rooming unit (hereinafter
collectively called “unsafe building”) is unfit for human habitation, he or she
shall, if his or her preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such
charges, issue and cause to be served upon the OWNER, as defined in §
151.46, of such unsafe building a complaint stating the charges and containing
a notice that a hearing will be held before the Chief Code Enforcement Officer
at a place and time therein fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days
after the serving of said complaint.
      (2)   (a)   The owner shall have the right to file an answer to the
complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the
place and time fixed in the complaint.
         (b)   If applicable, notice of such hearing shall also be given to at
least one of the persons signing a petition relating to such unsafe building.
Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant
to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or
equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer.
      (3)   At the hearing, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer may determine,
pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1205, that an unsafe building is unfit for human
habitation if he or she finds that conditions exist in the unsafe building that
render it dangerous or injurious to the health, safety or morals of the
occupants of the unsafe building, the occupants of the neighboring buildings or
other residents of the city. Such conditions may include, but are not limited
to, the following: defects therein increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or
other calamities; failure in any way to conform to the minimum standards set
forth in this subchapter; or especially dangerous to life because of bad
conditions of walls, overloaded floors, defective construction, decay, unsafe
wiring or heating system or inadequate means of egress.
   (B)   Procedure after hearing. After such notice and hearing, the Chief Code
Enforcement Officer shall state in writing his or her determination whether
such unsafe building is unfit for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is
deteriorated or dilapidated.
      (1)   If the Chief Code Enforcement Officer determines that the unsafe
building is deteriorated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings
of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be
served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to
repair, alter and improve such unsafe building to comply with the minimum
standards of fitness established by this subchapter within a specified period
of time, not to exceed 90 days. Such order may also direct and require the
owner to vacate and close such unsafe building until such repairs, alterations
and improvements have been made. Upon application by the owner within the
specified period of time, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer may grant
extensions for substandard dwellings for up to 90 days if substantial progress
has been made and the unit is occupied by its owner.
      (2)   If the Chief Code Enforcement Officer determines that the unsafe
building is dilapidated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings
of fact to support such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to vacate,
close and remove or demolish the same within a specified period of time not to
exceed 90 days, unless the owner elects to proceed under the provisions set
forth below, or unless an application for an extension of up to 90 days is
applied for by the owner within the time provided for compliance and granted by
the Chief Code Enforcement Officer for substantial progress made. However, if
the dwelling is located in a historic district of the city and the Historic
District Commission determines, after a public hearing, that the dwelling is of
particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the
district, and the dwelling has not been condemned as unsafe, the order may
require that the dwelling be vacated and closed consistent with G.S. § 160D-
949.
      (3)   Within ten days from the date of the order determining that the
building is dilapidated, the owner may notify the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer in writing of his or her intent to make such repairs or alterations to
said dwelling so as to comply with the minimum standards of fitness. Upon
receipt of an owner’s written intent to repair said dwelling, within the time
provided herein, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a supplemental
order directing the owner to commence and complete the repairs or alterations
necessary to comply with the minimum standards of fitness. The Chief Code
Enforcement Officer shall allow a reasonable period of time for the owner to
make such repair or alterations, but in no event shall the period of time
allowed for such repairs or alterations be less than 30 days nor more than 90
days unless an extension is granted by the Chief Code Enforcement Officer for
substantial progress made. Upon application by the owner within the specified
period of time, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer may grant extensions for
substandard dwellings for up to 90 days if substantial progress has been made
and the unit is occupied by its owner.
      (4)   In order to be considered for any extension of time for compliance
with an order issued pursuant to this subchapter, the owner must have made a
good-faith effort to comply with the order and all dangerous conditions must
have been repaired. The Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall have sole
authority to grant extensions. The City Council shall have no authority to hear
or act upon extension requests or appeals of any order issued by the Chief Code
Enforcement Officer.
      (5)   If the owner fails to give notice of either an intent to repair as
herein provided or notice of appeal of the decision of the Chief Code
Enforcement Officer to the Board of Adjustment within the time specified for
such appeal, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall proceed in accordance
with the provisions of divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) below.
      (6)   (a)   Whenever a determination is made pursuant to division (B)(2)
above that a dwelling must be vacated and closed, or removed or demolished,
under the provisions of this section, notice of the order shall be given by
first class mail to any organization involved in providing or restoring
dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for such
notices.
         (b)   A minimum period of 45 days from the mailing of such notice
shall be given before removal or demolition by action of the Chief Code
Enforcement Officer, to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate
with the owner to make repairs, lease or purchase the property for the purpose
of providing affordable housing. The Chief Code Enforcement Officer or the City
Clerk shall certify the mailing of the notices, and the certification shall be
conclusive in the absence of fraud. Only an organization that has filed a
written request for such notices may raise the issue of failure to mail such
notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order requiring the Chief Code
Enforcement Officer to wait 45 days before causing removal or demolition.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   If the owner of any deteriorated unsafe building shall fail to
comply with an order of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer to repair, alter or
improve the same within the time specified therein, or if the owner of a
dilapidated unsafe building shall fail to comply with an order of the Chief
Code Enforcement Officer to vacate, close and remove or demolish the same
within the time specified therein, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer may
submit to the Council at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the
City Attorney to institute in the General Court of Justice an appropriate
action to seek an order of the court directing such owner to comply with the
order of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer, as authorized by G.S. § 160D-446
(g).
      (2)   (a)   If the owner of any deteriorated unsafe building shall fail
to comply with an order of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer within the time
fixed by that order to repair, alter or improve the same within the time
specified therein; or if the owner of a dilapidated unsafe building shall fail
to comply with an order of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer to vacate, close
and remove or demolish the same within the time specified therein; or if
judicial relief has not been sought or has not been granted as provided in the
division (C)(1) above; then in any of these events and pursuant to G.S. § 160D-
1203(4) and (5), the Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall request the Council
to order him or her, by an ordinance specifically describing the subject
property to do the following, either:
            1.   To cause such unsafe building to be repaired, altered and
improved to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this
Code; or
            2.   To cause such unsafe building to be vacated, closed and
removed or demolished. The Council, in ordering one of the aforesaid
alternatives, shall order the specific action that will best effectuate the
purposes of this subchapter.
         (b)   Once the ordinance is adopted by the Council, a true copy of
such ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of the
county and the Registrar shall index the name of the property owner in the
“grantor index”, as provided by G.S. § 160D-1203(5). Once such an ordinance is
adopted by the Council, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall forthwith
cause such repair, alteration and improvement or closing, vacating and removal
or demolition to be carried out by any public authority or private concern.
Pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1203(7), the amount of the cost of repairs, alterations
and improvements, or vacating, closing and removal or demolition shall be a
lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred. Such lien
shall be filed, have the same priority and be collected as the lien for special
assessment provided in G.S. Article 10, Chapter 160A, being G.S. §§ 160A-216 et
seq. If the unsafe building is removed or demolished by the Chief Code
Enforcement Officer, he or she shall, if possible, sell in any commercially
reasonable manner the materials of the unsafe building and shall credit the
proceeds of the sale, if any, against the cost of the removal or demolition.
Any balance remaining shall be deposited by the Chief Code Enforcement Officer
with the Clerk of Superior Court for subsequent disbursement by the court to
the persons found by the court to be entitled thereto.
      (3)   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling,
the Chief Code Enforcement Officer may file a civil action in the name of the
city to remove such occupant(s). Such action shall be filed and conducted in
accordance with the provisions of G.S. § 160D-1203(8).
      (4)   None of the provisions of this Code shall be construed to impair or
limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to
cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or otherwise; or to
enforce this Code by criminal process pursuant to G.S. § 14-4; and the
enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the enforcement of
any other remedy or remedies provided herein or in any ordinance of the city,
or any statute of the state.
      (5)   After there has been a failure of the owner to comply with an order
of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer to repair, alter and improve, or to
vacate, close and remove or demolish the unsafe building, then the Chief Code
Enforcement Officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of any such
unsafe building a placard with the following words: “This building is unfit for
human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for habitation is
prohibited and unlawful.” Occupation or use of a building so posted is a
violation of this subchapter and shall constitute a misdemeanor pursuant to
G.S. § 14-4.
   (D)   Appeals from orders of Chief Code Enforcement Officer. 
      (1)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby. Any appeal from the Chief
Code Enforcement Officer shall be taken within ten days from the rendering of
the decision, or if either the owner or his or her attorney was not present
when the decision was rendered, then within ten days of service of such order.
Such appeal shall be taken by filing with the Chief Code Enforcement Officer
and with the Board of Adjustment created in Chapter 12 of the Zoning Code
(hereinafter called “the Board”) a notice of appeal which shall specify the
grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of
appeal, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed
from was made.
      (2)   When an appeal is from a decision of the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his or
her decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal
is from a decision of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer requiring the person
aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the
requirement until the hearing by the Board, unless the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal is filed with him or
her, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which
shall be furnished to the appellant), a suspension of this requirement would
cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the requirement shall
not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due
cause upon not less than one day’s written notice to the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer by the Board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to
G.S. § 160D-1208(d) and division (E) below.
      (3)   All regulations, fees and other rules of the Board shall apply to
these appeals, as stated in this division (D). The Board shall fix a reasonable
time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties,
and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in
person or by agent or attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm wholly or
partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such
decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to
that end, it shall have all the powers of the Chief Code Enforcement Officer,
but the concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Chief Code
Enforcement Officer. The Board shall have power also in passing upon appeals,
in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the
application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the
spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured,
and substantial justice done. Every decision of the Board shall be subject to
review by the Superior Court of the county by proceedings in the nature of
certiorari instituted within 15 days of the decision of the Board, but not
otherwise.
   (E)   Petition to Superior Court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the Chief Code Enforcement Officer or a decision rendered by the
Board shall have the right, within 30 days after the issuance of the order or
rendering of a decision, to petition the Superior Court for a temporary
injunction, restraining the Chief Code Enforcement Officer pending a final
disposition of the cause, as provided by G.S. § 160D-1208(d).

§ 151.53 CONFLICT WITH OTHER PROVISIONS.
   In the event any provision, standard or requirement of this subchapter is
found to be in conflict with any provision of any other ordinance or code of
the city, the provision which establishes the higher standard or more stringent
requirement for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the
residents of the city shall prevail.
(Code 2019, § 9-44)
§ 151.54 ABANDONED STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Any abandoned structure that is a health or safety hazard as a result
of the attraction of insects, rodents, conditions creating a fire hazard,
dangerous conditions constituting a threat to children, or frequent use by
vagrants as living quarters, or the absence of sanitary facilities, shall be
repaired, closed or demolished. It shall be unlawful for the owner of an
abandoned structure to allow the same to become or to remain a health or safety
hazard as defined in this section.
   (B)   The Code Enforcement Official shall have the authority to attempt to
accomplish the repair, closing or demolition of unsafe abandoned structures
through the procedure set out in §
151.51, except that if the estimated cost to repair the structure is 50% or
more of its value, the structure shall be considered dilapidated, and the Code
Enforcement Official shall order that it be demolished and removed. Upon the
failure of the owner of an unsafe abandoned structure to comply with an order
of the Code Enforcement Official to repair, close or demolish such structure,
the Code Enforcement Official shall present the matter to City Council. If the
City Council finds that the abandoned structure is unsafe pursuant to division
(A) above, it may adopt an ordinance ordering the Code Enforcement Official to
cause such abandoned structure to be repaired, closed or demolished. Each such
ordinance shall be recorded as provided in §
151.51(C)(2), and the cost of any repair, closing or demolition caused to be
made by the Code Enforcement Official shall be a lien on the premises as
provided in §
151.51.
   (C)   For the purposes of divisions (A) and (B) above, ABANDONED STRUCTURE
shall mean any structure that has not been occupied or used, by its owner or by
some person acting under the authority of its owners, for a continuous period
of 30 days or longer.
   (D)   If the City Council shall have adopted an ordinance, or the Code
Enforcement Official shall have issued an order, ordering a dwelling to be
repaired or vacated and closed, and if the owner has vacated and closed such
dwelling and kept such dwelling vacated and closed for a period of six months
pursuant to the purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in order to
render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the dwelling in
its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals
and welfare of the municipality in that the dwelling would continue to
deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to
children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities,
would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in
the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might
otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent
and affordable housing in the state, then in such circumstances, the City
Council may, after the expiration of such six-month period, enact an ordinance
and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting for the following:
      (1)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 30 days; or
      (2)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 30 days. Such ordinance shall be
recorded as provided in §
151.51(C)(2), and the cost of any repair, closing or demolition caused to be
made by the Code Enforcement Official shall be a lien on the premises as
provided in §
151.51.
(Code 2019, § 9-47) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any unsafe building to fail,
neglect or refuse to repair, alter and improve the same; or to fail to vacate,
close and remove or demolish the same, upon order of the Chief Code Enforcement
Officer duly made and served as herein provided, within the time specified in
such order, and each day that any such failure, neglect or refusal to comply
with such order continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. It
shall be unlawful for the owner of any unsafe building with respect to which an
order has been used pursuant to §
151.51 to occupy or permit the occupancy of the same after the time prescribed
in such order for its repair, alteration and improvement or its vacation,
closing and removal or demolition, and each day that such occupancy continues
after such prescribed time shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.
   (B)   Each day that a violation continues after notification that such
violation exists shall constitute a separate and distinct offense for purposes
of the penalties and remedies set forth in this section.
   (C)   This chapter may be enforced by any appropriate equitable action.
   (D)   This chapter may be enforced by any one, all or any combination of the
remedies authorized in this section.

      (1)   A buffer strip consisting of a durable masonry wall, fence or hedge
or other natural planting of comparable opacity shall be provided along the
side and/or rear lines of every park. If a durable masonry wall or fence is

shall remain the same as all initial review periods. Seven sets of plans are
required for construction and/or site plan reviews. Three sets of plans are
required for all subsequent plan reviews. A signed set of approved plans must
be retained at the project site by the applicant.
      (2)   Once site plans have been approved by the city, the applicant may
request a zoning permit to be issued. The zoning permit shall enable the
applicant to obtain a building permit, however, prior to any construction, the
applicant must meet with city staff to discuss the construction schedule. The
subdivider and/or applicant must resubmit two signed/approved copies of the
plans to the city, as well as an electronic copy.
      (3)   If it is determined that a final plat must be recorded due to the
construction and installation of public facilities, the final plat approval
process must be followed as it is outlined in this chapter.
      (4)   Once construction is complete, the applicant must request a zoning
certificate of compliance inspection by contacting the Planning and Development
Department, at which time an inspection will take place to ensure that the site
is developed in accordance with the approved site plan.
   (D)   Construction plans.
      (1)   Construction plans may be submitted at any time; provided, however,
the subdivider and/or applicant may be required to meet with the Planning and
Development Department as well as the City Engineer prior to any submission.
Construction plans shall include all necessary information required by this
chapter or any other ordinances of the city that may apply. City staff shall
have 20 business days to complete initial reviews of construction plans. Once
the initial city staff reviews are complete, the Planning and Development
Department will schedule a Technical Review Committee (TRC) meeting with the
subdivider and/or applicant and appropriate city staff to review the submittal.
Once the TRC meeting is complete, the subdivider may submit revised
construction plans, in which city staff shall have an additional 15 business
days to complete reviews. If all comments are not addressed with the re-
submittal, this process may continue until plans are approved by city staff.
      (2)   Construction plan approval shall entitle the subdivider and/or
applicant to commence with construction of the site. However, prior to the
actual start of construction, the subdivider and/or applicant must meet with
city staff to discuss the construction schedule. Seven sets of plans are
required for all construction plan reviews. Three sets of plans are required
for all subsequent plan reviews. A signed set of approved plans must be
retained at the project site by the applicant. The applicant’s engineer must
submit approved plans for the city’s use. Refer to §
153.086 for requirements.
      (3)   Construction plan approval is required for subdivisions of land,
civic, commercial, industrial, multi-family or other type of project.
   (E)   Final plats. Final plats may be submitted at any time provided,
however, in order to be eligible to be placed on the agenda of a Planning
Commission meeting, such submittal shall have been filed with the Planning and
Development Department at least 15 business days prior to that meeting. City
staff shall have a minimum of ten business days to complete the initial review
of final plats. Once staff reviews are complete, the Planning and Development
Department shall direct any and all comments to the subdivider and/or applicant
who shall in turn re-submit the final plat. The Planning and Development
Department must receive all re-submitted final plats a minimum of five business
days prior to the next regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting in order
to be placed on such agenda. The Planning Commission shall recommend approval,
approval with conditions or denial of the final plat within 35 days of its
first consideration. The recommendation shall be in written and/or drawn form
and dated. Following Planning Commission action, the Planning and Development
Department shall place the final plat on the next regular agenda of the City
Council meeting. The City Council shall have 60 days from its first
consideration to approve, approve with conditions or deny the final plat.
   (F)   Special Provisions for Conditional Districts. Proposals for rezoning
to any conditional district shall be processed and considered in the same
procedure as conventional rezoning proposals, except as otherwise set forth in
the § 4.3 of the Zoning Code.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.030 APPEALS.
   An aggrieved person may appeal any decision of the Subdivision Administrator
to the Board of Adjustment by filing a written notice with the Subdivision
Administrator within 30 days of the Subdivision Administrator action, or, his
or her failure to act, if he or she failed to act within the allotted time. The
Board of Adjustment, acting on appeal, shall have the same authority as the
approval authority from which the appeal is made in regard to the subject level
of subdivision review and approval.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.031 EFFECTS OF APPROVALS; PREREQUISITES.
   (A)   Sketch plan. Sketch plan approval shall entitle the subdivider and/or
applicant to prepare for submittal of the construction plan, site plan or to
move forward with any necessary rezoning request. Sketch plans may be submitted
and discussed during the initial meeting with Planning and Development staff.
   (B)   Site plan. Site plan approval shall constitute approval of the
development of civic, commercial and industrial projects which do not
necessarily require a subdivision of land. Furthermore, when development does
not require or involve a subdivision of land, the site plan submittal shall be
accompanied with a construction plan. If a specific project involves a
conditional district rezoning outlined in the City Zoning Ordinance, then said
site plan must be submitted during the rezoning process and accompany the
construction plan once appropriate zoning is assigned. Once the subdivider and/
or applicant has received site plan approval, the subdivider and/or applicant
may request a zoning permit to be issued by the Planning and Development
Department. If changes occur regarding the development of the project once the
site plan has been approved but prior to construction plan approval, the
subdivider and/or applicant must re-submit the site plan to the Planning and
Development Department for approval.
   (C)   Construction plan. Construction plan approval shall constitute
tentative approval of the final plat if the final plat is in substantive
agreement with the construction plan and shall entitle the subdivider and/or
applicant to proceed with street, storm drainage and utility installation, if
applicable, and/or to proceed to prepare the final plat, if applicable.
Approval of construction plans shall entitle the subdivider and/or applicant to
proceed with construction of the improvements for the subdivision and/or
project site. No construction, including grading, shall proceed without such
approval. The subdivider and/or applicant shall be responsible for contacting
the city’s Site Inspector to schedule the city’s Material Testing and
Inspection Services Firm for arranging testing and inspections of all public
infrastructure installations. The subdivider and/or applicant shall be
responsible for the payment of the services rendered by the Material Testing
and Inspection Services Firm on behalf of the city. Building permits may be
authorized to be issued after construction plan approval, payment of fees and
issuance of zoning permit.
   (D)   Plan revisions.
      (1)   Construction drawings that are revised after being approved and
signed by the city shall be re-submitted for approval prior to construction.
The city will not inspect or approve construction that is completed without
signed, approved plans.
      (2)   When plan revisions are necessary, it is recommended to submit only
the affected plan sheets and not the entire plan set unless the revisions
affect numerous plan sheets. “Minor” field revisions, as determined by the
city, will not require re-submittal of plans for approval. These minor
revisions shall be so noted on the final as-built plans. Revisions shall be
noted on all plan submittals.
      (3)   If the final plat of all or part of the area shown on a
construction plan is not recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds within
18 months of approval of the construction plan, or if there is a lapse of more
than 18 months between the recording of sections, the Planning and Development
Department may require the re-submittal of the unrecorded portion of the sketch
plan or construction plan as it may determine.
   (E)   Final plat.
      (1)   Final plat approval shall entitle the subdivider to record the
final plat. A final plat must be recorded in the office of the Register of
Deeds within 30 days of its approval by the Planning and Development
Department. No final plat shall be regarded as finally approved until such plat
shall be recorded.
      (2)   No final plat shall be approved for recording until all required
subdivision improvements have been installed and approved or until the
subdivider supplies an appropriate guarantee of installation as provided for in
§§
153.100 to 153.106.
      (3)   In addition, no final plat shall be approved for recording unless
such plat is in substantial agreement, as determined by the Planning and
Development Department, with the approved construction plan. Final plats not in
substantial agreement shall be resubmitted with construction plans for review
and approval.
      (4)   After the final plat is recorded, lots as shown on the plat may be
sold or otherwise conveyed by reference to the plat. Zoning permits may be
issued by the city, certificates of occupancy may be authorized to be issued,
provided all improvements have been installed, and inspected and approved by
the Planning and Development Department. The subdivider and/or applicant shall
provide the Planning and Development Department with a certified copy of the
recorded final plat.
      (5)   (a)   Approval and recording of the final plat shall constitute
dedication by the subdivider of the right-of-way of each public street and
utility and drainage public easement shown on such plat. Such dedication,
however, does not constitute acceptance by the city of such right-of-way, nor
does it constitute acceptance for maintenance or for other purposes of the
improvements within such rights-of-way and easements such as pavements,
sidewalk, drainage facilities and utility lines.
         (b)   Such right-of-way and improvements may be accepted by the City
Council by resolution upon completion by the subdivider and/or applicant and
inspection by the appropriate city staff. In addition, land designated on an
approved and recorded final plat as public open space and similar public
purposes shall be considered to be offered for dedication until the city has by
resolution accepted such dedication and such land is deeded to the city.
         (c)   Until such dedication has been accepted, land so offered may be
used for open space purposes by its owner, or his or her designees, and the
city shall be held harmless of any liability involving such land. Land so
offered for dedication shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with the
proposed public use without the express approval of the City Council.
   (F)   As-built plans.
      (1)   Digital files of the final, as-built construction drawings shall be
submitted with all as-built plans. Digital file format shall be compatible with
the latest AutoCAD version and be capable of input into latest ESRI desktop
software. Digital files shall contain all water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage
and street design information as shown on the as-built plans. At least one
digital file shall contain all improvements shown in an overall drawing
(similar to AutoCAD model space) to allow input into the city’s utility mapping
system. These files should be given to the Utilities Department or the GIS
Section. See §
153.086 for requirements.
      (2)   The city may choose to hold construction permits, delay water meter
installation, withhold or take other actions as deemed appropriate if as-built
plans and the corresponding digital files have not been submitted after
construction permits have been released for 80% of the developable lots in a
subdivision phase. For commercial, industrial, multi-family or other type
projects, certificate of occupancy permits may be held until as-builts,
corresponding digital files and all appropriate testing reports are submitted.

SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS; RESERVATION AND DEDICATIONS; REQUIRED
IMPROVEMENTS
§ 153.045 GENERAL.
   (A)   All proposed subdivisions subject to the regulation of this chapter
shall comply with this subchapter and shall be so planned as to facilitate the
most advantageous development of the entire community and shall bear a
reasonable relationship to the Land Development Guidelines and Thoroughfare
Plan of the city or be consistent with the current Gaston-Cleveland-Lincoln MPO
Standards.
   (B)   (1)   The general design of the subdivision shall take advantage of
and be adjusted to the contour of the land so as to produce usable building
sites and streets of reasonable gradients. Subdivision plans shall be drawn in
consideration of the suitability of the land and its capability to support and
maintain the proposed development.
      (2)   Due consideration shall be given to such factors as water supply,
watershed requirements, topography, rock outcrops, flood damage prevention,
erosion control, wetland preservation, sewage collection systems, storm water
management, solar energy, tree preservation, noise and pollution control,
habitat for endangered species, areas of historical, archaeological or
architectural significance, and land use relationships in addition to other
factors including those prescribed by this chapter.
   (C)   (1)   The City Council may require the subdivider and/or applicant to
prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) pursuant to G.S. § 113A-8 as
part of the preliminary plan for any subdivision of two acres or more where, in
the City Council’s opinion, one or more of the suitability factors outlined in
division (B) above, or any similar environmental factor, is a significant issue
regarding the particular subdivision.
      (2)   The City Council may waive the EIS where an EIS or equivalent
document is required by a state or federal agency for the same or essentially
the same factor(s).
   (D)   (1)   The subdivider and/or applicant shall install the improvements
specified herein, and such improvements shall be constructed at no cost to the
city, except as set forth herein and except as may be otherwise provided for in
the City Utilities and Public Works Extension Policies.
      (2)   No improvements shall be installed until construction plans have
been approved by the city and such other agency as may be appropriate or as
required by law. As provided for in §
153.031(E), a final plat may be recorded prior to installation of any or all
required improvements, provided that a financial guarantee in a form acceptable
to the city is given by the subdivider and/or applicant as provided for in §§
153.100 to 153.106.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.046 NAMES.
   (A)   In no case shall the name of a proposed subdivision duplicate or be
phonetically similar to an existing subdivision name within the jurisdiction
unless the proposed subdivision lies adjacent to or is in close proximity to
the existing subdivision.
   (B)   Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with others already
existing or proposed and named, shall bear the names of existing or proposed
streets. In no case shall the names of proposed streets duplicate or be
phonetically similar to other existing street names in the jurisdiction,
irrespective of the addition of a prefix, suffix or word such as street,
avenue, place, drive or court.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.047 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth, except where single-tier lots are required to separate
residential development from through vehicular traffic or another type of use
or when abutting a water area.
   (B)   Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet nor more than 900 feet in
length.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.048 LOTS.
   (A)   The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the proposed subdivision, for the type of development contemplated,
and in consideration of the method of providing water and sewer facilities to
the lots.
   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter that lot size, shape and orientation
shall be controlled by the provisions of the city’s Zoning Ordinance and the
types of development permitted by that ordinance. The final lot sizes may be
determined on a lot by lot basis, provided each meets the minimum requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance for the district in which it is located. Every lot
shall have sufficient area, dimensions and shape to permit a principal building
to be constructed thereon in conformance with the applicable provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance. Such buildable area shall lie at or be elevated to at least
two feet above the 100-year flood elevation as provided for in Chapter 16 of
the Zoning Code. Lots shall be designed so as to provide positive drainage away
from building sites, and individual lots shall be coordinated with the general
storm drainage plan for the subdivision. Lot boundaries shall be made to
coincide with natural and pre-existing human-made drainage ways to the extent
practicable to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon only by
altering such drainage ways. Lot arrangements shall be made with due
consideration given to not disturbing wetlands, rock outcrops and other such
natural features. Sidelines of lots shall be at or near right angles or radial
to street lines. All lots fronting a cul-de-sac shall have radial lot lines
from ROW to the rear property line without a deflection until beyond the
building footprint. All lots must have public street access and frontage
meeting the requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, except as provided
for in §
153.005(F). Parcels created through the subdivision process, which are not
intended for building purposes, shall be so designated and perpetually bound as
“not buildable” unless subsequently released through the subdivision process.
   (C)   Drainage swales or closed drainage systems in the front or rear of
lots connecting multiple lots shall be avoided. The closed storm drain system
shall be encased in a 20-foot drainage easement to be owned and maintained by
the HOA. The drainage easement shall be maintained by the property owner.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.049 STREETS AND STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   The proposed street system shall extend existing and projected streets at
not less than the required minimum width and shall be in conformance with the
following criteria.
   (A)   Conformance with Land Development Guidelines.
      (1)   The location and design of streets shall be in conformance with the
Land Development Guidelines. Where the conditions warrant, right-of-way width
and pavement width in excess of the minimum street standards may be allowed or
required. In any case where any part of a subdivision lies within the corridor
of a thoroughfare shown on a Gaston-Cleveland-Lincoln Metropolitan Planning
Organization (GCLMPO) or NCDOT Map adopted pursuant to G.S. Chapter 136,
Article 2E, no subdivision approval shall be granted with respect to the
property in the roadway corridor. Provided, however, no subdivision plat
approval shall be delayed by the provision of the Gaston-Cleveland-Lincoln MPO
or NCDOT Map procedure for more than three years from the date of its original
submittal.
      (2)   Development that takes place along designated thoroughfares
identified in local or regional planning documents should be well planned. At
some point in the future, widening or construction of these roads will take
place. In order to minimize any negative impacts to adjoining property owners
occurring as a result of such widening projects, and to require that all new
structures lying on properties along these roads be adequately set back from
existing and/or projected road rights-of-way. In this manner, all structures
built will be adequately set back from the road when it is widened. The
thoroughfare roads are shown on the adopted thoroughfare map, not the official
zoning map. This thoroughfare is addressed when a development is submitted for
review.
   (B)   Street classification.
      (1)   The final determination of the classification of streets in a
proposed subdivision shall be made by the Planning and Development Department.
      (2)   Thoroughfare streets provide for movement of high volumes of
traffic throughout the city. In general, thoroughfare streets consist of
numbered state roads and other major streets as described in the NCDOT, County
or City Thoroughfare Plan. Design criteria for thoroughfare streets shall be on
a case-by-case basis. Direct driveway access onto thoroughfares is prohibited.
      (3)   Commercial streets provide direct access to commercial property and
may be served by either thoroughfare or collector streets. Design shall be on a
case-by-case basis.
      (4)   Collector streets connect the residential and commercial streets to
thoroughfare streets, and may supplement the thoroughfare system by providing a
limited amount of through traffic. Collector streets are required when directly
serving more than 150 residential units, when connecting adjoining residential
areas, or as determined necessary by the city.
      (5)   Residential streets provide a dual service of lot access and
traffic movement between local residential streets and collector streets.
      (6)   Private streets may be used within commercial and multi-family
developments. Design requirements will vary depending on utility and vehicular
traffic needs and should be sufficient for service and emergency vehicles.
Private streets within subdivided single-family developments are generally
prohibited.
   (C)   Conformance with adjoining street system. The planned street layout of
a proposed subdivision shall be compatible with existing or proposed streets
and their classifications on adjoining or nearby tracts.
   (D)   Access to adjoining property. When it is desirable to provide for
street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended to the
boundary of such property. For stub out streets, roads shall be built to the
property line. Temporary hammerhead turnarounds are required for stub out
streets over 200 feet long.
   (E)   Reserve strips, half streets and private streets. Reserve strips and
non-access easements adjoining street right-of-way for the purpose of
preventing access to or from adjacent property (except those required to
prevent access to thoroughfares), and half-streets shall not be permitted under
any condition. Private streets shall be permitted only in specific developments
as permitted by the Zoning Ordinance. Easements for sole access to lots are
permitted only in accordance with §
153.005(F).
   (F)   Intersections. Streets shall be designed so as to intersect at 90
degrees unless approved by the city, and no street shall intersect any other
street at an angle of less than 60 degrees. Streets crossing natural areas or
streams shall cross at or near to right angles as possible within limits of
topographic conditions. Offset intersections are to be avoided. A minimum
intersection offset of 125 feet shall be maintained.
   (G)   Cul-de-sacs.
      (1)   Cul-de-sacs should not be used to avoid connection with an existing
street, to avoid the extension of a thoroughfare or collector street, or to
avoid connection to adjoining property.
      (2)   Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 900 feet in length.
Measurements shall be from the point where the centerline of the dead end
street intersects with the centerline of a through street to the center of the
turnaround or the cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sacs shall be provided with a turnaround
meeting city standards.
      (3)   Where one cul-de-sac extends from another cul-de-sac, the end of
each cul-de-sac shall be no more than 500 feet from a through street as
measured by the centerline of the streets.
   (H)   Marginal access streets. Where a tract of land to be subdivided
adjoins a thoroughfare, the subdivider and/or applicant may be required to
provide a marginal access street parallel to the thoroughfare or provide for
through lots on a local street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the
thoroughfare. Where through lots are established, such lots may be prevented
from having direct access to the thoroughfare by driveways through the use of
reverse strips or non-access easements.
   (I)   Water, sewer, street lights and storm drainage within streets. Water,
sewer, street lights, sidewalks, storm drainage and other such facilities to be
placed within the street right-of-way shall be placed in accordance with latest
adopted Land Development Guidelines. All utilities shall be placed underground.
   (J)   Pavement, curb and gutter and pavement and side ditch. Pavement, curb
and gutter to be placed in public streets shall be placed in accordance with
latest adopted Land Development Guidelines. All utilities shall be placed
underground.
   (K)   Street design criteria. All street designs and construction within
public street right-of-way shall be in accordance with latest adopted Land
Development Guidelines. All private street designs and construction shall be in
accordance with the latest adopted Land Development Guidelines. All utilities
shall be placed underground.
   (L)   Connection to state streets.
      (1)   An approved NCDOT permit is required to connect to any existing
state system street.
      (2)   G.S. § 136-102.6, “Compliance of Subdivision Streets with Minimum
Standards of the Board of Transportation Required of Developers”, requires that
new public streets outside the city limits and changes to existing streets
inside the city limits that are the responsibility of NCDOT be in accordance
with the Minimum Right-of-Way and Construction Standards established by the
Board of Transportation for acceptance on the state highway system. It is the
intent of these standards and requirements, as set forth, to complement and not
to conflict with the requirements of NCDOT as stated in G.S. § 136-102.6. In
all cases, the most restrictive limitation or requirement, or the requirement
causing the highest standard of improvement shall govern.
      (3)   All proposed streets shall be constructed in accordance with the
Land Development Guidelines. All street improvements shall be designed and
installed in accordance with city standards and the approved construction plan.
The subdivider’s engineer shall furnish the city with a certified statement
that all street improvements installed in the subdivision meet the minimum
standards of this chapter.
      (4)   In addition, street improvements, in accordance with the Street
Design Guidelines, shall be installed in the following situations:
         (a)   Any existing street segment that has not been accepted for
maintenance by either the city or State Department of Transportation, and that
is to serve as the required frontage for one or more lots created pursuant to
this chapter, shall be improved, dedicated and accepted for public use to the
public, as provided for above, in such a way that the street segment meets the
standards of this chapter for the particular classification of street,
including right-of-way width. Such street segment shall be directly connected
to the existing public street system by way of at least one public street
accepted for maintenance by either the city or State Department of
Transportation. No subdivision shall be permitted on any street that is an
“island” not connected directly to the public street system.
         (b)   Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets maintained by either
the city or the NCDOT shall dedicate additional street rights-of-way necessary
to meet the minimum width requirements for the type of classification of the
adjoining street. When any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the
existing street, the entire minimum right-of-way shall be provided. When the
subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the
minimum right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing street,
shall be provided. The improvement requirements of this subchapter shall not
apply to the subdivision of lots fronting on established streets that have
already been accepted for maintenance by the city or NCDOT.
         (c)   The Planning and Development Department may require pavement and
widening or pavement and widening and curb and gutter for turning lanes along
any existing or proposed street that forms a significant entrance to a proposed
subdivision where, in the opinion of the Planning and Development Department,
such improvements are necessary in order to provide for safe vehicular movement
into and out of the proposed subdivision.
         (d)   In cases where a street is stubbed into adjoining property for
future extension and such street serves as the frontage for one or more lots
which are not corner lots, the Planning and Development Department may require
the pavement of a temporary turnaround in a form similar to a cul-de-sac on
such a street where, in their opinion, such turnaround is necessary for the
public convenience, safety and service. Temporary easements for such purposes
may be required.
   (M)   City Street and Thoroughfare Plans. Where a proposed development plan
includes any part of a city street or thoroughfare which has been designated as
such on the Official Thoroughfare Plan adopted by the city, State Department of
Transportation, or Gaston-Cleveland-Lincoln Metropolitan Planning Organization
(GCLMPO), or as part of any transportation plan adopted by the city, a right-
of-way shall be platted in the location shown on the plan at the width
specified in this chapter, or as identified in a Transportation Impact Analysis
(TIA). As a condition of approval, the developer shall be required to construct
the proposed street or thoroughfare within the borders of his or her
development in accordance with the adopted standards or plans for such
construction. In instances where such a street is scheduled for construction by
the city or the State Department of Transportation, the developer may make a
payment in lieu of construction equal to his or her pro-rata share of the costs
of construction. Major thoroughfares and interstate highway construction are
exempted from this requirement.

construction, by the appropriate agency of the state. The subdivider’s engineer
shall be responsible for all designs and permitting associated with sewer
system extensions.
   (B)   All subdivisions shall be required to extend the city public sewer
system throughout the subdivision to each lot located therein. All required
sewer line extensions shall include the appropriate manholes, lift stations,
pumps, clean outs, taps and service to the property line of each lot as
required by city standards.

§ 153.052 OVERSIZED WATER AND SEWER FACILITIES.
   The city may, in order to serve future development, require the subdivider
to install certain oversized water and sewer improvements and/or to increase
such improvements to a size and/or extent beyond that necessary for the needs
created by the subdivision. In such cases, the city shall enter into an
agreement to provide for the oversizing and/or extension in conjunction with
the subdivision construction schedule.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.053 STORM DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   A comprehensive storm drainage system shall be planned and implemented
for each subdivision in accordance with the Land Development Guidelines. The
storm water management plan, storm drainage system plan and the best management
practices design plan shall be submitted as part of the construction plan
requirements, including all calculations. Where public and/or private easements
are required, they shall be noted on the final plat and construction plans.
   (B)   Storm drainage plans shall be considered on an individual basis
depending upon the situation within a given subdivision. The requirements of
the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance shall apply to storm drainage design

§ 153.055 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   To provide for electric, telephone and gas service, community antenna
television distribution systems, water and sewer lines, and other such
facilities within the subdivision, appropriate utility easements not to exceed
30 feet shall be provided on the final plat. The locations of such easements
shall be determined by the Subdivision Administrator and based upon the
approved construction plans. All utilities shall be placed underground. In
addition, storm drainage easements may be required in order to carry out the
storm drainage improvements as required in the Land Development Guidelines.
   (B)   Maintenance easements may be required depending upon the size of the
drainage way and the maintenance responsibility as determined by the city.
   (C)   In any case where maintenance is to be the responsibility of the
property owner, the city may require a right to enter for maintenance purposes
where the City Council determines that the public health, safety or general
welfare constitutes a public necessity for such maintenance.
   (D)   Storm drainage easements must encircle the water quality facility/SCM
and/or SWM facility. Easement must be shown ten feet from the top of the berm
of the facility or ten feet from the toe of the slope for the facility’s
embankment, whichever is greater. A storm drainage easement must be shown for
any pipe system or channel leading to or draining from the facility.
   (E)   A minimum 15-foot wide SCM maintenance access easement must be shown
from the street right-of-way to the SCM facility.
   (F)   All SCM and/or SWM devices shall be maintained by the property owner
or homeowner’s association. The devices shall be inspected and maintained by
the developer/owner/HOA in accordance with the approved design plans. Costs for
maintenance and repairs shall be borne by the property owner or homeowner’s
association.
   (G)   All storm drainage easements beyond the public road right-of-way shall
be shown on the construction plans and labeled, “Private Storm Drainage
Easement”. Easement width shall be 20 feet minimum, unless otherwise approved
by the city. Larger pipes may require wider easements.
   (H)   Developments that have an existing or proposed easement that aligns
with a planned greenway and is to be constructed as part of the project shall
provide easement language allowing for a public greenway access in addition to
the maintenance of public utilities. Even if the greenway is not required to be
built as part of the approval process, the easement language shall reflect that
a public greenway would be permitted within the sewer easement.

§ 153.056 NEIGHBORHOOD RECREATION SITES.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The subdivider and/or applicant of any subdivision for residential
purposes shall dedicate to the city, or otherwise provide for, land for park,
recreation and/or open space designed to serve the residents of the
subdivision.
      (2)   In any case where a subdivision is to be developed in phases, the
full open space/recreation dedication may be required to be made in the first
phase. Annexation proposals should reflect the open space requirements
identified in the strategic vision plan.
   (B)   Open space dedication.
      (1)   All residential developments with more than eight total units shall
be required to dedicate open space. To encourage development of residential
units in the Downtown District, all such residential development shall be
exempt from these provisions. The amount of useable open space required for
dedication shall be determined using the open space dedication matrix. These
figures are based upon similar dedication requirements throughout the state
with three minor adaptations.
         (a)   First, the matrix was designed to base open space requirements
on the number of bedrooms in a given development, rather than the usual
dedication based upon the dwelling unit. This more accurately reflects the
needs of the residents, as the number of bedrooms within a given development is
a better representation of the actual number of residents who would use open
space.
         (b)   Second, the matrix is established to encourage the preservation
of land. By allowing for an increase in densities, the matrix provides for an
increasing requirement in open space dedication. For example, a 50-acre
subdivision of 100 lots developed at a density of two units per acre would
generally require 3.44 acres or 7% of dedicated open space. In contrast, this
same tract of land subdivided into 400 lots (or condos) at a density of eight
units per acre would require 15.15 acres or 30% of dedicated open space. These
figures are based upon an average of three bedrooms per unit.
         (c)   Third and final, this matrix has been developed with regard to
the availability of accessible open space in close proximity to the proposed
development. Developments within a half-mile (ten-minute) walk (along sidewalks
or other pedestrian access) to existing publicly dedicated open space (parks,
greenbelts and the like) are granted a reduction in required open space
dedication of 25%. Similarly, developments that are adjacent to existing
publicly dedicated open space are granted a 50% reduction in required
dedication.
      (2)   Because the open space dedication requirements are based upon
preliminary estimations of bedroom units in a given development, changing
market conditions and final build-out of a project may yield a different
bedroom count. In order to accommodate for variations, this code will permit
variations to the estimated number of bedrooms, up to 10%. Variations in excess
of 10% may allow a payment in lieu of additional dedication. Variations in
excess of 25% will require the dedication of additional open space.
      (3)   (a)   For the purposes of good faith estimation, all single-family
developments will dedicate open space at a rate of three and one-half bedrooms
per unit unless otherwise stipulated. Attached homes and apartments will
dedicate open space at a rate of two to four bedrooms, in accordance with
building specifications.

                    Note to Table: All measurements are in square feet.
 
         (b)   How to use the matrix in division (B)(3)(a) above.
            1.   Determine average density for proposed development (gross
dwelling units per acre).
            2.   Determine average number of bedrooms per dwelling unity (good
faith estimate).
            3.   Multiply number of bedrooms by the number of units to get to
the estimated number bedrooms.
            4.   Multiply the estimated number of bedrooms by figures shown in
the matrix which relate to the density of the site and its proximity to
existing open space.
         (c)   An example of how to use the matrix in division (B)(3)(a) above
is as follows.
            1.   A developer wants to subdivide a 50-acre tract of land into
120 lots. The average number of bedrooms per lot is three and one-half (some
three bedrooms, some four bedrooms). The tract is not within one-half mile
walking distance to any publicly dedicated open space. How much open space is
required for dedication?
            2.   The density (in dwelling units per acre) is 2.4. There are an
estimated 420 bedrooms. Using the multiplier of 520, as shown in the matrix,
the required amount of useable open space to be required is 218,400 square feet
or 5.01 acres or 10% of the total area.
   (C)   Payment in lieu of open space dedication.
      (1)   If open space within a development is physically impractical due to
unusual topographic conditions then the City Council may, at its discretion,
accept either an equitable amount of land in another location or a fee paid to
the city in lieu of dedication. The following formula shall be used to
determine the fee:
         (a)   (Assessed Value of On-Site Property) X ((Yearly Adjusted
Inflation Rate) (Number of Years Since Last Revaluation)+1) = Payment in Lieu
of Open Space Dedication Fee
            1.   ASSESSED VALUE OF ON-SITE PROPERTY equals the value of the
required amount of land to be dedicated as a percentage of the assessed
valuation of the site prior to subdivision (i.e., if the total acreage is 100
and the total assessed value equals $500,000 and the required open space
dedication is 15 acres, then the Assessed Value of the Open Space Dedication
would be 15% of $500,000, or $75,000).
            2.   YEARLY ADJUSTED INFLATION RATE is based upon prevailing
inflation rates, as reported annually in the Wall Street Journal or other
reliable financial reporting medium (i.e., 3%).
            3.   NUMBER OF YEARS SINCE LAST REVALUATION is the total number of
years since the last revaluation was conducted by the taxing authority.
         (b)   1.   An example of the formula described in division (C)(1)(a)
above is as follows:
            2.   Where the Assessed Valuation is $75,000; the Inflation Rate is
3%; the Number of Years Since Last Revaluation is six; and the Cost of Off-Site
Open Space is $88,500 then the formula reads as: ($75,000)X(
(0.03X6)+1)=$88,500.
      (2)   Payments in lieu of dedication shall be approved as part of the
schematic. Any disagreement in the amount of required payment shall be resolved
by conducting a professional appraisal of the fair market value of the
property. The professional appraiser shall be mutually agreed upon by the city
or appointed by the city should an agreement not be reached. All payments made
in lieu of dedication shall be made at the time of construction document
approval. Failure to submit the required fee along with such applications will
delay approval of such submissions until payment is rendered. All funds
received for payment in lieu of dedication shall be used for the acquisition,
development or redevelopment of public open space within the same general area
of the new development within the city.
   (D)   Open space general provisions.
      (1)   OPEN SPACE is defined as all areas not covered by building or
parking lots, dry detention structures, streets, required setbacks or golf
courses.
      (2)   Open space shall be planned and improved, accessible and usable by
persons living nearby. IMPROVED shall mean cleared of underbrush and debris and
may contain one or more of the following improvements: landscaping, walls,
fences, walks, statues, utilities, irrigation, fountains, ball fields and/or
playground equipment.
      (3)   Significant stands of trees, stream bed areas and other valuable
topographic features shall be preserved within the required open space areas
where practical. Areas noted on any adopted Master Plan as open space shall be
preserved and dedicated where practical and feasible and may be left unimproved
in accordance with the Plan.
      (4)   Playground equipment, statues and fountains should be located
toward the interior of squares and parks, away from the public right-of-way, to
provide for adequate safety of the user.
      (5)   Walls and fences shall be made of brick, stone, wrought iron or
wood and shall not exceed four feet in height. (Exception: Fences used in
conjunction with ball fields.) Watershed District development shall allocate
required open space in the form of one or more of the types listed in this
chapter.
      (6)   Waterfront development shall provide 50% of the required open space
as waterfront parks along its shoreline. This requirement may be reduced to a
minimum of 25% if off-water open space is dedicated with an area equal to one
and one-half times the required waterfront dedication. The design shall be such
as to form a central public space or esplanade for the neighborhood to provide
waterfront access and views to residents. A minimum of 30% of the perimeter of
the park shall be bordered by the water.
      (7)   Open space should provide focal points for the neighborhood and
city. A central square or green, for example, may comprise a majority of the
area required for dedication.
      (8)   Dedicated open space shall be separately deeded to either a
homeowner’s association, a non-profit land trust or conservancy, the county or
to the city (upon approval by the City Council), or it may be held in private
ownership with conservation easements recorded in the County Register of Deeds
in a form approved by the city.
   (E)   Emergency response requirements for trail system.
      (1)   The purpose of the trail system requirements is to assure that when
off road amenities are provided by a development, that public health, safety
and welfare are appropriately assured during the review and approval by the
city.
      (2)   If a developer proposes or is required to provide any trail system
or network as part of the development, then the following items will be
required at a minimum and will be included as part of the Greenway Response Map
for the city.
         (a)   Private greenways or trails shall be eight feet wide with six
inches of compacted ABC “crush and run” stone or paved with concrete or
asphalt. Must meet standards in City Public Works Standard Detail R-141. Dirt
or natural surface trails may be approved by staff as part of a quid pro quo
negotiation with the developer.
         (b)   If foot bridges are proposed, it is required that a vehicle
access point is provided if the distance between them exceeds two miles.
Bridges shall have an eight-foot-wide clearance between the side rails to allow
for emergency UTV’s to cross the bridge. There shall be a smooth transition
from trail to bridge to allow emergency UTV’s to traverse from trail to bridge
without being impeded by sudden changes in grade. Must meet standards in City
Public Works Standard Detail R-142.
         (c)   City staff are responsible for regulating the naming, signage
and trail markers that are associated and installed with newly developed
trails. Markers and naming conventions will be assigned based on a project’s
location on the Greenway Response Map. Trail markers will display a city
assigned three letter abbreviation unique to the development, followed by the
mile marker based on Item 3 above. Contact Planning Department staff for
information regarding trail marker abbreviation assignment. Trail markers shall
be installed on both sides of a four-inch by four inch post with the marker
easily visible when walking along the trail from either direction. The post
shall be painted bright “safety” yellow. Trail marker posts should be of
uniform height with the bottom of trail markers posted at four feet above
grade. Trail markers shall be made of reflective materials, circular, and have
a minimum diameter of three and a half inches. Markers shall be easily
readable, display the three-letter abbreviation for the trails system, have the
background color be the same as the trail color shown on the kiosk map and
display the mileage distance from the trail origin. Trail markers shall be
located every 0.2 miles or less from the trail origin and no greater than 0.2
miles from the previous trail marker or kiosk with mile marker.
         (d)   A kiosk with a trail map must be located at the origin of each
trail and at any intersection of the trail and a road. Kiosks shall be water
tight and kiosks maps shall be located no greater than four feet from grade.
All trail kiosks shall have a mileage marker. If there are different color
trail systems in the development the kiosk should have maps labeled by the
color of the trail system it represents and the kiosk mile marker. For example:
“Blue Trail – Mile 0.0”. Trail maps must show the location where the map is
posted indicated by a “you are here” indicator, the origin of each trail, and
the location of trail marker posts along the trail with their mileage.
         (e)   The developer will provide global positioning system (GPS)
coordinates of the trail to be placed on the Greenway Response Map, which is
maintained by the GIS Division. All kiosks, bridges and trail markers shall be
located along with the entirety of the trail.
         (f)   All trail markers and kiosks will be constructed and placed in a
permanent nature in order to assure high visibility and awareness for all users
of the trails.
         (g)   The city may require other information be provided that is
specific to the project.
         (h)   All trails, kiosks and trail marking systems shall be maintained
by the neighborhood association including trash removal, debris removal (limbs
and leaves), clearing downed trees, maintaining drainage and repairing eroded
areas.
         (i)   All drainage pipes underneath the trail shall be constructed
with rigid concrete or HDPE pipe and have a minimum inside diameter of 12
inches.
         (j)   The maximum allowed slope for trails is 12 degrees or 3:25
(rise: run). Trails should utilize switchbacks with rounding turns to allow
utility terrain vehicles to navigate the trail without making multi point
turns. At the end of each trail there should be a method for easily turning
around a UTV.
         (I)   Any associated signage shall be maintained by the developer or
home owner’s association.

engineer/consultant and must show decorative light poles of a type supplied,
installed and maintained by Duke Energy. The developer must make financial
arrangements with Duke Energy prior to final plat approval, requiring Duke
Energy to install, maintain and replace such decorative poles. All lighting
construction costs, such as adverse conditions, abnormal construction costs and
materials also known as “decorative adder fees” will need to be paid before the
city will assume the lighting contract. The city will only pay for public
lighting energy costs. Planning staff can work to alter the placement of street
lights to ensure that street lights work with other site plan elements, such as
street trees, and utility lines. All installations shall require underground
wiring and shall be installed by Duke Energy to, according to the Duke Energy
Lighting Plan (adopted on December 13, 1999). The developer shall submit the
lighting plan with the construction plan package and shall be approved as a
part of the construction plans. The City Engineer and Site Inspector will
verify that the lighting plans have been inspected and accepted. Following City
Council approval for the bond release, the developer will be responsible for
notifying the HOA of the development stating that the city will be taking over
the provided Duke Energy accounts. At this time, the developer will also submit
the Duke Energy account numbers for street lighting when they request the bond
release. Once the new poles have been installed, any relocations or
modifications to the installation will be at the expense of the HOA or
developer, not at the expense of the city.

standing water is possible.
   (G)   Stabilizing stone, geotextiles or other approved stabilization options
shall be placed as required by the city when conditions warrant. Under drains
shall be constructed as required by the city to stabilize subgrade.
   (H)   (1)   Compaction tests by an independent testing lab shall be made at
the owner’s expense and the report submitted to the city. Random stone base
tests shall be taken every 150 feet and in cul-de-sacs, or as directed by city
inspectors.
      (2)   The stone base shall be compacted to 100% of the maximum density
obtainable with the Modified Proctor Test. When completed, the base course
shall be smooth, hard, dense, unyielding and well bonded.
   (I)   The stone base proofroll shall be scheduled and performed with city
inspectors. At the time of paving, edges and manholes/structures shall already
be trimmed to the proper depth and all debris and loose stone removed.
   (J)   Proofrolling of subgrade and stone base shall be performed in the
presence of the City Inspector using an over-loaded (on-site) triaxle dump with
22 to 25 tons of stone, third axle lifted. If rain occurs before placing stone
on subgrade that has been proofrolled, or if rain occurs prior to placing
asphalt on stone base that has been proofrolled, the subgrade and stone base
must be proofrolled again as directed by the city.
   (K)   The contractor or owner shall submit a report of the random soil
compaction tests performed every 150 feet and in cul-de-sacs, or as directed by
the City Inspector. Once soil testing reports are submitted and the
infrastructure suitable for pavement, the contractor or owner shall schedule a
subgrade proofroll with the City Inspector.
   (L)   Prime coat is to be applied at a rate of 0.25 gallons per square yard
as directed by the City Inspector.
   (M)   Existing curb and gutter and pavement shall be replaced or repaired as
required to tie onto sound material.
   (N)   Any required storm drainage construction or reconstruction associated
with this plan shall be performed at the owner’s expense.
   (O)   The contractor is responsible for locating all existing utilities
prior to start of construction. All construction must conform to the
Underground Utility Safety and Damage Prevention Act, being G.S. §§ 87-115 et
seq.
   (P)   Wheelchair ramps with truncated domes (black paver type) are required
where sidewalks intersect curb and gutter.
   (Q)   Water and sewer building connections shall be installed to the right-
of-way line, spaced at 30 inches center to center, and shall not be placed in
driveways or sidewalks. Water and sewer connections shall be stamped into the
curb at the exact location of the crossing (“W” for water, “S” for sewer). All
valves shall be indicated by a “V” stamped in the curb at a point closest to
the valve.
   (R)   For standard curb and gutter streets, hydrants shall be placed one
foot, two inches behind back of curb (measuring to center of the hydrant). For
valley curb and gutter streets, hydrants shall be placed behind the sidewalk.
   (S)   The City Inspector must be present for all subgrade preparation, stone
base and asphalt paving.
   (T)   For all residential streets, the final one and one-half inches of
pavement is not to be placed until after 80% of the homes are closed within the
subject phase. The final one and one-half inches of paving is not to be placed
for streets that will be used to access future phases.
   (U)   Asphalt shall be temporarily ramped around structures to prevent
damage prior to final paving. The temporary asphalt shall be removed just prior
to the final paving. The street shall be inspected by the city prior to the
final paving. Any cracked, settled or other damaged pavement sections shall be

water mains that have been pressure tested, chlorinated and flushed.
         (b)   Meters shall be located at the edge of the right-of-way at the
center of the lot, but in no case closer than 24 inches to any wall, building
or obstruction. The location of each meter shall be verified with the city.
         (c)   Pipe shall be cut to the required length and properly laid in
the service ditch with adequate provisions to protect against expansion and
contraction.
         (d)   Water service lines shall be installed with 20 to 30 inches of
cover unless otherwise approved by the city due to unusual circumstances.
         (e)   1.   Pipe shall be laid with bell ends facing in the direction
of laying, unless otherwise approved by the engineer. Every precaution shall be
taken to prevent foreign material from entering the pipe while it is being
placed. Trench width shall be as shown on the standard drawings.
            2.   At times when pipe laying is not in progress, the open ends of
pipe shall be closed by a water-tight plug or other means approved by the
engineer. This provision shall apply during the noon hours as well as
overnight. If water is in the trench, the seal shall remain in place until the
trench is pumped completely dry.
            3.   Where the bottom of the trench at subgrade is found to be
unstable or to include ashes, cinders, all types of refuse, vegetable or other
organic materials, or large pieces of fragments of inorganic material which, in
the judgment of the city, should be removed, the contractor shall excavate and
remove such unsuitable material to the width and depth ordered by the city.
Before the pipe is laid, the subgrade shall be made by backfilling with
aggregate base course, #67, in six-inch uncompacted layers. The layers shall be
machine tamped, as directed by the city, so as to provide a uniform and
continuous bearing and support for the pipe at all points along the pipe
length. Suitable backfill material shall be brought in as required and
compacted in eight-inch lifts to bring the trench back to the desired grade.
            4.   Pipe protection cover to a depth of 12 inches above the top of
the pipe shall consist of select material free from rocks larger than two
inches, and may require hand placement. However, should the material excavated
from the trench be completely free of rock larger than two inches, the trench
may be machine backfilled. Should the excavated material not be suitable for
machine backfill or hand placement, the contractor may, at his or her option,
use #67 stone to a depth of six inches above the top of the pipe. The trench
may then be backfilled as outlined in divisions (C)(7)(e)5. and (C)(7)(e)6.
below.
            5.   After the pipe protection cover has been placed, the trench
excavated areas shall be backfilled with excavated material free from rock
larger than 12 inches.
            6.   All pipeline trench backfill shall be placed in six-inch
layers and compacted using a mechanical, hydraulically-powered vibratory trench
compactor or other equivalent equipment. All trench backfill shall be compacted
to 95% (minimum) of that of the adjacent undisturbed soil.
         (f)   The contractor shall fill and flush the newly constructed lines
and visually check all valves and fire hydrants to assure proper operation.
         (g)   All pipe shall be tested as set out in AWWA C600, latest
revision. Tests will be conducted after the line is completed and backfill
made, except those areas around valves and fire hydrants may be left open at
the discretion of the contractor.
            1.   The line shall be tested at 150% of the designed operating
pressure or a minimum of 200 psi, whichever is greater. The engineer will
assist the contractor in determining test pressure at any given point. The
contractor shall provide all pumps or other equipment necessary to maintain the
test pressure within five psi at the test point for a period of two hours.
            2.   The leakage test shall be conducted concurrently with the
pressure test. LEAKAGE shall be defined as the quantity of water that must be
supplied into the newly laid pipe, or any valved section thereof, to maintain
pressure within five psi of the above specified test pressure after the air in
the pipeline has been expelled and the pipe has been filled with water. Leakage
shall not be measured by a drop in pressure in a test section over a period of
time.
            3.   The contractor shall be responsible for providing all pumps,
equipment and appurtenances necessary to maintain the above specified test
pressure, and to meter the water supplied to the line in order to maintain the
test pressure within the limits specified.
            4.   Leakage for water pipe shall be within the limits set out in
AWWA C600, latest revision. Should any test of pipe laid disclose leakage
greater than that specified, the contractor shall, at his or her own expense,
locate and repair the defective joints, and retest the line until the leakage
is within the specified allowance.
            5.   a.   No pipe installation will be accepted if the leakage is
greater than that determined by the following formula.
               b.   In inch-pound units, L =   SDP
                              133,200
               c.   Where:
                  I.   L equals allowable leakage, in gallons per hour;
                  ii.   S equals the length of pipe tested, in feet;
                  iii.   D equals the nominal diameter of the pipe, in inches;
and
                  iv.   P equals the average test pressure during the leakage
test, in pounds per square inch (gauge).
         (h)   1.   After successful testing, the water main shall be emptied
of water. The line shall then be disinfected in accordance with AWWA C651,
latest revision, for “Disinfecting Water Mains”, continuous feed method, except
that the placing of hypochlorite granules into the main during construction
will not be permitted.
            2.   All water mains installed shall be thoroughly flushed and
disinfected before being placed in service. This work shall be done under the
direct supervision of the engineer’s inspector. The contractor shall supply all
labor, equipment and materials necessary for carrying out this work. After a
thorough flushing and cleaning out, sufficient chlorine compounds shall be
introduced in the lines to produce a chlorine concentration of at least 100
parts per million. The chlorine solution shall be retained in the lines for at
least 24 hours. At the end of this period, the chlorine residual shall be at
least ten parts per million. The lines will then be flushed sufficiently to
clear them of chlorine exceeding one part per million. Samples of water from
the mains will then be taken and analyzed for bacteriological purity. If the
mains fail to meet the bacteriological standard for purity, disinfecting and
flushing will be repeated until such standards have been met. All analysis for
chlorine and bacteriological purity will be by the contractor at state approved
laboratories. The city shall be furnished copies of certified lab results.
            3.   After sterilization is complete, the contractor shall then
flush the sterilizing solution from the lines, and the lines will then be
placed into service. Chlorinated water shall not be discharged into or near
streams or other water bodies.
   (D)   Construction.
      (1)   Installation must meet these specifications and the standard
drawings.
      (2)   Water connection location shall be stamped into the curb at the
exact location of the crossing (“W” for water). All valves shall be indicated
by a “V” stamped in the curb at a point closest to the valve.
      (3)   Contractors will be responsible for a one-year warranty beginning
the date final construction acceptance is given by the city.
      (4)   (a)   The city will not maintain any newly installed infrastructure
until final acceptance of the project is granted by City Council.
         (b)   The one-year warranty period will not begin until final
acceptance. The developer may not request final acceptance until all
deficiencies have been satisfactorily addressed as determined by the city and a
set of as-built drawings certified by the engineer of record have been
submitted, reviewed and accepted by the city.
         (c)   It shall be the responsibility of the developer to request the
final acceptance.

         (b)   On all gravity flow sewers, the contractor shall conduct low
pressure air tests of the various sections of pipe by use of equipment
manufactured for this purpose. The equipment shall include a regulator to avoid
over-pressurizing and possibly damaging an otherwise acceptable line.
         (c)   The low pressure air test shall be conducted by plugging each
opening in the reach of pipe to be tested. All plugs shall be braced against
slippage due to internal pressure, and no one shall be allowed in the manhole
during the testing procedure. One of the plugs provided must have an inlet tap
or other provision for connecting an air hose. After connecting the air control
equipment to the air hose, monitor the air pressure so that the internal
pressure does not exceed five psig. After reaching four psig, the air supply
shall be throttled to maintain between four and 3.5 psig for at least two
minutes in order to allow equilibrium between air temperature and the pipe
walls. If plugs are found to leak, the contractor shall bleed off the air,
tighten the plugs, and again begin supplying air. After the temperature has
stabilized, the pressure is allowed to decrease to 3.5 psig. At 3.5 psig, the
contractor shall begin timing to determine the time required for the pressure
to drop. The pipe shall be presumed free of defects if the time, in seconds,
for the air pressure to decrease one psig is greater than that shown.
 
Minimum Test Time for Various Pipe Sizes
Nominal Pipe Size (Inches) T (Time) Minutes per 100 Feet
8                          1.2
10                         1.5
12                         1.8

24                         3.6
 
         (d)   The low pressure air test shall be performed as specified in the
latest revision of ASTM C828. If the line pressure drops more than one psi
during the required test time, then the section of pipe has failed the test.
         (e)   If by use of the procedure in division (C)(9)(d) above,
defective section(s) of line are found, the line segment shall be tested at 20-
foot intervals to determine the exact location of the defect(s). Repairs shall
be made in defective section(s), and the entire line segment shall then be
retested.
         (f)   If the top of the sewer pipe to be tested is below the ground
water table, an infiltration test may be required. Infiltration shall not
exceed 100 gallons per inch diameter per mile of pipe per 24 hours. Obvious
leaks in any section shall be corrected even if the section passes testing. The
contractor shall furnish and install weirs or other measures as required for
measuring infiltration.
      (10)   Mandrel testing.
         (a)   Polyvinyl chloride pipe sewer lines shall be mandrel tested as
follows.
            1.   Flexible sewer pipes shall be mandrel tested with a rigid
device sized to pass 5%or less deflection (or deformation) of the pipe.
            2.   The mandrel (go/no-go) device shall be cylindrical in shape
and constructed with either nine or 16 evenly spaced arms or prongs. Mandrels
with fewer arms (in odd or even numbers, respectively) will be rejected as not
sufficiently accurate. The contact length of the mandrel’s arms shall equal or
exceed the nominal diameter of the sewer to be inspected. Critical mandrel
dimensions shall carry a tolerance of plus or minus one one-hundredth of an
inch.
            3.   Pipe dimensions as contained in ASTM 2680, latest revision,
shall be used to compute the mandrel dimensions. Allowances for pipe wall
thickness tolerances or ovality (from shipment, heat, shipping loads, poor
production and the like) shall not be deducted from the base ASTM data, but
shall be counted as a part of the 5% or lesser deflection allowance.
            4.   The mandrel shall be hand-pulled by the contractor through all
sewer lines. Any sections of sewer not passing the mandrel shall be uncovered
and the contractor shall rebed, reround or replace the sewer to the
satisfaction of the city. These repaired sections shall be retested.
         (b)   The inspection shall be conducted no earlier than 30 days after
reaching final trench backfill grade, provided, in the opinion of the city,
that sufficient water densification or rainfall has occurred to thoroughly
settle the soil throughout the entire trench depth. If this cannot be achieved
in the time after installation prior to the project completion date, then the
mandrel size shall be increased to measure one-third less of a deflection
allowance.
         (c)   Drawings of the mandrel with complete dimensioning shall be
furnished by the contractor to the city for approval for each diameter and
specification of pipe.
         (d)   Contractors or owners shall supplement the mandrel testing
procedures with CCTV camera or sewer-line rapid assessment technology as
required by city inspectors at no cost to the city.
      (11)   Vacuum Testing of Manholes.
         (a)   Each manhole constructed by the contractor shall be vacuum
tested by the contractor after assembly of the manhole. The test shall be
conducted in accordance with ASTM C-1244. The test shall be performed after all
grade rings and rings and covers have been installed. After the testing
equipment is in place, a vacuum of ten inches of mercury shall be drawn on the
manhole. The time for the vacuum to drop to nine inches of mercury must be
greater than the minimum time listed below.
 
Minimum Vacuum Test Time (Seconds)
Manhole Depth (Feet) Diameter of Manhole (Inches)
                     48 Inches  60 Inches   72 Inches
0-10 Feet            60 seconds  75 seconds  90 seconds
10-15 Feet           75 seconds  90 seconds  105 seconds
15-25 Feet           90 seconds  105 seconds 120 seconds
25-30 Feet           105 seconds 120 seconds 135 seconds
 
         (b)   The City Inspector shall be present during the entire testing
process. Any repairs to manholes which fail the vacuum test must be made on the
inside and outside of each manhole.
   (D)   Construction.
      (1)   Installation must meet these specifications and the standard
drawings.
      (2)   Sewer connections shall be stamped into the curb at the exact
location of the crossing (“S” for sewer).
      (3)   Contractors will be responsible for a one-year warranty beginning
the date final construction acceptance is given by the city.
      (4)   The city will not maintain any newly installed infrastructure until
final acceptance of the project is granted by City Council. The one-year
warranty period will not begin until final acceptance. The applicant must
submit one set of as-builts and a digital copy to the Utilities Department. The
developer may not request final acceptance until all deficiencies have been
satisfactorily addressed as determined by the city and a set of as-built
drawings certified by the engineer of record have been submitted, reviewed and
accepted by the city. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to
request the final acceptance.

GUARANTEE OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS; WARRANTY AGAINST DEFECTS
§ 153.100 FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN LIEU OF IMMEDIATE INSTALLATION FOR APPROVAL.
   (A)   In lieu of requiring the completion, installation and inspection of
all or any part of the required improvements as described in this subchapter
prior to final plat approval, the city may enter into a contract with the
subdivider and/or applicant whereby the subdivider and/or applicant shall agree
to complete all required improvements. Once said agreement is signed by both
parties, and the security required herein is provided, the final plat may be
approved if all other requirements of this chapter are met.
   (B)   To secure this contract, the subdivider and/or applicant shall provide
either of, or a combination of, the following guarantees to cover the costs of
the proposed improvements.
      (1)   Security.
         (a)   The subdivider and/or applicant shall deposit cash, an
irrevocable letter of credit or other instrument readily convertible into cash
at face value, either with the city or in escrow with a financial institution.
The amount of deposit shall be equal to 120% of the estimated cost as approved
by the Planning and Development Department, of installing all required
improvements. The initial cost estimate shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider and/or applicant and certified by his or her engineer, but the
approval of the final cost estimate shall be made by the City Engineer.
         (b)   If other instrument is deposited in escrow with a financial
institution as provided above, then the subdivider and/or applicant shall file
with the city an agreement between the financial institution and him- or
herself guaranteeing the following:
            1.   Said escrow account shall be held in trust until released by
the City Council and may not be used or pledged by the subdivider and/or
applicant in any other matter during the term of the escrow;
            2.   In the case of a failure on the part of the subdivider and/or
applicant to complete said improvements within the time allotted, the financial
institution shall, upon notification by the city and submission by the city to
the financial institution of an estimate of the amount needed to complete the
improvements, immediately either pay to the city the funds estimated to
complete the improvements, up to the full balance of the escrow account, or
deliver to the city any other instruments fully endorsed or otherwise made
payable in full to the city; and
            3.   The irrevocable letter of credit shall be in the form of an
“evergreen” or “automatic renewal” letter of credit, and the subdivider and/or
applicant may request a reduction to 30% of the total amount deposited only
after 80% of the homesites are developed and may reissue the “evergreen” letter
of credit upon approval by the City Council.
      (2)   Governmental guarantee. In any case where a required improvement is
to be provided by the state or any local government other than the city, the
subdivider and/or applicant may provide, in lieu of the types of financial
guarantee as provided for above, a letter from the appropriate state or local
government official guaranteeing the installation of the improvement in the
required manner and within the time allotted. Provided, however, in any case
where the cost of such improvement exceeds $10,000 as determined by the city,
such governmental guarantee shall be in the form of an approved Project Budget
Ordinance where local government is to be the provider and an equivalent
document where the state is to be the provider.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.101 DEFAULT.
   (A)   Upon DEFAULT, meaning failure on the part of the subdivider and/or
applicant to complete the required improvements in a timely manner as specified
in the escrow agreement, the surety or the financial institution holding the
escrow account shall, if requested by the city, pay all or any portion of the
escrow fund to the city up to the amount needed to complete the improvements
based on an estimate by the city. Upon payment, the city, at its discretion,
may expend such portion of said funds as deemed necessary to complete all or
any portion of the required improvements. The city shall return to the
subdivider and/or applicant any funds not spent in completing the improvements.
   (B)   Default on a project does not release the subdivider and/or applicant
from liability/responsibility, financial or otherwise, for the completion of
the improvements.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.102 RELEASE OF GUARANTEE SECURITY.
   (A)   The subdivider and/or applicant may request a reduction to 30% of the
total amount deposited only after 80% of the homes are closed and may reissue
the “evergreen” letter of credit upon approval by the City Council.
   (B)   The City Council may release any remaining portion of all or any
security posted as the improvements are completed and approved by the City
Engineer. The City Manager shall reserve the right to release any remaining
portion of all or any security posted as the improvements are completed and
approved by the City Engineer if said security is less than 20% of the total
amount deposited and less than $50,000.
   (C)   Prior to such release, the subdivider and/or applicant shall provide
the City Engineer with a set of as-built drawings certified by his or her
engineer.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.103 WARRANTY AGAINST DEFECTS.
   (A)   Prior to the approval of the final plat or acceptance by the city of
any improvements in any subdivision, the subdivider and/or applicant shall
furnish to the city a written warranty against defects which shall guarantee
the material and workmanship for a period of not less than one year from the
date of such acceptance. Such warranty shall be accompanied by a financial
guarantee payable to the city equal to at least 15% of the cost of the
installation of such improvements as determined by the City Engineer.
   (B)   Such financial guarantee shall be in the form of financial guarantee,
as provided for in §
153.100.
   (C)   Upon successful performance of the improvements, as determined by the
City Council, for the one-year period, the financial guarantee shall be
returned to the subdivider and/or applicant. Upon the failure of an improvement
to perform within the generally accepted standards for the type of improvement
as determined by the City Council, the subdivider and/or applicant shall be
notified and given a reasonable period of time to correct the defects. Should
the subdivider and/or applicant fail to act in a timely manner, or otherwise
fail to correct the defect(s), the City Engineer shall find the subdivider and/
or applicant in default and proceed in the same manner as provided for in §
153.101.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.104 FINAL ACCEPTANCE.
   (A)   The city will not maintain any newly installed infrastructure until
final acceptance of the project is granted by City Council. The one-year
warranty period will not begin until final acceptance. The developer may not
request final acceptance until all deficiencies have been satisfactorily
addressed as determined by the city. It shall be the responsibility of the
developer to request the final acceptance.
   (B)   All construction and installation of improvements shall be in
accordance with all the city rules, regulations and requirements, and the
construction plans approved and on file with the city.
   (C)   All construction and installation of improvements shall be inspected
and certified by the applicant’s engineer as being completed in accordance with
the approved plans and specifications. This signed and sealed certification by
the applicant’s engineer shall be for all infrastructure improvements as shown
on the approved construction plans and be accompanied with the following
information:
      (1)   A set of water, sewer and drainage as-built drawings (paper copy)
certified by the engineer of record and a digital file for use by the city;
      (2)   Asphalt pavement core sampling report signed and sealed by a
certified material testing company;
      (3)   Asphalt compaction tests for the surface course; signed and sealed
by a certified material testing company;

sewer manholes shall be done in accordance with current industry standards and
requirements.

(Ord. passed 9-27-2021) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.105 CORRECTION OF CONSTRUCTION DEFICIENCIES.
   All deficiencies in construction shall be corrected by the developer as soon
as practical after notification from the city. The city reserves the right to
withhold issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy, or refuse
platting of future phases, if all deficiencies or repair items are not complete
after 50% of the lots have been permitted for construction in any phase of a
subdivision development or site plan. For commercial, industrial or other type
projects, certificate of occupancy may be held until all deficiencies are
corrected. A construction checklist to be completed by the developer can be
found in §
153.087.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.106 LETTER OF CREDIT CHECKLIST.
   (A)   This chapter allows for final plat approval so that the developer may
begin selling lots and/or houses before completing construction of the required
infrastructure (i.e., streets, sidewalks, streetlights, water and sewer
extensions and other subdivision requirements). In order to obtain final plat
approval before the infrastructure is completed, the developer must enter into
a subdivision agreement with the city setting forth the yet to be completed
subdivision requirements and the expected costs to complete the remaining
requirements. The developer’s engineer must provide a written, detailed cost
estimate and provide it to the city, which will in turn have it reviewed by the
city’s Engineer for completeness and accuracy of the cost estimate. The
subdivision agreement will make reference to the remaining subdivision
requirements and the estimated costs as finally agreed upon by the developer
and the city. The letter of credit is required to be 1.2 times or 120% of the
cost estimate, to allow for unforeseen contingencies and inflation.
   (B)   Below is a checklist for this process.
      (1)   The developer pays the city the application fee for final plat
approval of all or a portion of a subdivision.
      (2)   The developer’s engineer prepares a detailed cost estimate,
including all incomplete requirements as outlined in this chapter. The city
shall provide standard forms for use in preparing the cost estimate.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the developer’s engineer’s estimate, the city’s
Engineer will review the same and discuss any modifications he or she believes
necessary to the developer’s estimate.
      (4)   The Planning and Zoning Department will have the City Attorney
prepare the subdivision agreement. This will be handled between the Planning
and Zoning Department and the City Attorney, and all inquiries by the developer
will be made to the Planning and Zoning Department, and not directly with the
City Attorney.
      (5)   Upon completion of the subdivision agreement and approval by the
developer, the developer will give the subdivision administrator the name and
phone number of the bank which the developer would like to use to issue the
letter of credit. Do not have the bank issue any letter of credit until advised
to do so by the subdivision administrator. Letters of credit will need to be
issued only after the City Attorney and the banking representative discuss the
matter to be sure that the bank meets the city’s requirements and uses the
correct language and dates in the letter of credit.
      (6)   After the subdivision agreement has been signed by the city and
developer, and a proper letter of credit has been issued in accordance with
city requirements, then the developer may proceed to develop his or her
subdivision and obtain zoning compliance permit.

LEGAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.120 INTERPRETATION, PURPOSE, CONFLICT.
   (A)   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
safety, health, convenience, prosperity and general welfare.
   (B)   It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or
annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; provided,
however, that where this chapter imposes a greater restriction or imposes
higher standards than those required by other ordinances, rules, regulations,
or by easements, covenants or agreements the provisions of this chapter shall
govern so that, in all cases, the most restrictive limitation or requirement,
or the requirement causing the highest standard of improvement shall govern.
   (C)   Provided, however, in any case where the Zoning Ordinance specifically
permits a development type not otherwise provided for in this chapter, the
Zoning Ordinance shall prevail.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.121 REPEAL AND REENACTMENT OF EXISTING SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE.
   The rewriting of this chapter in part carries forth by reenactment some of
the provisions of the existing Subdivision Ordinance of the city, and is not
intended to repeal but rather to reenact and continue in force such existing
provisions so that all rights and liabilities that have been accrued are
preserved and may be enforced. All provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance,
which are not reenacted herein, are hereby repealed. All suits at law or in
equity and/or all prosecutions resulting from the violation of the Subdivision
Ordinance in effect, which are now pending in any of the courts of the state or
the United States, shall not be abated or abandoned by reason of the adoption
of this chapter, but shall be prosecuted to their finality the same as if this
existing chapter had not been adopted; and any and all violations of the
existing ordinance, prosecutions for which have not been instituted, may be
filed and prosecuted; and nothing in this chapter shall be so construed as to
abandon, abate or dismiss any litigation or prosecution now pending and/or
which may have been instituted or prosecuted.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.122 EFFECT UPON OUTSTANDING CONSTRUCTION PLANS.
   (A)   (1)   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in any
construction plan which has received approval by the city prior to the time of
the adoption of this chapter, provided that such construction plan has been
prosecuted to completion and a final plat recorded in the office of the
Register of Deeds within 18 months after the time of the adoption of this
chapter.
      (2)   If the final plat of all or part of the area shown on any
previously approved construction plan is not recorded in the office of the
Register of Deeds within 18 months after the time of the adoption of this
chapter, such non-recorded area shall be subject to all the provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   After the effective date of this chapter, any final plat to be
recorded based upon any outstanding construction plan shall follow the final
plat approval procedures of this chapter, including the guarantee of
installation provisions.
   (C)   In addition, nothing herein contained shall require any change in the
final plat, which has received approval by the city prior to the time of the
adoption of this chapter, provided that such a final plat is prosecuted to
completion in accordance with the terms of approval. In the event of default or
the failure of the subdivider and/or applicant to perform in accordance with
the conditions as approved, the city may, at its option, take lawful action
pursuant to the Subdivision Ordinance in existence at the time of the final
plat approval or this chapter.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.123 EFFECT UPON NEW TERRITORY ADDED TO JURISDICTION.
   (A)   At any time when new territory is added to the jurisdiction of this
chapter, such new territory shall immediately become subject to the provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   Any proposed subdivision or any subdivision in progress within such
new territory shall proceed only in accordance with the following.
      (1)   Any subdivision for which a final plat has been recorded in the
Register of Deeds Office pursuant to the approval of another local government,
but which is subject to an outstanding guarantee to such local government for
the installation of subdivision improvements, shall remain under the
subdivision control of such local government until such time as such
subdivision shall have been prosecuted to completion. Provided, however, the
city may not accept the dedication of any street or street improvements unless
such street and street improvements meet the standards of this chapter and the
city’s policy for acceptance of streets for use and maintenance by the city.
      (2)   All other subdivisions shall meet all of the requirements of this
chapter, and it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider and/or applicant
of any proposed subdivision or subdivision in progress to receive approval as
provided for in this chapter before proceeding with any development. The
subdivider and/or applicant shall arrange a conference with the Planning and
Development Department who shall determine the level and type of approval
required, and provide the subdivider and/or applicant with an approval track
for the particular case.
(Ord. passed 9-27-2021)
§ 153.124 MODIFICATIONS.
   The City Council may modify the requirements of this chapter where, because
of the size or shape of the tract to be subdivided, its topography, the
condition or nature of adjoining areas or the existence of other unusual
physical conditions, strict compliance with the provisions of this chapter
would cause an unusual and unnecessary hardship on the subdivider. In granting
modifications, the Council may require such conditions as will secure, insofar
as practicable, the objectives or requirements modified. In no case, however,

§ 3.17 COMPUTING THE NUMBER OF MULTI-FAMILY TYPE DWELLING UNITS.
   (A)   In computing the number of multi-dwelling type units (including
attached units) permitted for a given area of land, subtract the amount of land
area in square feet required for the first dwelling unit from the total net
land area and then divide the remainder by the amount of land required for each
unit over one. The quotient plus one is the number of dwelling units permitted
for the given area of land.
   (B)   For example, on a land area of 80,000 square feet located in the R-
8MF, Residential District:
 
80,000 (total net land)
(-) 8,000 (first dwelling unit)
72,000 (remainder)
72,000 divided by 3,000 (each additional unit) = 24
24 + 1 = 25
 
   (C)   Therefore, 25 multi-family dwelling units may be placed on the 80,000
square foot property. Fractional units over one-half may be rounded to the next
higher whole number when the base number of units is 20 or more.
   (D)   On projects with one building per lot, the computation must be
repeated for each lot separately. On projects with more than one building on a
lot, the computation need only be made one time.

building permit expires six months after issuance unless work under the permit
has commenced. Building permits also expire if work is discontinued for a
period of 12 months after work has commenced.
         (b)   One year – development approvals/permits. Pursuant to G.S. §
160D-403(c), unless otherwise specified by this section, statute or ordinance,
all development approvals or permits expire one year after issuance unless work
has substantially commenced. Expiration of a local development approval or
permit does not affect the duration of a vested right established as a site-
specific vesting plan, a multiphase development plan, a development agreement
or vested rights established under common law.
         (c)   Two to five years – site-specific vesting plans.
            1.   Duration. A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan
shall remain vested for a period of two years. This vesting shall not be
extended by any amendments or modifications to a site-specific vesting plan
unless expressly provided by the City Council. This determination shall be at
the discretion of the City Council and shall be made following the process
specified by division (C)3. below for the particular form of a site-specific
vesting plan involved.
            2.   Relation to building permits. A right vested as provided in
this division (c) shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period
with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit
applications have been filed. Upon issuance of a building permit, the
provisions of G.S. §§ 160D-1109 and 160D-1113 shall apply; except that, the
permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while
vested right under this division (c)2. exists.
            3.   Requirements for site-specific vesting plans. For the purposes
of this section, a SITE-SPECIFIC VESTING PLAN means a plan submitted to the
City Council describing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use
for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The plan may be in the form of,
but not be limited to, any of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit
development plan, a subdivision plat, a site plan, a preliminary or general
development plan, a special use permit, a conditional zoning or any other
development approval as may be used by the City Council. Unless otherwise
expressly provided by this ordinance, the plan shall include the approximate
boundaries of the site; significant topographical and other natural features
effecting development of the site; the approximate location on the site of the
proposed buildings, structures and other improvements; the approximate
dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings and other structures;
and the approximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the
site, including water, sewer, roads and pedestrian walkways. What constitutes a
site-specific vesting plan shall be defined by this ordinance and the
development approval that triggers vesting shall be so identified. A variance
shall not constitute a site-specific vesting plan and approval of a site-
specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not
confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a
sketch plan or other document fails to describe with reasonable certainty the
type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may
not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.
            4.   Process for approval and amendment of site-specific vesting
plans. If a site- specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by
this ordinance, the City Council shall provide whatever notice and hearing is
required for that underlying approval. If the duration of the underlying
approval is less than two years, that shall not affect the duration of the
site- specific vesting established by this division (c)4. If the site-specific
vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with
notice as required by G.S. § 160D-602 shall be held. The City Council may
approve a site-specific vesting plan upon such terms and conditions as may
reasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such
conditional approval shall result in a vested right, although failure to abide
by such terms and conditions will result in forfeiture of vested rights. The
City Council shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as a
condition of development approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed
approved upon the effective date of the City Council’s decision approving the
plan or such other date as determined by the City Council upon approval. An
approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the
approval of the owner and the City Council as follows: any substantial
modification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the original
approval; minor modification may be approved by staff, as authorized by §
15.6 of this Zoning Code.
         (d)   Seven years – multi-phase developments. A multi-phased
development shall be vested for the entire development with the zoning
regulations, subdivision regulations and unified development ordinances in
place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the
multi-phased development. This right shall remain vested for a period of seven
years from the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of
the multi-phased development. For purposes of this division (d), MULTI-PHASED

§ 4.1 ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED; PURPOSE SET FORTH.
   For the purpose of this ordinance, the City of Mount Holly, North Carolina,
is hereby divided into the following use districts.
   (A)   RA, Rural Agricultural District. The purpose is to establish a
district for the purpose of maintaining agricultural and residential uses of
the land and provide for a gradual transition into office or light industrial
uses by way of case-by-case rezoning; while discouraging residential
subdivisions and commercial land use which would be incompatible with future
office and light industrial developments. Also, reasonable safeguards for the
protection of existing residential uses will be employed. This district is
particularly well-suited to accommodate industrial growth from the aspects of
the transportation network, efficient use of public services and facilities,
land form, general compatibility of use and other pertinent considerations.
   (B)   R-20SF, Single-Family Residential. The purpose is to establish a
district to ensure that the principal land use of the land is for low-density
residential development not having access to public water supplies and
dependent upon septic tanks for sewage disposal will occur at sufficiently low
densities to provide a healthful environment. The minimum lot size established
for this district, however, does not guarantee sufficient space for on-site
water and/or sewer systems. In establishing this district, it is intended that
as public water and sewer are provided to property within the district that the
property, on a case-by-case basis, can be considered for more intensive land
use.
   (C)   R-12SF, Single-Family Residential District. The purpose is to
establish a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family
residential purposes. The regulations of this district are intended to provide
areas for those persons desiring smaller residences and to discourage any use
which would substantially interfere with the quiet residential nature of this
district. It is expected that municipal water and sewer facilities will be
available to each lot in such districts.
   (D)   R-10SF, Single-Family Residential District. The purpose is to
establish a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family
residential purposes. The regulations of this district are intended to provide
areas for those persons desiring smaller residences and to discourage any use
which would substantially interfere with the quiet residential nature of this
district. It is expected that municipal water and sewer facilities will be
available to each lot in such districts.
   (E)   R-8SF, Single-Family Residential District. The purpose is to establish
a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family residential
purposes. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the
community for those persons desiring small residences in medium density
neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to prohibit any use which because
of its character, would interfere with the quiet residential nature of this
district. It is expected that municipal water and sewer facilities will be
available to each lot in such districts.
   (F)   R-8MF, Multi-Family Residential District. The purpose is to establish
a district in which the primary use of land is for single-family, two-family
and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to
provide areas in the community for those persons desiring small residences and
multi-family structures in relatively high-density neighborhoods. The
regulations are intended to prohibit any use which because of its character,
would interfere with the residential nature of this district. It is expected
that municipal water and sewer facilities will be available to each lot in such
districts.
   (G)   O&I, Office and Institutional District. The purpose is to establish
and preserve areas for employment activities and services to the public which
do not materially detract from nearby residential uses.
   (H)   B-1, Central Business District. The purpose is to establish a district
for the central shopping area of the City of Mount Holly and its commercial
trade area. The regulations of this district are designed to encourage the
continued use of land for community trade and commercial service uses and to
promote a concentrated development of permitted uses while maintaining a
substantial relationship.
   (I)   B-2, Neighborhood Business District. The purpose is to establish a
district for the use of those businesses which are properly and necessarily
located near residential areas and which cater to the everyday needs of
residential neighborhoods.
   (J)   B-3, General Business District. The purpose is to establish a district
for those businesses and services which generally serve a wider area than
neighborhood businesses, but do not necessarily require location in the central
business district. Because these commercial uses are important to the economy
of the community and subject to higher vehicular use, they should have ample
parking, controlled traffic movement and suitable site design.
   (K)   L-I, Light Industrial District. The purpose is to establish and
preserve areas for industrial and related uses of such a nature that they do
not create serious problems of compatibility with other kinds of land uses and
to make provisions for certain kinds of commercial uses which are most
appropriately located as neighbors of industrial use which are necessary to
service the immediate needs of people in these areas.
   (L)   H-I, Heavy Industrial District. The purpose is to establish and
preserve areas for necessary industrial and related uses of such a nature that
they require isolation from many other kinds of land uses and to make
provisions for commercial uses which are necessary to service the immediate
needs of people in these areas.
   (M)   MHMU, Mount Holly Mixed-Use District. The purpose is to establish a
mixed-use zoning district for Mount Holly which allows residential,
recreational, civic, business and retail uses in a unified development plan.
The regulations for this district produce a development which provides easy
access for the community to reach employment locations, public and/or private
schools and necessity retail and services. The Mount Holly Mixed-Use Zoning
District shall meet the design requirements of the Design Regulations in §
5.18(C) of the Mount Holly Zoning Ordinance.
   (N)   RD, Residential Downtown. The purpose is to establish a residential
zoning district for the City of Mount Holly’s downtown area that promotes
increasing the residential density to support the Central Business District
retail and office development and incorporates the design guidelines of the
Downtown Development Manual of 2005.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 4.2 OVERLAY DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   Watershed Overlay District.
      (1)   The zoning districts established in §
4.1 of this chapter may also be zoned in one or more overlay districts as
designed herein and as shown on the Official Zoning Map. In such a case, the
land is subject to not only the requirements of the underlying zoning district,
but also the additional requirements of the overlay district.
      (2)   The purpose is to provide for the protection of the Lake Wylie and
Mountain Island Lake Water Supplies consistent with the WS-IV Critical Area and
the WS-IV Protected Area Watershed Management Rules as adopted by the North
Carolina Environmental Management Commission. Watershed Overlay Districts may
overlay any other zoning district. The districts are:
         (a)   LWWS-CA, Lake Wylie Watershed Critical Overlay District;
         (b)   LWWS-PA, Lake Wylie Watershed Protected Overlay District;
         (c)   MILWS-CA, Mountain Island Lake Watershed Critical Overlay
District; and
         (d)   MILWS-PA, Mountain Island Lake Watershed Protected Overlay
District.
   (B)   Manufactured Home Overlay District. The purpose is to provide for
locations suitable for the development of both manufactured home parks and
manufactured homes on individual lots. The Manufactured Home Overly District
shall only overlay residential districts. The districts are:
      (1)   MHA, Manufactured Home Overlay District; and
      (2)   MHP, Manufactured Home Park Overlay District.
   (C)   AOB, Adult Oriented Business Overlay District. The purpose of this
overlay district is to provide areas in which adult entertainment or sexually
oriented businesses may be established. Adult establishments, because of their
very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics upon adjacent neighborhoods and residential or institutional
uses. It has been demonstrated that the establishment of adult businesses often
creates problems for law enforcement agencies, by the very nature of these
businesses and the difficulty often experienced in trying to determine if the
operations are of a legal nature. Special regulation of these establishments is
necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to a de
facto downgrading or blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and uses. It is the
intent of this overlay district to restrict the concentration of these uses and
to separate these uses from residential and institutional uses or areas. The
AOB Overlay District shall only be permitted to overlay the B-3 or CU-B-
3 General Business Districts.
   (D)   HD, Historic Overlay District. The HD Historic Overlay District
establishes regulations which will help maintain the historic integrity of
certain areas within the city.
   (E)   South Gateway Overlay District.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose is to establish more restrictive requirements
for permitted uses in the South Gateway Overlay District near I-85, including
design regulations for commercial structures. The land in the overlay is
subject to not only the requirements of the underlying zoning district, but
also the additional requirements of the overlay district.
      (2)   B-3 General Business. The land in the overlay is identified in the
gateway to require greater standards for setbacks with the proximity of the
Highway 273 Corridor, which vary from the same zoning district in outside of
the overlay district.
   (F)   Downtown Gateway Overlay District.
      (1)   Purpose. On 4-13-2009, City Council established the Downtown
Gateway Overlay District, with the base zoning of B-1 Central Business
District. The Manual for Development for Downtown Mount Holly, an adopted
appendix to the Zoning Ordinance, shall serve as the governing document for the
Downtown Gateway Overlay District.
      (2)   Amendment. Additionally, on 8-12-2013, City Council approved the
following text amendment to the Manual for Development in Downtown Mount Holly:
medical facilities greater than 25,000 square feet in size are exempt from the
design regulations for new commercial buildings found in § 5 of the Manual for
Development in Downtown Mount Holly. However, no use shall be exempt from the
parking, landscaping, building material and connectivity requirements found in
the manual and the corresponding sections of the zoning ordinance.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 4.3 CONDITIONAL DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose is to establish a legislative process, in which
site plans and individualized development conditions are imposed. It is
recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at
particular locations in the absence of special conditions.
   (B)   Consideration. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be
rezoned to such a district in such situations, the conditional district is a
means by which such individualized development conditions can be imposed in the
furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance. The conditional district
classification will be considered only upon request of all applicant property
owners for rezoning. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these
regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the applicant should fail
to accept any condition, it is the intent of this ordinance that the
authorization of such conditional district shall be null and void and of no
effect and that proceedings be instituted to rezone the property to its
previous zoning classification. See §
14.5 for further guidelines on conditional district. Authority is found in G.S.
§ 160D-703(b).
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 4.4 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES SHOWN ON ZONING MAP.
   The boundaries of the districts are shown on the map accompanying this
ordinance and made part hereof entitled, “Official Zoning Map, Mount Holly,
North Carolina”. The Zoning Map and all the notations, references and
amendments thereto and other information shown thereon are hereby made a part
of this ordinance the same as if such information set forth on the map were all
fully described as set out herein. The Zoning Map properly attested is posted
at the Mount Holly Municipal Complex in the Department of Planning and Zoning
and is available for inspection by the public.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 4.5 DUE CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   In the creation, by this ordinance, of the respective districts, careful
consideration is given to the peculiar suitability of each and every district
for the particular uses and regulations applied thereto, and the necessary and
proper grouping and arrangement of various uses and densities of population in
accordance with a well-considered comprehensive plan for the physical
development of the city.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 4.6 RULES GOVERNING INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid
districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply.
   (A)   Where such district boundaries are indicated as approximately
following street, alley or highway lines, such lines shall be construed to such
boundaries.
   (B)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to said boundaries.
   (C)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to the centerline of streets, alleys or highways, or the rights-of-way
of the same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel
thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the Zoning Map.
   (D)   Where district boundaries are indicated as following topographic
contours, drainage divides or specific measured distances such features shall
be construed to such boundaries.
   (E)   Except for Watershed Overlay District boundaries, where an underlying
use district boundary line divides a lot or tract in a single ownership, the
district requirements for the least restricted portion of such lot or tract
shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof; provided, such extensions shall
not include any part of a lot or tract more than 35 feet beyond the district
boundary line. The term “least restricted” shall refer to use restrictions, not
lot or tract size.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 4.7 INTERPRETING PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   The listings of permitted uses in the various districts in this
ordinance are considered to be specific in regard to the types of uses intended
for each of the various districts. In interpreting proposed uses, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall refer to the National American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) Codes Manual as a guide. When a proposed use is
not specifically listed in the Table of Permitted Uses, the Zoning Enforcement
Officer shall use the NAICS Manual to determine if the use is the same as, or
manifestly similar to, a listed use in form and function. If the Zoning
Enforcement Officer finds that the proposed use is the same as, or manifestly
similar to, a listed use, he or she shall classify the proposed use a listed
use. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall maintain a written record of such
interpretations.
   (B)   Any person who is aggrieved by any such interpretation by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer may appeal such interpretation to the Board of Adjustment
as provided for in Ch. 12 of this ordinance.

§ 5.15 WATERSHED OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   General. The following general provisions apply to all Watershed
Overlay Districts. These provisions and the provisions contained in the
individual Watershed Overlay Districts are designed to protect the water
quality of the water supply watersheds that lie within the jurisdiction of this
ordinance and to implement the rules adopted by the North Carolina
Environmental Management Commission for the classified watershed pursuant to
G.S. § 143-214.5.
      (1)   The construction of new roads and bridges and non-residential
development should minimize built-upon area, divert storm water away from
surface water supply waters as much as possible and employ best management
practices (BMPs) to minimize water quality impacts. To the extent practicable,
the construction of new roads in the critical area should be avoided. The
Department of Transportation BMPs are outlined in its document entitled, Best
Management Practices for the Protection of Surface Waters, shall be used in all
road and bridge construction projects in the Watershed Overlay Districts.
      (2)   All development activities within Watershed Overlay Districts, in
addition to those activities specifically regulated by these provisions, are
subject to the standards, usage conditions and other regulations contained in
the Rules and Requirements of the Surface Water Supply Protection Rules,
adopted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission.
      (3)   A minimum 30-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is
required along all perennial waters, including stream, rivers and impoundments,
indicated on the most recent versions of the United States Geodetic Survey
(USGS) 1:24,000 scale topographic maps. Nothing in this division (A)(3) shall
prevent artificial stream bank or shoreline stabilization. No new development
is allowed in the buffer; except that, water dependent structures, or other
structures such as flagpoles, signs and security lights, which result in only
diminutive increases in impervious area and public works projects such as road
crossings and greenways may be allowed where no practicable alternative exists.
These activities shall minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away
from the surface water and maximize the utilization of BMPs. Existing single-
family residential development, single-family residential on pre-existing lots
and development that does not require a sedimentation control permit are not
required to provide the buffer.
      (4)   Where otherwise permitted in the underlying primary zoning
district, cluster development is allowed on a project-by-project basis as
follows:
         (a)   The overall density of the project meets the density requirement
of this ordinance;
         (b)   The appropriate vegetative buffer in division (A)(3) above is
provided;
         (c)   Built-upon areas are designed and located to minimize storm
water runoff impact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated storm water
flow and maximize the flow length through vegetative areas;
         (d)   Areas of concentrated development are located in upland areas
and away, to the maximum extent practicable, from surface waters and drainage
ways;
         (e)   Remainder of tract to remain in vegetated or natural state;
         (f)   The area in the vegetated or natural state may be conveyed to a
property owners association; a local government for preservation as a park or
greenway; a conservation organization; or placed in a permanent conservation or
farmland preservation easement. A maintenance agreement shall be filed with the
property deeds; and
         (g)   Cluster development shall transport storm water runoff from the
development by vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable.
      (5)   All development in Watershed Overlay Districts shall, to the
maximum extent practicable, minimize built-upon surface area, direct storm
water runoff away from surface waters and incorporate best management practices
(BMPs) to minimize water quality impacts.
      (6)   Existing development, as defined in this ordinance, is not subject
to the requirement of the overlay provisions. Expansions to structures
classified as existing development must meet the requirements of these
provisions; provided, however, the built-upon area of the existing development
is not required to be included in the density calculations. In determining
expansions to existing development, the maximum permitted additional built-upon
area is derived by multiplying the area of the portion of the property that is
not built-upon by the appropriate percent built-upon limitation for the Overlay
District in which the property is located.
      (7)   A pre-existing lot created prior to the effective date of this
ordinance, regardless of whether or not a vested right has been established,
may be developed or redeveloped for single-family residential purposes without
being subject to the restrictions of these overlay provisions.
      (8)   Any existing building or built-upon area not in conformance with
the limitations of these provisions that has been damaged or removed for any
reason may be repaired and/or reconstructed; provided:
         (a)   Repair or reconstruction is initiated within 12 months and
completed within two years of such damage or removal;
         (b)   The total amount of space devoted to built-upon area may not be
increased; and
         (c)   The repair or reconstruction is otherwise permitted under the
provisions of this ordinance.
      (9)   No activity, situation, structure or land use shall be permitted or
allowed to operate within a watershed which poses a threat to water quality and
the public health, safety and welfare. Such conditions may arise from
inadequate on-site sewage systems which utilize ground water absorption;
inadequate sedimentation and erosion control measures; the improper storage or
disposal of junk, trash or other refuse within a buffer area; the absence or
improper implementation of a spill containment plan for toxic and hazardous
materials; the improper management of storm water runoff; or any other
situation found to pose a threat to water quality.
      (10)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may require such information on
subdivision, zoning compliance permit and development plan applications,
including the density/built-upon area calculations, as he may deem necessary to
determine compliance with Watershed Overlay District provisions. Preliminary
and final subdivision plat approval and other such plan approvals may be
required to note density/built-upon limitations on the plat. For example, plats
may be required to show such information as total area of the development, the
amount and percent of impervious area in streets and sidewalks, the amount and
percent of impervious area in other public improvements and the amount and
percent of impervious area that is allocated to the various lots for future
development. Such information shall be displayed in such a manner that the
Zoning Enforcement Officer can readily determine compliance with these
provisions on a project-by-project basis.
      (11)   Development that does not require a sedimentation control permit
is exempt from the density/built-upon limitations contained herein. The Zoning
Enforcement Officer may, prior to the issuance of any permit in a Watershed
Overlay District, require evidence of a valid sedimentation control permit
issued by Gaston County Quality of Natural Resources Commission (QNRC) or
evidence satisfactory to the officer that no permit is required.
      (12)   The City Council and/or the Board of Adjustment may, in carrying
out its plan review authority under this Zoning Ordinance and/or its
subdivision review authority under the Subdivision Ordinance, adjust the
boundary of a Watershed Critical Area Overlay District to fit existing or
proposed streets, lot lines or other features; provided that, such adjustments
are agreed to by the property owner(s) involved and provided that any such
adjustment is made with no loss of total lot area in the affected Watershed
Critical Area Overlay District.
      (13)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall maintain records of the
administration of the Watershed Overlay District regulations and shall submit
any modifications of the regulations and/or map to the Division of
Environmental Management, Division of Environmental Health and Division of
Community Assistance. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall also maintain a
record of variances and the reason for the variance to the Division of
Environmental Management. The annual report shall contain a record of each
variance granted by the Board of Adjustment during the previous calendar year
and shall be submitted on or before January 1 of the following year.
      (14)   Any land designated by the Army Corp of Engineers as a wetland,
shall be required to have a minimum 15-foot natural vegetative buffer located
adjacent to it. The buffer area shall be along all possible sides of the
wetland area. Also, the subdivision plat shall be required to show the
Wetlands, as identified by the Army Corp of Engineers, together with the 15-
foot buffer as required by this division (A)(14). Signage depicting the wetland
and buffer area shall be installed by the developer to notify the public of
such. Signage must be approved by the Planning Director and does not require a
zoning compliance permit.
   (B)   LWWS-CA, Lake Wylie Watershed Critical Overlay District.
      (1)   General development standards.
         (a)   No new sites for land application of residual or petroleum
contaminated soils are allowed.

         (b)   Non-residential development activities which require a
sedimentation control permit shall not exceed 24% built-upon area, on a
project-by-project basis.
      (3)   Density built-upon limitations; high density. The high density
option allows for a greater development density, which equates to 24% to 50%
impervious surface; provided, engineered controls (structural BMPs) are used to
manage storm water runoff. Structural BMPs are required under the high density
option. High density development shall meet the requirements of this section,

structural BMPs are required under the high density option for subdivisions,
the approval of the high density development permit will be subject to the
owner filing a surety bond or a letter of credit or making other financial
arrangements, which are acceptable to the city of mount holly in an amount to
be determined by the city in consultation with other agencies, such as the
North Carolina Division of Water Quality, in a form which is satisfactory to
the City Attorney, guaranteeing the installation and maintenance of the
required structural BMPs until issuance of certificates of occupancy for 75% of
all construction, which might reasonably be anticipated to be built within the
area which drains into the structural BMPs, allowing credit for improvements
completed prior to the submission of the final plat. Upon issuance of
certificates of occupancy for 75% of all anticipated construction, relative to
the required structural BMPs, written notice thereof must be given by the owner
to the City Engineer/city. The Public Utilities Department will arrange for an
inspection of the structural BMPs and if found satisfactory, will within 30
days of the date of notice notify the owner in writing.
            2.   Property other than subdivisions; civil penalties. Any person
who fails to install or maintain the required structural BMPs in accordance
with this chapter, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500.
No penalties shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has
been notified of the violation by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, or other means which are determined reasonable in giving actual
notice. The notice shall describe the violation with reasonable particularity,
specify a reasonable time period within which the violation must be corrected,
and warn that the failure to correct the violation within the time period will
result in the assessment of a civil penalty or further legal action. Each day
that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
         (d)   Maintenance responsibility of structural BMPs. For single family
developments, BMPs that are constructed on privately-owned land and are not
within a public easement shall be maintained by a property owners association
or the owner of the subject property. BMPs that are constructed on public land
within public rights-of-way, and/or within public easements shall be maintained
by the public body with ownership/jurisdiction of the subject property.
            1.   Maintenance of structural BMPs shall be the responsibility of
the individual property owner.
            2.   (Reserved for maintenance covenants.)
            3.   (Reserved for storm water credit.)
         (e)   Future. The property owner may apply for a credit to the
property’s storm water fee according to the policies of the City of Mount Holly
Storm Water Ordinance to compensate for this responsibility. The property owner
will be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the structural BMPs. If, at
any time, the BMPs are not properly maintained, the credit will be suspended.
         (f)   Additional requirements. An occupancy permit shall not be issued
for any building or other structure, requiring such permit, within the
permitted development until the Public Utilities Department has approved the
structural BMP or storm water control structure.
   (C)   LWWS-PA, Lake Wylie Watershed Protected Area Overlay District.
      (1)   Density/built-upon limitations; low density.

control permit shall not exceed one dwelling unit per 20,000 square feet or,
optionally, 24% built-upon area, on a project-by-project basis.
         (b)   Non-residential development activities which require a
sedimentation control permit shall not exceed 24% built-upon area, on a
project-by-project basis.
         (c)   Residential development activities which require a sedimentation
control permit and which are not required to use, or do not utilize for storm
drainage purposes, a curb and gutter street system, shall not exceed three
dwelling units per acre or, optionally, 36% built-upon area, on a project-by-
project basis.
         (d)   Non-residential development activities which require a
sedimentation control permit and which are not required to use, or which do not
utilize for storm drainage purposes, a curb and gutter street system, shall not
exceed 36% built-upon area, on a project-by-project basis.
      (2)   Density built upon limitations; high density. The high density
option allows for a greater development density within the Lake Wylie Protected
Watershed Area, which equates to 24% to 70% impervious surface; provided,
engineered controls (structural BMPs) are used to manage storm water runoff.
Structural BMPs are required under the high density option. High density
development shall meet the requirements of this section, The City of Mount
Holly Zoning Ordinance, The City of Mount Holly Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, The Standard Detail of the City of Mount Holly and other
published standards of the City Planning and Zoning Department and Public
Utilities Department.

North Carolina registered professional engineer or landscape architect.
            2.   Structural BMPs shall be designed for specific pollutant
removal according to modeling techniques approved by the North Carolina
Division of Water Quality. Specific requirements for these systems shall be in
accordance with the design criteria and standards set forth by the City of
Mount Holly, The Standard Detail of the City of Mount Holly.
            3.   Qualifying areas of structural BMPs may be considered pervious
when computing total built upon area. However, if the structure is used to
compute the percentage built-upon area for one site, it shall not be used to
compute the built-upon area for any other site or area.
            4.   The design of the structural BMPs shall include the
appropriate easements for ingress and egress necessary to perform inspections,
maintenance, repairs and reconstruction.
         (c)   Installation of structural BMPs.

structural BMPs are required under the high density option for subdivisions,
the approval of the high density development permit will be subject to the
owner filing a surety bond or a letter of credit or making other financial
arrangements, which are acceptable to the City of Mount Holly in an amount to
be determined by the city in consultation with other agencies, such as the
North Carolina Division of Water Quality, in a form which is satisfactory to
the City Attorney, guaranteeing the installation and maintenance of the
required structural BMPs until issuance of certificates of occupancy for 75% of
all construction, which might reasonably be anticipated to be built within the
area which drains into the structural BMPs, allowing credit for improvements
completed prior to the submission of the final plat. Upon issuance of
certificates of occupancy for 75% of all anticipated construction, relative to
the required structural BMPs, written notice thereof must be given by the owner
to the City Engineer/City. The Public Utilities Department will arrange for an
inspection of the structural BMPs and if found satisfactory, will within 30
days of the date of notice notify the owner in writing.
            2.   Property other than subdivisions; civil penalties. Any person
who fails to install or maintain the required structural BMPs in accordance
with this chapter, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500.
No penalties shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has
been notified of the violation by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, or other means which are determined reasonable in giving actual
notice. The notice shall describe the violation with reasonable particularity,
specify a reasonable time period within which the violation must be corrected,
and warn that the failure to correct the violation within the time period will
result in the assessment of a civil penalty or further legal action. Each day
that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
         (d)   Maintenance responsibility of structural BMPs. For single-family
developments, BMPs that are constructed on privately-owned land and are not
within a public easement shall be maintained by a property owners association
or the owner of the subject property. BMPs that are constructed on public land
within public rights-of-way, and/or within public easements shall be maintained
by the public body with ownership/jurisdiction of the subject property.
            1.   Maintenance of structural BMPs shall be the responsibility of
the individual property owner.
            2.   (Reserved for maintenance covenants.)
            3.   (Reserved for storm water credit.)
         (e)   Future. The property owner may apply for a credit to the
property’s storm water fee according to the policies of the City of Mount Holly
Storm Water Ordinance to compensate for this responsibility. The property owner
will be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the structural BMPs. If, at
any time, the BMPs are not properly maintained, the credit will be suspended.
         (f)   Additional requirements. An occupancy permit shall not be issued
for any building or other structure, requiring such permit, within the
permitted development until the Public Utilities Department has approved the
structural BMP future or storm water control structure.
   (D)   MILWS-CA, Mountain Island Lake Watershed Critical Area Overlay
District.

         (b)   Non-residential development activities which require a
sedimentation control permit shall not exceed 24% built-upon area, on a
project-by-project basis.
         (c)   A healthy vegetative buffer provides for a stable land surface,
which absorbs rainfall, reduces heat reflection and noise and absorbs
pollutants, washing across the land. The City of Mount Holly can require
enhancement of the existing vegetation in the buffer if necessary so that the
buffer can effectively perform its filtering and absorption functions.
         (d)   Additional buffer requirements include:
            1.   A 100-foot vegetative buffer along the lake shoreline,
measured from “full pond” level or 648-foot elevation;
            2.   A 50-foot vegetative buffer along each bank of all perennial
streams;
            3.   No permanent structures or built upon areas shall be allowed
in the buffers;
            4.   Buffers shall be left in a natural state and no clearing or
grading in the buffer will be allowed, except on a limited conditional basis.
The removal of some native vines, shrubs, ground covers and small trees to
facilitate a better view or a more aesthetically pleasing natural landscape may
be allowed. This thinning operation must be done with hand tools and/or minimal
use of approved herbicides. No grubbing of tree stumps is allowed; however,
their removal with a stump grinding machine, which causes minimal soil
disturbance, is allowed. Natural leaf litter, hummus and soil should remain;
            5.   No trees larger than two-inch caliper are to be removed unless
dead or diseased;
            6.   Development within the buffer is limited to pervious,
recreational development and/or natural pedestrian trails and impervious common
area development only if the buffer area encroached upon is less than or equal
to 3% of the total project’s waterfront buffer. However, in no case shall any
development be allowed within 50 feet of the shoreline or bank. Impervious
structures such as driveways and boat houses on land are not permitted within
the buffer;
            7.   Water dependent structures and public projects such as roads
and greenway paths are allowed only where no practical alternative exists.
These projects should minimize built-upon surface areas, direct run-off away
from surface waters and maximize the use of non-structural BMPs;
            8.   All waterfront buffers shall be clearly marked with iron
stakes in cement markers, which shall not be removed. The buffer will be
clearly marked by flagging or fencing prior to any construction on the site;
            9.   Turf grass as a permanent landscape feature is prohibited in
the buffer area;
            10.   Septic tanks, drain fields and repair areas are not permitted
in the buffer;
            11.   No sediment basins, open channels or piped storm water is
allowed through the buffer. Drainage areas should be designed to allow water
sheet flow across the buffer; and
            12.   Walkway openings to provide access to the lake and dock areas
are allowed, but are limited to a maximum width of six feet. Pervious materials
should be used as base material or elevated boardwalks can be used. Paths
should be constructed to effectively control runoff and erosion.

sedimentation control permit shall not exceed 24% built-upon area, on a
project-by-project basis.
         (c)   Residential development activities which require a sedimentation
control permit and which are not required to use, or do not utilize for storm
drainage purposes, a curb and gutter street system, shall not exceed three
dwelling units per acre or, optionally, 36% built-upon area, on a project-by-
project basis.
         (d)   Non-residential development activities which require a
sedimentation control permit and which are not required to use, or which do not
utilize for storm drainage purposes, a curb and gutter street system, shall not
exceed 36% built-upon area, on a project-by-project basis.
         (e)   Notwithstanding the limitations of §
5.13(D)(2)(a), (D)(2)(b), (D)(2)(c) and (D)(2)(d) of this chapter, 10% of the
MILWS-PA area may be developed with new development projects of up to 70%
built-upon area as special intensity allocations (SIAs). SIAs shall be
allocated and developed in accordance with the following rules.
            1.   SIAs shall be allocated by the Zoning Administrator through
the zoning permit/Development Plan process. The Zoning Enforcement officer
shall maintain a record of the total acreage in the LWWS-PA area eligible for
SIAs, the acreage that has been allocated and the acreage that has been used as
of the latest date. In no case shall allocated acreage exceed the acreage
eligible for allocation. For the purposes of this subsection, the total area
that can be allocated for SIAs in the MILWS-PA is zero acres.
            2.   SIAs shall be allocated on a “first come, first served” basis
upon the approval and issuance of the appropriate permit; provided that, no SIA
shall be allocated to a development unless it is served by or is to be served
by City of Mount Holly water and sewer service.
            3.   The right to develop a SIA shall terminate with the loss of
the right to develop due to the expiration of a zoning permit, zoning permit
with vested rights, or building permit. In such a case, the allocated acreage,
or unused allocated acreage, shall be returned to the unallocated total acreage
eligible for allocation.
            4.   In no case shall the built-upon area of a SIA exceed the
built-upon limitations of the zoning district in which the SIA is located as
shown in this chapter.
   (F)   Density averaging.
      (1)   Legal authority. G.S. § 143-214.5 d2 permits density averaging in
the state.
      (2)   Definition and applicability. Density averaging is the transfer of
impervious development rights from one property to another, and involves two
noncontiguous parcels in the same water supply watershed. A local government
implementing a water supply watershed program shall allow an applicant to
average development density on up to two noncontiguous properties for purposes
of achieving compliance with the water supply watershed development standards
if all of the following circumstances exist:
         (a)   The properties are within the same water supply watershed. If
one of the properties is located in the critical area of the watershed, the
critical area property shall not be developed beyond the applicable density
requirements for its classification;
         (b)   Overall project density meets applicable density or stormwater
control requirements under 15A NCAC 2B .0200;
         (c)   Vegetated buffers on both properties meet the minimum statewide
water supply watershed protection requirements;
         (d)   Built upon areas are designed and located to minimize stormwater
runoff impact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated stormwater flow,
maximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas, and maximize the flow
length through vegetated areas;
         (e)   Areas of concentrated density development are located in upland
areas and, to the maximum extent practicable, away from surface waters and
drainageways;
         (f)   The property or portions of the donor properties that are not
being developed will remain in a vegetated or natural state and will be managed
by a homeowners' association as common area, conveyed to a local government as
a park or greenway, or placed under a permanent conservation or farmland
preservation easement unless it can be demonstrated that the local government
can ensure long-term compliance through deed restrictions and an electronic
permitting mechanism. A metes and bounds description of the areas to remain
vegetated and limits on use shall be recorded on the subdivision plat, in
homeowners' covenants, and on individual deed and shall be irrevocable;
         (g)   Development permitted under density averaging and meeting
applicable low-density requirements shall transport stormwater runoff by
vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable;
         (h)   A special use permit or other such permit or certificate shall
be obtained from the local Watershed Review Board, being the City of Mount
Holly Board of Adjustment, as authorized under §
12.10, to ensure that both properties considered together meet the standards of
the watershed ordinance and that potential owners have record of how the
watershed regulations were applied to the properties; and
         (i)   All parcels must be located within the planning and zoning
jurisdiction of the City of Mount Holly, and located within the Lake Wylie
Watershed Critical Overlay District or in the Lake Wylie Watershed Protected
Area Overlay District.
      (3)   Process.
         (a)   A pre-application meeting is required to go over the application
materials and any questions about the process.
         (b)   A City of Mount Holly watershed density averaging application
must be submitted with the following:
            1.   Surveys of both properties showing the current existing
impervious amount and maximum impervious amount;
            2.   Draft of revised property deeds;
            3.   Stormwater mitigation plan;
            4.   Draft of revised plats for the revised impervious allowances;
            5.   Draft of homeowner covenants (if applicable); and
            6.   Board of Adjustment fee.
         (c)   Once all submittal requirements are met, the request will be
heard by the Board of Adjustment (as the Watershed Review Board) at the next
available hearing.
         (d)   The Board of Adjustment must make written findings that the
proposed project meets the requirements set forth in §
12.12.
         (e)   If approved, the applicant shall submit two mylar maps for
recording and one paper copy of each plat for filing with the Planning
Department for final review.   
         (f)   Once approved, the mylars and the deeds for each parcel must be
recorded at the Gaston County Register of Deeds Office. As well, all decisions
rendered by the Board of Adjustment regarding density averaging cases (approved
and denied cases) will be filed in the Gaston County Register of Deeds via a
prepared order developed by city staff. The city will be responsible for
recording these orders and will charge a fee that is equal to the fee charged
by the Gaston County Register of Deeds to record deeds and other real estate
documents, which will be added to the application fee associated with density
averaging requests, and which will be paid by the applicant upon submittal.
         (g)   The Planning Department will issue a density averaging
certificate to the applicant, at which time the applicant can submit plans for
zoning and building permits.
         (h)   A copy of the density averaging certificate, including surveys,
recorded plat(s) deeds/property descriptions, and any documentation reflecting
the restrictions to the parcel that will remain undeveloped, will be forwarded
to the North Carolina Division of Water Quality.
         (i)   No change in the development proposal can be made unless the
certificate is amended by the Board of Adjustment.

proposed district, and a description of the boundaries of such district shall
be prepared by the Historic Preservation Commission and a recommendation
thereon made to the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, acting through
the State Preservation Officer or his or her designee, shall make an analysis
of and recommendations concerning such report and the description of proposed
boundaries. Failure of the Department of Cultural Resources to submit its
written analysis and recommendation to the city within 30 calendar days after a
written request for such analysis has been received shall relieve the city of
any responsibility for awaiting such analysis. The city may at any time
thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or amend this ordinance with

district shall comply with the regulations of the underlying zoning district,
except as follows.
      (1)   Residential structures erected in a historic district may use the
prevailing setback of structures on the same side of the street in accordance
with §
3.14 of this ordinance.
      (2)   All street setback (except as provided in division (C)(1) above),
interior setback, building coverage and height requirements shall comply with
applicable zoning regulations unless a special exception is approved by the
Board of Adjustment. The special exception shall be granted only if it complies
with the intent of the architectural and historic standards of the historic
district and if first recommended by the Historic Preservation Commission.
      (3)   Where the Historic Preservation Commission, in considering an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, shall find that the number of
off-street parking spaces and/or design standards for parking lots specified by
this ordinance would render the site incompatible with the historic district
design standards and the historic aspects of the district, it may recommend to
the Board of Adjustment a special exception to the provisions of the off-street
parking requirements and/or design standards. The Board of Adjustment may
authorize as a special exception a reduced standard concerning off-street
parking; provided, it finds:
         (a)   That the lesser standard will not create problems due to
increased on-street parking; and
         (b)   That the lesser standard will not create a threat to the public
safety.
   (D)   Certain changes not prohibited. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to prevent the following:
      (1)   The ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural
feature in a historic district which does not involve a change in design,
material or outer appearance thereof;
      (2)   The construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving
or demolition of any such feature if the Building Inspector or Zoning
Enforcement Officer has certified in writing to the Historic Preservation
Commission that such action is required to protect the public safety because of
unsafe or dangerous conditions; and
      (3)   The ordinary maintenance or repair of streets, sidewalks, pavement
markings, utility service lines, street signs, traffic signs and/or replacement
of street light fixtures in the event of equipment failure, accidental damage
or natural occurrences such as electrical storms, tornadoes, ice storms and the
like.
   (E)   Certificate of appropriateness required.
      (1)   A certificate of appropriateness shall be required for all
activities specified in this division (E) whether a building permit is required
or not.
      (2)   After the designation of a historic district, no exterior portion
of any building or other structure (including, but not limited to, masonry
walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement or other appurtenant
features), nor above ground utility structure, nor any type of outdoor
advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished
within such district until after an application for a certificate of
appropriateness as to exterior features has been submitted and approved by the
Historic Preservation Commission.
      (3)   For the purposes of this section, EXTERIOR FEATURES shall include
the architectural style, general design and general arrangement of the exterior
of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the
building material; the size and scale of the building; and the type and style
of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and other appurtenant fixtures. In
the case of outdoor advertising signs, EXTERIOR FEATURES shall be construed to
mean the style, material, size and location of all such signs. Such exterior
features may include historic signs, color and significant landscape,
archaeological and natural features of the area.
      (4)   The Historic Preservation Commission may impose standards as may be
set forth elsewhere in this section or adopted by the Commission. Any building
permit not issued in conformity with this section shall be invalid.
      (5)   The discontinuance of work or the lack of progress toward achieving
compliance with the certificate of appropriateness for a period of one year
shall render the certificate null and void and of no effect and application
shall be made for a new certificate. However, in the event the issuance of a
certificate is appealed, the one-year period shall not commence until a final
decision is reached regarding the matter.
      (6)   The Commission may, after adoption of architectural and historic
standards allow the Planning Director or his or her designee to review and
approve minor work; provided, however, that, no application for a certificate
of appropriateness may be denied without formal action by the Historic
Preservation Commission.
      (7)   The city and all public utilities, except as provided under
division (D) above, shall be required to obtain a certificate of
appropriateness prior to initiating in a historic district any changes in the
character of street paving, street width, utility installations or removals,
lighting, street trees, walls, fences, sidewalks or exterior of buildings or
structures on property or streets in which they have a fee or other interest.
   (F)   Application procedures.
      (1)   Application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made to
the Planning Department on forms provided. The application shall be filed no
later than 14 days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Historic Preservation Commission. Each application shall be accompanied by
sketches, drawings, photographs, specifications, descriptions and/or other
information of sufficient detail to clearly show the proposed move, exterior
alterations, additions, changes, new construction or demolition.
      (2)   The Planning Department staff shall make a reasonable attempt to
identify and notify the owners of surrounding property likely to be affected by
the application for a certificate of appropriateness. The Planning Department
shall transmit the application, together with the supporting information and
material, to the Historic Preservation Commission for consideration. The
Commission shall act upon the application within 60 days after the filing
thereof, otherwise failure to act upon the application shall be deemed to
constitute approval and a certificate of appropriateness shall prohibit an
extension of time where mutual agreement has been reached between the
Commission and the applicant.
      (3)   Prior to issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness,
the Historic Preservation Commission shall give the applicant and other
property owners likely to be affected by the application an opportunity to be
heard. In cases where the Commission deems necessary, it may hold a public
hearing concerning the application and seek the advice of the North Carolina
Department of Cultural Resources or other expert advice.
      (4)   The Commission shall not refuse to issue a certificate of
appropriateness except for the purpose of preventing the construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration or moving of buildings, structures,
appurtenant features or signs in the historic district which would be
incompatible with the architectural and historic standards.
      (5)   An appeal may be taken to the Board of Adjustment from the Historic
Preservation Commission’s action in granting or denying any certificate. The
appeal:
         (a)   May be taken by any aggrieved party;
         (b)   Shall be taken within 15 days after the decision of the
Commission; and
         (c)   Shall be in the nature of certiorari.
      (6)   Any appeal from the Board of Adjustment’s decision in any such case
shall be heard by the Superior Court of the county.
   (G)   Review criteria.
      (1)   In granting a certificate of appropriateness, the Historic
Preservation Commission shall take into account the historic or architectural
significance of the property under consideration and the exterior form and
appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to a structure.
      (2)   The Commission shall not consider interior arrangement.
      (3)   The provisions of this division (G) shall not become effective for
a historic district until after the Commission has adopted detailed
architectural and historic standards applicable to proposals within the
historic district. These criteria shall take into account the historic,
architectural and visual elements of the district and shall be reviewed a
minimum of every five years. At a minimum, the criteria shall contain standards
addressing the following factors.
         (a)   Historic significance or quality. The quality or significance in
history, architecture, archeology or culture present in districts, sites,
structures, buildings or objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship and feeling and association:
            1.   That are associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of local, state or national history; or that
are associated with the lives of persons significant in the past;
            2.   That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period
or method of construction;
            3.   That represent the work of a master or that possess high
artistic values; or
            4.   That represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or that have yielded, or may be
likely to yield, information important in prehistory or local, state or
national history.
         (b)   Exterior form and appearance. In considering exterior form and
appearance, the Commission may take into account, but is not limited to, the
following elements to ensure that they are consistent with the historic or
visual character or characteristics of the district:
            1.   Exterior features as described in division (E) above;
            2.   Height of the building or structure;
            3.   Setback and placement on lot of the building or structure,
including lot coverage and orientation;
            4.   Exterior construction materials, including textures, patterns
and colors;
            5.   Architectural detailing, such as lintels, cornices, brick
bond, foundation materials and decorative wooden features;
            6.   Roof shapes, forms and materials;
            7.   Proportions, shapes, positioning and locations, patterns, and
sizes of any elements of fenestration;
            8.   General form and proportions of buildings and structures;
            9.   Appurtenant fixtures and other features such as lighting;
            10.   Structural condition and soundness;
            11.   Use of local or regional architectural traditions; and
            12.   Effect of trees and other landscaping elements.
   (H)   Delay in demolition of landmarks and buildings.
      (1)   An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the
relocation, demolition or destruction of a designated landmark or a building,
structure or site within the district may not be denied, except as provided in
this section. However, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed
for a period of up to 365 days from the date of approval. The maximum period of
delay authorized by this division (H) shall be reduced by the Historic
Preservation Commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme
hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from
such property by virtue of the delay. During such period, the Commission shall
negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a
means of preserving the building or site. If the Commission finds that a
building or site within a district has no special significance or value toward
maintaining the character of the district, it shall waive all or part of such
period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.
      (2)   If the Historic Preservation Commission has voted to recommend
designation of a property as a landmark or designation of an area as a
district, final designation has not been made by the City Council, the
demolition or destruction of any building, site or structure located on the
property of the proposed landmark or in the proposed district may be delayed by
the Commission for a period of up to 180 days or until the City Council takes
final action on the designation, whichever occurs first.
      (3)   The City Council may enact an ordinance to prevent the demolition
by neglect of any designated landmark or any building or structure within an
established historic district. Such ordinance shall provide appropriate
safeguards to protect property owners from undue economic hardship.
      (4)   An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the
demolition or destruction of a building, site or structure determined by the
State Historic Preservation Officer as having statewide significance as defined
in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may be denied
except where the Historic Preservation Commission finds that the owner would
suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or
return by virtue of the denial.

Editor’s note:
   The district or districts in which a particular listed use may be permitted
is indicated by an “X” or an “S” in the district columns opposite the listed
use. The meanings of the entries in the table are as follows:
 
X    Indicates the use is permitted by right and a zoning permit may be obtained.
     Indicates the use requires approval of a special use permit in accordance with the
S    procedures described in §
     12.6 of this ordinance.
     The column labeled “Note” means that there are special additional performance
     requirements that the use must comply with in its development. These requirements
     are contained in
Note Chapter 7, “Special Requirement Notes to the Table of Uses”. For special uses, the
     requirements listed in the note for the particular use shall also represent the
     minimum conditions for issuance of a special use. For any other use subject to a
     note, the note requirement shall also represent the minimum conditions for
     issuance of any approval as part of the rezoning process.
 
NAICS Code is a classification within the North American Industry
Classification System. The NAICS System was developed for use by Federal
Statistical Agencies for the collection, analysis and publication of
statistical data related to the US Economy. The codes should be used when
identifying uses.
The listing of a use in the Table of Permitted and Special Uses in no way
relieves that use of having to meet all local, state and federal laws
pertaining to the establishment and operations of that use.
The City of Mount Holly recognizes that if a use listed or not listed in this
article is not found to have a definition in
Ch. 3 of this Ordinance, then the latest version of Merriam-Webster Dictionary
should be utilized to define said use.

§ 10.5 REQUIRED LANDSCAPING/BUFFER YARDS.
   Buffer yards are natural areas of specified widths that serve as a visual
screen between different zoning districts. Buffer yards shall be of different
types, based upon the relationship between the two land uses where the buffer
yard is to be located and may include natural plantings, a wall, fence or berm.
The width of the buffer yard and the density of plantings shall increase as the
difference in intensity between adjacent zoning districts increases. Minimum
buffer yard dimensions shall be measured horizontally; minimum buffer yard
widths shall be measured from the respective property line. Where buffer yards
turn at property corners, the length measurements determining plant quantities
shall not be required to overlap.
   (A)   Landscaping and buffer yard requirements. Screening and buffering
shall be required under the following situations:
      (1)   When a lot is:
         (a)   In an industrial district abuts a lot in a residential district,
screening must be provided on the Industrial lot in the form of a Type E
Screen/Buffer;
         (b)   In a commercial district abuts a lot in a residential district,
screening must be provided on the commercial lot in the form of a Type D
Screen/Buffer;
         (c)   In an office district abuts a lot in a residential district,
screening must be provided on the office lot in the form of a Type C Screen/
Buffer;
         (d)   In a residential district abuts another lot which contains a
multi-family development, screening must be provided on the lot containing said
multifamily development in the form of a Type C Screen/Buffer; or
         (e)   Containing a use subject to the issuance of a non-residential
SUP or CD that abuts a lot in residential district the approval body may
stipulate a version of Type A, B or C Screen/Buffer be provided on the SUP or
CD lot.
      (2)   (a)   When the front yard of a lot developed in an industrial
district is located directly across a public street from a residential
district; screening, at a minimum, must be provided on the industrial lot at a
minimum in the form of a Type B Screen/Buffer.
         (b)   In lieu of said screen, all principal and accessory structures
and off-street parking facilities must be set back in the front yard at least
100 feet from the edge of the road right-of-way.
      (3)   For open-air storage, or an unenclosed structure consisting of a
roof, but no walls used for storage of materials, products, wastes or equipment
associated with business or industrial uses located in any zoning district
within 100 feet of the street right-of-way, screening must be provided so as to
materially screen said storage or storage in the form of a berm, wall or fence
or an appropriate amount of natural plantings so as to provide the necessary
amount of screening.
      (4)   Except as provided herein, screening shall not be required between
any two lots which contain principal residential uses.
      (5)   Screening and buffering shall be provided as otherwise called for
in this ordinance.
      (6)   A minimum of Type A buffer shall be required for any non-
residential use abutting a residential district unless otherwise indicated in
this ordinance.
   (B)   Buffer yard composition standards. Buffer yard widths and landscaping
shall meet or exceed the following standards:

   (C)    Other buffer yard standards.
      (1)    Prohibited uses. The construction of any building or the placement
of any mechanical equipment within a buffer yard shall not be permitted, except
for equipment necessary for the provision of utilities. Active recreational
uses, such as ball fields, swimming pools and tennis courts or other active
structured recreational uses, or circulation drives or parking lots shall not
be allowed within the buffer yard area.
      (2)   Permitted uses. The following other uses may be permitted in a
buffer yard area provided that none of the required plant material is
eliminated, the intended screening is accomplished, the total width of the
buffer yard is maintained, and all other requirements of this chapter are met:
         (a)   Sculpture, outdoor furniture;
         (b)   Open space areas (provided that, none of the uses listed in
division (C)(1) above are located within the buffer yard area); and
         (c)   Walls, fences and driveways connecting to an adjoining property.
      (3)   Existing vegetation. Existing healthy vegetation may be counted
toward the required buffer yard. The landscape plan submitted for approval
shall indicate the number, type, size and location of such plant materials.
Existing vegetation that the Administrator deems “unhealthy” and not likely to
materially serve as a screening agent for the foreseeable future may be
disqualified as counting towards the required buffer.
      (4)   Application toward setback requirements. Buffer yard areas shall be
counted towards meeting applicable building setback areas.
      (5)   Standards for walls and fences. Fences used for buffering purposes
shall be constructed in a durable fashion with weather resistant wood and be of
consistent pattern. All materials used in the construction of a fence shall be
designed and intended for such use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Administrator may approve a buffer fence constructed of other materials;
provided, the materials and finish used will provide generally the same degree
of opacity, durability and aesthetic compatibility with adjoining residential
areas as weather resistant wood. A finished side of all walls or fences shall
face the common property line boundary. No wall or fence used as part of a
buffer shall be less than six feet or more than eight feet in height above
grade unless approved by the Administrator.
      (6)   Standards for berms. All berms shall be planted with both shrubs
and ground covers so as to leave no bare earth. All shrubs shall be a species
that can be expected to materially buffer the development site within five
years of planting. The slope of a berm shall be of a grade so that it is
suitable for maintenance and soil stability while taking into consideration the
type of plantings and ground cover that will be utilized, but in no case shall
a berm be less than three feet in height. The use of Pueraria lobata (kudzu)
for berm ground cover is not permitted, nor is any other nuisance veining
plants that have a tendency to spread to other properties.
      (7)   Location of buffer yard. With the exception of buffering required
for open storage any buffer yard required by this section shall be located
along the side and/or rear property lines of the lot(s) containing the use
subject to buffering. If buffering is required along the right-of-way, it shall
be located behind such right-of-way.
      (8)   Evergreen shrubs. For all buffer yards, at least 50% of the
required shrubs must be of an evergreen species.
      (9)   Interior plantings of parking lots.
         (a)   This requirement shall be met for all parking areas with more
than ten parking spaces.
         (b)   The parking lot shall be landscaped with canopy trees as
required by this section at the rate shown below. This requirement shall be
initiated by the initial use or development of the property. Canopy trees shall
be provided at a rate of one canopy tree for each ten parking spaces. After the
first two trees, any fractional remaining number of spaces over five shall
require one additional tree. Required canopy trees shall be distributed
throughout the parking area and shall be located within or adjacent to parking
lots as tree islands, at the end of parking bays, inside medians or between
rows of parking spaces. Canopy trees must be a minimum of ten feet in height
and two inches in diameter, measured six inches above grade a planting. When
mature, a canopy tree should be at least 50 feet in height and have a minimum
crown width of 30 feet. A list of approved tree species can be found in §
10.4 of this ordinance.
         (c)   In addition, in any case where ten parking spaces are added,
whether required or not, the entire parking lot including existing parking
areas shall be landscaped if the total number of parking spaces on the lot
equals more than ten parking spaces. Canopy trees must be planted directly
adjacent to parking areas or located in a parking lot planting strip. If a
parking lot planting strip is constructed, then the strip must be a minimum of
274 square feet with a minimum width of eight feet.
         (d)   If parking lot lighting is installed in a landscaped island,
then the lighting should be designed to accommodate the trees planted in the
island.
         (e)   The use of differing species around the parking area is
encouraged to promote diversity in the overall urban tree canopy. The use of
existing vegetation to satisfy this requirement is encouraged. Existing trees
may receive this credit however; they must meet the requirements stated above
for species and minimum diameter and height requirements. Supplemental
plantings may be required in addition to native materials.
      (10)   Street tree canopy.
         (a)   Developers shall plant canopy trees along all public and private
streets. The spacing of street trees will be in accordance with the three
species size classes listed in §
10.4 of this ordinance, and no trees may be planted closer together than the
following: small trees, 30 feet; medium trees, 40 feet; and large trees, 50
feet; except in special plantings designed or approved by a landscape
architect.
         (b)   The distance trees may be planted from curbs or curblines and
sidewalks will be in accordance with the three species size classes listed in §
10.4 of this ordinance, and no trees may be planted closer to any curb or
sidewalk than the following: small trees, two feet; medium trees, three feet;
large trees, four feet.
         (c)   No street trees shall be planted closer than 35 feet of any
street corner, measured from the point of nearest intersecting curbs or
curblines. No street tree shall be planter closer than ten feet of any fire
hydrant.
         (d)   No street trees other than those species listed as small trees
in §
10.4 of this ordinance may be planted under or within ten lateral feet of any
overhead utility wire, or over or within five lateral feet of any underground
water line, sewer line, transmission line or other utility.
         (e)   If street trees are part of the plan or tree preservation is
shown, then residential tree canopy may be waived upon review by the Planning
Director.
      (11)   Residential tree canopy.
         (a)   Each lot shall provide canopy trees selected from § 10.4 in
accordance with the following schedule:
 
Lot Size                 Required # of Canopy Trees
Less than 7,999 sq. ft.  1 front yard, 1 rear yard
8,000 - 20,000 sq. ft.   2 front yard, 2 rear yard
More than 20,000 sq. ft. 3 front yard, 3 rear yard
 
         (b)   The use of differing species to be planted in residential yards
is encouraged to promote diversity in the overall urban tree canopy. The use of
existing vegetation to satisfy this requirement is encouraged. Supplemental
plantings may be required in addition to native materials. Existing healthy
canopy trees over six inches in caliper may be counted towards fulfilling this
requirement; provided that, tree protection measures are used and maintained
during construction. If there is a question regarding the health of a tree that
cannot be resolved between the City of Mount Holly and the developer, the city
may require that the developer hire a certified arborist to examine the tree in
question. Required street trees may be counted towards the fulfillment of this
requirement. All other trees required under this division (C)(11) shall be
planted within the private lot.
         (c)   The developer shall submit a landscaping plan when said
developer submits any required plans for development which will take place
within the city limits or ETJ of the City of Mount Holly. A developer will not
receive any permits or plan approvals from the City of Mount Holly until they
have satisfied all provisions found within this ordinance.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996; Ord. passed 8-14-2023)
§ 10.6 PRESERVATION OF EXISTING VEGETATION DURING CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Protective barricades shall be placed around all trees designated to
be saved, prior to the start of development activities or grading.
   (B)   Protective barricades shall remain in place until development
activities are complete. The area within the protective barricade shall remain
free of all building materials, stockpiled soil or other construction debris.
Construction traffic, storage of vehicles and materials and grading shall not
take place within the protective areas of the existing trees.
   (C)   A tree protection plan shall be submitted with the landscape plan as
part of the construction documents showing how the trees will be protected from
the land disturbing activities.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 10.7 PLANTING STANDARDS.
   (A)   All new plant material shall be of good quality, installed in a sound,
professional manner and meet the standards set forth in the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) A300 standards. The contractor shall warrant all new
plant material for one year from time of installation.
   (B)   All trees shall be properly guyed or staked and mulched in accordance
with accepted practices in the landscape industry.
   (C)   Where large maturing trees are required and overhead utility lines
exist, small maturing trees planted one per 30 lineal feet shall be substituted
with the approval of the Planning Director.
   (D)   In no instance will the City of Mount Holly be responsible for the
maintenance of any vegetation unless such vegetation is located on property
owned by the City of Mount Holly. At installation, large maturing trees shall
not be less than ten feet in height with a minimum two-inch caliper. Small
maturing trees shall be a minimum of one and one-fourth inch caliper and have a
minimum height of eight feet. Installation and construction practices shall be
utilized which preserve and replace existing topsoil or amend the soil to
reduce compaction. New trees to be planted shall come from the list of approved
species found in §
10.4 of this ordinance. At installation, evergreen trees shall not be less than
eight feet in height with a minimum two-inch caliper.
   (E)   At installation, small shrubs shall be a minimum 18 inches in height
and medium or large shrubs a minimum of 30 inches. Installation and
construction practices shall be utilized which preserve existing topsoil or
amend the soil to reduce compaction.
   (F)   No plants shall be planted within the sight distance triangle at an
intersection, or driveway access points unless an unobstructed view between 30
inches and 84 inches of height is maintained.
   (G)   Existing vegetation may be applied toward the requirements of this
ordinance upon approval of the Planning and Development Director.
   (H)   A minimum of 50% of new trees must be native species, and sites with
more than 20 trees required will have to install multiple species pursuant to
the Tree Ordinance Guidelines.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 10.8 TREE CARE.
   (A)   Public tree care. The city shall have the right to plant, prune,
maintain and remove trees, plants and shrubs within the lines of all streets,
alleys, avenues, lanes, squares and public grounds, as may be necessary to
ensure public safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such
public grounds.
   (B)   Tree topping. It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any
person, firm or city department to top any street tree, park tree or other tree
on public property. TOPPING is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to
stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree’s crown to such a
degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely
damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or
other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be
exempted from this ordinance at the determination of the City Tree Board.
   (C)   Pruning, corner clearance. Every owner of any tree overhanging any
street or right-of-way within the city shall prune the branches so that such
branches shall not obstruct the light from any street lamp or obstruct the view
of any street intersection and so that there shall be a clear space of eight
feet above the surface of the street or sidewalk. Said owners shall remove all
dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs which constitute
a menace to the safety of the public. The city shall have the right to prune
any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the proper spread
of light along the street from a street light or interferes with visibility of
any traffic-control device or sign.
   (D)   Removal of stumps. All stumps of street and park trees shall be
removed below the surface of the ground so that the top of the stump shall not
project above the surface of the ground.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 10.9 REVISIONS TO APPROVED LANDSCAPE PLANS.
   Due to seasonal planting problems and/or a lack of plant availability,
approved landscape plans may require minor revisions. Minor revisions to
planting plans may be approved by the Planning and Development Department if:
   (A)   There is no reduction in the quantity of plant material;
   (B)   There is no significant change in size or location of plant materials;
and/or
   (C)   The new plants are of the same general category (i.e., shade tree,
ornamental tree, evergreen or shrub) and have the same general design
characteristics (mature height, canopy cover) as the materials being replaced.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 10.10 INSPECTION OF SITES.
   (A)   Planning and Development staff and authorized representatives of the
city may periodically inspect sites subject to the provisions of this
ordinance.
   (B)   If, through inspection, it is determined that a person has failed to
comply or is no longer in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, a
notice of violation shall be served upon that person by registered mail with
return receipt or other means by the city in compliance with the procedures in
G.S. § 160D-404(a). The notice shall set forth that which will be necessary to
comply with the ordinance.
   (C)   The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may
reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this
ordinance and for this purpose may enter at reasonable times upon the property,
public or private, for the purpose of inspecting the site(s) subject to the
provisions of this ordinance. No person shall refuse entry or access to any
staff or authorized representative, of the city who requests entry for the
purpose of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any
person obstruct, hamper or interfere with that representative while in the
process of carrying out official duties; provided, however, that, any staff or
authorized representative of the city shall secure either the appropriate
consent for inspection of areas not open to the public or will secure an
appropriate inspection warrant.
   (D)   A certificate of occupancy for the development shall not be issued
unless the landscaping required under this section is installed in accordance
with these standards and in accordance with the approved site plan or
subdivision plat.

Editor’s note:
   The purpose of this chapter is to avoid undue hardship by permitting the
continued use of any building, structure or property that was lawful at the
time of the enactment of this ordinance or any applicable amendment thereof
even though such use, structure or property does not conform to the provisions
of this ordinance. However, this chapter is also established to require that
non-conforming situations be terminated under certain circumstances.
§ 11.1 CONTINUATION OF NON-CONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   Non-conforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date
of this ordinance may be continued, subject to the restrictions and
qualifications set forth in §§
11.2 through
11.9 of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 11.2 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   Where the owners of a lot of record at the time of the adoption of this
ordinance or his or her successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land
to enable him to conform to the area or lot width requirements of this
ordinance, such lot may be used as a building site; provided, all other
dimensional requirements are met; and, provided that, the use to be made of the
property is not one to which larger than minimum lot area requirements are
called for in the list of permitted and conditional uses and the special
requirements.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 11.3 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NON-CONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   (A)   Except as specifically provided in this section, it shall be unlawful
for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent
of non-conformity of a non- conforming situation.
   (B)   Subject to division (D) below, a non-conforming use may be extended
through any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made non-
conforming by this ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to
accommodate such use. However, a non-conforming use may not be extended to
additional buildings or to land outside the original building.
   (C)   A non-conforming use may not be extended to cover more land than was
occupied, or manifestly designed and arranged to be occupied by that use when
it became non-conforming.
   (D)   The volume, intensity or frequency of use of property where a non-
conforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes
used at a location where a non-conforming situation exists may be changed if
these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity
rather than changes in kind and no violations of other divisions of this
section occur.
   (E)   Physical alteration of non-conforming structures or structures
containing a non- conforming use is unlawful if it results in:
      (1)   An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a non-
conforming use;
      (2)   Greater non-conformity with respect to dimension restrictions such
as yard requirements, height limitations or density requirements; and/or
      (3)   The enclosure of previously non-enclosed areas, even through those
areas are or were used in connection with the non-conforming activity.
   (F)   Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where non-
conforming situations exist is permitted and encouraged. Major renovation
(i.e., work estimated to cost more than 10% but less than 60% of the taxed
value of the structure to be renovated) may be done; provided that, the work
will not result in a violation of any other divisions of this section,
particularly division (E) above. In no case however shall work costing more
than 60% of the taxed value of the structure be done, singularly or
cumulatively, within any five-year period.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 11.4 RECONSTRUCTION PROHIBITED.
   (A)   Any non-conforming building or structure or any building or structure
containing a non- conforming use for which major repair or reconstruction is
proposed in any amount equal to 60% or more of the taxed value of the building
or structure or which has been damaged by any cause to an extent equal to 60%
or more of its taxed value shall only be repaired and/or reconstructed and used
as a conforming structure and a conforming use.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the above, a non-conforming residence and its related
accessory buildings, either jointly or singularly, may be reconstructed without
regard to the extent of damage in any case where the damage is caused by fire,
flood, act of nature or any other cause outside the control of the owner; and,
provided that, a permit for reconstruction is obtained within 180 days of such
damage.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 11.5 CHANGE IN KIND OF NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (A)   A non-conforming use may be changed to a conforming use. Thereafter,
the property may not revert to a non-conforming use.
   (B)   A non-conforming use shall not be changed to another non-conforming
use, except upon a finding by the Board of Adjustment that the use is more in
character with the uses permitted in the district than the previous use.
   (C)   If a non-conforming use and a conforming use, or any combination of
non-conforming uses, exist on one lot, the use made of the property may be
changed only to a conforming use.
   (D)   Conforming uses, except sexually-oriented businesses, may be
established or re-established in non-conforming buildings or structures;
provided that, off-street parking is provided as required by this ordinance and
provided no other provision of this ordinance for the establishment of new uses
is violated.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 11.6 DISCONTINUANCE OF NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (A)   When active operation or occupancy of a non-conforming use is
discontinued regardless of the purpose or reason for a consecutive period of
180 days, the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming
uses.
   (B)   For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a non-
conforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings,
activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as
a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a non-conforming
apartment building or one space in a non-conforming mobile home park for 180
days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space
thereafter so long as the apartment building or mobile home park as a whole is
continuously maintained. But, if a non-conforming use is maintained in
conjunction with a conforming use, cessation of operation or occupancy of the
non-conforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to
maintain it thereafter.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 11.7 DISCONTINUANCE OF NON-CONFORMING ADULT-ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of §
11.6 of this chapter, adult-oriented businesses shall be governed by the
following.
   (A)   Any adult-oriented business that fails to comply with the use and
location requirements of this ordinance, but which lawfully operating before
the effective date of this ordinance, shall not be deemed to be in violation of
this ordinance, but shall be a non-conformity. Any such business which ceases
active operation for a period of 30 days regardless of the purpose or reason
shall be subject to all the requirements of this ordinance and the property may
thereafter be used only for conforming uses.
   (B)   Any adult-oriented business lawfully operating as of the effective
date of this ordinance but which subsequently fails to comply with the use and
location requirements of this ordinance as the result of changes within the
vicinity or amendment to this ordinance, shall not be deemed to be in violation
of this ordinance, but shall be a non-conformity. Any such business which
ceases active operation for a period of 30 days regardless of purpose or reason
shall be subject to all the requirements of this ordinance and the property may
thereafter be used only for conforming uses.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 11.8 REPLACEMENT OF NON-CONFORMING MANUFACTURED HOMES.
   (A)   Homes may be placed and replaced in non-conforming manufactured home
parks so long as the manufactured home park retains its non-conforming status
and so long as the space was designed and arranged as a manufactured home space
prior to the adoption of this ordinance. Any such manufactured home shall meet
the definition of a manufactured home Class A or B.
   (B)   Individually established non-conforming manufactured homes may be
replaced; provided that, a Class A manufactured home shall only be replaced
with a Class A manufactured home; and, provided that, any other manufactured
home shall only be replaced with a Class A or B manufactured home.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 11.9 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   Any sign which does not conform to the provisions herein on the date of
enactment of this chapter shall be considered legally non-conforming. Such
signs shall not be enlarged or extended. Such signs may:
   (A)   Be repaired in accordance with §
11.4 of this chapter;
   (B)   Have their faces changed;
   (C)   Be replaced or reconstructed with similar materials; and
   (D)   Be relocated to another portion of the lot provided appropriate
standards are met.

§ 12.1 BOARD ESTABLISHED.
   There shall be and is hereby created a Board of Adjustment (hereafter
referred to as the “Board”), consisting of five regular members and four
alternate members, each to be appointed for three-year terms. In appointing the
original members or in the filling of vacancies caused by the expiration of the
terms of existing members, the City Council may appoint certain members for
less than three years so that the terms of all the members shall not expire at
the same time. Five regular members shall reside within the Mount Holly city
limits and be appointed by the City Council from the regular membership of the
Planning Commission. The Board shall also consist of four alternate members,
which shall be appointed from the remaining membership of the nine- member
Planning Commission. The length of terms and the manner of appointment for
members of the Board shall coincide with their terms on the Planning
Commission. Alternate members may attend all meetings of the Board, but shall
serve, participate and vote only in the absence of a regular member, except for
procedural matters as described in the Rules of Procedure. During the absence
of any regular member, an alternate member, regardless of his or her residency,
shall serve and may exercise all the powers and duties of a regular member.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 12.2 MEETINGS AND PROCEDURES.
   The Board shall adopt and abide by rules of procedure which shall govern the
meeting schedule, election of officers, voting, quorums, attendance and general
conduct of meetings. The rules of procedure shall be in accord with the North
Carolina General Statutes and shall be kept in the office of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer for public information. All meetings are open to the
public.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 12.3 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board shall hear and decide all matters upon which it is required to
pass under any statute or ordinance for special use and permits, requests for
variances, appeals of decisions of administrative officials charged with
enforcement of the ordinance, herein referred to as the Zoning Enforcement
Officer, and appeals as outlined in
Chapter 4, Buildings, and
Chapter 9, Housing, of the City of Mount Holly Code of Laws. The term DECISION,
as used in this section, includes any final and binding order, requirement or
determination. The Board shall follow quasi- judicial procedures in determining
appeals of administrative decisions, special use permits, certificates of
appropriateness, variances or any other quasi-judicial decision.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 12.4 NOTICE OF EVIDENTIARY HEARING.
   Notice of evidentiary hearings conducted, pursuant to this section, shall be
mailed to the person or entity whose appeal, application or request is the
subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the
hearing, if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all
parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing;
and to any other person entitled to receive notice as provided by the Zoning
Ordinance. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the city may rely on the
Gaston County tax listing to determine owners of property entitled to mailed
notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten days, but not
more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time
period, the city shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the
site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street of highway
right-of-way.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 12.5 FILING AND NOTICE FOR AN APPEAL.
   The Board shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order,
requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Enforcement Official,
the official charged with the enforcement of this ordinance. The Board may also
hear appeals arising out of any other ordinance that regulates land use or
development, pursuant to the conditions outlined in this section.
   (A)   Any person who has standing, as defined under G.S. § 160D-1402(c), may
appeal a decision to the Board. Appeals from the enforcement and interpretation
of this ordinance, shall be filed with the City Clerk, specifying the grounds
for the appeal.
   (B)   The Zoning Enforcement Official, who made the decision, shall give
written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the decision
and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the owner. The
written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail or by
first-class mail.
   (C)   The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the
written notice, within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing
to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source or constructive
notice of the decision, within which to file an appeal. In the absence of
evidence to the contrary, notice given pursuant to G.S. § 160D-403(b) by first-
class mail shall be deemed received on the third business day following deposit
of the notice for mailing with the United States Postal Service.
   (D)   It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to
appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing
the words, “zoning decision” or “subdivision decision”, in letters at least six
inches in height and identifying the means to contact a Zoning Enforcement
Official for information about the decision is prominently posted on the
property that is the subject of the decision, provided that the sign remains on
the property for at least ten days. Posting of signs is not the only form of
constructive notice. Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the
landowner or applicant. Verification of the posting shall be provided to the
official who made the decision. The posting of the property for constructive
notice is not a requirement of the ordinance, but it shall serve as a form of
constructive notice by following the procedures outlined herein.
   (E)   The Zoning Enforcement Official who made the decision shall transmit
to the Board all documents and exhibits constituting the record, upon which the
action appealed from is taken. The Zoning Enforcement Official shall also
provide a copy of the record to the to the appellant and to the owner of the
property that is subject of the appeal, if the appellant is not the owner.
   (F)   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays
all enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed
unless the Zoning Enforcement Official, who made the decision, certifies to the
Board after notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in
an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or because
the violation is transitory in nature, lasting a short-time or temporary, a
stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case,
enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed, except by a restraining order,
which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the
appellant may file with the Zoning Enforcement Official, a request for an
expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board shall meet to hear the appeal
within 15 days after such request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
appeals of decisions granting a development approval or otherwise affirming
that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance, shall not
stay the further review of an application for development approvals to use such
property; in these situations, the appellant or city may request and the Board
may grant a stay of a final decision of development approval applications,
including building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
   (G)   Subject to division (F) above, appeals shall be taken within times
prescribed by the Board. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of the appeal, give due notice thereof to the parties and decide it within a
reasonable time.
   (H)   The Zoning Enforcement Official, who made the decision, shall be
present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the
hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the city
would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the
notice of appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing. The Board may reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall
make any order, requirement, decision or determination that ought to be made.
The Board shall have all of the powers of the Zoning Enforcement Official who
made the decision.
   (I)   When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. § 160D-947, concerning the
designation of a landmark or historic district and certificate of
appropriateness, or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing
shall be based on the record below and the scope of review shall be as provided

appropriate conditions and safeguards, special use permits as authorized by the
district regulations in Ch. 6 of this ordinance. Reasonable and appropriate
conditions and safeguards may be imposed upon these permits by the Board.
   (B)   Any special use permit so authorized shall be perpetually binding upon
the property included in such permit unless subsequently changed or amended by
the Board, as provided for in this chapter.
   (C)   Minor modifications to special use permits that do not involve a
change in uses permitted or the density of overall development permitted may be
reviewed and approved administratively by the Zoning Enforcement Official. Any
other modification or revocation of a special use permit shall follow the same
process for approval as is applicable to the approval of a special use permit.
If multiple parcels of land are subject to a special use permit, the owners of
individual parcels may apply for permit modification so long as the
modification would not result in other properties failing to meet the terms of
the special use permit or regulations. Any modifications approved shall only be
applicable to those properties whose owners apply for the modification. If the
permit or any modification is approved, then the special use permit is required
to be recorded with the register of deeds by the applicant. Appeals of these
decisions shall be followed under §
15.6 of this ordinance.
   (D)   All decisions rendered by the Board of Adjustment regarding special
use permits (approved and denied cases) will be filed in the Gaston County
Register of Deeds via a prepared order developed by city staff. The city will
be responsible for recording these orders and will charge a fee that is equal
to the fee charged by the Gaston County Register of Deeds to record deeds and
other real estate documents, which will be added to the application fee
associated with special use permits, and which will be paid by the applicant
upon submittal.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996; Ord. passed 6-10-2024)
§ 12.7 VARIANCES.
   (A)   When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict
letter of the Zoning Ordinance, the Board shall vary any of the provisions of
the ordinance, upon a showing of all of the following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or general public, may not be the basis for granting
a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a
reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act, being 42 U.S.C. §§
3601 et seq., for a person with a disability;
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship; and
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose and
intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.
   (B)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by a variance.
Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance; provided that, the
conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other ordinance that
regulates land use or development may provide for variances consistent with the
provisions of this section.
   (C)   In granting the variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions
regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building,
structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this
ordinance.
   (D)   Minor modifications that do not require a variance by the Board of
Adjustment and are permitted by the Planning Department Director or designee
are as follows: when a lot of record as defined in §
3.4 of this ordinance with an existing structure constructed prior to the
adoption of this ordinance is subdivided that creates new lots that meet the
minimum lot size requirements, but the lot with the existing structure meets
the minimum lot size and not all of the setbacks. Appeals shall follow §
15.6 of this ordinance.
   (E)   All decisions rendered by the Board of Adjustment regarding variances
(approved and denied cases) will be filed in the Gaston County Register of
Deeds via a prepared order developed by city staff. The city will be
responsible for recording these orders and will charge a fee that is equal to
the fee charged by the Gaston County Register of Deeds to record deeds and
other real estate documents, which will be added to the application fee
associated with variances, and which will be paid by the applicant upon
submittal.

§ 12.8 VARIANCES FROM WATERSHED OVERLAY DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment may authorize variances from the specific
requirements of the Watershed Overlay Districts in the same manner and subject
to the same procedures and requirements of this chapter for authorizing other
variances; provided that:
      (1)   The notice required in §
12.4 of this chapter shall also be mailed by first class mail to all other
local governments having watershed regulation jurisdiction within the
particular watershed where the variance is requested and to each entity using
that water supply for consumption; and
      (2)   If the variance request is for a major variance as defined herein,
the following procedure shall apply. If the Board of Adjustment decides in
favor of granting the major variance, the Board shall then prepare a
preliminary record of the hearing and submit it to the North Carolina
Environmental Commission (EMC) for review and action. If the Board does not
decide in favor of granting the major variance such unfavorable action shall
constitute denial.
   (B)   In the event of favorable action by the Board on a major variance, the
Board shall cause the record of their hearing to be promptly submitted to the
EMC. The record of the hearing shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   The variance application;
      (2)   The hearing notice;
      (3)   The evidence presented;
      (4)   Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence and rulings on
them;
      (5)   Findings and exceptions; and
      (6)   The action of the Board including any conditions proposed.
   (C)   If the EMC approves the major variance or approves with conditions or
stipulations added, the EMC shall prepare a decision which authorizes the Board
of Adjustment to issue a final decision which would include any conditions or
stipulations added by the EMC. If the EMC denies the major variance, then the
EMC shall prepare a decision and transmit it to the Board of Adjustment. The
Board shall then prepare a final decision denying the major variance.
   (D)   All decisions rendered by the Board of Adjustment regarding variances
from watershed overlay district requirements (approved and denied cases) will
be filed in the Gaston County Register of Deeds via a prepared order developed
by city staff. The city will be responsible for recording these orders and will
charge a fee that is equal to the fee charged by the Gaston County Register of
Deeds to record deeds and other real estate documents, which will be added to
the application fee associated with variances from watershed overlay district
requirements, and which will be paid by the applicant upon submittal.

§ 12.9 INTERPRETING WATERSHED OVERLAY DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment, in addition to its authority in deciding
appeals, shall have the power to make adjustments to the exterior boundary of
Watershed Overlay Districts by removing all or part of a piece of property from
a Watershed Overlay District where it finds that all or part of such property
actually lies outside the drainage area of such watershed. In any case where
there is a dispute as to whether a property or any part of a property that is
shown on the Official Zoning Map as being in a Watershed Overlay District
actually drains to that watershed, the Board of Adjustment shall, upon appeal
by the owner, make a determination as to the facts of the matter as it affects
the subject property.
   (B)   In determining whether a property or part of a property drains to the
watershed as indicated on the map, the Board of Adjustment shall base its
determination on actual field conditions of the property as determined by
topographical conditions. In making its determination, the Board of Adjustment
may require the appellant to produce relevant expert testimony and exhibits.
After hearing such appeal, the Board shall find that the subject property (all
or part) is either in the designated watershed or out of the designated
watershed. If the Board shall find that the subject property is out of the
designated watershed, the Board shall order the map to be adjusted to show the
subject property to be outside the designated watershed. In making such order,
the Board of Adjustment shall designate the watershed in which the subject
property is located. If such designation causes the subject property to be
located in another Watershed Overlay District, the order shall cause the map to
be adjusted to show the same. Any such map adjustments shall be maintained and
reported as required by §
5.15 of this ordinance.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 12.10 WATERSHED DENSITY AVERAGING CREDITS.
    As authorized by G.S. § 143-214. 5, the Board of Adjustment, in addition to

12.9, respectively, shall have the authority to approve applications for
density averaging for the WS-IV Lake Wylie Protected and Critical Watersheds,
in accordance with §
5.15(F). All decisions rendered by the Board of Adjustment regarding density
averaging cases (approved and denied cases) will be filed in the Gaston County
Register of Deeds via a prepared order developed by city staff, per §
5.15(F)(3)(f). The city will be responsible for recording these orders and will
charge a fee that is equal to the fee charged by the Gaston County Register of
Deeds to record deeds and other real estate documents, which will be added to
the application fee associated with density averaging requests, and which will
be paid by the applicant upon submittal.

§ 12.11 ZONING PERMITS WITH VESTED RIGHTS.
   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide zoning permits with vested
rights in accordance with §
15.3 of this ordinance.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 12.12 VOTING.
   (A)   The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board shall be necessary to
grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any
other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of
certiorari. For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the Board and
members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter under G.S.
§ 160D-109(d) shall not be considered members of the Board for calculation of
the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take
the place of such members.
   (B)   A member of any board exercising quasi-judicial functions, pursuant to
this chapter, shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter in
a manner that would violate affected persons’ constitutional rights to an
impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations of due process include, but
are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter
that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close
familial, business or other associational relationship with an affected person
or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised
to a member’s participation and that member does not recuse himself or herself,
the remaining members shall, by majority vote, rule on the objection.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 12.13 DECISIONS.

a reasonable time. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent
material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision
shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Board’s determination of contested
facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision
shall be signed by the Chair or other duly authorized member of the Board. A
quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the
Clerk to the Board. The decision of the Board shall be delivered within a
reasonable time by personal delivery, electronic mail or first-class mail to

provide notice shall certify to the city that proper notice has been made, and
the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.
   (B)   The Board may continue an evidentiary hearing that has been convened
without further advertisement. If an evidentiary hearing is set for a given
date and a quorum of the Board is not then present, the hearing shall be
continued until the next regular Board meeting without further advertisement.
   (C)   (1)   Administrative materials. The administrator or staff to the
Board shall transmit to the Board all applications, reports and written
materials relevant to the matter being considered. The administrative materials
may be distributed to the members of the Board prior to the hearing if at the
same time they are distributed to the board a copy is also provided to the
appellant or applicant and to the landowner if that person is not the appellant
or applicant. The administrative materials shall become a part of the hearing
record. The administrative materials may be provided in written or electronic
form. Objections to inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials may be
made before or during the hearing. Rulings on unresolved objections shall be
made by the Board at the hearing.
      (2)   Presentation of evidence.
         (a)   The applicant, the city, and any person who would have standing
to appeal the decision under G.S. § 160D-1402(c) shall have the right to

competent, material and substantial evidence that is not repetitive as allowed
by the Board.
         (b)   Objections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary issues,
including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal or the standing of a
party, may be made to the Board. The Board Chair shall rule on any objections,
and the Chair’s rulings may be appealed to the full Board. These rulings are
also subject to judicial review pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1402. Objections based
on jurisdictional issues may be raised for the first time on judicial review.
      (3)   Appearance of official, new issues. The official who made the
decision or the person currently occupying that position, if the decision maker
is no longer employed by the city, shall be present at the evidentiary hearing
as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters
stated in a notice of appeal. If any party or the city would be unduly
prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of
appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing.

§ 12.16 SUBPOENAS.
   The Board of Adjustment making a quasi-judicial decision through the Chair,
or in the Chair’s absence, anyone acting as Chair, may subpoena witnesses and
compels the production of evidence. To request issuance of a subpoena, the
applicant, the city, and person with standing under G.S. § 160D-1402(c) may

witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The Chair shall issue requested
subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope,
and not oppressive. The Chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a
subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the Chair may be immediately
appealed to the full Board of Adjustment. If a person fails or refuses to obey
a subpoena, issued pursuant to this section, the Board of Adjustment or the
party seeking the subpoena may apply to the General Court of Justice for an
order requiring that its subpoena by obeyed, and the Court shall have
jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all proper parties.

§ 14.3 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION.
   (A)   The Director of Planning shall present any properly completed
application for amendment to the Planning Commission at its next regularly
scheduled meeting occurring at least ten days after filing of such application
with the Planning Department. At that meeting the Planning Commission shall set
a public hearing on the application at a future date not more than 45 days
after receipt of the application by the Commission. The Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment in accordance with its
rules of procedure. The Planning Director shall cause public notice to be made
as is required in accordance with the Commission’s rules.
   (B)   The Planning Commission shall either recommend in favor of an
amendment or in opposition to an amendment by simple majority vote of those
present and voting. The Commission may also propose conditions to their
recommendation. A tie vote on a proposal shall be considered to be in
opposition to such amendment. If the Planning Commission should fail to act on
any proposal within 30 days after it is first presented to the Commission such
failure to act shall be considered to be a favorable recommendation for the
purposes of this procedure.
   (C)   When conducting a review of proposed zoning text or map amendments
pursuant to this section, the Planning Commission shall advise and comment on
whether the proposed action is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has
been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The
Planning Commission shall provide a written recommendation to the governing
board that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate
by the Planning Commission, but a comment by the Planning Commission that a
proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not
preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the governing
board. If a Zoning Map amendment qualifies as a “large-scale rezoning” under
G.S. § 160D-602(b), the Planning Commission statement describing plan
consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and
policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the recommendation
made.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 14.4 CITY COUNCIL ACTION.
   (A)   The Planning Director shall present any proposed amendments and the
Commission’s recommendations to the City Council at its next regular scheduled
meeting at which it considers setting public hearings for zoning amendment
proposals. The Planning Director shall transmit to the City Council such
information from the action of the Planning Commission as, in his or her
opinion, constitutes the Board’s record on the proposed amendments.
   (B)   The City Council shall take such lawful action on such proposals as it
may deem advisable provided that no zoning amendment shall be adopted until
after a public hearing shall have been held and public notice given as required
by law.
   (C)   When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, the
governing board shall approve a brief statement describing whether its action
is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive plan. The
requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear
indication in the minutes of the governing board that at the time of action on
the amendment the governing board was aware of and considered the planning
board’s recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive
plan. If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed
inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect
of also amending any future land-use map in the approved plan, and no
additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. A
plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The plan
consistency statement is not subject to judicial review. If a zoning map
amendment qualifies as a “large-scale rezoning” under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the
governing board statement describing plan consistency may address the overall
rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted
plans were considered in the action taken.
   (D)   (1)   When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map
amendment, a statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning
shall be approved by the governing board. This statement of reasonableness may
consider, among other factors:
         (a)   The size, physical conditions and other attributes of the area
proposed to be rezoned;
         (b)   The benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors and
the surrounding community;
         (c)   The relationship between the current actual and permissible
development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be
permissible under the proposed amendment;
         (d)   Why the action taken is in the public interest; and
         (e)   Any changed conditions warranting the amendment.
      (2)   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a “large-scale rezoning”
under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the governing board statement on reasonableness may
address the overall rezoning.
   (E)   The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement
required by this section may be approved as a single statement.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 14.5 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS (CD).
   (A)   Application.
      (1)   Petitioning for a CD Zoning District is a voluntary procedure and
can be initiated by all owners of the property to be included. Every
application for the rezoning of property to a CD District shall be accompanied
by a site plan, drawn to scale containing all of the information outlined in
division (B) below. The Administrator shall schedule a meeting with the
applicant, prior to any public involvement meeting (PIM) being advertised and/
or held to review the rezoning application and site plan to make sure that it
meets, at a minimum, all minimum requirements of this ordinance. The timeline
will also follow the annexation policy adopted as part of the Comprehensive
Land Use Plan.
      (2)   Furthermore, no application shall be considered complete unless it
is accompanied by a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule approved by the
governing board for the submittal of an application for rezoning to a CD
District. Said fee shall be waived for any application submitted by any
official or agency acting on behalf of the City of Mount Holly or the State of
North Carolina.
      (3)   The Administrator may require the petitioner to submit more than
one copy of the rezoning application in order to have enough copies available
to circulate to other government agencies for review and comment. When dealing
with the conditional zoning district process, it may be desirable to request
additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship
to the surrounding area. Therefore, the Planning Commission and/or City Council
may request additional information [in addition to that required above], as
they deem necessary.
   (B)   Procedures.
      (1)   A pre-application meeting between the applicant and the
Administrator shall be required in order to familiarize the applicant of the
procedure for securing approval of a conditional zoning. The Administrator
shall accept no conditional zoning application for review without such meeting
having first occurred unless the Administrator determines that such meeting
would not serve any meaningful purpose and waives the meeting requirement.
      (2)   Procedures for application submittal are as follows:
         (a)   A complete conditional zoning application that is signed by the
applicant and which is accompanied by a submittal fee (in accordance with a fee
scheduled approved by City Council) shall be filed with the Administrator; and
         (b)   The application shall be accompanied by a drawing or plan, drawn
to scale, that includes or is accompanied by the following:
            1.   Name, address and phone number of the property owner (or his
or her agent) and the property identification number of the property (Note: the
property owner or his authorized agent are the only two parties who may
initiate a request for a conditional zoning.);
            2.   A boundary survey and vicinity map, showing the property’s
total acreage, general location in relation to adjoining streets, railroads
and/or waterways, date and north arrow. The zoning classification of the
property in question and contiguous properties shall also be shown (In lieu of
the boundary and survey maps, one or more up-to-date tax maps depicting the
area in question may be submitted. Any required drawing or depiction of the
proposed development or use shall not appear on the tax maps, but rather shall
appear on the drawing or plan.);
            3.   The name and addresses of all owners, tax parcel numbers and
existing land use(s) of all contiguous properties;
            4.   Proposed use of all land and structures including the number
of residential units proposed, if any, and total square footage of non-
residential development;
            5.   Location of all proposed structures, their approximate area
and exterior dimensions, height and proposed number of structures;
            6.   A description of all screening and landscaping required by the
Zoning Ordinance and/or proposed by the applicant; the delineation of any
wooded, landscaped or grassed areas existing prior to development and proposed
to remain on the property once the development is completed;
            7.   All existing easements, reservations and rights-of-way;
            8.   Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time for
the project;
            9.   Delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown
on the official Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood hazard
boundary maps for Gaston County;
            10.   Traffic, parking and circulation plans, showing the proposed
location and arrangement of parking spaces and ingress and egress to adjacent
streets;
            11.   A list, if any, of all additional development conditions or
standards that differ from those that would normally apply to that use. Only
conditions that exceed the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance minimum standards
can be considered and listed by the applicant;
            12.   The Administrator reserves the right to waive the depiction
of some or all of the information contained in divisions (B)(2)(b)5. through
(B)(2)(b)10. above when, in his or her opinion, such information is not a
requirement of this ordinance for the particular conditional use being
requested. Notwithstanding, if either the Planning Commission or City Council
determines that additional information as set forth in divisions (B)(2)(b)5.
through (B)(2)(b)10. above is needed to render a recommendation or decision on
the application, they may require the applicant to submit such additional
information; and
            13.   In lieu of showing all of the information in divisions (B)(2)
(b)5. through (B)(2)(b)11. above, the applicant may submit a general
development plan which shows on the proposed site, by land use type, the areas
to be developed for buildings and parking and shall show all points of ingress
and egress onto thoroughfares and collector streets.
   (C)   Public involvement meeting.
      (1)   Once the requisite number of complete applications has been
submitted to the Administrator and the requisite fees have been paid, and prior
to the public hearing on the rezoning request, a public involvement meeting
(PIM) shall be scheduled and held. Such meetings shall occur prior to any
recommendation by the Planning Board and approval by the City Council.
      (2)   The PIM is designed to provide a framework for creating a shared
vision with community involvement directed by the applicant in accordance with
the following requirements.
         (a)   The applicant shall provide an agenda, schedule, location and
list of participants such as landscape architects, engineers and the like to
answer questions from citizens and service providers for the PIM in cooperation
with the Administrator.
         (b)   It is recommended that the PIM last two to four hours, depending
on the nature of the proposed development and its location. A minimum of one
hour should be scheduled during normal business hours to allow service
providers and other public agencies (such as public works officials, NCDOT,
NCDENR, QNRC and the like) to participate as needed and to allow for citizens
to drop in at a convenient time throughout the period. It is recommended (but
not mandated) that this portion of the PIM take place at the proposed
development site. In addition, a second one-hour (minimum) meeting should be
scheduled at a conveniently located meeting site agreed upon by the applicant
and the Administrator. Notwithstanding the above, a PIM may last for different
amounts of time, depending on the nature of the development, its location and
the number of parties involved and/or attending the meeting.
         (c)   Notice of the PIM shall at a minimum, be given as follows.
            1.   A public notice shall be sent by the City of Mount Holly to a
newspaper having general circulation in the City of Mount Holly not less than
ten days or more than 25 days prior to the date of the PIM.
            2.   A notice shall be sent by first class mail by the City of
Mount Holly to the applicant and to the owners of all properties that lie in
Gaston County within 250 feet as measured from the exterior boundaries of the
proposed development and which are located within an annexation agreement
boundary that such city/town has with any other municipality. The applicant
shall furnish the City of Mount Holly with mailing labels that depict the names
and addresses of the owners of all properties within said 250-foot area. Such
notice shall be sent not less than ten days prior to the date of the PIM. The
notification shall contain information regarding the PIM time and location(s)
as well as a general description of the proposal.
            3.   With respect to division (C)(2)(c) above, the applicant shall
reimburse the City of Mount Holly for all postage and advertising expenses
incurred for such notifications.
            4.   A PIM notification sign shall be posted by the City of Mount
Holly in a conspicuous place at the property not less than ten days prior to
the PIM. The sign shall indicate date, time and location(s) of the PIM. In lieu
of any or all of this information to be contained on this posted notice, the
notice may give a phone number where interested parties may call during normal
business hours to get further information on the PIM.
      (d)   The Administrator will keep notes of comments received during the
PIM. A summary of the comments made shall be included in any staff report
prepared by the Administrator relative to the rezoning request. Following the
PIM, the applicant shall have the opportunity to make changes to the
application to take into account information and comments received. One or more
revised copies of the application shall be submitted to the Administrator for
review. No additional fee shall be required to be paid for making such changes
provided the Administrator receives the revised application within 30 days
following the PIM. If a revised application is not received during said 30-day
period, the Administrator shall review the original application submitted.
   (D)   Administrator approval. The Administrator shall have up to 30 days
following any revision of the application to make comments. If the
Administrator forwards no comments to the applicant by the end of any such 30-
day period, the application shall be submitted to the Planning Board for its
review without any further comment.
   (E)   Plans and other information to accompany petition.
      (1)   Every application for the rezoning of property to a CD District
shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale containing all of the
information outlined in division (B) above.
      (2)   Furthermore, no application shall be considered complete unless it
is accompanied by a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule approved by the
governing board for the submittal of an application for rezoning to a CD
District. Said fee shall be waived for any application submitted by any
official or agency acting on behalf of the City of Mount Holly or the State of
North Carolina.
   (F)   Public hearing notification requirements. Before any property is
rezoned to a CD District, the Planning Commission and City Council must hold a
legislative hearing after the public information meeting has been concluded.
Notification of the legislative hearing shall follow §
14.2(B) of this chapter.
   (G)   Planning Commission review. The Planning Board shall have at least 30
days to make a recommendation on the proposed change, said 30 days being
measured from the date of the date of initial referral of the amendment by
staff to the Planning Commission. If a recommendation is not made during said
time period, the application shall be forwarded to City Council without a
recommendation. Any such Planning Commission recommendation shall be
accompanied by statements that address:
      (1)   Whether the proposed amendment is consistent with any comprehensive
plan that has been adopted by the governing board and any other officially
adopted plan that is applicable;
      (2)   Other matters that the Planning Commission deems appropriate; and
      (3)   Why it considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the
public interest.
   (H)   Action by city. Conditional Zoning District decisions are a
legislative process subject to judicial review using the same procedures and
standard of review as apply to general use district zoning decisions. Once the
public hearing has been held, City Council shall take action on the petition.
The public hearing, once opened, can be continued to a later date and action
take at that time. City Council shall have the authority to:
      (1)   Approve the application as submitted;
      (2)   Deny approval of the application;
      (3)   Approve the application with modifications that are mutually agreed
to by the applicant and the governing board. Such conditions shall be in
compliance with division (F) above; and
      (4)   Submit the application to the Planning Commission for further
study. The Planning Commission shall have up to 30 days from the date of such
submission to make a report to the governing board. If no report is issued, the
governing board can take final action on the petition. City Council reserves
the right to schedule and advertise a new public hearing based on the Planning
Commission’s report.
   (I)   Conditions to approval of petition. In approving a petition for the
reclassification of a piece of property to a CD District, the Planning
Commission may recommend, and City Council may require, that reasonable and
appropriate conditions be attached to approval of the petition. Such conditions
shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and
use of the site to City of Mount Holly ordinances and plans adopted pursuant to
G.S. § 160D-501, or other plan and those that address the impacts reasonably
expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. The petitioner
will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional
requirements prior to approval or denial by the governing board. In no instance
shall any of these conditions be less restrictive than any requirements that
would otherwise pertain to that particular development if it were located in a
general or parallel conditional zoning district. Such conditions may exceed any
performance criteria or minimum requirements listed elsewhere in this ordinance
that pertain to that development. Statements that analyze whether the rezoning
is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and any other officially
adopted plan and other matters that the City Council deems appropriate and why
it considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest shall
be prepared and accompany each final decision relative to the CD rezoning
request.
   (J)   Effect of approval; Zoning Map designation. If a petition for a CD
District is approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed
by the predetermined ordinance requirements applicable to the district’s zoning
classification, the approved site plan for the district and any additional
approved rules, regulations and conditions, all of which shall constitute the
zoning regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as
an amendment to these regulations and to the Zoning Map and Future Land Use
Map. Following the approval of the petition for a CD District, the subject
property shall be identified on the Zoning Map by the appropriate district
designation followed by the letters “CD” (i.e., CD-RSF.) The Future Land Use
Map, as appropriate, shall also be updated if the approved request changes the
adopted map. Notwithstanding, the Administrator may make minor changes to the
approved site plan administratively without necessitating a need to rezone the
property to a different conditional district classification.

§ 15.1 ZONING ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
   This ordinance shall be administered and enforced by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer who shall be appointed by the City Manager. The Zoning Enforcement
Officer may appoint agents to act on his or her behalf. If the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall find that any of the provisions of this ordinance are
being violated, he or she shall notify the person responsible for such
violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action
necessary to correct it. He or she shall order discontinuance of illegal use of
land, buildings or structures; removal of illegal buildings or structures or
additions; alterations or structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any
illegal work being done; or shall take any other action authorized by this
ordinance to insure compliance with or to prevent violations of its provisions.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 15.2 ZONING PERMIT.
   No land shall be used or occupied and no building hereafter structurally
altered, erected or moved shall be used, or its use changed, until a zoning
permit shall have been issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer stating that
the building and/or the proposed use thereof complies with the provisions of
this ordinance. No building permit shall be issued and no building shall be
occupied until that permit is approved. A record of all permits shall be kept
on file in the office of the Zoning Enforcement Officer and copies shall be
furnished, on request, to any persons having a proprietary or tenancy interest
in the building erected. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall collect such fees
for the issuance of zoning permits as are authorized by the fee schedule as
adopted by the City Council. The issuance of a valid zoning permit shall confer
with it the right to undertake and complete the development and/or use of
property under the terms and conditions of such permit; provided that, such
action as authorized by the permit is commenced within 180 days of issuance;
and, provided that, all other permits are obtained. Otherwise, the permit shall
be void.
   (A)   Application procedure. Each application for a zoning permit shall be
accompanied by a plan in duplicate, drawn to scale, one copy of which shall be
returned to the owner upon approval. The plan shall show the following:
      (1)   The shape and dimensions of the lot on which the proposed building
or use is to be erected or conducted;
      (2)   The location of the said lot with respect to adjacent rights-of-
way;
      (3)   The shape, dimensions and location of all buildings, existing and
proposed, on the said lot;
      (4)   The nature of the proposed use of the building or land, including
the extent and location of the use, on the said lot;
      (5)   The location and dimensions of off-street parking and the means of
ingress and egress to such space; and
      (6)   Any other information which the Zoning Enforcement Officer may deem
necessary for consideration in enforcing the provisions of this ordinance.
   (B)   Right of appeal. If the zoning permit is denied, the applicant may
appeal the action of the Zoning Enforcement Officer to the Board of Adjustment
as provided for herein. Such appeal shall be made within 30 days of such permit
denial.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 15.3 ZONING PERMIT WITH VESTED RIGHTS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Procedure. In any case where the applicant for a zoning permit
desires to obtain a vested right, as authorized by G.S. § 160D-108, the
applicant shall observe the following procedures.
         (a)   The applicant shall submit to the Zoning Enforcement Officer a
copy of a site specific development plan drawn to scale describing with
reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for the specific parcel or
parcels of land.
         (b)   Such plan shall include:
            1.   The boundaries of the site;
            2.   Significant topographical and other natural features affecting
the development of the site;
            3.   The location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures
and other improvements;
            4.   The dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings
and other structures;
            5.   The location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on
the site, including water, sewer, roads and walkways; and
            6.   Such other information as the Zoning Enforcement Officer may
determine to be necessary in order to determine the specifics of the plan.
      (2)   Public hearing; notice thereof.
         (a)   Upon receipt of a properly prepared site specific development
plan, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall arrange to bring such plan before
the Board of Adjustment in the manner of a public hearing. Completed plans
shall be received a minimum of 25 days prior to the public hearing at which the
proposed vested rights plan is scheduled to be considered by the Board. Notice
of the public hearing shall be given in the same manner as that required for a
rezoning request.
         (b)   In considering an application for a zoning permit with vested
rights, the Board of Adjustment shall give due regard that the purpose and
intent of this ordinance shall be served, public safety and welfare secured and
substantial justice done. If the Board should find, after public hearing, that
the proposed permit should not be granted, such proposed permit shall be
denied.
         (c)   In granting such permit, the Board of Adjustment shall make the
following affirmative findings:
            1.   The use requested is among those listed as a permitted or
conditional use in the district in which the subject property is located or is
to be located and complies with all the requirements of this ordinance and
other applicable ordinances;
            2.   The requested permit is either essential or desirable for the
public convenience or welfare;
            3.   The requested permit will not impair the integrity or
character of the surrounding or adjoining districts, and will not be
detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the community; and
            4.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, sanitation and/or
other necessary facilities have been or are being provided.
         (d)   In granting a zoning permit with vested rights, the Board of
Adjustment may impose such additional restrictions and requirements upon such
permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this
ordinance are served, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.
Approval of a site specific development plan with the condition that a
variance, conditional use permit or modification be obtained shall not confer a
vested right unless and until the necessary variance, conditional use permit or
modification is obtained. If all requirements and conditions are accepted by
the applicant, the Board shall authorize the issuance of the permit, otherwise
the permit shall be denied. Any permit so authorized shall remain vested for a
period of two years from the date of the action granting the permit.
   (B)   Violations. Any violation of a term or condition involved in the
granting of a zoning permit with vested rights shall be treated the same as a
violation of this ordinance and shall be subject to the same remedies and
penalties as any such violation. In addition, the Board of Adjustment may,
after public hearing, revoke any such vested rights for failure to abide by any
such term or condition.
   (C)   Other ordinances apply. The establishment of a vested right shall not
preclude the application of overlay zoning which imposes additional
requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity or use, or
ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all
property subject to land use regulation, including, but not limited to
Building, Fire, Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Codes.
   (D)   Changes or amendments. No change or amendment to any permit with
vested rights shall be made, except after public hearing and except as provided
for in this ordinance for the original issuance of such permit. If, at the time
of consideration of proposed change or amendment to an existing permit, such
permit or proposed change or amendment could not be lawfully made under
ordinance conditions existing at that time, such proposed change or amendment
shall be denied. In addition, in no case shall there be an extension of the
two-year time period for which such development right is vested. Nothing herein
shall exempt plans related to such permit from subsequent reviews and approvals
to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval;
provided that, such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the
original approvals.
   (E)   Status at expiration of term. A right which has been vested shall
terminate at the end of the two-year vesting period with respect to buildings
and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed. Upon
issuance of a building permit, the provisions of G.S. §§ 160D-403 and 160D-1115
shall apply; except that, a building permit shall not expire or be revoked
because of the running of time while a vested right under this section is
outstanding. Any development constructed pursuant to a zoning permit with
vested rights for which the vested term has expired and which is not in
conformance with all the terms of this ordinance because of changes made in the
provisions of this ordinance, including the Zoning Map, after the issuance of
such permit shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance relating to
non- conformities the same as any other non-conformity.
   (F)   Annexation declaration. Any landowner who signs an annexation petition
to the city pursuant to G.S. §§ 160A-31 or 160A-58.1 shall, as part of that
petition, file a signed statement declaring whether or not vested rights with
respect to the property subject to the petition have been established under
G.S. § 160D-108. If the statement declares that such rights have been
established, the city may require petitioners to provide proof of such rights.
A statement which declares that no vested rights have been established by law
shall be binding on the landowner and any such vested right shall be
terminated.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 15.4 DUTIES OF ZONING ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT, COURTS AND
CITY COUNCIL TO MATTERS OF APPEAL.
   It is the intention of this ordinance that all questions arising in
connection with the enforcement of this ordinance shall be presented first to
the Zoning Enforcement Officer and that such questions shall be presented to
the Board of Adjustment only on appeal from the Zoning Enforcement Officer; and
that, from the decision of the Board of Adjustment, recourse shall be to courts
as provided by law. It is further the intention of this ordinance that the
duties of the City Council in connection with the ordinance shall not include
the hearing and passing upon disputed questions that may arise in connection
with the enforcement thereof, but the procedure for determining such questions
shall be as herein set out in the ordinance, and that the duties of the City
Council in connection with this ordinance shall be only the duty of considering
and passing upon any proposed amendment or repeal of the ordinance as provided
by law.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 15.5 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
    Violations of this ordinance shall subject the violation to the penalties
and remedies as set forth in § 10.99 of the Code of the City of Mount Holly.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996; Ord. passed 11-18-2024)
§ 15.6 MINOR MODIFICATIONS (ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENTS).
   These are administrative modifications to conditional zoning, special use
permits and other development approvals, which must follow standard practices
outlined in this ordinance.
   (A)   Changes to an approved site plan. Except as provided in division (B)
below, changes to an approved petition or to the conditions attached to the
approved petition shall be treated the same as amendments to these regulations
or to the zoning maps and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures
in this chapter.
   (B)   Administrative amendment process.
      (1)   Application for an administrative amendment. Any request for an
administrative amendment shall be pursuant to a written letter, signed by the
property owner, to the planning staff detailing the requested change. Upon
request, the applicant must provide any additional information that is
requested. Accompanying the letter shall be the applicable fee for
administrative review.
      (2)   Authority to approve an administrative amendment.
         (a)   The Planning Director or designee shall have the delegated
authority to approve an administrative amendment change to an approved site
plan. The standard for approving or denying such a requested change shall be
that the change does not significantly alter the site plan or its conditions
and that the change does not have a significant impact upon abutting
properties.
         (b)   Significant changes to an approved site plan that cannot be
considered through an administrative amendment include the following:
            1.   Increasing the number of buildings;
            2.   Increasing the number of dwelling units more than five units
or 10% of the total approved, whichever is less;
            3.   Adding driveways to thoroughfares;
            4.   Reducing parking spaces below the minimum standards;
            5.   Reducing buffers or yards;
            6.   Moving structures closer to adjacent properties in a
residential district or when abutting a residential use;
            7.   Reducing open space;
            8.   Changing owner occupied units to rental if noted on the site
plan; and
            9.   Increasing the mass of buildings.
         (c)   The Planning Director or designee, however, shall always have
the discretion to decline to exercise the delegated authority either because
the designee is uncertain about approval of the change pursuant to the standard
or because a rezoning petition for a public hearing and City Council
consideration is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If the Planning
Director or designee declines to exercise this authority, then the applicant
can only file a rezoning petition for a public hearing and Council decision.
   (C)   Staff decision, notifications, appeal process.
      (1)   Approval where there was a valid protest petition in effect on the
original rezoning petition.
         (a)   If an administrative amendment is approved, and a valid protest
petition was filed against the original petition on or after 1-1-2006 (even if
it was withdrawn), then the Planning Director or designee shall:
            1.   Send written notification of the approval to adjacent property
owners within 300 feet of the subject parcel (exclusive of rights-of-way);
            2.   Send written notification of the approval to neighborhood
leaders, as listed by the planning department, within one mile of the subject
site; and
            3.   Post a sign on the subject property, indicating that the staff
has granted an administrative amendment.
         (b)   Adjacent property owners within 100 feet (exclusive of rights-
of-way) have the right to file an appeal with the Planning Director or designee
within 30 days from the date of the written notification. The Zoning Committee

ARTICLE 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 16.1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has, in G.S. Ch. 143, Art.
21, Part 6; G.S. Ch. 160A; and G.S. Ch. 160D, Art. 8, delegated to local
governmental units the responsibility units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the City
Council of the City of Mount Holly, North Carolina, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.2 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Mount
Holly are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.4 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this ordinance are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets and bridges)
that are located in flood-prone areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.

damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure; provided that, the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure

state statutes.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.12 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration. Larger floods can and will occur. Actual flood heights may be
increased by human-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that
land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create
liability on the part of the City of Mount Holly or by any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or
any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.13 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
   Violation of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined
not more than $50 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both. Each day
such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein

when applicable, including an engineering report on the effects of the proposed
project on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the effects to
properties located both upstream and downstream; and a map (if not shown on
plot plan) showing the location of the proposed watercourse alteration or
relocation.
   (B)   Permit requirements. The floodplain development permit shall include,
but not be limited to:
      (1)   A description of the development to be permitted under the
floodplain development permit;
      (2)   The special flood hazard area determination for the proposed
development in accordance with available data specified in §
16.7 of this chapter;
      (3)   The regulatory flood protection elevation required for the
reference level and all attendant utilities;
      (4)   The regulatory flood protection elevation required for the
protection of all public utilities;
      (5)   All certification submittal requirements with timelines;

   (C)   Certification requirements.
      (1)   Elevation certificates.
         (a)   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is required prior to
the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit
holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
elevation of the reference level, in relation to mean sea level. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder prior to the
beginning of construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to
make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development
permit.
         (b)   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is required after the
reference level is established. Within seven calendar days of establishment of
the reference level elevation, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the
reference level, in relation to mean sea level. Any work done within the seven-
day calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at
the permit holder’s risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the
certificate data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be
corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further work being
permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
         (c)   A final as-built elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is
required after construction is completed and prior to certificate of
compliance/occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of final as-built
construction of the elevation of the reference level and all attendant
utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance or occupancy. (The FEMA elevation certificate is
optional for floodplain management elevation data, but recommended. The use of
the FEMA elevation certificate is required for the purchase of flood insurance
and mandatory for CRS participation.)
      (2)   Flood-proofing certificate. If non-residential flood-proofing is
used to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a flood-
proofing certificate (FEMA Form 81-65), with supporting data, an operational
plan, and an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual
start of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the flood-proofed
design elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in
relation to mean sea level. Flood-proofing certification shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and
certified by same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate
data, the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance plan.
Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant prior
to permit approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit.
Failure to construct in accordance with the certified design shall be cause to
withhold the issuance of a certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (3)   Elevation. If a manufactured home is placed within Zones A, AO, AE
or A1-30 and the elevation of the chassis is more than 36 inches in height
above grade, an engineered foundation certification is required in accordance
with the provisions of §
16.41(C)(2) of this chapter.
      (4)   Effects. If a watercourse is to be altered or relocated, a
description of the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation; a
professional engineer’s certified report on the effects of the proposed project
on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the effects to properties
located both upstream and downstream; and a map showing the location of the
proposed watercourse alteration or relocation shall all be submitted by the
permit applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit.
      (5)   Certification exemptions. The following structures, if located
within Zones A, AO, AE or A1-30, are exempt from the elevation/flood-proofing
certification requirements specified in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above:
         (a)   Recreational vehicles meeting requirements of §
16.41(F)(1) of this chapter;
         (b)   Temporary structures meeting requirements of §

      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (E)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (F)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this ordinance, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
ordinance.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25
per $100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a
record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and

variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation shall apply.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in §§
16.7 and
16.42 of this chapter, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions
of §
16.40 of this chapter, are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
16.5 of this chapter.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
16.5 of this chapter. Structures located in A, AE, AO and A1-30 Zones may be
flood-proofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of
elevation; provided that, all areas of the structure, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection
elevation are water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones,
the flood-proofing elevation shall be in accordance with §
16.45(B) of this chapter. A registered professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in
§
16.26(C) of this chapter, along with the operational and maintenance plans.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
16.5 of this chapter.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is
above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) below.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of flood waters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow flood waters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other
coverings or devices; provided, they permit the automatic flow of flood waters
in both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure; and
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction; and
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and has no permanently attached additions); or
      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
   (G)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures.
      (1)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages and the like)
are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the following criteria
shall be met.
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas).
         (b)   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled.
         (c)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential.
         (d)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood
waters.
         (e)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
the provisions of §
16.40(A) of this chapter.
         (f)   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in

16.40(D) of this chapter.
         (g)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation in conformance with the provisions of division (D)(3) above.
      (2)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet
that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or
flood-proofing certificate. Elevation or flood-proofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with §
16.26(C) of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.42 STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS.
   Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Approximate Zone A and
established in §
16.7 of this chapter, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been
provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
16.40 of this chapter, shall apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet
each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is
greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined based on the following criteria.
      (1)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be
elevated or flood-proofed in accordance with standards in §§
16.40 and
16.41 of this chapter.
      (2)   When floodway data is available from a federal, state or other
source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway areas
shall also comply with the requirements of §§
16.41 and
16.45 of this chapter.
      (3)   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such
base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance
with §
16.7 of this chapter and utilized in implementing this ordinance.
      (4)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be
elevated or flood-proofed (non-residential) to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
16.5 of this chapter. All other applicable provisions of §
16.41 of this chapter shall also apply.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.43 STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS WITH BFE BUT WITHOUT ESTABLISHED
FLOODWAYS OR NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available
from another source, but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are
identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report,
the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   Standards of §§
16.40 and
16.41 of this chapter; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.44 FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   (A)   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located
within the special flood hazard areas established in §
16.7 of this chapter. The floodways and non- encroachment areas are extremely
hazardous areas due to the velocity of flood waters that have erosion potential
and carry debris and potential projectiles.
   (B)   The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in §§
16.40 and
16.41 of this chapter, shall apply to all development within such areas.
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         (b)   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion
of the proposed encroachment.
      (2)   If division (B)(1) above is satisfied, all development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this ordinance.
      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision;
provided, the following provisions are met:
         (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
16.41(C) of this chapter; and
         (b)   The no encroachment standard of division (B)(1) above.
(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)
§ 16.45 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO).
   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
16.7 of this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These
areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate.
   (B)   In addition to §§
16.40 and
16.41 of this chapter, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
meet the following requirements.
      (1)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of four feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. A minimum of
four feet is recommended where a depth is not provided.
      (2)   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be flood-
proofed to the same level as required in division (B)(1) above so that the
structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that
level shall be water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is
required in accordance with §§
16.26(C) and 16.41(B) of this chapter.
      (3)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
