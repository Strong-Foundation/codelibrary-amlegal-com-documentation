may have an appeal to the next term of Granville County Superior Court; but if
the valuation so made be paid to the owner, or lodged in the hands of the Clerk
of the Superior Court, the land so valued shall vest in the city so long as it
may be used for the purpose of the same, and the appeal shall not hinder or
delay said Board of Commissioners in opening such street or erecting such
improvement; provided, that in case of the discontinuance of the use of the

(Ord. passed 7-8-86)
DIVISION 3:  BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
§ 2-461  CODE OF ETHICS.
   (A)   General principles underlying the Code of Ethics.
      (1)   The stability and proper operation of democratic representative
government depends upon public confidence in the integrity of the government
and upon responsible exercise of the trust conferred by the people upon their
elected officials.
      (2)   Governmental decisions and policy must be made and implemented
through proper channels and processes of the governmental structure.
      (3)   Elected officials must be able to act in a manner that maintains
their integrity and independence, yet is responsive to the interests and needs
of those they represent.
      (4)   Elected officials must always remain aware that at various times
they play different roles:
         (a)   As advocates, who strive to advance the legitimate needs of
their citizens;
         (b)   As legislators, who balance the public interest and private
rights in considering and enacting ordinances, orders, and resolutions; and
         (c)   As fair and impartial decision makers, when making quasi-
judicial and administrative determinations.
         (d)   Elected officials must know how to distinguish among these
roles, to determine when each role is appropriate, and to act accordingly.
      (5)   Elected officials must be aware of their obligation to conform
their behavior to standards of ethical conduct that warrant the trust of their
constituents. Each official must find within his or her own conscience the
touchstone by which to determine what conduct is appropriate.
   (B)   Code of Ethics.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this code of ethics is to establish
guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for board members and to provide
guidance in determining what conduct is appropriate in particular cases. It
should not be considered a substitute for the law or for a board member’s best
judgment.
      (2)   (a)   Board members should take care to obey all laws that apply to
their official actions as board members. Board members should be guided by the
spirit as well as the letter of the law in whatever they do.
         (b)   At the same time, board members should feel free to assert
policy positions and opinions without fear of reprisal from fellow board
members or citizens. To assert that a board member is behaving unethically
based upon a disagreement with that board member based on a question of policy
(and not on the board member’s ethical behavior) is unfair, dishonest,
irresponsible, and itself unethical.
         (c)   The Board shall endeavor to keep itself up-to-date, through its
attorney or other sources, of new or on-going legal or ethical quandaries or
difficulties that they may face in their official positions.
      (3)   (a)   Board members should act with integrity and with independence
from improper influence as they exercise the functions of their offices.
         (b)   Board members should use their best independent judgment to
pursue the common good as they see it, presenting their opinions to all in a
reasonable, forthright, consistent manner. They should be incorruptible, self-
governing and not subject to improper influence, while at the same time being
able to consider the opinions and ideas of others.
         (c)   At the same time, however, board members should recognize that
they are part of a larger group and should act accordingly. They should respect
their office and not behave in ways that reflect badly on it. They should treat
other board members and the public with respect, and should honor the opinions
of others even when they disagree. They should recognize that they are not
generally authorized to act on behalf of the Board, since the Board must take
official action as a body.
      (4)   (a)   Board members should avoid impropriety in the exercise of
their official duties. Their official actions should be above reproach. A board
member is considered to be acting with impropriety if a reasonable person who
was made aware of the relevant facts surrounding the board member’s action
would conclude that the action was inappropriate.
         (b)   If a board member concludes that his or her actions, while legal
and ethical, may be misunderstood, he or she may seek the advice of the Board’s
attorney. He or she may also state on the record the facts of the situation and
the steps taken to resolve it.
      (5)   (a)   Board members should be faithful in the performance of the
duties of their offices. They should act as the especially responsible citizens
whom others can trust and respect. Board members should not engage in
communications outside the meeting in quasi-judicial matters.
         (b)   Board members should be faithful in their attendance at meetings
and in their preparation for those meetings. They should carefully analyze all
credible information that is provided to them.
         (c)   As a group of citizens to whom much has been entrusted, the
Board should demand full accountability from those over whom it has authority.
The Board should set a good example for others in the community, keeping in
mind that trust and respect must continually be earned.
         (d)   Board members should be willing to bear their fair share of the
Board’s workload. To the extent appropriate, they should be willing to put the
Board’s interests ahead of their own.
      (6)   (a)   Board members of local governing boards should conduct the
affairs of their boards in an open and public manner. They should comply with
all applicable laws governing open meetings and public records, recognizing
that doing so is an important way to be worthy of the public’s trust. This
recognition includes sensitivity to those matters recognized by law. The Board
should remember when meeting that they are conducting the public’s business.
They should also remember that the records of their local government belong to
the public and not to them or their employees. They should make clear that a
climate of openness is to be maintained at all times in their governmental
units.
         (b)   In order to insure strict compliance with the laws governing
openness, governing board members should strive to be transparent and act with
candor. They should prohibit unjustified delay in fulfilling public records
requests. They should take deliberate steps before they go into closed session
for any reason, to insure that the closed session will be lawful and that the
closed session does not stray from the purpose for which it was called.
   (C)   Censure procedures.
      (1)   If the elected Board has reason to believe that one of its board
members has violated a provision of this code of ethics, it may open an
investigation into the matter. All information compiled, including the grounds
for the finding of probable cause, shall be shared with the board member when
it is received. All information pertaining to the case shall be open to public
inspection and copying pursuant to the North Carolina public records statutes.
      (2)   Should the Board determine, by a two-thirds majority, that it
wishes to proceed further with censure proceedings, it shall call for a quasi-
judicial hearing at a regular meeting or at a special meeting convened for that
purpose. Notice of the hearing stating its time, place, and purpose shall be
published twice in two separate calendar weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation or shall be advertised for the same amount of time on the
jurisdiction’s website. The notice shall state that a detailed list of the
allegations against the board member is available for public inspection and
copying in the office of the city clerk.
      (3)   The hearing shall be convened at the time and place specified. Any
and all votes during the hearing and any deliberations that follow shall be
taken by the ayes and noes and recorded in the Board’s minutes. The hearing and
any deliberations shall be conducted in open session in accordance with the
requirements of the North Carolina open meetings statutes. The rules governing
the hearing shall be those that apply to a standard quasi-judicial hearing. For
purposes of illustration but not limitation, the accused board member shall
have the right to have counsel present to present and cross-examine expert and
other witnesses, and to offer evidence, including evidence of the bias of any
board member or presiding officer. An audio or video and audio tape of the
proceedings shall be prepared.
      (4)   (a)   The accused board member shall have the right to challenge
the participation of any other board member or the presiding officer based on
bias or self-interest. If such a challenge is made, the Board shall immediately
hear evidence and vote on the challenge. Neither the accused board member nor
the board member whose participation is challenged may vote, although both may
offer evidence. The challenge shall be decided by a majority vote of those
present and voting, a quorum being present.
         (b)   Under both the city and the county voting statutes, persons may
be excused from voting on matters involving their own financial interest or
official conduct when there is a legal basis for being, or requirement to be,
excused from voting. See G.S. §§ 160A-75 and 153A-43, respectively. Persons
should identify and disclose these matters in advance so the Board can
determine whether there is a conflict allowing a person to be excused by the
Board from voting. A censure proceeding is a matter involving a member’s
official conduct, and the member accused in the proceeding should not take part
in any votes that take place. Since a censure proceeding is a quasi-judicial
matter, board members should also be excused from voting if they are
impermissibly biased in the matter under consideration. This is the basis for
excusing members other than the person who is being directly accused.
      (5)   Once the hearing is concluded, it shall be closed by vote of the
Board. The presiding officer shall next entertain a motion to adopt a non-
binding resolution censuring the board member based on specified violations of
the code of ethics. Any motion made must be an affirmative one in favor of
adopting a non-binding resolution of censure. If the motion or resolution does
not state particular grounds for censure under the code of ethics, the
presiding officer shall rule it out of order.
      (6)   If a motion to adopt a non-binding resolution of censure stating
particular grounds under the code of ethics has been made, the Board shall
debate the motion. The accused board member and any other board members who
have been removed from participation because of bias or self-interest may
remain present, but shall not be allowed to participate in the debate. At the
conclusion of the debate, the board members shall vote, except for the accused
board member and any other board members who have been removed from
participation. If the motion is approved by a two-thirds vote of those present
and voting, a quorum being present, the motion is approved and the non-binding
resolution of censure is adopted.
      (7)   The non-binding resolution of censure shall be made a part of the
minutes of the Board. Any recording of the Board’s quasi-judicial proceedings
shall be approved by the Board as a permanent part of the Board’s minutes. The
proceedings shall then be considered concluded, the Board having done all that
it legally can with respect to the matter in question.
   (D)   Legal enforcement.
      (1)   Local governing boards have no legal power to bring criminal or
other charges against each other, or otherwise to control each other’s behavior
directly. At the same time, the Board expects that individual board members
will probably wish to behave in a manner that is both legal and ethical. For
example, board members will want to take care to be familiar with some of the
more common ethics-related criminal violations with which they might be charged
by the district attorney, and they should take care to avoid common pitfalls.
      (2)   The UNC School of Government offers the following legal rules  that
also relate to ethical principles to help meet this need. Local governing board
members should consider legal restrictions in terms of behavior that they
should avoid. While requirements found in the law should be viewed as a minimum
standard, board members should always consider whether there are ethical
problems with other behavior, even if it does not violate crirninal or other
statutes dealing with conflicts of interest or other subjects.
         (a)   Avoid deriving a direct benefit from contracts in which you are
involved in making or administering on behalf of the public agency. (G.S. § 14-
234(a)(1); criminal penalty; note defined terms in the statute: direct benefit,
involved in making or administering a contract).
         (b)   Avoid attempting to influence others who are involved in making
or administering a contract on behalf of the public agency, even if you aren’t
involved, if you will derive a direct benefit from the contract. (G.S. § 14-234
(a)(2); criminal penalty; note defined terms in the statute: direct benefit,
involved in making or administering a contract).
         (c)   Avoid soliciting or receiving any gift or reward in exchange for
recommending, influencing, or attempting to influence the award of a contract
by the public agency you serve. (G.S. § 14-234 (a)(3); criminal penalty).
         (d)   Consider the ethical and practical consequences of deriving a
direct benefit from a contract that is authorized under any exception to the
statute, and weigh these considerations against the potential advantage to the
public agency and to yourself. Follow reporting requirements to ensure
transparency. (G.S. § 14-234 (b); (d)(l)).
         (e)   Avoid participating in deliberations about or voting on a
contract in which you have a direct benefit, when the contract is undertaken as
allowed under any exception to the statute. (G.S. § 14-234 (b)(l); criminal
penalty).
         (f)   Avoid using your knowledge of contemplated action by you or your
unit, or information known to you in your official capacity and not made
public, to acquire a financial interest in any property, transaction, or
enterprise, or to gain a financial benefit that may be affected by the
information or contemplated action. Avoid intentionally aiding another to do
any of these things. (G.S. § 14-234.1; criminal penalty.)
         (g)   Avoid receiving any gift or favor from a current, past, or
potential contractor. (G.S. § 133-32(a); criminal penalty.)
         (h)   Consider the ethical and practical consequences of accepting a
gift or favor under any exception to the statutory prohibition, and follow
reporting requirements to ensure transparency. (G.S. § 133-32(d)).
         (i)   Avoid voting on matters involving your own financial interest or
official conduct. (G.S. §§ 160A-75; 153A-44.) Disclose the existence of the
direct financial interest in advance, and, when in doubt, obtain an opinion
from your local attorney about whether you must vote or may be excused.
         (j)   Avoid voting on any zoning map or text amendment where the
outcome of the vote is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and
readily identifiable financial impact on you.
         (k)   Do not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter,
including matters that come before the Board when acting in a quasi-judicial
capacity under G.S. §§ 160A-388 or 153A-345, if participation would violate
affected persons’ constitutional right to an impartial decision-maker.
Impermissible conflicts under this standard include having a fixed opinion
prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex
parte communications, a close familial, business, or other associational
relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of
the matter. (G.S. §§ 160A-381(d), 160A-388(e1), 153A-340(g), 153A-345(e)(1);
violation of constitutional standard by one board member invalidates the entire
vote).

§ 5-150  PURPOSE.
   (A)   The city enacts the following article to allow for the city to enter
into long-term reimbursement agreements for developments greater than 100
acres, which may or may not be within the city limits or ETJ of the city, and
hereby finds the following:
      (1)   Large-scale development projects often occur in multiple phases
extending over a period of years, requiring a long-term commitment of both
public and private resources;
      (2)   Because of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects
often require careful integration between public capital facilities planning,
financing, and construction schedules and the phasing of the private
development;
      (3)   Because of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects
involve substantial commitments of private capital by developers, which
developers are usually unwilling to risk without sufficient assurances that
public resources will remain available through the extended period of the
development and that the public resources provided are constructed according to
the standards maintained by the city; and
      (4)   That it is in the public interest of the citizens of the city to
participate, to the extent allowed by law, in the development of properties
that have the potential of providing employment and other economic benefits to
the city and its citizens.
   (B)   This article is supplemental to the powers conferred upon the city and
does not preclude or supersede rights and obligations established pursuant to
other laws regarding building permits, site-specific development plans, phased
development plans, or other provisions of law.
(Ord. 07-06-02, passed 6-12-07)
§ 5-151  DEFINITIONS.
   For purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPER.  A person or other legal entity, including a governmental agency
or redevelopment authority, who intends to undertake any development and who
has a legal or equitable interest in the property to be developed.
   DEVELOPMENT.  The planning for or carrying out of a building activity, the
making of a material change in the use or appearance of any structure or
property, or the dividing of land into two or more parcels. DEVELOPMENT, as
designated in a law or development permit, includes the planning for and all
other activity customarily associated with it unless otherwise specified. When
appropriate to the context, DEVELOPMENT refers to the planning for or the act
of developing or to the result of development. Reference to a specific
operation is not intended to mean that the operation or activity, when part of
other operations or activities, is not development. Reference to particular
operations is not intended to limit the generality of this item.
   GOVERNING BODY.  The Board of Commissioners of the city.
   LAWS.  All ordinances, resolutions, regulations, comprehensive plans, land
development regulations, policies, and rules adopted by a local government
affecting the development of property, and includes laws governing permitted
uses of the property, density, design, and improvements.
   LOCAL GOVERNMENT.  The City of Oxford.
   PUBLIC FACILITIES.  Major capital improvements, including, but not limited
to sanitary sewer and potable water systems and facilities.
(Ord. 07-06-02, passed 6-12-07)
§ 5-152  AUTHORIZATION.
   The city is hereby authorized to enter into a written reimbursement
agreement pursuant to this article with a developer for the development of
property, provided the property contains 100 acres or more of developable
property (exclusive of wetlands, mandatory buffers, unbuildable slopes, and
other portions of the property which may be precluded from development at the
time of application). Reimbursement agreements shall be of a term specified in
the agreement, provided they may not be for a term exceeding 20 years. Nothing
contained herein shall obligate the city to enter into such agreements and such
agreements shall be entered into only at the request of the developer. A simple
majority vote of the Board of Commissioners, after a public hearing, shall be
required for approval.
(Ord. 07-06-02, passed 6-12-07)
§ 5-153  PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED.
   Before entering into a reimbursement agreement, the city shall conduct a
public hearing on the proposed agreement. The notice for the public hearing
must specify the location of the property subject to the reimbursement
agreement, the development uses proposed on the property, and must specify a
place where a copy of the proposed reimbursement agreement can be obtained. The
developer shall reimburse the city for all costs associated with the public
hearing and advertisement.
(Ord. 07-06-02, passed 6-12-07)
§ 5-154  REQUIREMENTS OF AGREEMENT.
   (A)   A reimbursement agreement shall at a minimum include all of the
following:
      (1)   A legal description of the property subject to the agreement and
the names of its legal and equitable property owners;
      (2)   The duration of the agreement. However, the parties are not
precluded from entering into subsequent reimbursement agreements that may
extend the original duration period;
      (3)   The development uses permitted on the property and a general
description of the nature and extent of the proposed uses;
      (4)   A description of the public facilities that will service the
development, including who provides and maintains the facilities, the date any
new public facilities, if needed, will be constructed, and a schedule to assure
public facilities are available concurrent with the impacts of the development;
and
      (5)   A description of any other conditions, terms, restrictions, or
other requirements determined to be necessary by the local government for the
public health, safety, or welfare of its citizens.
   (B)   A reimbursement agreement may provide that the entire development or
any phase of it be commenced or completed within a specified period of time.
The reimbursement agreement must provide a development schedule, including
commencement dates and interim completion dates at no greater than five-year
intervals; provided, however, the failure to meet a commencement or completion
date shall not, in and of itself, constitute a material breach of the
development agreement pursuant to G.S. § 160A-400.27, but must be judged based
upon the totality of the circumstances. The reimbursement agreement may include
other defined performance standards to be met by the developer or any of its
contractors. The developer may request a modification in the dates as set forth
in the agreement. Consideration of a proposed major modification of the
agreement shall follow the same procedures as required for initial approval of
a reimbursement agreement.
   (C)   If more than one local government is made party to an agreement, the
agreement must specify which local government is responsible for the overall
administration of the development agreement.
   (D)   The reimbursement agreement also may cover any other matter not
inconsistent with this section.
(Ord. 07-06-02, passed 6-12-07)
§ 5-155  LAW IN EFFECT AT TIME OF AGREEMENT GOVERNS; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Unless the reimbursement agreement specifically provides for the
application of subsequently enacted laws, the laws applicable to development of
the property subject to a reimbursement agreement are those in force at the
time of execution of the agreement.
   (B)   In the event state or federal law is changed after a reimbursement
agreement has been entered into and the change prevents or precludes compliance
with one or more provisions of the reimbursement agreement, the local
government may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change
in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the reimbursement
agreement, by ordinance after notice and a hearing.
(Ord. 07-06-02, passed 6-12-07)
§ 5-156  REVIEW BY THE CITY.
   (A)   During any period of time in which a reimbursement agreement is
active, the city shall review the development at any and all times that the
city deems necessary to ensure compliance with the agreement. The city shall
notify the developer in writing of its findings if in the discretion of the
City Manager or City Engineer, a breach of the agreement has occurred, the
developer must be required to demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms
of the development agreement.
   (B)   If, as a result of a review, the city finds and determines that the
developer has committed a material breach of the terms or conditions of the
agreement, the city shall serve notice in writing, within a reasonable time
after the periodic review, upon the developer setting forth with reasonable
particularity the nature of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding
and determination, and providing the developer a reasonable time in which to
cure the material breach.
   (C)   If the developer fails to cure the material breach within the time
given, then the local government unilaterally may terminate or modify the
reimbursement; provided, the notice of termination or modification may be
appealed to the Board of Adjustment in the manner provided by G.S. § 160A-388
(b).
(Ord. 07-06-02, passed 6-12-07)
§ 5-157  MISCELLANEOUS.
   (A)   A reimbursement agreement may be amended or canceled by mutual consent
of the parties to the agreement and may not be assigned without the prior
written consent of the city.
   (B)   In the event that any of the obligations of the city in the
reimbursement agreement constitute debt, the city shall comply, at the time of
the obligation to incur the debt and before the debt becomes enforceable
against the city, with any applicable constitutional and statutory procedures
for the approval of this debt. The agreement shall be signed by the City
Attorney, City Finance Director, and the City Manager. The total debt incurred
shall be secured by the developer by a letter of credit or other security
deemed acceptable to the Board of Commissioners.
   (C)   No member of the Board of Commissioners may vote on a reimbursement
agreement if it is reasonably likely that the agreement or development would
have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the
member.

ARTICLE II:  PRIVILEGE TAX
§ 13-26  PURPOSE.

purposes. The general policy of the city is to require payment of the maximum
tax permitted for the privilege of owning or operating a qualifying business
within the corporate limits of the city.
   (B)   A license issued pursuant to this article is only evidence that the
appropriate tax has been paid and does not constitute regulatory approval and
does not excuse a licensee from compliance with any other applicable ordinance,
regulation or statute. The issuance of a license hereunder does not reflect
that the recipient is in compliance with any applicable local, state or federal
regulation or law, other than this article, or that the recipient is otherwise
engaged in a legal activity or operating a business in a legal manner.
   (C)   The issuance of a license under this article does not authorize the
carrying on of a business for which additional licenses or qualifications are
required by state or local law, nor does the issuance of a license prevent the
city from enacting additional regulations applicable to the licensee.
   (D)   This article does not prevent the city from imposing license taxes on
additional business activities, from increasing or decreasing the amount of any
license tax or from regulating any business taxed.

§ 13-39  ADMINISTRATOR’S AUTHORITY; DUTIES OF BUSINESS OWNER.
   (A)   Providing notice to an applicant or licensee. Whenever this article
requires the Administrator to give a written statement or notice to an
applicant or a licensee, he or she may do so in any one of three ways, each of
which shall be presumed to constitute actual notice:
      (1)   By personally delivering the notice to the applicant or licensee;
      (2)   By mailing the notice by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the address specified for that purpose in the licensee
application or to the last known address; and
      (3)   By causing the notice to be served on the applicant or licensee in
accordance with the procedures for service or process under Rule 4, North
Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (B)   Investigations by the Tax Collector.  If the Administrator has reason
to believe that a person is conducting a business in violation of this article,
the Administrator is hereby authorized to conduct an investigation to determine
the person’s tax liability. The results of the investigation shall be deemed
confidential and shall be conducted in keeping with sound business and
investigatory practices.
   (C)   Duty to keep books.  Any person who conducts a business taxed under

liability to be accurately conducted. If a person fails to keep books and
records as required, the Administrator or designee shall make a determination
of the applicant’s tax liability from the information available which the
determination may be based on information imputed to the person or business..
   (D)   Duty to permit inspection.  Each person who conducts business in the
city shall permit the Administrator or designee to inspect the business
premises during normal business hours to determine the nature of the business
conducted there and to examine the books and records to determine the nature
and amount of business transacted.
   (E)   Administrator to issue license; payment of tax a prerequisite.  After
receipt of the completed application, and a determination by the Administrator
that the license should be issued, the Administrator shall determine the amount
of tax due and notify the applicant of that amount. The Administrator shall not
issue a license until the tax is paid.
   (F)   Display of license.  Every license issued by the city must be
prominently displayed at the place of business of the licensee named therein.
Failure to post this license shall raise the presumption that no such license
exists or that the same is expired. If there is no regular place of business,
the licensee must keep the license wherever the business is being operated and
in a place where it can be seen and inspected. If a machine or other item of
personal property is the subject of the license, the license shall be affixed
to the machine or item.
(Ord. 09-03-02, passed 3-10-09)
§ 13-40  DUTY TO NOTIFY ADMINISTRATOR OF CHANGES.
   (A)   Change in the business during the tax year.
      (1)   Information change.  A licensee under this article shall report a
change in the information contained in the license application to the
Administrator within ten days after the change occurs. If information shown on
the license itself is affected thereby, the licensee shall surrender the
license to the Administrator when reporting the change. The Administrator will
reissue a license reflecting the change of name or address.
      (2)   Change affecting amount due.  If changes affect the amount due, the
Administrator shall reissue a separate or additional license reflecting the
change upon payment of the additional tax. The license shall be subject to
cancellation for failure to comply with this article.
      (3)   Duplicate copy.  Upon satisfactory proof that the current license
has been lost or destroyed, the Administrator will furnish a duplicate license
at a cost to be determined by the city. Any other duplication of a license
shall constitute a Class 3 misdemeanor which shall be punishable as provided in
§
13-99 .
   (B)   Notice of discontinuation, sale or transfer of business.  Any person
who sells, transfers or goes out of business, shall give notice of the same to
the Administrator at least 48 hours prior to the date of the pending sale,
transfer or termination of business.
(G.S § 105-366(d))
      (1)   Transfer.  All licenses issued hereunder are non-transferable and
any transferee or successor of the licensee shall be required to obtain a
license prior to the commencement of business.

refundable.

13-99
§ 13-41 REASONS FOR REFUSAL OR REVOCATION.
   (A)   The Administrator or designee shall refuse to issue or shall revoke a
license required by this article for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   The applicant misrepresents a fact relevant to the amount of tax
due or the qualifications for a license;
      (2)   The applicant refuses to provide information necessary to compute
the amount of tax due; and
      (3)   The applicant fails or refuses to provide all information required
in the application.
   (B)   Upon the revocation of any license, it shall be unlawful for the
person to whom the license was granted to continue to conduct the business.
   (C)   The Administrator or designee shall revoke a license for reason set
forth in this section. However, before the Administrator or designee may revoke
a license, he or she shall give the licensee written notice of the grounds of
revocation, pursuant to §
13-39(A).
(Ord. 09-03-02, passed 3-10-09)  Penalty, see §
13-99
§ 13-42  TAX DISPUTED AND/OR UNQUALIFIED APPLICANTS; RIGHT TO CONFERENCE.
   (A)   At the time as the Administrator or designee believes that a reason
exists for refusing to issue or revoking a license based on the amount of tax
due or pursuant to §
13-41, the Administrator shall send notice of refusal or revocation to the
applicant or licensee. The notice shall specify the amount of tax due, the
section of this article upon which the tax calculation is based, the amount of
tax paid, any interest due, the balance owed, the manner and time period in
which the person may respond to the notice of deficiency, and the consequences
to the person if he or she fails to respond. If the applicant or licensee
disagrees with the determination, he or she may request a hearing within ten
days after the day on which notice is served. The request must be in writing
and shall specify the applicant’s objections to the matters set forth on the
notice. By way of illustration, but not limited to, an applicant who receives a
notice may object on the following grounds:
      (1)   That the tax due has already been paid;
      (2)   The Administrator miscalculated the amount of tax due;
      (3)   The Administrator based the calculation on incorrect or
insufficient information concerning either the nature or the amount of business
conducted; and
      (4)   The Administrator based the determination on an erroneous
interpretation of a section of this article that establishes a category of
business subject to a particular tax.
   (B)   The conference shall be held within 30 days from receipt of objections
and no action may be taken by the Administrator with respect to the application
or license within that time period. If the applicant fails to request a
conference, the determination becomes final and the Administrator shall proceed
to take necessary actions to resolve or collect the deficiency. (See §§
13-41 through
13-44)
   (C)   If the Administrator revokes or refuses to issue a license, the
applicant may reapply for a license at any time thereafter. If the reason for
which the application was refused no longer exists, and if no other reason
exists for refusing to issue a license, the Administrator shall issue the
license.
   (D)   The Administrator shall maintain a record of each conference held
pursuant to this article for a period of three years. The record shall contain
the name of the applicant or licensee, the date of the conference and a brief
statement of the issues discussed and the results reached. After three years,
the Administrator shall dispose of the record pursuant to G.S. § 121-5.
(Ord. 09-03-02, passed 3-10-09)
§ 13-43  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAX.
   If a person begins or continues to engage in a business taxed under this
article without payment of the required privilege license tax, the
Administrator may use any of the following methods to collect the unpaid tax.
   (A)   Garnishment and levy remedies.  The Administrator may propose the sale
of tangible personal property (levy) or attach wages, rents, bank deposits and
other compensation (garnish) to eliminate any delinquent license taxes in
accordance with G.S. §§ 105-368 and 160A-207. The remedies of levy and sale of
real and personal property of the taxpayer within the city in the same manner
and to the same extent as apply to taxes levied by the state pursuant to G.S. §
105-109(d) and as per the provisions of G.S. § 105-242.
   (B)   Criminal remedies.  Conducting business within the city without having
paid the privilege license tax imposed by this article, without a valid license
issued pursuant to this article, or without posting a license pursuant to §
13-39(G), is a Class 3 misdemeanor, punishable as provided in §
13-99. Each day that a person conducts business in violation of this article is
a separate offense.
   (C)   Equitable remedies.  In addition to the criminal remedies set forth in
division (B) above and pursuant to G.S. § 160A-175(d), the city may seek an
injunction against any person conducting a business in violation of this
article.
   (D)   Payment.  Any person who commences or continues to conduct a business
taxed under this article without payment of the tax is liable for the
additional tax as defined in §
13-99. No license shall be granted until the tax plus the additional tax has
been paid.
(Ord. 09-03-02, passed 3-10-09)
§ 13-44  LICENSEE’S REMEDIES.
   (A)   Assertions of valid defense.  A licensee may obtain a release or
refund of a tax if he or she can demonstrate a valid defense to the enforcement
of the collection of any tax levied in this article and shall proceed as
provided in this section:
      (1)   A valid defense shall include the following:
         (a)   A tax imposed through clerical error;
         (b)   An illegal license; and
         (c)   A license levied for an illegal purpose.
      (2)   If the license tax has been paid, the licensee, at any time within
three years after the license became due or within six months after the date of
payment, whichever is later; may request a refund of the license by submitting
to the Board of Commissioners a written statement of his or her defense and a
request for a refund thereof.
   (B)   Action of governing body. Upon receiving a licensee’s written
statement of defense and request for release or refund, the Board of
Commissioners shall, within 90 days after receipt of the request, determine
whether the licensee has a valid defense to the license imposed or any part
thereof and shall either release or refund that portion of the amount that is
determined to be in excess of the correct license liability or notify the
licensee in writing that no release or refund will be made. The action of the

declares by resolution that the public convenience and necessity require the
proposed taxicab service.
   (B)   In determining whether the public convenience and necessity require
for the operation of a taxicab for which application for a certificate is made,
the Board shall consider and investigate:
      (1)   Whether the demands of the public require additional taxicab
service;
      (2)   The adequacy of existing mass transportation and taxicab service;
      (3)   The financial responsibility and experience of the applicant;
      (4)   The ability of the applicant to earn a fair return on the capital

used;

      (7)   Whether the additional taxicab service will result in a greater
hazard to the public; and
      (8)   Other relevant facts as the Board may deem advisable or necessary.
   (C)   After declaring that the public convenience and necessity require the
proposed taxicab service, the Board shall grant the certificate subject to the
conditions as the Board may deem that public convenience and necessity require
and provided that no certificate shall be granted if:
      (1)   The applicant has been convicted of a felony against the state or

phrases shall have the following meanings.
      GOLF CART. A vehicle designed and manufactured for operation on a golf

must have a valid issued registration.

and a completed waiver of liability, releasing the city from liability that may
arise as a result of operation of a golf cart inside the city limits. These
documents must be in the golf cart at all times while in operation on public
roads.
      (3)   All golf carts must meet the requirements or minimum standards of
safety equipment as set forth above in this section.
      (4)   All golf cart operators must present a valid driver’s license while
operating a golf cart on a public road.
      (5)   The registration sticker shall be valid for no more than one year
and must be visible on the golf cart.
