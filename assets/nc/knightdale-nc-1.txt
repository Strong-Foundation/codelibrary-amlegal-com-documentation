CHAPTER 155

The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact: 
Section 1. - [Incorporation and general powers.]
That the Town of Knightdale in the county of Wake be and the same is hereby
incorporated by the name and style of "Knightdale," and it shall be governed by
and subject to all provisions of law now existing in reference to incorporated
towns and not inconsistent with this act.
Section 2. - [Boundaries.]
That the boundaries of said town of Knightdale shall be determined as follows:
Beginning at the southeast corner of the Knightdale school property, on
Fayetteville Street, and runs north six degrees, forty-five minutes east four
thousand feet to the northeast corner of S. A. Watson's lot on Griffin Street;

Dillon Gin property; thence south thirty degrees east two thousand two hundred
and ten feet to a point, W. O. Johnson's land; thence north fifty-nine degrees
fifty-five minutes east twelve hundred and fifty feet to the beginning.
Section 3. - [Officers—established.]
That the officers of said town shall be a mayor, treasurer, constable and five
aldermen.

That B. L. Wall shall be mayor of said town and N. G. House, J. F. Keith, L. A.
Doub, J. T. Ramsey and C. L. Robertson shall be aldermen and are hereby

elected by the mayor and board of aldermen. The officers hereby appointed shall
hold office until their successors shall be elected in an election to be held
in said town on the second Tuesday in May, one thousand nine hundred and
twenty-eight, and every two years thereafter when the qualified voters of said
town shall elect a mayor and five aldermen who shall qualify and take office on
the first Monday in June next succeeding their election.
Section 5. - [Officers—qualification.]
That the officers appointed in this act shall qualify within ten days from its

Section 6. - [Officers—authority.]
That said mayor and aldermen shall make such rules, ordinances, regulations and
laws as may be necessary for proper government of said town and shall have and
may exercise all such rights and authority as are allowed incorporated towns
under the general law.
Section 6.1. - Conditional Use Districts.
In addition to the powers granted to the Town in G.S. 160D-702 et seq., the
Town may provide for the creation of conditional use zoning districts.
It is the purpose and intent of this section to permit the Town to create,
through the legislative process, both general use districts, in which a variety
of uses are permitted, and conditional use district, in which limited uses are
permitted only upon approval by the Town.
A person petitioning for rezoning of a tract of land where conditional use
districts are authorized by ordinance, may elect to request a general use
district or a conditional use district for the tract. If the petitioner elects
to petition for the general use zoning, and if the petition is approved, the
rezoned property may be used for any of the uses permitted in the applicable
general use district. If the petitioner elects to petition for uses which are
intended for the property specified in the petition. If the petition is for
conditional use district zoning, the Town is to approve or disapprove the
petition on the basis of the specific use or uses requested.
Section 6.2. - Site Plans.
The Town Council may as part of its zoning regulations required that a site
plan be submitted, and approved prior to the issuance of a building permit for
new construction, excluding renovation and repair of existing structures, and
excluding accessory uses and their structures, unless such renovations and
repairs and accessory uses shall cause an increase in the off-street parking
requirement or a change in occupancy as occupancy is defined by the North
Carolina Building Code. Such local law shall specify the elements to be
included in site plans submitted for approval in accordance with standards of
zoning code; such elements may include, where appropriate, those relating [to]
of off-street parking, driveway access, internal circulation, screening, signs,
landscaping, architectural features, locations and dimensions of buildings,
topography and grading, utilities, drainage structures, street and sidewalk
improvements, loading and service areas, fire hydrants, and such other elements
as may reasonably be related to the health, safety, and general welfare of the
community. Where appropriate, approval of site plans may be conditioned to
include requirements that street and utility rights-of-way be dedicated to or
be reserved by the public, or street and utility improvements be made to the
same extent as required by the local subdivision regulations. This provision
shall not apply to additions of less than five percent (5%) of gross floor area
on an annual basis unless such addition causes an increase in the off-street
parking requirements or a change in occupancy as occupancy is defined by the
North Carolina State Building Code. The Town Council shall prescribe procedures
for review and approval of such applicable zoning or other relevant laws or
regulations, with approvals by designated Town staff, or the Town Council.
Appeals shall lie from the staff to the Town Council. The Town Council may
require that site plans be in conformity with previously approved subdivision
plans for the same property; further, in the event of conflict between a
requirement for site plan approval and requirements for previously approved
subdivision plans, the latter shall control.
Section 6.3. - Road or Drainage Project Fees.
   (a)   Definitions. The following words in this section are defined for this
subdivision as follows, unless the contrary clearly appears from the context:
      (1)   Capital Costs. "Capital Costs" shall mean costs spent for
developing new road or public storm drainage projects or road or public storm
drainage improvements; such costs may include land acquisition, design, and
construction, and no other.
      (2)   Road or Drainage Project. "Road or drainage project" shall mean
road or public storm drainage improvements provided or established by the Town
or in conjunction with other units of government which are required in addition
to those required by the subdivision regulations.
      (3)   Developer. "Developer" shall mean an individual, corporation,
partnership, organization, association, firm, political subdivision, or other
legal entity constructing or creating new construction.
      (4)   Road or Drainage Project Fee. "Road or drainage project fee" shall
mean the charge imposed upon new construction pursuant to the grant of
regulatory authority contained herein.
      (5)   New Construction. "New construction" shall mean any new
development, construction, or installation that results in real property
improvement or which requires a building permit. This term shall include the
installation of a mobile home and factory built or modular housing. This term
shall not include fences, billboards, poles, pipelines, transmission lines,
advertising signs, or similar structures and generate the need for additional
or expanded road or drainage projects upon completion of the new construction.
   (b)   Subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, the Town of
Knightdale, following the adoption of an ordinance or ordinances, shall have
the right, power, and authority to impose and collect a regulatory fee defined
herein as a road or drainage project fee on all new construction within its
Town limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction.
   (c)   Requirements and limitations.
      (1)   No road or drainage project fee shall be enacted until the Town
Council has caused to be prepared a report containing: (i) a description of the
anticipated capital costs to the Town of each additional or expanded road or
drainage project; (ii) a description of the relevant characteristics of
construction which gave rise to additional or expanded road and drainage
projects, such as population, trip generation, stormwater runoff, and flow
characteristics; (iii) a plan for providing one or more road or drainage
projects has been prepared.
      (2)   Before adopting or amending any road or drainage project fee
ordinance authorized by this section, the Town Council shall hold a public
hearing. A notice of the public hearing shall be given so as to conform with
G.S. 160D-601, as it may be amended from time to time. No such ordinance shall
be adopted or amended without receiving the planning commission recommendation
to the Town Council. If the planning commission shall fail to return a
recommendation within 60 days of submittal of an ordinance, the ordinance shall
be returned to the Town Council and deemed to have a favorable recommendation
as submitted to the planning commission.
      (3)   The amount of each fee imposed and collection hereunder shall be
based upon reasonable and uniform considerations of capital costs to be
incurred by the Town as a result of new construction and shall bear a
reasonable relationship to such costs. Such fee shall be based upon reasonable
classifications and rates which shall be uniformly applied to all members of a
class; however, the fees may differ within zones which may be established
depending on the special needs and costs of road and drainage projects in such
zones. To the extent that the developer installs and dedicates road or drainage
projects for which the use of the fee is designated, which immediately become
the property of the Town or another unit of government, and which are not
otherwise reimbursed by the town, the fee shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the value of the improvements or dedications.

in a separate trust fund. Expenditures from such trust fund for any one road or
drainage project shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the capital costs of
such individual project. No expenditures from such trust fund shall be made for
any purpose other than a road or drainage project undertaken by the Town, or by
the Town in conjunction with other units of government. Facility fees shall be
spent for those community service facilities authorized by this Section 6.3
which the Town provides within six years after its collection and within 10
years for those community service facilities authorized by this Section 6.3
which the Town provides in conjunction with other units of government.

Sec. 1.01. - Declaration of policy.
The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials
and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that
government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental
structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the
public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of
these goals, a code of ethics for Town officials is adopted. The purpose of
this chapter is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for
all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible
with the best interest of the Town.
(Ord. of 10-4-10)
Sec. 1.02. - Definitions.
   (a)   Interest means direct or indirect pecuniary or other material benefit
accruing to a Town official as a result of a contract or transaction which is
or may be the subject of an official act or action by or with the Town. For the
purpose of this code, a Town official shall be deemed to have an interest in
the affairs of:
      (1)   Any person in their immediate household as defined in the following
paragraph (e);
      (2)   Any business entity in which the Town official is an officer or
director;
      (3)   Any business entity in which the stock of, or legal or beneficial
ownership of, in excess of ten (10) percent of the total stock or total legal
or beneficial ownership, is controlled or owned directly or indirectly by the
Town official;
      (4)   The relationship of employer-employee does not automatically create
an interest which is prohibited by this ethics code. However, any Town official
who is an employee of an entity involved in a contract or undertaking with the
Town or which seeks the benefit of an official action of the Town may have a
conflict of interest if the Town official's participation or vote in the matter
would provide the Town official a direct or indirect pecuniary or other
material benefit which would otherwise not be received by the Town official.
Any Town official who believes such a conflict might exist shall disclose the
nature of the conflict to the Town Council. After receiving the disclosure, the
Town Council shall, by recorded vote, either excuse the member from voting or
make a finding that no conflict exists. The definition of employer shall
include professional relationships where the Town official is employed in
connection with the matter before the Council or is generally employed by the
client who has the matter before the Council.
   (b)   Official act or action means any legislative, administrative,
appointive or discretionary act of any Town official.
   (c)   Business entity means any business, proprietorship, firm, partnership,
person in representative or fiduciary capacity, association, venture, trust or
corporation which is organized for financial gain or for profit.
   (d)   Town official means the Mayor, members of the Town Council, the Town
Manager, Assistant Town Manager, department heads, Town Attorneys or any
Advisory Board or Committee member appointed by the Town Council.
   (e)   Immediate household means the Town official, spouse, domestic partner,
and all dependent children of the Town official.
   (f)   Confidential information shall mean information which would qualify
for discussion in a closed session pursuant to G.S. 143-318.11.
(Ord. of 10-4-10; Ord. No. 17-06-21-001, 6-21-17; Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-
24)
Sec. 1.03. - Standards of conduct.
   (a)   All Town officials as herein defined shall obey all applicable laws
regarding their official actions and be subject to and abide by the standards
of conduct set forth herein.
   (b)   No official as defined herein shall have or thereafter acquire an
interest in any contract or agreement with the Town, except in such a manner as
may be authorized by state or federal legislation.
   (c)   No Town official shall use their official position or the Town's
facilities for their private gain, nor shall they appear before or represent
any private person, group or interest before any department, agency, committee
or board of the Town except in matters of purely civic or public concern. The
provisions of this paragraph (c) are not intended to prohibit a Town official's
use of parking permits and are not intended to prohibit their speaking before
neighborhood groups and other nonprofit organizations.
   (d)   No Town official shall use or disclose confidential information gained
in the course of or by reason of their official position for purposes of
advancing:
      (i)   Their financial or personal interest;
      (ii)   A business entity of which they are an owner (in part or in
whole), an officer or a director;
      (iii)   The financial or personal interest of a member of their immediate
household or that of any other person; or
      (iv)   To the detriment to the Town when the Town is engaged in any
contract negotiation, efforts preliminary to the acquisition or disposal of
real or personal property, preparation for or actual litigation, and/or
deliberation on land use planning or other legislative matters.
   (e)   Incompatible service. No Town official shall engage in, or accept
private employment or render service for private interest when such employment
or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of their official duties
or would tend to impair their independence of judgment or action in the
performance of their official duties, unless otherwise permitted by law and
unless disclosure is as provided in this code.
   (f)   No Town official shall directly or indirectly solicit any gift, or
accept or receive any gift, whether in the form of money, services, loan,
travel, entertainment, hospitality, thing or promise, or any other form, under
circumstances in which it could reasonably be inferred that the gift was
intended to influence them or could reasonably be expected to influence them in
the performance of their official duties, or was intended as a reward for an
official action on their part. Legitimate political contributions shall not be
considered as gifts under the provisions of this paragraph (f). This section is
not intended to prohibit customary gifts or favors between Town officials and

   The Mayor shall state the motion and then open the floor to debate on it.
The Mayor shall preside over the debate according to the following general
principles:
   (1)   The introducer (the member who makes the motion) is entitled to speak
first;
   (2)   A member who has not spoken on the issue shall be recognized before
someone who has already spoken;
   (3)   To the extent possible, the debate shall alternate between opponents
and proponents of the measure.
(Ord. of 8-7-95; Ord. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 20.45. - Procedural motions.
   In addition to substantive proposals, the following procedural motions, and
no others, shall be in order. Unless otherwise noted, each motion is debatable,
may be amended, and requires a majority of the votes cast, a quorum being
present, for adoption. In order of priority, the procedural motions are:
   (1)   To adjourn. The motion may be made only at the conclusion of action on
a pending substantive matter; it cannot interrupt deliberation of a pending
matter.
   (2)   To take a brief recess. 
   (3)   Call to follow the agenda. The motion must be made at the first
reasonable opportunity, or the right to make it is waived for the out-of-order
item in question.
   (4)   To suspend the rules. The motion requires for adoption a unanimous
vote of the membership of the Council present, excluding the Mayor. The Council
may not suspend provisions of the rules that state requirements imposed by law
on the Council.
   (5)   To divide a complex motion and consider it by paragraph.
   (6)   To defer consideration. A substantive motion the consideration of
which has been deferred expires after ninety-one (91) days have elapsed
following the date of deferral, unless a motion to revive consideration is
adopted.
   (7)   Call of the previous question. The motion is not in order until there
have been at least ten (10) minutes of debate, and every member has had an
opportunity to speak once.
   (8)   To postpone to a certain time or day. This allows the Council to
postpone consideration to a specified time or day and is appropriate when more
information is needed, or the deliberations are likely to be lengthy. It should
be distinguished from the motion to defer consideration.
   (9)   To refer to a Committee or Board. Sixty (60) days or more after a
motion has been referred to a Committee, the introducer may compel
consideration of the measure by the entire Council, whether or not the
Committee or Board has reported the matter to the Council.
   (10)   To amend. An amendment to a motion must be pertinent to the subject
matter of the motion. An amendment is improper if adoption of the amended
motion has the same effect as rejection of the original motion. A motion may be
amended, and that amendment may be amended, but no further amendments may be
made until the last-offered amendment is disposed of by a vote. Any amendment
to a proposed ordinance shall be reduced to writing before the vote on the
amendment.
   (11)   To revive consideration. The motion is in order at any time within
the ninety-one (91) days after the day of a vote to defer consideration. A
substantive motion on which consideration has been deferred expires after
ninety-one (91) days have elapsed following the deferral unless a motion to
revive consideration is adopted.
   (12)   To reconsider. The motion must be made by a member who voted with the
prevailing side, and only at the meeting during which the original vote was
taken, including any continuation of that meeting through adjournment at a time
and place certain. The motion cannot interrupt deliberation on a pending
matter, but is in order at any time before final adjournment of the meeting.
   (13)   To rescind or repeal. The motion is not in order if rescission or
repeal of an action is forbidden by law.
   (14)   To prevent reconsideration for six (6) months. The motion is in order
immediately following the defeat of a substantive motion and at no other time.
The motion requires for adoption a vote equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the actual
membership of the Council, excluding the Mayor and vacant seats. If adopted,
the restriction imposed by the motion remains in effect for six (6) months or
until the next organizational meeting of the Council, whichever occurs first.

   An affirmative vote equal to a majority of all the members of the Council
not excused from voting on the question in issue (including the Mayor’s vote in
case of an equal division) shall be required to adopt an ordinance, to take any
action that has the effect of an ordinance, or to make, ratify or authorize any
contract on behalf of the Town. In addition, no ordinance or action that has
the effect of an ordinance may be finally adopted on the date on which it is
introduced, except by an affirmative vote equal to or greater than two-thirds
(2/3) of all the actual membership of the Council, excluding vacant seats, and
not including the Mayor. No ordinance shall be adopted, unless it has been

Council and ending with the adoption of the budget ordinance, the Council may
hold any special meetings that may be necessary to complete its work on the
budget ordinance. Except for the notice requirements of the open meetings law,
which continue to apply, no provision of law concerning the call of special
meetings applies during that period so long as:
   (1)   Each member of the Council has actual notice of each special meeting
called for the purpose of considering the budget; and
   (2)   No business other than consideration of the budget is taken up.
This rule does not allow, and may not be construed to allow, the holding of
closed meetings or closed sessions by the Council if it is otherwise prohibited

(Mo. of 10-17-07; Ord. 20-12-16-003, 12-16-20; Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)

(Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 31.15. - Open burning.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate certain open
burning in order to protect the public from the hazards of fires and air
pollution. Open burning is defined as the burning of materials wherein products
of combustion are emitted into the ambient air without first passing through a
stack or chimney from an enclosed container.
   (b)   Scope. This regulation shall apply to all operations involving open
burning within the Town of Knightdale, except those specifically exempted by
this section.
   (c)   No open burning allowed. No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or
permit open burning of refuse or other combustible material except as may be
permitted in compliance with this section. As public pickup services are
available for solid waste and yard waste within the Town of Knightdale, no open
burning of trash, leaves, tree branches, or yard trimmings are allowed.
   (d)   Permissible open burning with required permit. While recognizing that
open burning contributes to air pollution, certain types of open burning may
reasonably be allowed in the public interest. The authority to conduct open
burning under the provision of this section does not exempt or excuse a person
from the consequences, damages or injuries which may result from such conduct,
nor does it excuse or exempt any person from complying with all applicable
laws, ordinances, regulations, and orders of other governmental entities having
jurisdiction even though the open burning is conducted in compliance with this
section. The following types of burning are permissible within the Town limits
with a Town-issued burning permit:
   (1)   Fires purposely set to agricultural lands for disease and pest control
and other accepted agricultural or wildlife management practices.
   (2)   Fires purposely set to forest lands for accepted forest management
practices.
   (3)   Fires purposely set in rural areas for rights-of-way maintenance.
   (4)   Bonfires, as defined by the NC Fire Prevention Code, are large fires
utilized for ceremonial purposes and are considered open burning. These are
typically conducted in conjunction with planned events and are larger than
three (3) feet in diameter and two (2) feet in height. A bonfire shall not be
conducted within fifty (50) feet of a structure or combustible material and
conditions.
   (5)   The burning of waste materials, trees, brush, and other vegetable
matter in connection with construction projects and the clearing of land or
rights-of-way and with the following limitations:
      a.   Prevailing winds at the time of burning must be away from any city
or town or built-up area, the ambient air of which may be significantly
affected by smoke, fly-ash, or other air contaminants from the burning;
      b.   The location of the burning must be at least five hundred (500) feet
from any occupied dwelling and two hundred fifty (250) feet from any public
road;
      c.   The amount of dirt on the material being burned must be minimized;
      d.   Heavy oils, asphaltic materials, items containing natural or
synthetic rubber or any materials other than plant growth may not be burned;
      e.   Initial burning may generally be commenced only between the hours of
8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., and no combustible material may be added to the fire
after 6:00 p.m. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or operator of the
open burning operation to obtain written approval for burning during periods
other than those specified above. At no time during the burning operation shall
the permittee fail to have the fire tended or guarded.
      f.   Fires are not permitted on Air Quality Code Orange, Red or Purple
days.
   (6)   Permits or permissions granted by the Town under this section shall be
subject to continued review and may be withdrawn at any time. Furthermore, the
Town of Knightdale burning permit must remain on the premises during the hours

drainage infrastructure improvements for which Knightdale is financially
responsible, in whole or in part.
   (2)    Definitions. The following words in this section are defined for this
subdivision as follows, unless the contrary clearly appears from the context:
      Capital costs shall mean costs spent for developing new road or public
storm drainage projects or road or public storm drainage improvements. Capital
costs for land acquisition, design, and construction shall broadly include all
costs associated with the project undertaken at the same time as the
construction or improvement of the roadway or storm drainage system as
determined by the Council, including, but not limited to, sidewalks, curbs,
gutters, walking or bike paths, and utilities customarily included within or
appurtenant to roadways.
      Developer shall mean an individual, corporation, partnership,
organization, association, firm, political subdivision, or other legal entity
constructing or creating new construction.
      New construction shall mean any development, construction, or
installation that results in improvement of real property or which requires a
building permit. This term shall include the installation of a mobile home and
factory-built or modular housing. This term shall not include fences,
billboards, poles, pipelines, transmission lines, advertising signs, or similar
structures generating the need for additional or expanded road or drainage
projects upon completion of the new construction.
      Road or drainage project shall mean road or public storm drainage
improvements provided or established by the Town or in conjunction with other
units of government which are required in addition to those required by the
subdivision regulations.
      Road or drainage project fee shall mean the charge imposed upon new
construction pursuant to the grant of regulatory authority contained herein.
      Town or Knightdale shall mean the Town of Knightdale.
      Town Council or Board shall mean duly elected Town Council and any
successor governing body.
   (3)   Authorization of fees.

stormwater fees on all new construction located within the Town's corporate
limits and/or within the boundaries of any extraterritorial planning area
established by the Town pursuant to G.S. 160A-360 or any other law. Such fees
shall be in addition to all other charges prescribed by ordinance, or
resolution now or hereafter in effect.
      (b)   The Town Council may adopt such rules and regulations as it deems
necessary or convenient to effectuate the purposes of this article, and such
rules and regulations shall apply both within the City and its extraterritorial
jurisdiction planning area.
      (c)   A road or drainage project fee shall be enacted only after the Town
Council receives a report containing: (i) a description of the anticipated
capital costs to the Town of the road or drainage project contemplated; (ii) a
description of the relevant characteristics of construction which gave rise to
additional or expanded road and drainage projects, such as population, trip
generation, stormwater runoff, and flow characteristics, if such information
has not been provided previously; and (iii) a plan for providing one (1) or
more road or drainage projects or a plan showing the improvements provided.
      (d)   Such fees shall be authorized following a public hearing before the
Town Council. All affected property owners shall be notified of the time,
place, and purpose of the public hearing at least two (2) weeks in advance of
the hearing. Following the public hearing, the Council shall set the amount or
percentage of the fees attributable to each subject property and the time for
payment of all fees.
   (4)   Collection of fees.
      (a)   The fees collected by the Town pursuant to this section shall be
kept separate from other revenue of the Town in a designated account called
Road and Drainage Project Fee. All road and drainage project fees collected by
the Town shall be maintained and used for its intended purpose.
      (b)   The amount of each fee imposed and collection hereunder shall be
based upon reasonable and uniform considerations of capital costs to be
incurred by the Town as a result of new construction and shall bear a
reasonable relationship to such costs. Such fee shall be based upon reasonable
classifications and rates which shall be uniformly applied to all members of a
class; however, the fees may differ within zones which may be established
depending on the special needs and costs of road and drainage projects in such
zones.
      (c)   To the extent that the developer installs and dedicates road or
drainage projects, which ultimately become the property of the Town or another
unit of government, the fee shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value of
the improvements or dedications if not paid for by the Town; provided that, if
the Town is responsible for reimbursement of the developer, either in whole or
in part, such reimbursement amount shall be considered in all respects as if
the Town paid such amount to construct such road or drainage improvement.
      (d)   Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure
shall be invested as allowed in G.S. 159-30 for other public monies. All income
so derived shall be deposited into the applicable trust account.
   (5)   Use of fees. Funds expended from the road and drainage project fee
trust account shall be made for no other purpose than a road or drainage
project undertaken by the Town (including projects for which the Town has a
reimbursement obligation), or by the Town in conjunction with other units of
government. Expenditures from such fund for any one (1) road or drainage
project shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the capital costs of such
individual project.
   (6)   Supplemental power. The fees authorized by this article are additional
and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other provision permitting
collection of fees, assessments, fees in lieu of assessment, fees in lieu of
construction, or other amounts by the Town related to the development of land
or the issuance or approval of any subdivision, site plan, plat, other
development plan, building permit, Town permit, certificate of compliance, or
certificate of occupancy. The fees authorized herein are intended to be
consistent with and to further the goals of the Town's policies, ordinances,
and resolutions. Assessments, charges, fees, or rates authorized by any other
general or local law are not affected by this article.

danger to people or property or are in poor health or dead. Any removed street
tree shall be replaced with the correct species and size as indicated on the

Sec. 80.07. - Removal of abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicles; pre-
towing notice requirements.
   Except as set forth in this chapter, an abandoned, nuisance or junked
vehicle which is to be removed shall be towed only after notice to the
registered owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle. In the case
of a nuisance vehicle or a junked motor vehicle, if the names and mailing
addresses of the registered owner or person entitled to the possession of the
vehicle, or the owner, lessee, or occupancy of the real property upon which the
vehicle is located can be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence,
the notice shall be given by first class mail. The person who mails the notice
(s) shall retain a written record to show the name(s) and address(es) to which
mailed, and the date mailed. If such names and addresses cannot be ascertained
or if the vehicle to be removed is an abandoned motor vehicle, notice shall be
given by affixing on the windshield or some other conspicuous place on the
vehicle a notice indicating that the vehicle will be removed by the Town on a
specified date (no sooner than seven (7) days after the notice is affixed). The
notice shall state that the vehicle will be removed by the Town on a specified
date, no sooner than seven days after the notice is affixed or mailed, unless
the vehicle is moved by the owner or legal possessor prior to that time.
   With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property, nuisance vehicles
and junked motor vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if the
registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the vehicle
but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is abandoned, a
nuisance vehicle or in the case of a junked motor vehicle that the aesthetic
benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, such appeal shall be
made to the Town Council in writing, heard at the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the Town Council, and further proceedings to remove the vehicle
shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and decided.
(Ord. of 8-6-90; Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 80.08. - Exceptions to prior notice requirement.
The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an abandoned,
nuisance or junked motor vehicle may, as determined by the authorizing
official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a special need for
prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to otherwise maintain and
protect the public safety and welfare. Such findings shall, in all cases, be
entered by the authorizing official in the appropriate daily records.
Circumstances justifying the removal of vehicles without prior notice includes:
   (a)   Vehicles abandoned on the streets. For vehicles left on the public
streets and highways, the Town hereby determines that immediate removal of such
vehicles may be warranted when they are:
   (1)   Obstructing traffic;
   (2)   Parked in violation of an ordinance prohibiting or restricting
parking;
   (3)   Parked in a no-stopping or standing zone;
   (4)   Parked in loading zones;
   (5)   Parked in bus zone; or
   (6)   Parked in violation of temporary parking restrictions imposed under
code sections.
   (b)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles. With respect to abandoned or
nuisance vehicles left on city-owned property other than the streets and
highways, and on private property, such vehicles may be removed without giving
prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing official finds a
special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health,
safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation, such
circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to
businesses and residences, vehicles parked in such location or manner as to
pose a traffic hazard, and vehicles causing damage to public or private
property.
(Ord. of 8-6-90)
Sec. 80.09. - Removal of vehicle; post-towing notice requirements.
   Any abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle which has been ordered
removed may, as directed by the Town, be removed to a storage garage or area by
the tow truck operator or towing business contracting to perform such services
for the Town. Whenever such a vehicle is removed, the authorizing Town official
shall immediately notify the last known registered owner of the vehicle, such
notice to include the following:
   (1)   The description of the removed vehicle;
   (2)   The location where the vehicle is stored;
   (3)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;
   (4)   The procedure the owner must follow to redeem the vehicle; and
   (5)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable cause
hearing on the removal.
   The Town shall attempt to give notice to the vehicle owner by telephone;
however, whether or not the owner is reached by telephone, written notice,
including the information set forth in subsections (1) through (5) above, shall
also be mailed to the registered owner's last known address, unless this notice
is waived in writing by the vehicle owner or their agent.
   If the vehicle is registered in North Carolina, notice shall be given within
twenty-four (24) hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the state, notice
shall be given to the registered owner within seventy-two (72) hours from the
removal of the vehicle.
   Whenever an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle is removed, and such
vehicle has no valid registration or registration plates, the authorizing Town
official shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the vehicle
identification number, to determine the last known registered owner of the
vehicle and to notify them of the information set forth in subsections (1)
through (5) above.

Sec. 80.10. - Right to probable cause hearing before sale or final disposition
of vehicle.
After the removal of an abandoned vehicle, nuisance vehicle or junked motor
vehicle, the owner or any other person entitled to possession is entitled to a
hearing for the purpose of determining if probable cause existed for removing
the vehicle. A request for hearing must be filed in writing with the county
magistrate designated by the Chief District Court Judge to receive such hearing
requests. The magistrate will set the hearing within seventy-two (72) hours of
receipt of the request, and the hearing will be conducted in accordance with
the provisions of G.S. 20-222, as amended.
(Ord. of 8-6-90)
Sec. 80.11. - Redemption of vehicle during proceedings.
At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause hearing,
the owner may obtain possession of the removed vehicle by paying the towing
fee, including any storage charges, or by posting a bond for double the amount
of such fees and charges to the Town truck operator or towing business having
custody of the removed vehicle. Upon regaining possession of a vehicle, the
owner or person entitled to the possession of the vehicle shall not allow or
engage in further violation of this Ordinance.
(Ord. of 8-6-90)
Sec. 80.12. - Sale and disposition of unclaimed vehicle.

owner or other party entitled to possession will be disposed of by the tow
truck operator or towing business having custody of the vehicle. Disposition of
such a vehicle shall be carried out in coordination with the Town and in
accordance with Article 1 of Chapter 44A of the North Carolina General
Statutes.
(Ord. of 8-6-90)
Sec. 80.13. - Conditions on removal of vehicles from private property.
As a general policy, the Town will not remove a vehicle from private property
if the owner, occupant or lessee of such property could have the vehicle
removed under applicable state law procedures. In no case will a vehicle be
removed by the Town from private property without a written request of the
owner, occupant or lessee, except in those cases where a vehicle is a nuisance
vehicle or is a junked motor vehicle which has been ordered removed by the Town
Manager. The Town may require any person requesting the removal of an
abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle from private property to indemnify
the Town against any loss, expenses or liability because of the removal,
storage, or sale thereof.
(Ord. of 8-6-90)
Sec. 80.14. - Protection against criminal or civil liability.

to the appealing owner, specifying the time and place for the appeal to be
heard by the Town Council.
   (b)   The hearing shall be heard at the next regularly scheduled Town
Council meeting for which agenda items are being accepted by the Town Clerk.
The owner or any part in interest shall have the right to file a written answer
to the Town Council and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give evidence at
the place and time fixed in the notice. Any person desiring to do so may attend
such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of
evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in such
hearings.
(Ord. No. 00-10-18-001, § 4, 10-18-00; Ord. No. 11-12-05-002, § 1, 12-5-11)
Sec. 83.05. - Council decision.
The Town Council, after hearing all the evidence presented at the nuisance
appeal hearing, may reverse the Code Enforcement Officer's determination that a
nuisance condition exists on the subject property. The Town Council, however,
may affirm the Code Enforcement Officer's findings and it then shall enact an
ordinance specifically declaring the condition existing on the affected parcel
of land to be a public nuisance which is dangerous and prejudicial to the
public health or safety and ordering the Code Enforcement Officer to abate the
nuisance condition. The Town Council's decision shall be final.
(Ord. No. 00-10-18-001, § 5, 10-18-00)
Sec. 83.06. - Abatement by Town.
   Following an appeal hearing, if the Town Council has ordered the Town's Code
Enforcement Officer to abate the nuisance condition on the affected lot, the
Code Enforcement Officer shall deposit a first class mail notice, postage
prepaid, to the property owner as reported by the Wake County Tax
Administration that they must abate the nuisance within ten (10) days of the
deposit. If the property owner within this ten-day period neglects to abate the
public nuisance condition, then the Code Enforcement Officer shall cause the
condition to be removed or otherwise remedied by having employees of the Town,
or subcontractors retained by the Town, go upon the premises and remove or
otherwise abate the nuisance under the supervision of the Code Enforcement
Officer. The expense of remedying the abatement shall be paid by the property
owner. If the expense is not paid, it is a lien on the land or premises where
the nuisance occurred, and such lien shall have the same priority and be
collected as unpaid ad valorem taxes. In addition hereto, any such unpaid
expenses shall be a lien on other property owned by such property owner located
within the Town's corporate limits, or within one (1) mile of the Town's
corporate limits, except for such property owner's primary residence, and such
lien shall have the same priority as a money judgment lien.
(Ord. No. 00-10-18-001, § 6, 10-18-00; Ord. No. 11-12-05-002, § 1, 12-5-11;
Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 83.07. - Costs of abatement; lien.
   (a)   The actual cost and associated expenses including advertising,
certified mail and attorneys fees incurred by the Town in removing or otherwise
remedying a public nuisance shall be charged to the owner of such lot or parcel
of land, and it shall be the duty of the Tax Collector to mail a statement of
such charges to the owner or other person in possession of the premises with
instructions that such charges are due and payable within thirty (30) days from
the receipt thereof.
   (b)   In the event charges for the removal or abatement of a public nuisance
are not paid within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a statement of
charges, such charges shall become a lien upon the land or premises where the
public nuisance existed and shall be collected as unpaid taxes, as provided in
G.S. 160A-193.
(Ord. No. 00-10-18-001, § 7, 10-18-00)
Sec. 83.08. - Annual notice to chronic violators.
The notice given to violators required in Section
83.03 is modified as set forth herein for chronic violators of the nuisance
condition for tall noxious weeds or grass enumerated in Section
83.01(a). A chronic violator is a person who owns property whereupon, in the
previous calendar year, the Town gave notice of violation at least three (3)
times for the nuisance condition of tall noxious weeds or grass. The Town may
notify a chronic violator of the Town's public nuisance ordinance that, if the
violator's property is found to be in violation of Section
83.01(a) in the subsequent and consecutive year(s), the Town shall, without
further notice in the calendar year in which notice is given, take action to
remedy the violation, and the expense of the action shall become a lien upon
the land or premises where the nuisance occurred and shall have the priority
and be collected as unpaid ad valorem taxes, unless paid by the property owner.
In addition hereto, any such unpaid expenses shall be a lien on other property
owned by such property owner located within the Town's corporate limits, or
within one (1) mile of the Town's corporate limits, except for such property
owner's primary residence, and such lien shall have the same priority as a
money judgment lien. The annual notice shall be sent by certified or registered
mail.
(Ord. No. 11-12-05-002, § 1, 12-5-11)
Sec. 83.09. - Procedure not exclusive.
The procedure set forth in this chapter shall be in addition to any other
remedies that may now or hereafter exist under law for the abatement of public
nuisances and this chapter shall not prevent the Town from proceeding in a
criminal action against any person, firm, or corporation violating the
provisions of this chapter as provided in G.S. 14-4.

Sec. 84.04. - Unnecessary noise.
   (a)   Statement of purpose and intent: Loud, disturbing noises prohibited,
generally.
   (1)   The provisions hereinafter contained are enacted for the purpose of
preventing noise disturbances or unreasonably loud noise and are enacted
pursuant to the authority granted in G.S. 160A-184. Above certain levels or
durations and during specific times of day, unreasonably loud noise or noise
disturbance is detrimental to health, safety and welfare of the citizenry and
the individual's right to peaceful and quiet enjoyment. It is the policy of the
Town to prohibit noise disturbance and unreasonably loud noise from all
sources, subject to its police power, to secure and promote public health,
comfort, convenience, safety, welfare, and prosperity of the citizens of
Knightdale. Nothing in this section is intended to deter individuals from
exercising the individual right of freedom of speech and commerce, or any other
freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States of America or
the State of North Carolina, and nothing in this section is intended to
unreasonably limit or restrain commercial or industrial enterprise.
   (2)   Subject to the provisions of § 84.04(c) to 84.04(k), it shall be
unlawful for any person to create or assist in creating any unreasonably loud,
disturbing noise in the Town which frightens, annoys, disturbs, injures, or
endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of citizens within the
Town of Knightdale or causes damage to property or business within the Town of
Knightdale. Such sounds do not include the ordinary and usual sounds, noises,
commotions, or vibration incidental to residential living or operation of
businesses or commercial establishments when conducted in accordance with the
usual standards of practice and in a manner that does not unreasonably disturb
the peace and comfort of adjacent residences or which will not detrimentally
affect the operators of adjacent places of business.
   (b)   Definitions. For this section, the following words and phrases are
defined below unless it shall be apparent from the context that a different
meaning is intended:
   Construction: On-site erection, fabrication, installation, alteration,
demolition or removal of any structure, facility or addition thereto, including
all related activities including, but not restricted to, clearing of land,
earth moving, blasting, landscaping, mixing or pouring concrete, and the
operation of vehicles or equipment in connection with such activities.
   Disturbing noise: Noise which is perceived by a person of ordinary
sensibilities as interrupting the normal peace and calm of an area.
   Emergency work: Any work performed for preventing or alleviating physical
trauma or property damage threatened or caused by an existing or imminent
peril.
   Motor vehicle or vehicle: Any vehicle propelled on land by a motor,
including, but not limited to, passenger cars, trucks, truck-trailers, semi-
trailers, campers, go-carts, automobiles, motorcycles or buses. It shall
exclude trains and emergency response vehicles such as police, fire and rescue
vehicles.
   Noise control officer: The Town's code enforcement officer, any police
officer, or other person so designated by the Town Manager.
   Occupied residential structure: Any structure that is occupied for
residential use or that reasonably appears to be occupied for residential use;
it is not necessary that a person be inside the structure at the time an
unreasonably loud or disturbing noise is caused or created.
   Person: Any individual, association, partnership or corporation, including
any officer, employee, department, agency or instrumentality of the United
States, the state or any political subdivision thereof.
   Unreasonably loud noise: Noise which is substantially incompatible with the
time and location where created or heard to the extent that it brings about an
actual or imminent interference with peace, rest, or good order.
Technical terms:
   Amplified sound: Any sound using amplifying equipment, whose source is
outside or whose source is inside, and the sound propagates to the outside or
to other dwellings or interior locations under separate ownership or occupancy.
   A-weighted sound level: The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on
a sound level meter using the A-weighting network. The level so read is
designated dB(A).
   Decibel (dB): A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to twenty
(20) times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the
sound measured to the reference pressure, which is twenty (20) micronewtons per
square meter.
   Slow response: A measuring technique to obtain an average value when
measuring a noise level that fluctuates over a range of four (4) dB or more. By
way of illustration only, a sound level meter set on "slow response" would
record a sound level between two (2) and six (6) decibels less than the reading
for a steadying signal of the same frequency and amplitude when a tone of one
thousand (1,000) Hz and for a duration of one-half (0.5) second is applied.
   Sound: An oscillation in pressure, particle displacement, particle velocity
or other physical parameter, in a medium with internal forces that causes
compression, and rarefaction of that medium. The description of sound may
include any characteristic of such sound, including duration, intensity and
frequency.
   Sound level: The weighted sound pressure level obtained using a sound level
meter and frequency weighting network, such as A, B, or C as specified in
American National Standards Institute Specifications for sound level meters
(ANSI S1.41971 or the latest approved version thereof). If the frequency
weighting employed is not indicated, the A-weighting shall apply.
   Sound-level meter: An instrument which includes a microphone, amplifier, RSM
detector, integrator or time average, output meter and weighting network used
to measure sound pressure levels.
   Sound pressure level: Twenty (20) times the logarithms to the base 10 of the
ratio of the root mean squared (RMS) sound pressure to the reference pressure
of twenty (20) micronewtons per square meter.
   (c)   Noise measurement. To determine dB(A)'s as referred to in this
article, sound levels shall be measured on the A-weighting scale on a sound
level meter of standard design and quality having characteristics established
by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or its successor body.
   All measurements shall be taken at or within the nearest residential
property line occupied by the complainant, unless otherwise stated. For
multifamily structures, including apartments, condominiums, or other
residential arrangements where boundary lines cannot readily be determined or
do not exist, measurements shall be taken:
   (1)   from any point abutting the exterior of the complainant's residential
unit; or
   (2)   from any point on the interior of the complainant's residential unit
if taking an exterior measurement is impractical or if the noise complained of
is emanating from an adjoining unit.
   The sound measurement shall be averaged over a period of one (1) minute for
purposes of determining the sound level (the "measurement period"). It shall be
a violation of this ordinance for the averaged sound measurement to exceed the
prescribed dB(A), or for any sound or noise to exceed the prescribed dB(A)
level by three (3) or more decibels at any time during the measurement period.
   (d)   Exceptions. The following acts and activities are exempt from the

IMAGES/0-0-0-968.jpg]Publisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new
legislation (Ord. 24-11-20-001, adopted 11-20-2024). The text of the amendment
will be incorporated below when the ordinance is codified.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect juveniles from
victimization and exposure to criminal activity by establishing a curfew for
persons under the age of eighteen (18) years in the Town of Knightdale. The
Youth Protection Ordinance is intended to promote the health, safety and
welfare of both juveniles and adults by creating an environment providing
better protection and security for all concerned. The purpose is also to define
the duties of parents or guardians and operators of business establishments and
protect minors from improper influences and criminal activity that occurs after
the curfew hour.
   (b)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following words and
phrases shall have the following meanings:
   Authorized adult: Parent, guardian or someone over the eighteen (18) years
of age authorized to accompany the juvenile for a designated period of time.
   Emergency: An unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state
that calls for immediate action. The term includes, but is not limited to, a
fire, natural disaster, or automobile accident, or any situation requiring
immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury or loss of life.
   Establishment: Any privately owned place of business operated to which the
public has access or is invited including but not limited to any place of
amusement or entertainment.
   Juvenile: Any person under the age of eighteen (18) years who is not married
or been emancipated, or in equivalent phrasing, any person sixteen (16) or less
years of age.
   Owner/operator: any individual, firm, association, partnership or
corporation, operating, managing or conducting any establishment, including the
employees, members or partners of an association or partnership and the
officers of a corporation.
   Parent: Any person having legal custody of a juvenile (i) as a natural or
adoptive parent, (ii) as a legal guardian, (iii) as a person who stands in loco
parentis, or (iv) as a person to whom legal custody has been given by court
order.
   Public place: Any place that is generally open to and used by the public or
a substantial group of the public, whether it be publicly-owned or privately-
owned, including but not limited to, streets, highways, alleys, rights-of-way,
public vehicular areas and parking lots, shops, restaurants, convenience
stores, schools and school grounds, places of business and amusement,
playgrounds, parks, church grounds, similar areas that are open to the public,
and other common areas open to or accessible to the public.
   Remain: To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily in a public place
including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four
(4) or more persons in which any juvenile involved would not be using the
streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home, or
to fail to leave the premises of an establishment when requested to do so by a
police officer or the operator of an establishment.
   Restricted hours: The time of night referred to herein is based upon the
prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight
Saving Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the Town of
Knightdale, North Carolina. Restricted hours will mean: 9:00 p.m. on any
evening until 6:00 a.m. of the following day.
   (c)   Offenses. Except as provided by subsection (d), the following offenses
constitute a violation of this section:
   (1)   A person under the age of eighteen (18) years shall be in violation of
this section if they shall remain at any time in a group of four (4) or more
individuals in or upon any public place or establishment within the Town.
   (2)   It shall be a violation of this section for any person under the age
of eighteen (18) years to be or remain in or upon any public place or
establishment within the Town during the restricted hours.
   (3)   It shall be a violation of this section for any person eighteen (18)
years or older to aid or abet a juvenile in the violation of subsection (c)(1)
or (c)(2).
   (4)   A parent of a juvenile shall be in violation of this section if they
knowingly permit, and/or by inadequate supervision, allows the juvenile to
remain on the premises of any establishment or in any public place within the
Town during the restricted hours. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that
a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a
juvenile in that parent's legal custody. This requirement is intended to hold a
neglectful or careless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such juvenile.
   (5)   It shall be a violation of this section for a parent of a juvenile to
refuse to take custody of the juvenile during the restricted hours.
   (6)   The owners, operator, or any employee of an establishment shall be in
violation of this section if they knowingly allow a juvenile to remain upon the
premises of the establishment during the restricted hours. The term "knowingly"
includes knowledge that an operator or employer should reasonably be expected
to have concerning the patrons of an establishment.
   (d)   Exceptions. A juvenile shall not be in violation of this section if
the juvenile is:
   (1)   Accompanied by a parent or adult eighteen (18) years of age, or older,
authorized by the parent to supervise such juvenile.
   (2)   Using a direct route to or from a place of employment.
   (3)   In a motor vehicle with parental consent.
   (4)   Reacting or responding to an emergency.
   (5)   Attending or traveling to or from, by direct route, any school,
religious or recreational activity or other organized activity which is
supervised by adults that accept responsibility for the juvenile. If during
restricted hours, the parent must have knowledge of the organized activity in
which the juvenile is involved and the juvenile shall carry a written
communication, signed by the juvenile and countersigned, if practicable, by a
parent of the juvenile with their home address and telephone number and
specifying when, where and in what manner the juvenile will be in a public
place.
   (6)   Participating in or observing athletic or recreational events on
public parks or public playgrounds except during restricted hours.
   (7)   Exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution.
   (f)   Enforcement procedures. 
   (1)   If a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is in
violation of the ordinance the officer shall notify the juvenile that they are
in violation of the ordinance and shall require the juvenile to provide their
name, address and telephone number and how to contact their parent or guardian.
In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of convincing
evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer shall, in the first
instance of violation of the ordinance, use their best judgment in determining
age.
   (2)   The police officer shall issue the juvenile a written warning that the
juvenile is in violation of the Ordinance and order the juvenile to go promptly
home. The Chief of Police shall send the parent or guardian of the juvenile
written notice of the violation by certified mail with a warning that any
subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the ordinance,
including enforcement or parental responsibility and of applicable penalties.
   (3)   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide that the police officer deliver to a parent a
juvenile under appropriate circumstances; for example, a juvenile of tender
age, near home, whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or are
known.
   (4)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, when: (i) a juvenile has received one
(1) previous written warning for violation of this section; or (ii) a police
officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile has engaged in
delinquent conduct, the procedure shall then be to take the juvenile to the
police station where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for the
juvenile whereupon the parent and the juvenile shall be questioned. This is
intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant
facts, and to centralize responsibility in the person designated there and then
on duty for an accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement,
and recording, thus making available experienced personnel and access to
information and records.
   (5)   When a parent immediately called, has come to take charge of the
juvenile, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the juvenile shall
be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or
fails to take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall be released to
the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the juvenile may
temporarily be entrusted to an adult, neighbor or other person who will on
behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for a juvenile pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
   (6)   For the first violation of the ordinance by an operator of an
establishment who permits a juvenile to remain on the premises, a police
officer shall issue a written notice of the violation with a warning that any
subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the ordinance,
including enforcement of operator responsibility and of applicable penalties.
   (g)   Penalties. 
   (1)   A juvenile who violates any provision of this section is subject to
being adjudicated delinquent. The Court may, in its discretion, impose any
dispositional alternative(s) that are provided in the North Carolina Juvenile
Code for any juvenile who is delinquent.
   (2)   Any person other than a juvenile who violates any provision of this
section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to maximum fine and/or
imprisonment in the discretion of the Court in accordance with N.C.G.S. 14-4.
   (3)   Civil penalty.

offender to a civil penalty to be recovered by the Town in a civil action in
the nature of a debt or as otherwise provided herein if the offended fails to

the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first offense and for each
subsequent offense the fine shall increase by an additional one hundred dollars
($100.00).
      b.   Citation contents. Such violation citation shall, among other
things:

fee.

be cleared with the Chief of Police, Town Hall, 950 Steeple Square Court,

of the citation. The notice shall further state that if the violation citation
is not cleared within seventy-two (72) hours, Court action by the filing of a
civil complaint for collection of the penalty may be taken. As used upon the
violation citation, the word "cleared" shall mean either:
            (i)   Payment;
            (ii)   Arrangement for payment to be made; or
            (iii)   A prima facie showing to the Chief of Police that the
citation was received as a result of mistake, inadvertence or excusable
neglect.
      c.   Settlement of civil claim. The Chief of Police is authorized to
accept payment in full and final settlement of the claim or claims, right or
rights of action which the Town may have to enforce such penalty by civil
action in the nature of debt.
      d.   Additional penalty. A penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00), in
addition to the one imposed for payment within seventy-two (72) hours, shall
apply in those cases in which the penalties prescribed in this section have not
been paid within the prescribed seventy-two (72) hour period.
   (h)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, term or exception
of this section, or any application thereof to any person or circumstance, is
adjudged to be unconstitutional or invalid, such adjudication shall not be
deemed applicable to any other person or circumstances. Furthermore, the Town
Council declares its intent to adopt and enforce each and every section of this
Ordinance [Ord. of 10-3-05] separate and independent from one another.

currently exist or for any new development. If additional parking area is added
to comply with this parking prohibition, the maximum area of additional parking
areas is three hundred four (304) square feet or forty (40) percent of the lot
area, whichever is less. All new parking areas shall be constructed of at a
minimum similar material to the existing parking area; where existing parking
is constructed of unprepared surfaces it shall be compacted to minimize dust
and delineated to clearly indicate the parameters of the parking area. Parking
in the side and rear yard is limited to driveways, drive aisles and similar
devices leading to a rear yard garage or similar structure. Where a corner lot
provides primary parking in the corner side yard, the corner side yard shall be
treated as a front yard for the purposes of this section.

* Editor's note— An ordinance adopted July 5, 2005, enacted provisions to be
designated as Art. 84.300, §§ 84.300—84.312. In order to maintain the numeric
style of the Code, said provisions have been redesignated as Ch. 87, §§
87.00—87.12 by the editor. Original numbering has been maintained in the
history notes following each section.
Sec. 87.00. - Purpose and intent.
The Town of Knightdale enacts this chapter after several public hearings to
help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for
the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The Council is
authorized to enact this chapter pursuant to its police powers, as specified in
the Town Charter and Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes.
The Council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the
rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless
the Town acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti
tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and
entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to
be, all to the detriment of the Town.
The Town Council intends, through the adoption of this chapter, to provide
additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts
of graffiti vandalism and defacement. The Council does not intend for this
chapter to conflict with any existing anti-graffiti federal or state laws and
to the extent of any such conflict, the provisions of the federal or state
shall control.

[Anti-Graffiti Ordinance] to the address of the property occupied by the

(Ord. of 7-5-05, § 84.307)

abatement procedures in the Town Code.
   (4)   An information sheet identifying any graffiti removal assistance
programs available through the Town and private graffiti removal contractors.
   (b)   Exceptions to property owner responsibility. The removal requirements
of subsection (a) above shall not apply if the property owner or responsible
party can demonstrate that the property owner or responsible party has an
active program for the removal of graffiti and has scheduled the removal of the
graffiti as part of that program, in which case it shall be unlawful to permit
such property to remain defaced with graffiti for a period of thirty (30) days
after service by first class mail of notice of the defacement.
   (c)   Right of Town to remove. 
   (1)   Use of public funds. Whenever the Town becomes aware or is notified
and determines that graffiti is located on publicly-owned or privately-owned
property viewable from a public or quasi-public place, the Town shall be
authorized to use public funds for the removal of the graffiti, or for the
painting or repairing of the graffiti, but shall not authorize or undertake to
provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive an area than that
where the graffiti is located, unless the Town Manager, or the designee of the
Town Manager, determines in writing that a more extensive area is required to
be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement to the
neighborhood or community, or unless the property owner or responsible party
agrees to pay for the costs or repainting or repairing the more extensive area.
   (2)   Right of entry on private property. Prior to entering upon private
property or property owned by a public entity other than the Town for the
purpose of graffiti removal, the Town shall attempt to secure the consent of
the property owner or responsible party and a release of the Town from
liability for property damage or personal injury. If the property owner or
responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time
specified by this chapter, or if the Town has requested consent to remove or
paint over the offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party
has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the Town and consistent
with the terms of this section, the Town shall commence abatement and cost
recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal according to the provisions
specified below.
   (d)   Abatement and cost recovery proceedings.
   (1)   Notice of due process hearing. The Town Manager, or the designee of
the Town Manager, serving as the Hearing Officer, shall provide the property
owner of record and the party responsible for the maintenance of the property,
if a person different than the owner, not less than forty-eight (48) hours
notice of the Town's intent to hold a due process hearing at which the property
owner or responsible party shall be entitled to present evidence and argue that
the property does not constitute a public nuisance. Notice shall be served by
certified mail return receipt requested addressed to the property owner listed
by the Wake County Tax Office. If the owner of record cannot be found after a
diligent search, or refuses to accept certified mail delivery, the notice may
be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property
for a period of ten (10) days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the area in which the property is located.
   (2)   Determination of hearing officer. The determination of the Hearing
Officer after the due process hearing shall be final and not appealable. If,
after the due process hearing, regardless of the attendance of the owner or the
responsible party or their respective agents, the Hearing Officer determines
that the property contains graffiti viewable from a public or quasi-public
place, the Hearing Officer shall give written notice in an eradication order
that, unless the graffiti is removed within ten (10) days, the Town shall enter
upon the property, cause the removal, painting over (in such color as shall
meet with the approval of the Hearing Officer), or such other eradication
thereof as the Hearing Officer determines appropriate, and shall provide the
owner and the responsible party thereafter with an accounting of the costs of
the eradication effort on a full cost recovery basis.
   (3)   Eradication effort. Not sooner than the time specified in the order of
the Hearing Officer, the Town Manager, or the designee of the Town Manager,
shall implement the eradication order and shall provide an accounting to the
owner and the responsible party of the costs thereof.
   (4)   Cost hearing. The owner or responsible party may request a cost
hearing before the Hearing Officer on the eradication accounting, and
appropriate due process must be extended to the owner or responsible party. If
following the cost hearing or, if no hearing is requested, after the
implementation of the eradication order, the Hearing Officer determines that
all or a portion of the costs are appropriately chargeable to the eradication
order, the Hearing Officer determines that all or a portion of the costs are
appropriately chargeable to the eradication accounting, or an amount thereof
determined as appropriate by the Hearing Officer, shall be due and payable by
the owner or responsible party within thirty (30) days. Any amount of
eradication charges assessed by the Hearing Officer that are less than the
total amount set forth in the eradication accounting shall be explained by
written letter from the Hearing Officer to the Town Council.
   (5)   Lien. As to such property where the responsible party in the property
owner, if all or any portion of the assessed eradication charges remain unpaid
after thirty (30) days, pursuant to the authority created by law, the portion
thereof that remains unpaid along with interest and collection expenses
including a reasonable attorney's fee, shall constitute a lien on the property
that was the subject of the eradication effort. The Town Manager shall present
a Resolution of Lien to the Town Council, and upon passage and adoption
thereof, shall cause a certified copy of the Lien to be recorded with the Wake
County Clerk of Court's Office.
(Ord. of 7-5-05, § 84.308; Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)

   (a)   Common utility colors and paint type. Any gas, electric, telephone,
water, sewer, cable telephone and other utility operating in the Town shall
paint its above surface metal fixtures with a uniform paint type and color that
meets with the approval of the Town Manager.
   (b)   Condition encroachment permits. All encroachment permits issued by the
Town shall, among such other things, be conditioned on:

encroaching object of a type and nature that is acceptable to the Town Manager,
or the Town Manager's designee;

object; or
      (4)   The permittee's providing the Town with sufficient matching paint
and/or anti-graffiti material on demand for use in the painting of the
encroaching object containing graffiti.
   (c)   Condition site plans and special use permits. In approving parcel
maps, conditional use permits, variances, or other similar land use
entitlements, the Town shall consider imposing any or all of the following
conditions, or other similar or related conditions, at the public hearing
required by law for approval of the tentative or parcel map, conditional use
permit, variance or other similar land use entitlement:
      (1)   Use of anti-graffiti material. Developer shall apply an anti-
graffiti material of a type and nature that is acceptable to the Town Manager,
or the designee of the Town Manager, to the publicly viewable surfaces on the
improvements to be constructed at the site deemed by Town Manager, or designee,
to be likely to attract graffiti;
      (2)   Right of access to remove graffiti. Developer shall grant, prior to
resale of any of the parcels that are within the territory of the map, the
right of entry over and access to such parcels upon forty-eight (48) hours

used for nonresidential purposes that has been defaced with graffiti more than
five (5) times in twelve (12) months shall be declared a public nuisance and
required to be retrofitted, at the cost of the property owner, with features or
qualities as may be established by the Town as necessary to reduce the
attractiveness of the surface for graffiti, or as necessary to permit more
convenient or efficient removal of graffiti. In exercising the authority
hereunder, the Town may not impose a cost on the property owner of greater than
two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00).
      (2)   At Town's cost. The owner of property used for nonresidential
purposes on which is located a surface of a structure that has been defaced

(Ord. No. 21-07-21-003, 7-21-21)
Sec. 92.04. Code Enforcement officials.
   The officer is hereby designated and appointed to enforce the provisions of
this article and to exercise the duties and powers prescribed herein including:
      (1)   Investigate the condition of buildings within the Town in order to
determine which buildings are abandoned or in violation of this article;
      (2)   Enter upon premises for the purpose of making inspections;
      (3)   Administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses and receive
evidence;

provide for the repair, closing or demolition of such buildings;
      (6)   Keep an accurate record of the results of inspections, complaints,
and findings made under this article and all enforcement proceedings begun
pursuant to the provisions of this article; and
      (7)   Perform such other duties as may be prescribed herein, or assigned
to the officer by the Town Council.
(Ord. No. 21-07-21-003, 7-21-21)
Sec. 92.05. Standards for enforcement.
   (a)   Every unsafe building within the Town shall be deemed in violation of
this article whenever such building constitutes a hazard to the health, safety,
or welfare of the Town's citizens. Those conditions which may be found to
create such a hazard are:
      (1)   The attraction of insects or rodents;
      (2)   Susceptibility to fires or any other hazardous condition or
circumstance;
      (3)   Dangerous conditions constituting a threat to children;
      (4)   Frequent use by vagrants;
      (5)   Susceptibility to vandalism;
      (6)   Defective construction;
      (7)   Overloaded structural parts; or
      (8)   Dilapidation, deterioration, or decay.
   (b)   In making the preliminary determination of whether or not a building
is unsafe in violation of this article, the Code Enforcement Official may, by
way of illustration and not limitation, consider the presence or absence of the
following conditions:
      (1)   Holes or cracks in the building's floors, walls, ceilings or roof
which might attract or admit rodents and insects or become breeding places for
rodents and insects.
      (2)   The collection of garbage or rubbish in or near the building which
might attract rodents and insects or become breeding places for rodents and
insects.
      (3)   Violations of the state building code, the state electrical code,
or the fire codes which constitute a fire hazard in such building.
      (4)   The collection of garbage, rubbish or combustible materials which
constitute a fire hazard in such building.
      (5)   The use of such building or nearby grounds or facilities by
children as a play area.
      (6)   Violations of the state building code which might result in danger
to children using the building or nearby grounds or facilities as a play area.
      (7)   Repeated use of such building by transients and vagrants, in the
absence of sanitary facilities, for living, sleeping, cooking, or eating.
(Ord. No. 21-07-21-003, 7-21-21)
Sec. 92.06. Inspections.
   (a)   Authority to enter. For the purpose of making inspections and
otherwise performing duties under this article, the officer may authorize the
Town's Building Inspectors to enter, examine and survey at all reasonable times
all buildings for the purpose of performing the duty of safeguarding the health
and safety of the general public.
   (b)   Obtaining a warrant. Whenever an owner, occupant, or agent thereof
shall deny the Town Building Inspector reasonable access to any premises for
purposes of making inspections, the officer or Town Building Inspector shall
obtain a warrant to inspect as authorized by G.S. 15-27.2.
   (c)   Emergency cases. In cases where it appears that there is an imminent
danger to life or safety of any person unless an unsafe building is immediately
repaired, vacated, closed, or demolished, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
order its immediate repair, evacuation, closing or demolition as they may deem
necessary, notwithstanding the other provisions of this article. The officer
may take the temporary measures necessary to safeguard persons from immediate
danger of collapse of such building and is authorized to close temporarily
sidewalks, streets, and other buildings in places adjacent to such unsafe
building and prohibit the same from being used, pending the elimination of the
danger. The cost of emergency measures taken shall become a lien against the
premises upon which the emergency condition existed upon confirmation of the
cost by the Town Council. The confirmation shall take place only after ten (10)
days written notice to the owner of the premises where the nuisance existed.
The Council may also notify any other parties of interest of the emergency
condition.
(Ord. No. 21-07-21-003, 7-21-21; Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 92.07. Procedure for enforcement.
   (a)   Preliminary investigation. On the officer's own motion, on request of
any public authority, or upon receipt of a petition signed by any five (5)
residents of the Town alleging that any building is unsafe, the officer shall
authorize the Building Inspector to undertake a preliminary investigation of
the premises.
   (b)   Notice. If the preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such
charges, the officer shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner of the
building charged as unsafe and all parties in interest in the building a
complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that an administrative
hearing will be held before the officer or the officer's designated agent at a
place therein fixed, not later than ten (10) days after the date of the notice
pursuant to subsection 92.07(e). A notice of the pending proceedings shall also
be posted a conspicuous place on the premises affected at least ten (10) days
prior to the date of the administrative hearing. Notice of such administrative
hearing shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition
relating to such building, if any. The owner shall have the right to file an
answer to the complaint in writing with the officer before the time fixed on
the complaint or to appear in person and give testimony at the place and time
fixed in the complaint for the administrative hearing. The owner may also give
written authorization for any party in interest in the building to appear on
the owner's behalf at the administrative hearing.
   (c)   Administrative hearing. The purpose of the administrative hearing is
to determine the existence of any of those hazardous conditions listed in
section
92.05 surveyed in the officer's preliminary investigation. Any person desiring
to do so may attend such administrative hearing and give evidence in the matter
being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall
not be controlling in administrative hearings before the officer. The owner may
file with the officer a written statement agreeing that the building referred
to in the complaint is unsafe, that the same should be demolished, and agreeing
that all costs of demolition shall be a lien in the nature of a special
assessment upon the property on which the building is located. In such cases,
the officer may proceed with the demolition without complying with the
additional provisions of this section.
   (d)   Issuance of order after hearing. If, after such notice and
administrative hearing, the officer shall determine that the building under
consideration is unsafe under the terms of this article, the officer shall
state in writing their findings of fact in support of that determination and
shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order. If any
party in interest other than owner took part in the administrative hearing, the
order shall also be served on that person. The Town at its discretion may also
serve the order on other parties of interest in the building who did not take
part in the administrative hearing. The order shall require the owner, within
the time specified in the order, but not less than sixty (60) days, to repair,
alter or improve the building in order to render it safe, or to close such
building, or to demolish and remove such building. Any unsafe building ordered
to be closed or to be demolished and removed must immediately be vacated upon
notice of the order. The officer may require, upon notice of the order, any
unsafe building to be repaired, altered, or improved to be vacated until such
time as the officer determines the building has been made safe. The officer
must affix a copy of the order on the unsafe building, and also a notice
stating: "This building is unsafe." For those unsafe buildings which must be or
are required to be vacated, notice shall further state: "This building is
unsafe and unfit for human habitation. Occupation of this building for human
habitation is prohibited and unlawful." It is the owner's responsibility to
ensure that the building is immediately vacated of all occupants until such
time as the officer determines the building has been made safe. In its order
the Town may permit a specified party in interest to carry out the order
provided that the specified party in interest demonstrates at the hearing its
proper legal authority to fulfill the order by making the building safe. Such
permission granted by the Town to a specified party in interest shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, the owner's duty to fully comply with the
order and does not relieve the owner of any legal responsibilities.
   (e)   Methods of service of complaints and orders.
   (1)   Complaints or orders issued by the officer shall be served upon
persons either personally or by registered or certified mail. When service is
made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also
be sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered
or certified mail is unclaimed or refused so long as the regular mail is not
returned by the post office within ten (10) days after the mailing.
   (2)   If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the officer in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, or, if the owners are known but have refused to accept service by
registered or certified mail, and the officer makes an affidavit to that
effect, then the serving of the complaint or order upon the owners or other
persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in
the town at least once, no later than one (1) week prior to the administrative
hearing. Nothing in the section limits the Town, in its discretion, from
providing additional notice by publication in a newspaper having general
circulation in the Town.
(Ord. No. 21-07-21-003, 7-21-21; Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 92.08. Filing of notice of lis pendens.
   Lis pendens (a pending suit), in general terms, is a notice filed on public
records for the purpose of warning all persons that the title to certain
property is in litigation, and they are in danger of being bound by an adverse
judgment. Upon the issuance of a complaint and notice of hearing or order
pursuant thereto, a notice of lis pendens, with a copy of the complaint and
notice of hearing or order attached thereto, may be filed by the officer in the
office of the Clerk of Superior Court for the county, as provided in G.S. 1-
120.2. The officer shall serve a copy of the notice of lis pendens upon the
owners and parties in interest in the building, including any lien holders and
tenants who may be determined by the exercise of reasonable diligence. The
officer may have the notice of lis pendens canceled at such time as the
building is brought into conformity with this article by sending to the Clerk
of Superior Court a notice asking that the notice of lis pendens be canceled.
(Ord. No. 21-07-21-003, 7-21-21; Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 92.09. Failure to comply with order.
   (a)   Failure to comply. It shall be unlawful for the owner of any building
to fail, neglect, or refuse to repair, alter, or improve the same, or to fail,
neglect or refuse to vacate and close or vacate and demolish and remove the
same, upon order of the officer duly made and served as herein provided, within
the time specified in such order. Each day that any such failure, neglect, or
refusal to comply with such order continues past the time for compliance
specified therein shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.
   (b)   No occupancy upon order. It shall be unlawful for the owner of any
building, with respect to which an order has been issued pursuant to section
92.07 of this article, to occupy or permit the occupancy of the same after the
time prescribed in such order for its vacation. Each day that such occupancy
continues after such prescribed time shall constitute a separate and distinct
offense. It shall also be unlawful for any person other than the owner to
occupy a building to which an order has been issued pursuant to section 92.07
of this article. This shall constitute an offense charged against the occupant,
separate and distinct from any offense by the owner. Each day that such
occupancy by a non-owner continues after such prescribed time shall constitute
a separate and distinct offense.
   (c)   Civil offense. Unless specifically provided otherwise, violation of
this article shall be a civil offense. If an owner fails to comply with an
order to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close, or to vacate and
demolish and remove any unsafe building, anyone, all, or combination of the
enforcement actions authorized by law may be taken, including those set forth
herein.
   (1)   Civil penalty for owner. If the owner of any unsafe building shall
fail to comply with an order of the officer to repair, alter, or improve or to
vacate and close or vacate and demolish and remove the same within the time
specified therein, or if any building is occupied in violation of this article
or any valid order or decision of the officer or Town Council made pursuant to
this article, the owner may be subject to a civil penalty (See Fee Schedule)
for the first day following the expiration of such order or following a
determination that an unsafe building has been reoccupied in violation of this
section, as the case may be. In each instance, a penalty (See Fee Schedule) per
day may be imposed for each subsequent day that the order remains unsatisfied,
or the unsafe building remains occupied in violation of an order. If an owner
fails to pay the civil penalty within ten (10) days after being notified of the
amount due, the Town may recover the civil penalty together with all costs by
filing one (1) or more civil actions in the general court of justice in a suit
to collect a debt. The Town Attorney is hereby authorized to file suit on
behalf of the Town to collect any civil penalties, and the Town Manager is
hereby authorized to verify and sign complaints on behalf of the Town in such
suits.
   (2)   Civil penalty for non-owner occupant. In addition to the owner's fines
set forth in subsection
92.09(c)(1) above, if a non-owner occupant of any unsafe building shall fail to
comply with an order of the officer to vacate the building within the time
specified in the order, the occupant may be subject to a civil penalty (See Fee
Schedule) for the first day following the expiration of such order or following
a determination that an unsafe building has been reoccupied in violation of
this section, as the case may be. In each instance, a penalty (See Fee
Schedule) per day may be imposed for each subsequent day that the unsafe
building remains occupied in violation of an order. If a non-owner occupant
fails to pay the civil penalty within ten (10) days after being notified of the
amount due, the Town may recover the civil penalty together with all costs by
filing one (1) or more civil actions in the general court of justice in the
nature of a suit to collect a debt. The Town Attorney is hereby authorized to
file suit on behalf of the town to collect any civil penalties, and the Town
Manager is hereby authorized to verify and sign complaints on behalf of the
town in such suits.
   (d)   Administrative fees. In addition to any other charge, any owner of a
building located within the Town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction may be
subject to an administrative fee (See Fee Schedule) upon an inspection hearing
disclosing the building to be unsafe. In addition to any other charge, any
owner of a building located within the Town and its extraterritorial
jurisdiction may be subject to an administrative fee (See Fee Schedule) upon
any additional inspection hearing disclosing the building to be unsafe within
the same 12-month period. The property owner may also be assessed any costs
incurred in obtaining service including legal publication of notice of
complaint charges, hearing notice and findings of fact and orders related to
the building.
   (e)   Enforcement of order. If the owner of any unsafe building shall fail
to comply with an order of the officer to repair, alter, or improve or to
vacate and close the same within the time specified therein, or if the owner of
any unsafe building shall fail to comply with an order of the officer to
demolish and remove the same within the time specified therein, or if any
building is erected, constructed, altered, repaired, converted, maintained, or
used in violation of this article or any valid order or decision of the officer
or Town Council made pursuant to this article, and court ordered relief has not
been sought or has not been granted as provided in section 92.10 of this
article, the officer may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to
prevent the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration or use
of a building in violation of this article or in any way inimical to the health
and safely of the Town's citizens; to correct or abate the violation; to
prevent the occupancy of the building; or for any other purpose authorized by
G.S. 160D-404 and other law. Such action shall include repairing, altering,
improving, vacating, closing, or demolishing and removing the building, as
required by the order. Before repairing, altering, improving, vacating,
closing, or demolishing and removing the building, the officer must take the
following additional steps.
   (1)   Enforcement action pursuant to ordinance. The officer must submit to
the Town Council for adoption of a resolution describing the building and
ordering the officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article with
respect to the building which the officer found to be unsafe. Such resolution
shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the County and
shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. The
officer must affix a copy of the resolution on the unsafe building, and a
notice stating: "This building is unsafe and unfit for human habitation; the
use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and
unlawful." Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, in accordance
with G.S. 160D-1129, occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a
class 3 misdemeanor. If, after adoption of such resolution, any occupant fails
to comply with an order to vacate the building, the officer may file a civil
action in the name of the Town to remove such occupant without further notice
regardless as to whether the occupant is also the owner of the building.
   (2)   Additional resolution one year later. If the officer shall have issued
an order ordering a building to be repaired or vacated and closed, and such
building has remained unrepaired or vacated and closed for a period of one (1)
year, either by action of the owner as provided in subsection
92.09(b) above or following the adoption of a resolution by the Board of
Commissioners pursuant to subsection
92.09(e)(1), then, if the Town Council shall find that the owner has abandoned
the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the building in order to
render it safe, and that the continuation of the building in its vacated and
closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals and welfare of
the Town in that the building would continue to deteriorate, would create a
fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would
attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to
blight and the deterioration of property values in the area, or would render

representative of the Town, other than the officer issuing the final decision
or order, or the Town Council upon proper notice. Except as provided herein,

the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to the
appellant), a suspension of the officer's requirement would cause imminent
peril to life or property. In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended

of this chapter. The Administrator shall have the following powers and duties:
   (a)   To investigate the dwelling conditions, and to inspect dwellings and
dwelling units located in the Town, in order to determine which dwellings and
dwelling units are unfit for human habitation and for compliance with this
chapter and other applicable ordinances, and for the purpose of carrying out
the objectives of this chapter with respect to the repair, closing or
demolition of such dwellings and dwelling units;
   (b)   To take such action, together with other appropriate departments and
agencies, public and private, as may be necessary to achieve rehabilitation of
any dwelling or dwelling unit which is deteriorated;
   (c)   To keep a record of the results of inspections made under this chapter
and an inventory of those dwellings that do not meet the minimum standards of
fitness herein prescribed;
   (d)   To administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses and receive
evidence;
   (e)   To enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations and

   (f)   To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents, and employees
as they deem necessary to assist in carrying out the purposes of this chapter,

(Ord. No. 09-01-05-001, 1-5-09; Ord. No. 21-07-21-004, 7-21-21; Ord. No. 24-11-
20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 93A.13. - Inspections; duty of owners and occupants.
   The following shall constitute duties of owners and occupants of a dwelling
or dwelling unit with respect to inspections:
   (a)   For the purpose of making inspections, the Administrator is hereby
authorized to enter, examine and survey all dwellings, dwelling units, rooming
houses, rooming units and the premises associated therewith only when there is
reasonable cause to believe that unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise hazardous or
unlawful conditions may exist in the residential building or structure. When
the Administrator determines that a safety hazard exists in a dwelling unit
within a multifamily building, which, in the opinion of the Administrator poses
an immediate threat to the occupant, the Administrator may inspect in the
absence of a specific complaint and actual knowledge of the unsafe condition,
additional dwelling units to determine whether the same safety hazard exists.
   (b)   Reasonable cause shall mean any one of the following conditions:
      (1)   The landlord or owner has a history of more than two (2) verified
violations of the housing code within a 12-month period;
      (2)   There has been a complaint that substandard conditions exist within
the building or there has been a request that the building be inspected;
      (3)   The Administrator has actual knowledge of an unsafe condition
within the building; and/or
      (4)   Violations of the housing code are visible from off the property.
   (c)   The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house
or rooming unit, or the person in charge thereof, shall give the Administrator
free access to such dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house or rooming unit and
its premises for the purposes of such inspection, examination and survey when
reasonable cause for inspection exists or the subject dwelling is in a
multifamily building as described in subsection (a).
   (d)   Every occupant of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house or rooming
unit shall give the owner thereof, or their agent or employee, access to any
part of such dwelling or dwelling unit and its premises at all reasonable times
for the purpose of making such repairs or alterations as are necessary to
effect compliance with the provisions of this ordinance or with any lawful
order issued pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance.
      When permission to inspect a dwelling or its premises is denied by the
owner/occupant, the Administrator must obtain a warrant to inspect under state
law. State law provides for the issuance of warrants for the conducting of
inspections authorized by law.
      The consent of the tenant/occupant who is in actual possession and
control of the premises is sufficient to authorize an inspection without a
warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the owner had objected to the
warrantless search. When faced with a situation where permission to inspect is
denied, the Administrator may seek the advice of the Town Attorney.
(Ord. No. 09-01-05-001, 1-5-09; Ord. No. 21-07-21-004, 7-21-21; Ord. No. 24-11-
20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 93A.14. - Procedure for enforcement.
   (a)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is
filed with the Administrator by a tenant or occupant, a party of interest, a
public authority or agency or at least five (5) residents of the Town charging
that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, or whenever
it appears to the Administrator that any dwelling or dwelling unit may be unfit
for human habitation, the Administrator shall, if their preliminary
investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served
upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit a
notice of violation stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing
will be held before the Administrator at a place therein fixed, not less than
ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days after the serving of the complaint.
Such notice shall be served in the manner prescribed in G.S. 160D-1206.
   The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to
the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the
place and time fixed in the complaint before the Administrator. Notice of such
hearing shall also be given to at least one (1) of the persons signing a
petition relating to such dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend
such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of
evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in
hearings before the Administrator. The Administrator shall have discretion to
make findings concerning the matters addressed at the hearings.
   In the event the condition of the dwelling, or dwelling unit creates an
imminent risk to the health and safety of occupants or the public, the
Administrator is empowered to take any emergency measure provided by law to
protect the public or the occupants of the dwelling or dwelling unit.
   (b)   Lis pendens. Upon issuance of a notice of violation and notice of
hearing pursuant to this section, the Administrator, in their sole discretion,
may cause the filing/recording of a notice of lis pendens or other appropriate
notice in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court and Register of Deeds of
Wake County. The lis pendens shall be cross-indexed in accordance with indexing
procedures of the North Carolina General Statutes. The Administrator shall
cause a copy of the notice of lis pendens to be served upon the owners and
other parties in interest at the time of filing in accordance with G.S 160D-
1206.
   Upon compliance with the requirements of any order based upon such complaint
and hearing the Administrator shall direct the Clerk of Superior Court and
Register of Deeds to cancel the notice of lis pendens and shall file any
documentation required by the court to cancel the lis pendens.
   (c)   Procedure after hearing. After such notice and hearing, the
Administrator shall determine whether the dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit
for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated. If
the Administrator determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is
deteriorated, they shall state in writing their findings of fact in support of
such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner
thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter, or improve
such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards established
by this chapter within a specified period of time, not to exceed ninety (90)
days. Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close such
dwelling or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations, and improvements
have been made.
   If the Administrator determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, they shall
record in writing their findings of fact to support such determination, and
shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order either
directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling or
dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards established by this chapter,
or else to vacate and remove or demolish the same within a specified period of
time not to exceed ninety (90) days. If the Administrator finds that repair,
alteration, or improvement of such dwelling or dwelling unit cannot reasonably
be accomplished or that continued occupation and residence during the term of
repair is not safe for occupants, they may require that all occupants
immediately vacate the property.
   (d)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated or dilapidated
dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the
Administrator to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and close the same
within the time specified therein, the Administrator shall submit to the Town
Council at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney to
petition the Superior Court for an order directing such owner to comply with
the order of the Administrator, as authorized by G.S. 160D-1208(e), or to
vacate the dwelling pursuant to G.S. 160D-1203(3).
      (2)   In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a dwelling or dwelling
unit to comply with an order of the Administrator issued pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter, and upon adoption by the Town Council of an
ordinance authorizing and directing them to do so, as provided by G.S. 160D-
1203(4) and this chapter, the Administrator may proceed to cause such dwelling
or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered or improved to comply with the minimum
standards of fitness established by this chapter, or to be vacated and closed
and removed or demolished, as directed by the ordinance of the Town Council.
         When authorized by the Town Council, the Administrator shall cause to
be posted on the main entrance of such dwelling or dwelling unit a placard with
the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation: the use or
occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful".
Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor.
      (3)   Summary ejectment. If an owner or occupant fails to comply with a
valid order to vacate a dwelling, the Administrator may initiate proceedings to
remove the occupant as provided under G.S. 160D-1203(8).
   (e)   Appeals from orders of Administrator. An appeal from any decision or
order of the Administrator may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby. Any
appeal from the Administrator shall be taken within ten (10) days from the
receipt of the decision or service of the order, and shall be taken by filing
with the Administrator and with the Board of Adjustment a written notice of
appeal, which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon
the filing of any notice of appeal, the Administrator shall forthwith transmit
to the Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which
the decision appealed from was made.
   A decision of the Administrator shall remain in force during the appeal
until modified or reversed, provided that when an appeal is from a decision of
the Administrator requiring the person aggrieved to perform any act, the appeal
shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the
Board of Adjustment, unless the Administrator certifies to the Board of
Adjustment, after the notice of appeal is filed with them, that by reason of
the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to the
appellant), a suspension of this requirement would cause imminent peril to life
or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a
temporary restraining order or injunction issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction. Such an order may be granted for due cause shown upon not less
than one (1) day's written notice to the Administrator, by the Board of
Adjustment, or by the Wake County Superior Court upon petition made pursuant to
G.S. 160D-1208.
   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all
appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its
decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent
or attorney. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, in whole or in
part, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such
decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to
that end it shall have all the powers of the Administrator, but the concurring
vote of four-fifths (4/5) members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary
to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Administrator.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have power also in passing upon appeals, when
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out
the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance
to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance
shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice
done.
   Every decision of the Board of Adjustment may be subject to review by
proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within the Wake County
Superior Court within fifteen (15) days after the written decision of the Board
of Adjustment, but not otherwise.
   (f)   Petition to Superior Court for restraining order by owner. Any person
aggrieved by an order issued by the Administrator or a decision rendered by the
Board of Adjustment shall have the right, within thirty (30) days after
issuance of the order or rendering of the decision, to petition the Superior
Court for an order restraining the Administrator pending a final disposition of
the cause, as provided by G.S. 160D-1208(d).

Sec. 93A.15. - Methods of service of complaints and orders.
   Complaints or orders issued by the Administrator shall be served upon person
(s) either personally or by registered or certified mail. If the whereabouts of
such persons are unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the
Administrator in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the Administrator shall
make an affidavit to that effect, and the serving of such complaint or order
upon such person may be made by publishing the same at least once no later than

(Ord. No. 08-04-07-001, § 3, 4-7-08; Ord. No. 14-02-19-002, § 3, 2-19-14; Ord.
No. 17-02-06-002, § 1, 2-6-17; Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 93B.04. - Requirement to obtain and maintain license.
   (a)   Permit required. It shall be unlawful for an owner to rent, to receive
rental income from, or to offer for rent any RRD required to be permitted under
this part (1) without first obtaining a permit for the dwelling, or (2) when
the permit issued under this part is revoked, suspended, or otherwise invalid.
The owner of an RRD shall hold a permit under this part for each RRD and shall
abide by the standards herein in order to be eligible to retain the permit.
Each RRD is a separate dwelling for all purposes, including application,
payment of fees, and permitting.
   (b)   Application. 
   (1)   Every application for the rental occupancy permit prescribed herein
shall be upon a form approved by, and filed with, the Code Enforcement Officer.
Every application shall be made under oath and shall contain the information
required to show that the owner is eligible for a permit under this chapter and
sufficient information to enable the Development Services Department to
determine that the standards of this chapter are being, or prior to occupancy
will be, met at any RRD to be permitted.
   (2)   Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete application and a
nonrefundable application fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00), the Code
Enforcement Officer shall review each application and determine whether the
application should be approved. The Code Enforcement Officer shall deny any
application which does not satisfy the minimum requirements of this section and
any application submitted by an owner during a period of permit revocation.
   (3)   Any approved applicant shall pay three hundred dollars ($300.00) for
the first year of the permit at the time such permit is issued. The annual fee
for subsequent years shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such fee shall be
due and payable when the permit issues with annual fees for subsequent years
are due and payable annually.
   (4)   An application shall be accompanied by a notarized statement from a
competent person agreeing to accept service of any violation notices or any
order from the Town for violations at the RRD and an address, phone number, and
facsimile or electronic mail address [to which] such correspondence shall be
sent. Such address or other information may be updated by providing written
notice to the Town, provided that if the person accepting service is changed,
another notarized statement of acceptance must be supplied.
   (5)   The refusal of service by the service agent of a notice of violation
or order, or a notice of violation or orders returned undelivered, shall be
grounds to suspend or to revoke the permit. When a notice or order under this
section is returned undelivered, the Code Enforcement Officer shall require the
appointment of a process service agent in North Carolina as a condition for
continuing to hold the permit. Failure by the owner to maintain a duly
appointed service agent, or to appoint a service agent within ten (10) days of
being so ordered, shall be grounds to revoke the rental occupancy permit.
   (c)   Duration of permit and termination. 
   (1)   Any person required to obtain a rental occupancy permit must maintain
licensure for a period of no less than two (2) years. If a violation of the
Town Code occurs while permitted, the permit requirement is extended for the
RRD covered by the permit for two (2) years following the date such violation
is remedied as determined by the Town.
   (2)   To be released from the requirement for a rental occupancy permit, the
owner must have had no violation of any of the Code provisions for the two-year
period immediately prior to expiration of the permit and the dwelling must be
approved as compliant with the Code in a final inspection. Final inspections
will be conducted only upon the request of the owner. If the owner fails to
request an inspection within ninety (90) days after the date the permit
requirement was due to expire, the Code Enforcement Officer, after written
notice to the owner and tenant, may inspect the permitted dwelling for
compliance with Town Code provisions, but is not required to do so.
   (d)   Public access. The Inspections Department shall maintain a list of all
dwellings and dwelling units which are RRDs and subject to the permit
requirements of this chapter for public inspection. The Inspections Department
shall update this list of RRDs at least once every quarter.
   (e)   Subsequent owners responsible for maintenance and compliance with such
permit. If the new owner of the dwelling unit is a bona fide new owner, they
may request that the Code Enforcement Officer remove the requirement that the
dwelling have a rental occupancy permit, and:
   (1)   Have paid all outstanding fees and civil penalties for the dwelling;
   (2)   Have no violations or pending violations of this chapter issued to the
new owner; and
   (3)   Obtain from the Code Enforcement Officer a determination that the
dwelling complies with the Code.

Sec. 93B.05. - Requirements of permittees.
   (a)   Permittee responsibilities. 
      (1)   Any person required by this chapter to have a permit for an RRD
shall file a complete application for any required permit within ten (10) days
following notice from the Code Enforcement Officer that this chapter applies to
the dwelling, which timely application shall constitute compliance with this
chapter unless and until the application is denied.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful to rent, to receive rental income from, or to
offer for rent a dwelling subject to the permit requirements of this chapter
beginning ten (10) days after service of notice by the Code Enforcement Officer
that a permit is required under this part unless a complete application has
been submitted for the dwelling.
      (3)   Any permittee shall respond to any department making contact,
either in person or by telephone within two (2) business days after being
contacted at the telephone number, electronic mail address, street address or
post office box, or facsimile provided in the application. The permittee shall
submit to the department making the contact, within three (3) days of the
notice, written documentation of the response. The permittee may designate a
licensed rental agency as the person responsible for responding to calls for
assistance from the Town departments. The designated agency must have at least
one (1) agent located in the Town or within twenty-five (25) miles of the
Town's planning jurisdiction who is authorized by the agency to respond to
calls. The designation shall be effective only after a notarized statement is
submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer in which the responsible employee is
identified and agrees to accept the duty.
      (4)   The permittee shall maintain the dwelling so that it does not
violate any applicable provision of the Town Code.
      (5)   The permittee shall maintain a current list of occupants. Upon
request, by Town inspectors, police, and fire and emergency response personnel
investigating violations or potential violations of this chapter, the permittee
shall present the list of occupants to the investigating personnel.
      (6)   The permittee shall obtain a certificate of compliance from the
Code Enforcement Officer before a vacant RRD with an unresolved notice of
violation of the Housing Code is occupied by a tenant.
      (7)   Within thirty (30) days of the designation of a dwelling as RRD,
the owner shall deliver a written notification, using the form approved by the
Code Enforcement Officer to all interested parties as set forth below in a
manner permitting proof of delivery. Such parties shall include, whenever
applicable:
         a. Each tenant;
         b. Any new tenant, but such notice must be provided prior to entering
a rental agreement;
         c. Any association or governing body which controls the property
commonly owned and associated with the dwelling; and
         d. Any co-owners of the RRD, development, or real property on which
the RRD is located.
The permittee shall provide proof of the delivery to the Code Enforcement
Officer along with a copy of the notification within ten (10) days of receipt
of proof of delivery. Such notice must include a notification that the dwelling
is an RRD and explain the possible enforcement actions which can be applied for
violations of the rental occupancy permit.
      (8)   The permittee shall comply with the requirements of this chapter in
all respects.
   (b)   Nonpermittee responsibilities. 
      (1)   Any person who is not the record owner or a tenant of an RRD may
avoid sanctions and penalties under this chapter by filing an affidavit or
notarized statement under oath that the person is not the owner or tenant of
the RRD in question and has terminated any relationship with the owner or
tenant concerning control, management, or rental responsibility for the RRD and
that the failure to comply with the noticed violations was caused by the record
owner's or tenant's refusal to comply with the chapter. This includes anyone
who holds a G.S. 105-41(a)(8) or (9) privilege license as a rental agency and
anyone who acts as a service agent for the owner or tenant. Any mortgagee of
record, not otherwise defined as an owner, shall be deemed compliant with this
chapter unless and until the other owners of the RRD fail to comply with
notices of violations or orders, including for the payment of civil penalties.
A mortgagee of record, not otherwise defined as an owner, shall not be liable
for civil penalties or administrative fees in excess of the liability of the
other owners.
      (2)   Prior to or within thirty (30) days of receipt of a notice of
violation and notice that a dwelling will be required to obtain a residential
occupancy permit, an owner may provide evidence to the Code Enforcement Officer
that: (1) the activities, violations or abatements which could cause a property
or dwelling to be deemed an RRD are the result of tenant behavior or action,
and (2) the owner (or other responsible entity) has begun and is diligently
pursuing eviction of a tenant, including legal action if necessary, on the
basis of the tenant's behavior or actions. Such action shall not alleviate the
need to apply for an RRD permit in the time prescribed by this chapter unless
the owner takes action to begin the eviction or removal process within ten (10)
days, provides evidence of the same to the Code Enforcement Officer, and
provides evidence of diligent pursuit thereafter. An owner shall also be
entitled to relief from any subsequent violation(s) that occur while the action
to evict the tenant is pending upon the same showing to the Code Enforcement
Officer.
      (3)   In no event may an owner avoid the requirements of this chapter for
more than two (2) noticed violations in any three-year period per dwelling. Any
owner who evicted or removed the tenant as a result of the tenant causing such
violation(s), whether such removal is the result of a tenant voluntarily
vacating the dwelling or as a result of court action, shall be deemed compliant
with this chapter upon filing with the Code Enforcement Officer an affidavit or
other notarized statement stating that: (1) the tenant cited for the violation
no longer resides at the dwelling, or (2) the attached complaint was filed to
evict the tenant and listing the actions showing diligence in effecting the
eviction and attaching a copy of the signed lease with the required right to
evict. If the court has denied the owner's diligent pursuit to evict the
tenant, it shall be sufficient if the owner does not renew the tenant's lease
at the end of the then current term and instead terminates the lease.

making the owner ineligible to hold a residential rental occupancy permit for a
period of up to two (2) years.
      (3)   Twenty (20) days following service on the permittee of a written
notice by the Inspections Director which describes the nature of any violation,
the Inspections Director may revoke a permit if it is determined that the
permittee has violated any provision of this chapter and other means of
enforcement have failed to deter the permittee from operating in violation of
this chapter.
   (d)   Probationary status. Following a determination that a permittee under
this chapter has violated the provisions of this chapter, the permittee shall
be sent a notice that the permit is on a probationary status and will be
suspended or revoked if the permittee commits further violations as set forth
herein.
   (e)   Reinstatement. The Code Enforcement Officer shall reinstate a
residential rental occupancy permit when the owner requesting reinstatement has
paid all outstanding fees and civil penalties for the dwelling and the owner
has no pending appeals of any notices or orders and:
      (1)   Within ten (10) working days of the service of the order, the owner
obtains approval from the Code Enforcement Officer of a management plan for the
dwelling to achieve full compliance with the standards herein as promptly as
feasible and, in no event, in more than thirty (30) days, or such time as the
Code Enforcement Officer finds reasonable; or
      (2)   Within ten (10) working days of the service of the order, the owner
by power of attorney appoints a licensed rental agency to manage the property
for the two-year period following the approval, which agency agrees to remedy
any existing violation of the Code as promptly as feasible and, in no event, in
more than thirty (30) days, or such time as the Code Enforcement Officer finds
reasonable; or
      (3)   Within ten (10) days of the service of the order, a new owner of
the RRD, who is not a prior owner, not related by marriage or within the fifth
degree of kinship to the seller, and is not a business affiliate of the prior
owner, submits an affidavit so attesting along with proof of title transfer,
pays all outstanding fees and civil penalties, and shows the Code Enforcement
Officer that the dwelling complies with the standards.
   (f)   No criminal act. Any person violating any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be subject to the civil penalties and permit revocations set
forth. No violation of this chapter shall be deemed a criminal violation and a
violation shall not be a misdemeanor or infraction pursuant to G.S. 14-4.

Sec. 93B.07. - Appeal.
   Any permittee, owner, or other person served with notice or an order under
the provisions of this chapter may appeal the notice or order in the following
manner:
   (1)   An appeal must be filed in writing with the Code Enforcement Officer
within thirty (30) days after service of the written notice or order of the
Code Enforcement Officer. The written appeal shall identify the application of
the article at issue and provide the reasons the petitioner contends that it
was wrongly applied and any supporting documentation. An appeal challenging a
notice that a dwelling is qualified as an RRD pursuant to this chapter may only
include an appeal of the basis for the citations resulting in the determination
that the dwelling is qualified as an RRD if such violations have been
successfully challenged or are in the process of being challenged.
   (2)   Unless the Code Enforcement Officer decides to allow the requested
relief based on the appeal request, the Code Enforcement Officer shall forward
each appeal request to the BOA for a decision on the issue. The BOA shall
consider both the applicable code provisions and equitable factors in resolving
the appeal. If the person who files an appeal of a notice that a dwelling is
qualified as an RRD shows that the owner did not cause and, with the use of
reasonable measures, could not have prevented the actions or activities leading
to the citations which qualified the dwelling as an RRD and that the owner is
using reasonable diligence to correct such violations in a timely fashion, the
BOA may reverse the order or reduce the sanctions imposed.
   (3)   An appeal may be taken from any decision of the BOA by either the
owner or the Town by giving notice of appeal to the Town Council within thirty
(30) days after the final decision of the BOA. Notice of appeal shall be given
by delivery of a written statement to the Town Manager stating the grounds for
the appeal and providing the Town Manager with particular reference to the
meeting at which the issue was heard by the BOA. The written appeal shall
identify the application, violation, or order at issue and provide the reasons
the petitioner contends that it was wrongly applied. The Code Enforcement
Officer shall transmit to the Town Manager all documents constituting the
record upon which the decision by the BOA was made.
   (4)   The Town Council shall fix a reasonable time for the presentation of
oral arguments by the parties and shall give due notice to the petitioner and
the Town Manager. The Town Council shall issue a written determination, within
a reasonable time, stating whether the disputed application of the article will
be approved without change or modified or reversed.
   (5)   All decisions of the Code Enforcement Officer, BOA, and Town Council
shall be served on the petitioner.
   (6)   The enforcement of an order issued by the Code Enforcement Officer
which includes the revocation of a rental occupancy permit shall be stayed upon
the filing of an appeal and until a final order is issued by the Inspections
Director, BOA, or Town Council.

Sec. 93B.09. - Methods of service.
   (a)   Notices, orders or other documents issued pursuant to this chapter
shall be served upon persons either personally or by registered or certified
mail. When service is made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the
notices, orders or other documents may also be sent by regular mail, facsimile
or electronic mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered or
certified mail is unclaimed or refused, or if either the electronic mail,
facsimile or regular mail is not returned within ten (10) days.
   (b)   If the identities of any owners or whereabouts of persons are unknown
and the same cannot be ascertained by the Code Enforcement Officer in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, or if the owners are known but have refused
to accept service by registered or certified mail, then the Code Enforcement
Officer shall make an affidavit to that effect, stating the steps taken to
determine and locate the interested persons, then the serving of such complaint
or order upon such owners or persons may be made by publication in a newspaper
having general circulation in the Town at least once no later than twenty (20)
days after such affidavit is executed. Where such service is by publication, a
notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
premises thereby affected.
   (c)   In order to assist owners who desire to better monitor activities at
their properties, the Code Enforcement Officer shall also notify an owner when
an activity at the property results in a Code citation or violation that may
impact the property under this chapter.

Sec. 96.05. Mandatory standards for land-disturbing activity.
   No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this chapter shall be
undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards:
   (a)   Buffer zone.
   (1)   Standard buffer. No land-disturbing activity during periods of
construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake
or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the
watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the twenty-
five percent (25%) of the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity.
      (i)   Projects on, over or under water. This division shall not apply to
a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to
be located on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse.
      (ii)   Buffer measurement. Unless otherwise provided, the width of a
buffer zone is measured horizontally from the edge of the water to the nearest
edge of the disturbed area, with the twenty-five percent (25%) of the strip
nearer the land-disturbing activity containing natural or artificial means of
confining visible siltation.
   (b)   Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall
be no greater than the angle that can be retained by vegetative cover or other
adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left
exposed will, within 21 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading, be
planted or otherwise provided with temporary or permanent ground cover,
devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. The angle for graded
slopes and fills must be demonstrated to be stable. Stable is the condition
where the soil remains in its original configuration, with or without
mechanical constraints.
   (c)   Fill material. Materials being used as fill shall be consistent with
those described in 15A NCAC 13B.0562 unless the site is permitted by the
Department's Division of Waste Management to operate as a landfill. Not all
materials described in Section .0562 may be suitable to meet geotechnical
considerations of the fill activity and should be evaluated accordingly.
   (d)   Ground cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity that will disturb more
than one acre, or less than one acre as part of a larger common plan of
development, is undertaken on a tract, the person conducting the land-
disturbing activity shall install erosion and sedimentation control devices and
practices that are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-
disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon
and development of the tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent
ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or
development. Except as provided in Section
96.08(c)(4), provisions for a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain
erosion must be accomplished within 90 calendar days following completion of
construction or development.
   (e)   Prior plan approval. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing
activity subject to this chapter unless, thirty (30) or more days prior to
initiating the activity, a plan for the activity is filed with and approved by
the Town. An erosion and sedimentation control plan may be filed less than 30
days prior to initiation of a land-disturbing activity if the plan is submitted
under an approved express permit program. The land-disturbing activity may be
initiated and conducted in accordance with the plan once the plan has been
approved. The Town shall forward to the Director of the Division of Water
Resources a copy of each plan for a land-disturbing activity that involves the
utilization of ditches for the purpose of dewatering or lowering the water
table of the tract.
   (f)   The land-disturbing activity shall be conducted in accordance with the
approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.

Sec. 96.06. Erosion and sedimentation control plans.
   (a)   Plan submission. A plan shall be prepared for all land-disturbing
activities that will result in the disturbance of land equal to or greater than
one (1) acre, or that will result in the land disturbance of less than one (1)
acre if part of a larger common plan of development or sale, including without
limitation, a subdivision.
   (b)   Financial responsibility and ownership. Plans shall be disapproved
unless accompanied by an authorized statement of financial responsibility and
documentation of property ownership. This statement shall be signed by the
person financially responsible for the land-disturbing activity or their
attorney in fact. The statement shall include the mailing and street addresses
of the principal place of business of: (1) the person financially responsible;
(2) the owner of the land; and (3) any registered agents. If the person
financially responsible is not a resident of North Carolina, a North Carolina
agent must be designated in the statement for the purpose of receiving notice
of compliance or non-compliance with the plan, the Act, this chapter, or rules
or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter. Except as provided in
divisions (c) or (k) of this section, if the applicant is not the owner of the
land to be disturbed, the draft erosion and sedimentation control plan must
include the owner's written consent for the applicant to submit a draft erosion
and sedimentation control plan and to conduct the anticipated land-disturbing
activity.
   (c)   If the applicant is not the owner of the land to be disturbed and the
anticipated land- disturbing activity involves the construction of utility
lines for the provision of water, sewer, gas, telecommunications, or electrical
service, the draft erosion and sedimentation control plan may be submitted
without the written consent of the owner of the land, so long as the owner of
the land has been provided prior notice of the project.
   (d)   Environmental Policy Act document. Any plan submitted for a land-
disturbing activity for which an environmental document is required by the
North Carolina Environment Policy Act (G.S. 113A-1 et seq.) shall be deemed
incomplete until a complete environmental document is available for review. The
Town shall promptly notify the person submitting the plan that the thirty (30)-
day time limit for review of the plan pursuant to this chapter shall not begin
until a complete environmental document is available for review.
   (e)   Content. The plan required by this section shall contain architectural
or engineering drawings, maps, assumptions, calculations, and narrative
statements as needed to adequately describe the proposed development of the
tract and the measures planned to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
Plan content may vary to meet the needs of specific site requirements. Detailed
guidelines for plan preparation may be obtained from the Town on request.
   (f)   Timeline for decisions on plans. The Town will review each complete
plan submitted to them and within thirty (30) days of receipt thereof will
notify the person submitting the plan that it has been approved, approved with
modifications, or disapproved. Failure to approve, approve with modifications,
or disapprove a complete plan within thirty (30) days of receipt shall be
deemed approval. The Town will review each revised plan submitted to them and
within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof will notify the person submitting
the plan that it has been approved, approved with modifications, or
disapproved. Failure to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a
revised plan within fifteen (15) days of receipt shall be deemed approval.
   (g)   Approval. The Town shall only approve a plan upon determining that it
complies with all applicable state and local regulations for erosion and
sedimentation control. Approval assumes the applicant's compliance with the
federal and state water quality laws, regulations and rules. The Town shall
condition approval of plans upon the applicant's compliance with federal and
state water quality laws, regulations and rules. The Town may establish an
expiration date, not to exceed three (3) years, for plans approved under this
chapter whereby no land-disturbing activity has been undertaken.
   (h)   Disapproval for content. The Town may disapprove a plan or draft plan
based on its content. A disapproval based upon a plan's content must
specifically state in writing the reasons for disapproval.
   (i)   Other disapprovals. The Town shall disapprove an erosion and
sedimentation control plan if implementation of the plan would result in a
violation of rules adopted by the Environmental Management Commission to
protect riparian buffers along surface waters. The Town may disapprove an
erosion and sedimentation control plan or disapprove a transfer of a plan under
division (k) of this section upon finding that an applicant or a parent,
subsidiary, or other affiliate of the applicant:
   (1)   Is conducting or has conducted land-disturbing activity without an
approved plan or has received notice of violation of a plan previously approved
by the Commission or a local government pursuant to this chapter and has not
complied with the notice within the time specified in the notice.
   (2)   Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to this chapter or
a local ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter by the time the payment is
due.
   (3)   Has been convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. 113A-64(b) or any
criminal provision of a local ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter.
   (4)   Has failed to substantially comply with state rules or local
ordinances and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter.
      a.   In the event that an erosion and sedimentation control plan or a
transfer of a plan is disapproved by the Town pursuant to division (j) of this
section, the local government shall so notify the Director of the Division of
Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources within ten (10) days of the disapproval.
The Town shall advise the applicant or the proposed transferee and the Director
in writing as to the specific reasons that the plan was disapproved.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 96.16(a), the applicant may appeal
the local government's disapproval of the plan directly to the Commission.
      b.   For purposes of this section, an applicant's record or the proposed
transferee's record may be considered for only the two (2) years prior to the
application date.
   (j)   Transfer of plans. The Town administering an erosion and sedimentation
control program may transfer an erosion and sedimentation control plan approved
pursuant to this section without the consent of the plan holder to a successor-
owner of the property on which the permitted activity is occurring or will
occur as provided in this section.
   (1)   The Town may transfer a plan if all of the following conditions are
met:
      (i)   The successor-owner of the property submits to the local government
a written request for the transfer of the plan including a copy of the current
owner corporation's dissolution or other records to support the assertion that
the current rights holder is no longer in business or has abandoned the
project, and an authorized statement of financial responsibility and ownership.
      (ii)   The Town finds all of the following:
         a.   The plan holder is one of the following:
            1.   A natural person who is deceased.
            2.   A partnership, limited liability corporation, corporation, or
any other business association that has been dissolved.
            3.   A person who has been lawfully and finally divested of title
to the property on which the permitted activity is occurring or will occur.
            4.   A person who has sold the property on which the permitted
activity is occurring or will occur.
         b.   The successor-owner holds title to the property on which the
permitted activity is occurring or will occur.
         c.   The successor-owner is the sole claimant of the right to engage
in the permitted activity.
         d.   There will be no substantial change in the permitted activity.
   (2)   The plan holder shall comply with all terms and conditions of the plan
until such time as the plan is transferred.
   (3)   The successor-owner shall comply with all terms and conditions of the
plan once the plan has been transferred.
   (4)   Notwithstanding changes to law made after the original issuance of the
plan, the Town may not impose new or different terms and conditions in the plan
without the prior express consent of the successor-owner. Nothing in this
section shall prevent the Town from requiring a revised plan pursuant to G.S.
113A-54.1 (b).
   (k)   Notice of activity initiation. No person may initiate a land-
disturbing activity before notifying the agency that issued the plan approval
of the date that land-disturbing activity will begin.
   (l)   Preconstruction conference. Prior to any land disturbing activity, a
preconstruction conference shall be held on site.
   (m)   Display of plan approval. A plan approval issued under this chapter
shall be prominently displayed until all construction is complete, all
temporary measures have been removed, all permanent sedimentation and erosion
control measures are installed, and the site has been stabilized. A copy of the
approved plan shall be kept on file at the job site.
   (n)   Required revisions. After approving a plan, if the Town, either upon
review of such plan or on inspection of the job site, determines that a
significant risk of accelerated erosion or off-site sedimentation exists, the
Town shall require a revised plan. Pending the preparation of the revised plan,
work shall cease or shall continue under conditions outlined by the appropriate
authority. If following commencement of a land-disturbing activity pursuant to
an approved plan, the Town determines that the plan is inadequate to meet the
requirements of this chapter, the Town may require any revision of the plan
that is necessary to comply with this chapter.
   (o)   Amendment to a plan. Applications for amendment of a plan in written
and/or graphic form may be made at any time under the same conditions as the
original application. Until such time as the amendment is approved by the Town,
the land-disturbing activity shall not proceed except in accordance with the
plan as originally approved.
   (p)   Failure to file a plan. Any person engaged in land-disturbing activity
who fails to file a plan in accordance with this chapter, or who conducts a
land-disturbing activity except in accordance with provisions of an approved
plan shall be deemed in violation of this chapter.
   (q)   Self-inspections. The landowner, the financially responsible party, or
the landowner's or the financially responsible party's agent shall perform an
inspection of the area covered by the plan after each phase of the plan has
been completed and after establishment of temporary ground cover in accordance
with G.S. 113A-57(2). In addition, weekly and rain-event self-inspections are
required by federal regulations, that are implemented through the NPDES
Construction General Permit No. NCG 010000. The person who performs the
inspection shall maintain and make available a record of the inspection at the
site of the land-disturbing activity. The record shall set out any significant
deviation from the approved erosion control plan, identify any measures that
may be required to correct the deviation, and document the completion of those
measures. The record shall be maintained until permanent ground cover has been
established as required by the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.
The inspections required by this section shall be in addition to inspections
required by G.S. 113A-61.1.
      Where inspections are required by division (r) of this section or G.S.
113A-54.1(e), the following apply:
   (1)   The inspection shall be performed during or after each of the
following phases of the plan:
      (i)   Initial installation of erosion and sediment control measures;
      (ii)   Clearing and grubbing of existing ground cover;
      (iii)   Completion of any grading that requires ground cover;
      (iv)   Completion of all land-disturbing activity, construction, or
development, including permanent ground cover establishment and removal of all
temporary measures; and
      (v)   Transfer of ownership or control of the tract of land where the
erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved and work has begun.
The new owner or person in control shall conduct and document inspections until
the project is permanently stabilized as set forth in division (q)(1)(iii) of
this section.
   (2)   Documentation of self-inspections performed under division (q)(1) of
this section shall include:
      (i)   Visual verification of ground stabilization and other erosion
control measures and practices as called for in the approved plan;
      (ii)   Verification by measurement of settling basins, temporary
construction entrances, energy dissipators, and traps.
      (iii)   The name, address, organization affiliation, telephone number,
and signature of the person conducting the inspection and the date of the
inspection shall be included, whether on a copy of the approved erosion and
sedimentation control plan or an inspection report. A template for an example
of an inspection and monitoring report is provided on the DEMLR website at:
https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/energy-mineral-land-resources/erosion-
sediment-control/forms. The person responsible for conducting these inspections
shall have or obtain at least one NCDOT recognized erosion and sedimentation
control certification. Any documentation of inspections that occur on a copy of
the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan shall occur on a single
copy of the plan and that plan shall be made available on the site.
      (iv)   A record of any significant deviation from any erosion or
sedimentation control measure from that on the approved plan. For the purpose
of this division, a significant deviation means an omission, alternation, or
relocation of an erosion or sedimentation control measure that prevents it from
performing as intended. The record shall include measures required to correct
the significant deviation, along with documentation of when those measures were
taken. Deviations from the approved plan may also be recommended to enhance the
intended performance of the sedimentation and erosion control measures.

11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 96.07. Basic control objectives.
   An erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved if the plan
fails to address the following control objectives:
   (a)   Identify critical areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe
erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from
erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special
attention.
   (b)   Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activities are to be
planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest time specified in G.S.
113A-57, the rules of this chapter, or as directed by the approving authority.
   (c)   Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and
conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time.
   (d)   Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of
exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during
the period of exposure.
   (e)   Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned
and conducted to prevent off-site sedimentation damage.
   (f)   Manage storm water runoff. Plans shall be designed so that any
increase in velocity of storm water runoff resulting from a land-disturbing
activity will not result in accelerated erosion of the receiving storm water
conveyance or at the point of discharge. Plans shall include measures to
prevent accelerated erosion within the project boundary and at the point of
discharge.
(Ord. No. 21-11-01-001, 11-1-21; Ord. No. 21-12-15-001, 12-15-21)
Sec. 96.08. Design and performance standards.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) and (c)(1) of this section,
erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be
planned, designed, and constructed to provide protection from the calculated
maximum peak rate of runoff from the ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be
calculated using the procedures in the latest edition of the United States
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service's "National
Engineering Field Handbook", or other acceptable calculation procedures.
   (b)   HQW zones. In high quality water (HQW) zones the following design
standards shall apply:
   (1)   Limit on uncovered area. Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited
at any time to a maximum total area of twenty acres within the boundaries of
the tract. Only the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW zone
shall be governed by this section. Larger areas may be uncovered within the
boundaries of the tract with the written approval of the Director upon
providing engineering justification with a construction sequence that considers
phasing, limiting exposure, weekly submitted self-inspection reports, and a
more conservative design than the twenty-five year storm.
   (2)   Maximum peak rate of runoff protection. Erosion and sedimentation
control measures, structures, and devices within HQW zones shall be planned,
designed and constructed to provide protection from the runoff of the twenty-
five year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated
according to procedures in the latest edition of the United States Department
of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service's "National Engineering
Field Handbook" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this
state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or
association.
   (3)   Sediment basin design. Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be
designed and constructed according to the following criteria:
      (i)   Use a surface withdrawal mechanism, except when the basin drainage
area is less than 1.0 acre;
      (ii)   Have a minimum of 1,800 cubic feet of storage area per acre of
disturbed area;
      (iii)   Have a minimum surface area of 325 square feet per cubic feet per
second (cfs) of the twenty-five year storm (Q25) peak flow;
      (iv)   Have a minimum dewatering time of 48 hours;
      (v)   Incorporate 3 baffles, unless the basin is less than 20 feet in
length, in which case 2 baffles shall be sufficient.
      Upon a written request of the applicant, the Director may allow
alternative design and control measures in lieu of meeting the conditions
required in divisions (b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(v) of this section if the
applicant demonstrates that meeting all of those conditions will result in
design or operational hardships and that the alternative measures will provide
an equal or more effective level of erosion and sediment control on the site.
Alternative measures may include quicker application of ground cover, use of
sediment flocculants, and use of enhanced ground cover practices.
   (4)   Grade. Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed
and constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical
if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions permit a
steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices,
structural devices or other forms of ditch liners proven as being effective in
restraining accelerated erosion. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall
be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion.
(Ord. No. 21-11-01-001, 11-1-21; Ord. No. 21-12-15-001, 12-15-21; Ord. No. 22-
03-16-002, 3-16-22; Ord. No. 24-11-20-001, 11-20-24)
Sec. 96.09. Storm water outlet protection.
   (a)   Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land disturbing
activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion
caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land disturbing activity.
   (b)   Performance standard. Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity
so that the post construction velocity of the 10-year storm runoff in the
receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:
   (1)   The velocity established by the Maximum Permissible Velocities Table
set out within this section; or
   (2)   The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse
prior to development.
   If divisions (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section cannot be met, then the
receiving watercourse to and including the discharge point shall be designed
and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity
exceeds the "prior to development" velocity by 10%.
   Maximum Permissible Velocities Table
   The following is a table for maximum permissible velocity for storm water
discharges in feet per second (F.P.S.) and meters per second (M.P.S.):
Material F.P.S. M.P.S
Material                               F.P.S. M.P.S
Fine sand (noncolloidal)               2.5    0.8
Sandy loam (noncolloidal)              2.5    0.8
Silt loam (noncolloidal)               3.0    0.9
Ordinary firm loam                     3.5    1.1
Fine gravel                            5.0    1.5
Stiff clay (very colloidal)            5.0    1.5
Graded, loam to cobbles (noncolloidal) 5.0    1.5
Graded, silt to cobbles (colloidal)    5.5    1.7
Alluvial silts (noncolloidal)          3.5    1.1
Alluvial silts (colloidal)             5.0    1.5
Coarse gravel (noncolloidal)           6.0    1.8
Cobbles and shingles                   5.5    1.7
Shales and hard pans                   6.0    1.8
 
   Source - Adapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation
Research, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1926, for channels with straight
alignment. For sinuous channels, multiply allowable velocity by 0.95 for
slightly sinuous, by 0.9 for moderately sinuous channels, and by 0.8 for highly
sinuous channels.
   (c)   Acceptable management measures. Measures applied alone or in
combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are
no objectionable secondary consequences. The Town recognizes that the
management of storm water runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and
bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will
be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce
successful results. Some alternatives, while not exhaustive, are to:
   (1)   Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including
measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas
rendered impervious;
   (2)   Avoid increases in storm water discharge velocities by using vegetated
or roughened swales and waterways in place of closed drains and high velocity
paved sections;
   (3)   Provide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities to
reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge;
   (4)   Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross
sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining; and
   (5)   Upgrade or replace the receiving device structure or watercourse such
that it will receive and conduct the flow to a point where it is no longer
subject to degradation from the increased rate of flow or increased velocity.
   (d)   Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated to
the Town that storm water discharge velocities will not create an erosion
problem in the receiving watercourse.

03-16-002, 3-16-22)
Sec. 96.10. Borrow and waste areas.
   If the same person conducts the land-disturbing activity and any related
borrow or waste activity, the related borrow or waste activity shall constitute
part of the land-disturbing activity, unless the borrow or waste activity is
regulated under the Mining Act of 1971, G.S. Ch. 74, Art. 7, or is a landfill
regulated by the Division of Waste Management. If the land-disturbing activity
and any related borrow or waste activity are not conducted by the same person,
they shall be considered by the approving authority as separate land-disturbing
activities.

Sec. 96.12. Operations in lakes or natural watercourses.
   Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or
under a lake or natural watercourse shall minimize the extent and duration of
disruption of the stream channel. Where relocation of a stream forms an
essential part of the proposed activity, the relocation shall minimize changes
in the stream flow characteristics.
(Ord. No. 21-11-01-001, 11-1-21; Ord. No. 21-12-15-001, 12-15-21)
Sec. 96.13. Responsibility for maintenance.
   During the development of a site, the person conducting the land-disturbing
activity shall install and maintain all temporary and permanent erosion and
sedimentation control measures as required by the approved plan or any
provision of this chapter, the Act, or any order adopted pursuant to this
chapter or the Act. After site development, the landowner or person in
possession or control of the land shall install and/or maintain all necessary
permanent erosion and sediment control measures, except those measures
installed within a road or street right-of-way or easement accepted for
maintenance by a governmental agency.

Sec. 96.16. Plan appeals.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, the appeal of a
disapproval or approval with modifications of a plan shall governed by the
following provisions:
   (1)   The disapproval or modification of any proposed plan by the Town shall
entitle the person submitting the plan to a public hearing if such person
submits written demand for a hearing within 15 days after receipt of written
notice of disapproval or modifications.
   (2)   A hearing held pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the
Development Review Committee within 30 days after the date of the appeal or
request for a hearing.
   (3)   The Development Review Committee shall make recommendations to the
governing body of the Town within 30 days after the date of the hearing on any
plan.

03-16-002, 3-16-22)
Sec. 96.17. Inspections and investigations.
   (a)   Inspection. Agents, officials, or other qualified persons authorized
by the Town will periodically inspect land-disturbing activities to ensure
compliance with the Act, this chapter, or rules or orders adopted or issued
pursuant to this chapter, and to determine whether the measures required in the
plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation resulting from
land-disturbing activity. Notice of the right to inspect shall be included in
the certificate of approval of each plan.
   (b)   Willful resistance, delay or obstruction. No person shall willfully
resist, delay, or obstruct an authorized representative, employee, or agent of
the Town, while that person is inspecting or attempting to inspect a land-
disturbing activity under this section.
   (c)   Notice of violation. If the Town determines that a person engaged in
land-disturbing activity has failed to comply with the Act, this chapter, or
rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, a notice of
violation shall be served upon that person. The notice may be served by any
means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4. The notice shall specify a date by
which the person must comply with the Act, or this chapter, or rules or orders
adopted pursuant to this chapter, and inform the person of the actions that
need to be taken to comply with the Act, this chapter, or rules or orders
adopted pursuant to this chapter. Any person who fails to comply within the
time specified is subject to additional civil and criminal penalties for a
continuing violation as provided in G.S. 113A-64 and this chapter. If the
person engaged in the land-disturbing activity has not received a previous
notice of violation under this section, the Town shall deliver the notice of
violation in person and shall offer assistance in developing corrective
measures. Assistance may be provided by referral to a technical assistance
program on behalf of the approving authority, referral to a cooperative
extension program, or by the provision of written materials such as Department
guidance documents. If the Town is unable to deliver the notice of violation in
person within 15 days following discovery of the violation, the notice of
violation may be served in the manner prescribed for service of process by G.S.
1A-1, Rule 4, and shall include information on how to obtain assistance in
developing corrective measures.
   (d)   Investigation. The Town shall have the power to conduct such
investigation as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as
prescribed in this chapter, and who presents appropriate credentials for this
purpose to enter at reasonable times, any property, public or private, for the
purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land-disturbing
activity.
   (e)   Statements and reports. The Town shall also have the power to require
written statements, or filing of reports under oath, with respect to pertinent
questions relating to land-disturbing activity.
(Ord. No. 21-11-01-001, 11-1-21; Ord. No. 21-12-15-001, 12-15-21)
Sec. 96.18. Penalties.
   (a)   Civil penalties.
   (1)   Civil penalty for a violation. Any person who violates any of the
provisions of this chapter, or rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to this
chapter, or who initiates or continues a land-disturbing activity for which a
plan is required except in accordance with the terms, conditions, and
provisions of an approved plan, is subject to a civil penalty. The maximum
civil penalty amount that the Town may assess per violation is five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00). A civil penalty may be assessed from the date of the
violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate
violation. When the person has not been assessed any civil penalty under this
section for any previous violation, and that person abated continuing
environmental damage resulting from the violation within 180 days from the date
of the notice of violation, the maximum cumulative total civil penalty assessed
under this division for all violations associated with the land-disturbing
activity for which the erosion and sedimentation control plan is required is
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).
   (2)   Civil penalty assessment factors. The governing body of the Town shall
determine the amount of the civil penalty based upon the following factors: (i)
the degree and extent of harm caused by the violation; (ii) the cost of
rectifying the damage; (iii) the amount of money the violator saved by
noncompliance; (iv) whether the violation was committed willfully; and (v) the
number and severity of prior violations received by the permittee and record of
the violator in complying or failing to comply with this chapter.
   (3)   Notice of civil penalty assessment. The governing body of the Town
shall provide notice of the civil penalty amount and basis for assessment to
the person assessed. The notice of assessment shall be served by any means
authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4. A notice of assessment by the Town shall
direct the violator to either pay the assessment, contest the assessment within
30 days by filing a petition for hearing with the Town as directed in 11.2(E)
of the Town's UDO or file a request with the Sedimentation Control Commission
for remission of the assessment within 30 days of receipt of the notice of
assessment. A remission request must be accompanied by a waiver of the right to
a contested case hearing pursuant to G.S. Ch. 150B and a stipulation of the
facts on which the assessment was based.
   (4)   Final decision. The final decision on contested assessments shall be
made by the governing body of the Town in accordance with Section 12.2(e) of
the Town's UDO.
   (5)   Appeal of final decision. Appeal of the final decision of the
governing body of the Town shall be to the Superior Court of the county where
the violation occurred. Such appeals must be made within 30 days of the final
decision of the governing body of the Town.
   (6)   Remission of civil penalties. A request for remission of a civil
penalty imposed under G.S. 113A-64 may be filed with the Town within 30 days of
receipt of the notice of assessment. A remission request must be accompanied by
a waiver of the right to a contested case hearing pursuant to G.S. Ch. 150B and
a stipulation of the facts on which the assessment was based. The following
factors shall be considered in determining whether a civil penalty remission
request will be approved:
      (i)   Whether one or more of the civil penalty assessment factors in G.S.
113A-64(a)(3) were wrongly applied to the detriment of the petitioner.
      (ii)   Whether the petitioner promptly abated continuing environmental
damage resulting from the violation.
      (iii)   Whether the violation was inadvertent or a result of an accident.
      (iv)   Whether the petitioner had been assessed civil penalties for any
previous violations.
      (v)   Whether payment of the civil penalty will prevent payment for
necessary remedial actions or would otherwise create a significant financial
hardship.
      (vi)   The assessed property tax valuation of the petitioner's property
upon which the violation occurred, excluding the value of any structures
located on the property.
   (7)   Collection. If payment is not received within 30 days after it is due,
the Town may institute a civil action to recover the amount of the assessment.
The civil action may be brought in the Superior Court of the county where the
violation occurred, or the violator's residence or principal place of business
is located. Such civil actions must be filed within three (3) years of the date
the assessment was due. An assessment that is not contested and a remission
that is not requested is due when the violator is served with a notice of
assessment. An assessment that is contested or a remission that is requested is
due at the conclusion of the administrative and judicial review of the
assessment.
   (8)   Credit of civil penalties. The clear proceeds of civil penalties
collected by the Town under this section shall be remitted to the Civil Penalty
and Forfeiture Fund in accordance with G.S. 115C- 457.2. Penalties collected by
the Town may be diminished only by the actual costs of collection. The
collection cost percentage to be used shall be established and approved by the
North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management on an annual basis, based
upon the computation of actual collection costs by the Town for the prior
fiscal year. In any event, the cost percentage shall not exceed twenty percent
(20%) of the total penalties collected.
   (b)   Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any
provision of this chapter, or rule or order adopted or issued by the Commission
or a local government, or who knowingly or willfully initiates or continues a
land-disturbing activity for which a plan is required except in accordance with
the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, shall be guilty of a
Class 2 misdemeanor which may include a fine not to exceed $5,000 as provided
in G.S. 113A-64.
(Ord. No. 21-11-01-001, 11-1-21; Ord. No. 21-12-15-001, 12-15-21; Ord. No. 22-
03-16-002, 3-16-22)
Sec. 96.19. Injunctive relief.
   (a)   Violation of local program. Whenever the governing body has reasonable
cause to believe that any person is violating or threatening to violate any
ordinance, rule, regulation or order adopted or issued by the Town, or any
term, condition, or provision of an approved plan, it may, either before or
after the institution of any other action or proceeding authorized by this
chapter, institute a civil action in the name of the Town, for injunctive
relief to restrain the violation or threatened violation. The action shall be
brought in the superior court of the county in which the violation is occurring
or is threatened.
   (b)   Abatement of violation. Upon determination by a court that an alleged
violation is occurring or is threatened, the court shall enter any order or
judgment that is necessary to abate the violation, to ensure that restoration
is performed, or to prevent the threatened violation. The institution of an
action for injunctive relief under this section shall not relieve any party to
the proceedings from any civil or criminal penalty prescribed for violations of
this chapter.
(Ord. No. 21-11-01-001, 11-1-21; Ord. No. 21-12-15-001, 12-15-21)
Sec. 96.20. Restoration after non-compliance.
   The Town may require a person who engaged in a land-disturbing activity and
failed to retain sediment generated by the activity, as required by G.S. 113A-
57(3), to restore the waters and land affected by the failure so as to minimize
the detrimental effects of the resulting pollution by sedimentation. This
authority is in addition to any other civil or criminal penalty or injunctive
relief authorized under this chapter.
