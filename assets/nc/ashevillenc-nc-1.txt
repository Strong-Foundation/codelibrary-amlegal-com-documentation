  Chapter 121 of the Private Laws of 1931 and ratified by referendum in April of
  1931. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes

manager may authorize the head of a department or office responsible to him to
appoint and remove subordinates in such department or office. All appointments
made by or under the authority of the manager shall be on the basis of
executive and administrative ability and of the training and experience of such
appointees in the work which they are to perform. All such appointments shall
be without definite term unless for temporary service not to exceed 60 days.

office or positions of those classes which the council may by resolution
provide need not be so reported.
Sec. 22. Council not to request or take part in appointments or removals.
Neither the council nor any of its committees or members shall direct or

the council.
Sec. 25. Right of manager and other officers to seats in council and
participation in council discussions.

city as may be designated by vote of the council shall be entitled to seats in
the council but shall have no vote therein. The manager shall have the right to
take part in the discussion of all matters coming before the council and the
heads of departments and any other officers having seats in the council shall
be entitled to take part in all discussions of the council relating to their
respective departments and offices.
Sec. 26. Departments generally.
The city council, after hearing recommendations by the city manager, shall by
resolution establish and designate departments of the city and may, from time
to time, upon the recommendation of the city manager, abolish, redesignate,
reorganize, restructure, reestablish and otherwise change such departments to
promote efficiency in the administration of the city government. Nothing in
this section shall prevent the council, by a two- thirds vote of its members,
from authorizing and directing the execution of a contract with Buncombe County
for the joint performance of similar administrative duties and functions of
said county and city by consolidating the agencies thereof by which such
functions are, at the time of making such an agreement, being performed and
authorizing their subsequent joint operation as one agency at joint expense, or
for the performance of said administrative functions for the benefit of both

offices and/or perform himself or delegate to another any one or more functions
or duties assigned to a department or office. Each director shall have power to

authentications, inspections, certifications, amendments and submission of such
petition shall be the same as hereinafter provided in this article for
petitions for the recall of officials. If the petition accompanying the
proposed ordinance be signed by the requisite number of voters and contains a

not passed by the council, such board shall within 15 days after such petition
is submitted to it, either:

be more than one such special election in any period of six months for such
purpose. The council may submit a proposition for the repeal of any such
ordinance or for amendment thereto to be voted upon at any succeeding general
city election and should any such proposition so submitted receive a majority
of the votes cast thereon at such election such ordinance shall thereby be
repealed or amended accordingly as of the date when the result of such vote is

petition as provided under this section cannot be resubmitted to referendum by
petition within a three-year period from the date of the election at which said

Sec. 85. Recall—Generally.
The holder of any elective office under the city Charter may be removed at any
time by the voters qualified to vote for a successor of such incumbent. The
procedure to effect the removal of an incumbent of the elective office shall be
as follows:
A petition, signed by 15 percent of the number of registered voters of the City
of Asheville, demanding an election of a successor of the person sought to be
removed, shall be filed with the chairman of the city board of elections, and
the petition shall contain a general statement of the grounds for which the
removal is sought. The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to
one paper, but each signer shall add to his signature his place of residence,
giving the street and number. One of the signers of each paper shall make oath
before an officer competent to administer oaths that the statements thereon
made are true, as he believes and that each signature to the paper appended is
the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Within ten
days from the date of filing such petition the city board of elections shall
examine and from the registration books used at the next preceding municipal
election held in the city ascertain whether or not said petition is signed by
the requisite number of qualified voters. Such registration books shall for
that purpose be made available to the city board of elections by the officer or
board in whose custody they may be. The chairman of the board of elections
shall attach to said petition his certificate, showing the result of such
examination as determined by the board of elections. If by such certificate the
petition is shown to be insufficient it may be amended within ten days from the
date of such certificate. The board of elections shall within ten days after
such amendment make a like examination of the amended petition and if the
certificate of the chairman of the board of elections which shall be made
thereafter in accordance with the decision of the board of elections on the
matter shall show the petition to be insufficient, such petition shall be
returned to the person filing the same without prejudice to the filing of a new
petition to the same effect. If the petition shall be deemed sufficient by the
board of elections, the chairman of said board shall forthwith so certify and
shall submit the petition to the council at its next regular meeting. If the
petition shall be found to be sufficient the council shall order and fix a date
for holding an election for the election of a successor to the elective officer
sought to be removed. In the event a primary election is held in connection
with the election of members of the council under the provisions of this
Charter or any amendment thereto, then in effect, then the date of such primary
or in the event none is to be held, the date of such election shall be fixed
not less than 15 or more than 30 days from the date of the certificate of the
chairman of the board of elections to the council that a sufficient petition is
filed. A petition filed as aforesaid may demand the election of a successor to
more than one elective officer of the city. An officer elected at a recall
election as aforesaid, shall hold office for the unexpired term of the officer
whom he succeeds.
(Session Laws 1969, ch. 313, § 4)
Sec. 86. Same—Officer sought to be removed as candidate to succeed himself.
Any elective officer sought to be removed as aforesaid shall be eligible to
succeed himself unless ineligible for some other reason contained in this
Charter or under the general law of the state and each such elective officer so
sought to be removed shall, unless within three days after the ordering of an
election or primary as aforesaid, he files with the chairman of the board of
elections a written refusal to be candidate to succeed himself, be considered a
candidate to succeed himself and shall be treated as such in the same manner as
if he had become a candidate for such office in the manner provided in this
Charter.

Notes
  Editor's note(s)—
  This subpart consists of certain acts relating to the city, but not enacted
  as specific amendments or additions to the Charter. This is not a complete
  compilation of all such acts, but only of those which were deemed to be of
  such general interest and importance as to warrant inclusion herein. Also
  included herein, as indicated by appropriate notes, are those sections of the
  former Charter (Private Laws 1923, ch. 16) which were specifically reenacted
  by the present Charter.
1 The article headings and section numbers and catchlines were added by the
  editor and sections of the acts containing formal provisions, such as
  repealing clauses and effective dates, have been omitted. The source of each
  section is indicated by the history note appearing at the end thereof in
  parentheses. Formal citations should be to the original act, and not to this
  compilation. A uniform system of punctuation and capitalization has been
  used. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. Words added
  for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Sec. 8. Amendment of General Statutes relative to sale, lease, etc., of parks
and recreation property.
(a)   General Statutes of North Carolina, section 160A-353 [G.S. 160A-353], is
amended by adding a new subdivision [subsection] to read:
"(4a)   Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, by action of the

(Session Laws 1981, ch. 23, §§ 1, 2)
Sec. 9. Amendment of General Statutes relative to sale or lease of property to
further the purposes of urban development action grants.
(a)   General Statutes of North Carolina, section 160A-457 [G.S. 160A-457], as
the same appears in the 1977 Cumulative Supplement to Volume 3D, is amended by
deleting the word "and" at the end of the subdivision [subsection] (2) and
adding the following new subsections at the end to read as follows:
(4)   To enter into contracts or agreements with any person, association or
corporation to undertake and carry out specified activities in furtherance of
the purposes of urban development action grants authorized by the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1977 (P.L. 95-128). Such contracts may be
negotiated and entered into prior to the actual acquisition or redevelopment of
any real property obtained for the purposes authorized by this part, and such
contracts shall be binding legal commitments for accomplishing the purposes set
forth therein; and
(5)   In addition to the powers granted in subsection (3) above, to convey or
lease at a private transaction to any person, firm, corporation, or
governmental unit particular properties within a redevelopment area where it
finds the proposed redeveloper is the only known available, qualified and
willing redeveloper for the contemplated use and makes one or more of the
following findings, which said findings shall be verified and approved by the
governing body of the municipality after a public hearing, notice of which
shall be given once a week for two successive calendar weeks in a newspaper
published in the municipality and by posting such notice at four public places
in the municipality, said notice to be published the first time, or posted, not
less than 15 days prior to the date fixed for said hearing:
(a)   That the proposed use or redevelopment is necessary in order to
facilitate the relocation of persons or firms displaced by an urban development
action grant project or other governmental action;
(b)   That the proposed use or redevelopment is reasonably necessary in order
to assure development which will have the desired beneficial effect upon
neighboring property, the project area, and the community as a whole, as
contemplated by the redevelopment plan;
(c)   That the proposed use or redevelopment will assure that the property will
not remain unused for an unduly long period and will result in a return to the
local ad valorem tax rolls at a substantially earlier date than uses or
redevelopments obtainable by other methods of disposition.
Such conveyance or lease shall be for such consideration as may be agreed upon
by the city and the redeveloper and approved by the governing body of the
municipality, which shall not be less than the fair, actual value of the
property as determined by the governing body of the municipality, based on
competent evidence. All conveyances made under the authority of this subsection
shall contain restrictive covenants limiting the use of the property so
conveyed to the designated purpose for which the conveyance is made, provided,
that the disposition of property at private sale or lease as authorized in
subsection (5) shall be expressly limited to property used in connection with
urban development action grants and for no other purpose under this part."
(b)   If any provision of this act [section] is for any reason held to be
unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remainder of the act [section].
(c)   This act [section] shall apply only to the City of Asheville, North
Carolina.
(Session Laws 1979, ch. 81, §§ 1—3; Session Laws 1981, ch. 632, § 1)
Sec. 10. Land sales by Asheville City Council and Asheville Housing Authority.
(a)   In addition to the authority granted by article 12 of chapter 160A of the
General Statutes [G.S. 160A-265 et seq.], the City of Asheville is authorized
to dispose of real property in accordance with provisions of subsections (b) or
(c) of this act [section] by sale or lease. All references hereafter in this
act [section] or uses of the words "convey," "sale," "conveyances,"
"conveyance," "sold," or "sell" shall be deemed to read and shall be defined as
"convey or lease," "sale or lease," "conveyances or leases," "conveyance or
lease," "sold or leased," or "sell or lease," as the same is applicable
thereto.
(b)   The city council may convey at private sale to a prospective developer
particular properties in excess of $5,000.00 in valuation where it finds that
the proposed developer is the only known available, qualified and willing
developer for the contemplated use of the property which may have been
specified or designated by council, provided that one or more of the following
findings are made and verified after a public hearing, notice of which shall be
given once a week for two successive calendar weeks in a newspaper published in
the municipality, said notice to be published the first time not less than 15
days prior to the date fixed for said hearing:
(1)   That the proposed use or development is reasonably necessary in order to
ensure development which will have the desired beneficial effect upon
neighboring property, the project area, and the community as a whole;
(2)   That the proposed use or development will ensure that the property will
not remain unused for an unduly long period and will result in a return to the
local ad valorem tax rolls at a substantially greater assessed valuation and at
an earlier date than uses or redevelopment obtained by other methods of
disposition.
Conveyances made in this manner shall be for such consideration and conditions
as may be agreed upon by the council and the developer which shall not be less
than the fair, actual value of the property, as determined by the council,
based on competent evidence.
(c)   (1) After a public hearing advertised in accordance with the provisions
of General Statutes of North Carolina, section 160A-364 [G.S. 160A-364], the
city council may determine that in the best interest of the municipality
certain property should be developed for one purpose only, said purpose and
terms of sale or conveyance being designated by city council. The city council
shall advertise such property and invite redevelopment proposals by public
notice, by publication once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper
having general circulation in the municipality, and shall make available all
pertinent information to any person interested in undertaking a purchase of
such property and the redevelopment of such property or any part thereof. Any
property sold in accordance with this subsection shall be sold by negotiated
offer, advertisement, and upset bid for cash at a price not less than the fair
market value thereof as fixed by the city council. All conveyances made under
the authority of this subsection shall contain restrictive covenants limiting
the use of property conveyed to the designated purpose for which the conveyance
is made.
(2)   In addition to the provisions of the preceding paragraph the city council
may reject the highest responsible bid and accept a lesser bid where it makes
the following specific findings: The general public welfare and proper
development of the community will be better served by the bid which was

Notes
  Code reference—
5 Asheville Downtown Commission,
  § 2-76
  .
Sec. 241. Downtown development projects.
(a)   Definition. In this section, "downtown development project" means a
capital project in the city's central business district, as that district is
defined by the city council, comprising one or more buildings and including
both public and private facilities. By way of illustration but not limitation,
such a project might include a single building comprising a publicly owned
parking structure and publicly owned convention center and a privately owned
hotel or office building.
(b)   Authorization. If the city council finds that it is likely to have a
significant effect on the revitalization of the central business district, the
city may acquire, construct, own, and operate or participate in the
acquisition, construction, ownership, and operation of a downtown development
project or of specific facilities within such a project. The city may enter
into binding contracts with one or more private developers with respect to
acquiring, constructing, owning, or operating such a project. Such a contract
may, among other provisions, specify the following:
(1)   The property interests of both the city and the developer or developers
in the project.
(2)   The responsibilities of the city and the developer or developers for
construction of the project.
(3)   The responsibilities of the city and the developer or developers with
respect to financing the project.
Such a contract may be entered into before the acquisition of any real property
necessary to the project.
(c)   Property acquisition. A downtown development project may be constructed
on property acquired by the developer or developers, on property directly
acquired by the city, or on property acquired by the city while exercising the
powers, duties, and responsibilities of a redevelopment commission pursuant to
G.S. 160A-505 or G.S. 160A-456.
(d)   Property disposition. In connection with a downtown development project,
the city may convey interests in property owned by it, including air rights

duties, and responsibilities of a redevelopment commission, the city may convey
property interests pursuant to the "Urban Redevelopment Law" or any local
modification thereof.
(2)   If the property were acquired by the city directly, the city may convey
property interests pursuant to G.S. 160A-457 and any local modification
thereof. Except for local modifications, article 12, chapter 160A of the
General Statutes [G.S. 160A-265 et seq.] does not apply to such dispositions.
(e)   Construction of the project. The contract between the city and the
developer or developers may provide that the developer or developers shall be
responsible for construction of the entire downtown development project. If so,
the contract shall include such provisions as the city council deems sufficient
to assure that the public facility or facilities included in the project meet
the needs of the city and are constructed at a reasonable price. A project
constructed pursuant to this paragraph is not subject to article 8, chapter 143
of the General Statutes [G.S. 143-128 et seq.].
(f)   Operation. The city may contract for the operation of any public facility
or facilities included in a downtown redevelopment project by a person,
partnership, firm or corporation, public or private. Such a contract shall
include provisions sufficient to assure that any such facility or facilities
are operated for the benefit of the citizens of the city.
(g)   Grant funds. To assist in the financing of its share of a downtown
project, the city may apply for, accept and expend grant funds from the federal

Sec. 1-5. General penalty; civil remedies; enforcement of ordinances;
continuing violations.
(a)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, violation of any provision of
this Code or any other city ordinance shall subject the offender to the
remedies provided in this section, except that where the General Statutes of
North Carolina provide specific civil remedies for violations of provisions of
this Code adopted pursuant to such statutes, such remedies available to the
city for enforcement of this Code shall be in addition to the remedies stated
in this section.
(b)   Violations of all provisions of this Code, unless otherwise specifically
provided in this Code and/or specifically enumerated in appendix B of this
volume, shall be a misdemeanor and punishable as provided by N. C. Gen. Stat.
sec. 14-4.
(c)   Violations of the provisions enumerated in appendix B of this volume
shall subject the offender to a civil penalty upon the issuance of a citation
for such violation as provided in this section. The civil penalty, if not paid
to the city finance director within 15 days of the issuance of a citation, may
be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt. Unless
otherwise provided by a specific provision of this Code, such civil penalties
shall be in the amount of $50.00 for each violation, and each day any single
violation continues shall be a separate violation. The provisions of this Code
which shall subject the offender to a civil penalty are as enumerated in
appendix B of this volume.
(d)   In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this section,
any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance may be enforced by an
appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In
such case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such
orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application
of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law.
(e)   In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this section,
any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance that makes unlawful a
condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by
injunction and order of abatement, and the general court of justice shall have
jurisdiction to issue such orders. When a violation of such a provision occurs,
the city may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of justice
for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement commanding the
defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of
the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and
rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in
general and rule 65 in particular.
(f)   In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of abatement
as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of abatement may direct that:
(1)   Buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished or
removed;
(2)   Fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings
on the property;
(3)   Grass and weeds be cut;
(4)   Improvements or repairs be made; or
(5)   Any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into
compliance with this Code or such ordinance.
If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order
of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for
contempt, and the city may execute the order of abatement. The city shall have
a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the
nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure
cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings
and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with
sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the
judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the
defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a
time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not
suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith.
(g)   The provisions of this Code and any other city ordinances may be enforced
by one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this
section, except that any provision, the violation of which incurs a civil
penalty, shall not be enforced by criminal penalties.
(h)   Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing
violation of any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance shall be a
separate and distinct offense.
(i)   Any ordinances adopted by the mayor and council, the violation of which
shall incur a penalty, shall specify whether the enforcement shall be pursuant
to the civil penalty or criminal penal provisions of this section.
(j)   Unless provided otherwise in this Code, upon determination of a violation
of any section of this Code, the penalty for which is a civil penalty, the city
shall cause a civil citation to be issued to the violator. A civil citation
shall be issued by the appropriate official of the city and either served
directly on the violator or his duly designated agent or registered agent, if a
corporation, in person or posted in the United States mail service by first
class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in
the records of the city or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance
of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon
the mailing of such citation. Unless provided otherwise in this Code, the
citation shall direct the violator to appear before the city clerk, located in
the city hall, within 15 days of the date of the citation or alternatively to
pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must
have been corrected by the time the citation is paid; otherwise, further
citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense
continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated.
(k)   Unless provided otherwise in this Code, if the violator fails to respond
to a citation within 15 days of its issuance and pay the penalty prescribed
therein, the city may institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the
appropriate division of the state general court of justice for the collection
of the penalty.

DIVISION 3. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Sec. 2-226. Policy.
(a)   It is the policy of the city that all employees be treated fairly and
equitably in all respects. Employees who feel they have not been so treated
have a right to present an individual or group grievance to appropriate
management officials for prompt consideration and equitable decision. Employees
may orally or in writing, formally or informally, present complaints to their
supervisors, starting with their immediate supervisor and proceeding through
supervisory channels to the department head and city manager.
(b)   When more than one grievance is filed regarding the same subject matter,
each person in a supervisory position, from the immediate supervisor to the
city manager, who is charged with the responsibility of making a determination
in the grievance procedure shall determine whether to hear such grievances
jointly or separately. The determination regarding whether to proceed with the
grievances jointly or separately may be based upon that person's determination
of the most efficient manner in which to handle the grievances. If the
supervisor or city manager shall determine that the rights of an employee who
has filed a grievance would be prejudiced by a joint hearing, that employee's
grievance shall be heard separately.
(c)   Before presenting their complaints to their supervisors, employees who
file a group grievance shall select no more than six employee representatives
from among those filing the grievance. Each person in a supervisory position,
from the immediate supervisor to the city manager, who is charged with the
responsibility of making a determination in the grievance procedure shall hear
such a grievance through the group representatives; however, nothing in this
section shall prohibit a supervisor from hearing the grievance with the entire
group of grievants.
(d)   It is the intent of this section that employees and their representatives
be unimpeded and free from restraint, coercion, discrimination or reprisal in
exercising this right of appeal. The filing of a grievance by any employee will
not be construed as reflecting unfavorably on his good standing, performance,
loyalty or desirability for continued service with the city. Any employee may
discuss any matter with his supervisor, other levels of supervision and the
personnel department without invoking the formal grievance procedure outlined
in this division.
(Code 1965, § 19A-1; Ord. No. 1731, § 1, 12-20-88; Ord. No. 1864, § 19A-1, 9-
18-90; Ord. No. 4910, § 2, 11-9-21)
Sec. 2-227. Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly
indicates a different meaning:
Grievance means a complaint or dispute of an employee relating to his
employment. Examples of problems for which grievances may be filed include but
are not limited to the following:

(3)   Unsafe physical facilities, surroundings, materials or equipment;

Cross reference(s)—Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 2-228. Purposes.
The purposes of the grievance procedure include but are not limited to the
following:
(1)   Providing employees with a procedure by which their complaints can be
considered promptly, fairly and without reprisal.
(2)   Encouraging employees to express themselves about the conditions of work
which affect them as employees.
(3)   Promoting a better understanding of policies, practices and procedures
which affect employees.
(4)   Increasing the confidence that employees have that personnel decisions
are in accordance with established, fair and uniform policies and procedures.
(Ord. No. 1864, § 19A-3, 9-18-90; Ord. No. 4910, § 2, 11-9-21)
Sec. 2-229. Procedures.
The steps enumerated in this section shall be followed in all employee
grievances. All grievances must be in writing, either in letter or memo form or
using a city grievance form, dated and signed. Upon receipt of a written
grievance, the supervisor shall immediately forward a copy of it and any
subsequent decisions regarding the matter to the grievant's department head and
personnel director. However, if an employee feels that he has been subject to
sexual or racial harassment by his supervisor, the employee may refer the
matter directly to the employee's department head or the personnel director.
Prior to the first formal step of the grievance procedure, an employee and his
supervisor are encouraged to discuss the problem and seek to resolve it
informally. This meeting should be scheduled by the employee within 15 calendar
days of the incident or action giving rise to the problem.
(1)   Step 1. If an informal meeting does not resolve the problem, the employee
may file a written grievance within ten calendar days of the initial
discussion; provided, however, if an informal discussion of the grievance has
not taken place, an employee shall file his written grievance within 15
calendar days of the incident or action giving rise to the complaint. Ongoing
conditions are not subject to this deadline. The supervisor shall respond, in
writing, within ten calendar days of receipt of the written grievance. In some
cases, the supervisor may feel that a second meeting would be constructive. If
so, the supervisor may schedule a meeting with the employee within seven
calendar days after receiving the written grievance, fairly investigate the
matter and render a written decision on the grievance within seven calendar
days of the meeting. If an employee has filed a grievance with a supervisor who
lacks authority to resolve it, the supervisor shall immediately forward the
grievance to the employee's department head or other appropriate supervisor to
ensure that the grievance is acted on in a timely manner.
(2)   Step 2. If the employee is not satisfied with the step 1 decision, the
employee may file an appeal with his division head within seven calendar days
following receipt of the step 1 decision. The division head shall respond, in
writing, within ten calendar days of the receipt of the written grievance. In
some cases, the division head may feel that a second meeting would be
constructive. If so, the division head may schedule a meeting with the employee
within seven calendar days after receiving the written grievance, fairly
investigate the matter and render a written decision on the grievance within
seven calendar days of the meeting. If an employee has filed a grievance with a
division head who lacks authority to resolve it, the division head shall
immediately forward the grievance to the employee's department head to ensure
that the grievance is acted on in a timely manner.
(3)   Step 3. If the employee is not satisfied with the step 2 decision, the
employee may file an appeal with his department head within seven calendar days
following receipt of the step 2 decision. The department head shall within ten
calendar days hold a meeting with the employee for the purpose of discussing
the grievance fully. The department head will render a written decision within
ten calendar days of the meeting.
(4)   Step 4. If the employee is not satisfied with the step 3 decision, the
employee may file a written appeal with the city manager within seven calendar
days following receipt of the step 3 decision. Within 15 calendar days of
receipt of such request, the city manager shall hear matters pertinent to the
grievance. In so doing, the manager may appoint a grievance committee to assist
him in resolving the grievance. The role of such a committee shall be advisory
and not binding on the city manager. Within 30 calendar days of such hearing,
the decision of the city manager shall be reduced to writing and transmitted to
the aggrieved employee by hand delivery or certified mail, return receipt
requested. The decision shall also be distributed to the aggrieved employee's
department head and the personnel department. In cases where the employee has
been discharged, suspended, reduced in rank, transferred against his will or
denied any promotion or raise in pay to which he would be entitled to, the
decision of the city manager may be appealed to the civil service board as
specified in step 5. In all other cases, the decision of the city manager is
final.
(5)   Step 5. If the employee is not satisfied with the step 4 decision, the
employee may appeal his grievance to the civil service board. Such appeal shall
be filed with the city clerk within ten days following receipt of the step 4
decision. The city clerk shall set the matter for hearing before the civil
service board at a date not less than five and no more than 15 days from the
clerk's receipt of such notice. If timely appealed, the civil service board
shall only hear the grievance of a city employee who has been discharged,
suspended, reduced in rank, transferred against his will or denied any
promotion or raise in pay to which he would be entitled to determine whether or
not the action complained of is justified. If the board determines that the act
or omission complained of is not justified, the board shall order the city to
rescind whatever action the board has found to be unjustified and may order the
city to take such steps as are necessary for a just conclusion of the matter
before the board.
(6)   Step 6. If the employee is not satisfied with the step 5 decision, the
employee may appeal his grievance to the county superior court for a trial de
novo. Such appeal shall be filed with the clerk of superior court of the county
within ten days of the receipt of the board's decision.

Sec. 2-230. Departmental predisciplinary conference.
(a)   Purpose. A departmental predisciplinary conference shall be afforded any
full-time permanent employee whose conduct or performance may result in his
involuntary demotion, suspension without pay for more than fourteen (14)
calendar days or dismissal from the city service. At such conference, the
employee shall be given the opportunity to respond to the alleged inappropriate
conduct or unsatisfactory performance, and the information received from the
employee shall be used by the department head in determining whether or not
there are reasonable grounds to support the action of suspension, demotion or
dismissal.
(b)   Procedure. The employee shall be given a minimum of 48 hours' notice of
the date, time, location and subject matter of the predisciplinary conference.
The notice shall be written and acknowledged as received by the employee or by
his department or division head in cases where the employee refuses to
acknowledge receipt. The predisciplinary conference shall be attended by and
limited to the following:
(1)   The employee;
(2)   The supervisor of the employee;
(3)   The department head; and
(4)   A representative from the personnel department when requested by the
employee or department head.
Such personnel representative shall be the director of personnel or his
designee. In addition, either party may be represented by counsel. The
conference shall be administrative in nature, and full opportunity will be
afforded the employee to respond to the issues. At the conclusion of the
conference, the employee will be advised as to when a decision will be made
regarding the actions, if any, to be taken in the matter. The department head
shall deliver a written decision to the employee within ten calendar days.
(c)   Failure to appear. If the employee is duly notified and fails to appear
for the predisciplinary conference, he shall forfeit the right to such a
conference.
(d)   Procedure for appeal to city manager. Any permanent full-time employee
who is suspended without pay for more than ten consecutive work shifts, demoted
or dismissed pursuant to this article shall have the right to appeal directly
to the city manager under the grievance procedure. Such an appeal shall be
requested in writing within 12 calendar days of the departmental action being
appealed. All provisions of the grievance procedure regarding appeal to the
city manager and the civil service board shall be applicable.

(Ord. No. 3731, § 1, 4-28-09)
Sec. 3-2. Findings.
The Asheville City Council makes the following findings to accomplish the
objectives of vigorous and effective enforcement of this chapter:
(1)   That compliance with rabies vaccination laws as spelled out in the North
Carolina General Statutes, Part 6 of Article 6 of Chapter 130A, is necessary
for the protection of public health, for the protection of owners of the
animals and to enable the animal control officer to accomplish his/her duties.
The owner of an animal has a serious ownership obligation and duty to the
citizens of Asheville to comply with the rabies vaccination laws.
(2)   That the presence of a dog when off-premises in violation of article II
of this chapter often creates substantial anxieties and concerns for the safety
and free movement of people and, therefore, the owner has an obligation to the
citizens of the city to effectively confine and physically control his/her dog.
(3)   That the possibility of a dog bite causes serious anxiety for citizens of
the city and, therefore, owners have an obligation to prevent the creation of
that apprehension and concern.
(4)   That a dog owner has a responsibility to be aware of any possible dangers
to children under the age of seven years who, at that age, are unable to fully
appreciate the possible danger presented by a dog and a dog's reaction to a
young child.
(5)   That a dog owner has a responsibility to be aware of any possible dangers
to disabled and elderly persons who may not be able to physically ward off an
aggressive dog.
(6)   That the animal control officer must have sufficient authority to impose
preventive measures, to seize animals, and, if necessary, to determine
ownership rights.
(7)   That the city must adopt civil penalties, fines and other sanctions as
measures to protect the citizens of the city and to declare that the ownership
of pets entails responsibility on the part of the owners.
(Ord. No. 3731, § 1, 4-28-09)
Sec. 3-3. Purpose.
It shall be the purpose of this chapter to prohibit certain acts, omissions and
conditions which interfere with the health, safety and general welfare of the

officer shall have the authority to allow for reasonable extensions of time
limits based on good faith progress of implementation of the preventive
measures. Any approved extensions shall be in writing.
(d)   Failure to comply with the written order. It shall be unlawful for an
owner to fail to comply with a written order to take preventive measures within
the designated time for compliance stated in the written order or any extension

in writing; (2) the order has been in effect without incident or review for 24
months; (3) there have been no violations of the animal control ordinance by
the owner for the past 24 months. Upon receipt of a valid review request, the

order, modify the order or nullify the order based on the totality of the
circumstances. The decision of the animal control administrator is subject to
appeal as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
(g)   Injury to person. If an animal has caused serious injury to any person,
upon the finding by the animal control officer that an animal is a danger to
the health, safety or welfare of the general public, the owner shall forfeit
his or her ownership rights and the animal shall be put down. The animal
control officer shall make the decision in writing and serve said decision upon

shelter in a humane manner. Impoundment of such an animal shall not relieve the
owner thereof from any penalty that may be imposed for violation of this
chapter.
(c)   Notice to owner. Upon impounding an animal, the animal control officer
shall inspect the animal for identification such as a tag, microchip or tattoo
and make a reasonable effort to notify the owner and inform such owner of the

loss or possible impoundment of an animal must check the animal shelter since
all animals seized or impounded under this ordinance shall be available for
inspection and reclamation during the shelter's normal business hours. The 72-
hour period begins when the animal control officer delivers the animal to the
animal shelter.
(d)   Redemption by owner generally. The owner of an animal impounded under
this section may redeem the animal and regain possession thereof within 72-

this section, by complying with all applicable provisions of this chapter, and
making payment of any veterinarian fees and any redemption fees as determined
by City of Asheville. Fee rates shall be available for public inspection in the
office of the director of animal control. The owner shall make all redemption

released for adoption from the animal shelter be spayed or neutered.

in accordance with this chapter and applicable state laws.
(h)   Destruction of wounded or diseased animals. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this section, any animal impounded that is badly wounded or
diseased and has no identification may be destroyed immediately in a humane

shelter attendants may destroy the animal in a humane manner.
(Ord. No. 3731, § 1, 4-28-09)
Sec. 3-30. Seizure and disposition of animals.
(a)   In addition to any other authority or procedure authorized by this
chapter or by any other law to seize an animal, the animal control officer
shall have the authority to summarily seize any animal from the premises when
the animal control officer determines that the animal is receiving insufficient
care or treatment as set forth in section
3-12 or that the animal in the surrounding circumstances is dangerous to the
health, safety or welfare of the general public. Upon summarily seizing an
animal, the animal control officer shall provide the owner with a written order
of seizure. The animal control officer shall give notice of this section by
posting a copy of it at the location where the animal was seized or by
delivering it to a person residing on the property of the owner within 24-hours
from the time the animal was seized.
(b)   Obligation of owner to comply with seizure order. When the animal control
officer serves the owner with a written order of seizure, it shall be unlawful
for the owner to fail to comply with the order or to interfere with the animal
control officer. A sworn officer shall accompany the animal control officer to
seize the animal. Violation of this provision shall constitute a criminal
offense and may be punished as set forth in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-4.
(c)   A challenge to the seizure order. If the owner wishes to challenge the
seizure order, then the owner must submit in writing the basis of the challenge
within three business days of the seizure of the animal, not counting the day
of seizure of the animal. The challenge must be filed with the director of
animal control. The challenge to the seizure order shall be handled in the same
manner as provided for in section
3-18 of this chapter.
(d)   Owner's redemption of animal. The owner is entitled to redeem the animal,
unless the animal control department retains the animal upon some other basis
of legal authority, by paying all applicable fees, citation fees, boarding
fees, any other costs that are attributable to the seizure of the animal, and
complying with any outstanding order of the animal control officer.
(e)   Termination of owner's rights. If an owner fails to comply with the
requirements that constituted the basis for seizing the animal, or fails to
reclaim the animal within the time allowed to appeal the seizure, then the
animal shelter shall have the authority to humanely destroy the animal or place
the animal for sale to the public, or to place the animal with a local humane
society for future placement through the humane society, unless the animal's
owner provides a security bond or cash in accordance with subsection (f).
(f)   Security bond. Any person claiming an ownership interest in any animal
confined pursuant to this chapter may prevent the disposition of the animal
after the holding period set forth in subsections
3-29(c) or
3-30(e) by posting a security bond or cash with the animal shelter prior to the
animal being adopted or euthanized in an amount sufficient to guarantee payment
of all of the reasonable expenses expected to be incurred in caring and
providing for the animal, including the estimated cost of medical care, for at
least 30 days; However, such security bond shall not prevent the animal shelter
from disposing of the animal at the end of the 30-day period covered by the
posted bond/cash, unless the person claiming an ownership interest in the
animal posts an additional security bond or cash with the animal shelter to
secure payment of the animal's reasonable expenses for an additional 30 days,
and does so prior to the expiration of the first 30-day period. The amount of
the bond/cash shall be determined by the director of the animal shelter or his/
her designee based on the current rate for board and on the condition of the
animal after examination by a veterinary professional. Failure to post the
security bond within the time allowed shall result in the animal being
immediately forfeited to the animal shelter. The owner must comply with any
order issued by the animal control officer and pay all city fees and fines
before the animal may be released from the animal shelter.
(g)   Security bond forfeited upon failure to pay costs. If the fees, costs,
and penalties owed for the animal are not paid in full by the end of each
security period, the security bond already posted shall be forfeited to the
animal shelter on said date and used to pay the remaining unpaid fees, costs,
and penalties owing for the animal. The animal's owner shall remain responsible
for all remaining unpaid fees, costs, and penalties. Any security bond/cash
remaining after the payment of all fees, costs, and penalties shall be remitted
to the person who posted the bond/cash.

If, upon such hearing as provided in section
4-183, the building inspector shall find that the building or structure in
question is in such a dilapidated or substandard state of disrepair as to
constitute a fire or safety hazard or to be dangerous to life, health or other
property or is a public nuisance, he shall make an order in writing, directed
to the owner of the building or structure, requiring the owner to remedy such
conditions so found to exist by demolishing and removing the building or
structure or taking such other steps as may be necessary to abate the nuisance
and remove the hazards, within such period, not less than 60 days, as the
building inspector may prescribe.
(Code 1965, § 8-54)
Sec. 4-185. Appeal.
The owner of any unsafe building or structure ordered by the building inspector
to be demolished and removed or who is directed by the building inspector to
take any other steps to abate a nuisance or remove hazards found by the
building inspector to exist shall have the right of appeal from such order to
the city council. Such owner shall give notice of appeal to the building
inspector at the time of the hearing at which the order is made or, within ten
days after such order is made, shall file with the building inspector a written
notice of such appeal. Notice of appeal shall state the grounds therefor.
Unless an appeal is taken within the time and in the manner prescribed in this
section, the action of the building inspector shall be deemed final, subject
only to such action as the city council may take as provided in this article.
Where an appeal has been properly taken and notice thereof given in accordance
with the provisions of this section, it shall be the duty of the building
inspector to report the appeal to the city manager, who shall cause the matter
to be placed on the agenda for action by the city council at its next ensuing

If the owner does not appeal from the final order or direction of the building
inspector requiring the unsafe building or structure be demolished and removed
or the taking of such other steps to abate the nuisance and remove the hazards
and fails or refuses to comply with such order and direction, the building
inspector shall file a written report thereof with the city manager, who shall
cause such report to be placed on the agenda for action by the city council at
its next ensuing regular meeting or at some subsequent meeting to which the
city council may continue the action. The building inspector shall mail a copy
of the report by certified or registered mail to the owner at his last known
address or have a copy of the report delivered to the owner. The report shall

be scheduled for action.
(Code 1965, § 8-56)
Sec. 4-187. Order of city council; assessment of costs.
In all cases referred to in this article that reach the city council for
action, either upon appeal of the owner from the ruling of the building
inspector or upon report of the building inspector that the owner fails or
refuses to comply with his order or direction, the city council shall hear the
matter. If the city council finds and determines that the building or structure
in question is in such a dilapidated or substandard state of disrepair as to
constitute a fire or safety hazard or to be dangerous to life, health or other
property or is a public nuisance and that the owner of the building or
structure has failed or refused to abate the nuisance and has failed or refused
to have the building or structure demolished and removed or has failed or
refused to take such other steps as may be necessary to abate the nuisance and
remove the hazards found to exist, the council may cause the demolition and
removal of such building or structure to be done or effect such other remedies
as may be necessary to abate the nuisance and remove the hazards and specially
assess the cost of such work against the lot or parcel of land on which the
building or structure was situated. Such assessment shall constitute a specific
lien upon the lot or parcel of land which may be enforced by an action
instituted in the name of the city in the nature of an action to foreclose a
mortgage as provided by G.S. 105- 414 and in the case of ad valorem taxes and
local improvement assessments.
(Code 1965, § 8-57)
Sec. 4-188. Notice of city council hearing.
In cases in which the building inspector has been unable to give the owner
actual notice of hearing in the manner provided in this article and has given
such notice by posting and publishing the notice as authorized in section
4-183 and the owner has failed or refused to comply with the order or direction
of the building inspector to demolish and remove the building or structure or
take such other remedial action as will remove the hazards and such case is
referred to the city council for action, the city council shall, before taking
such action, cause to be posted on the outside of the building or structure in
question, at least ten days prior to the date fixed for the hearing, and
published one time in a qualified newspaper having circulation in the city, at
least one week prior to the date fixed for such hearing, a written notice
stating the name of the owner as appears of record in the office of the
register of deeds of the county, the address or location of the building or
structure involved and the time, place and purpose of the hearing and such
other information as the city council may deem advisable.
(Code 1965, § 8-58)
Sec. 4-189. Presumption of danger to public.
In all cases in which the city council, under authority of this article, causes
the demolition and removal of any building or structure to be carried out or
directs such other remedial steps to be taken as may be necessary to abate the
nuisance and remove the hazard, it shall be conclusively presumed that the
public nuisance and the fire and safety hazard and danger to life, health or
other property created and maintained by the continued presence of such
building or structure in such condition as is found to exist constitute a clear
and present danger amounting to a situation of emergency involving the public
health, safety and general welfare which requires entry upon private property
for the summary abatement and removal of such danger, in the public interest.
(Code 1965, § 8-59)
Sec. 4-190. Willful failure or refusal to comply with order.
It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully fail or refuse to comply with
any final order or direction of the building inspector or city council made by
virtue and in pursuance of this article. Any such violation shall subject the
offender to the criminal penalty provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 14-4. Every
day such person shall willfully fail or refuse to comply with any final order
or direction of the building inspector or city council made by virtue and in
pursuance of this article shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.

exposed to the elements and not reasonably expected to contribute to decay of
wood surfaces is not required to be treated. All siding shall be weather-
resistant and watertight. All masonry joints shall be sufficiently tuck pointed
to insure water and air tightness. "Sufficiently tuck pointed" means that
mortar shall not be removable by finger pressure.
5.   Roofs. Roofs shall be structurally sound, and maintained in a safe manner
and have no defects which might admit rain or cause dampness in the walls or
interior portion of the dwelling. The following may constitute evidence of
defects: Missing shingles; flashing(s) missing; roof deflection deeper than of

substantially vermin-proof, shall be kept in sound condition and good repair
and shall be safe to use and capable of supporting the load which normal use
may cause to be placed thereon. Interior finish shall be free of excessive
holes and cracks. No cardboard or other highly combustible or improper wall
finish or ceiling finish shall be allowed. No rotted, fire-damaged, or loose
flooring shall be allowed. All floors shall be level enough so as not to
present a tripping hazard. Every bathroom floor surface and kitchen floor
surface shall be constructed and maintained so as to be reasonably impervious
to water and so as to permit such floor to be readily kept in clean and
sanitary condition.
c.   Windows and window assemblies.
1.   Each window shall be weathertight, watertight and rodent proof, and shall
be kept in sound working condition and good repair. If daylight can be seen
around the inside or outside perimeter of the window casing, that window does
not meet this standard. Every openable window shall be equipped with an
effective locking mechanism or other mechanism that functions as a lock.
2.   Each window sash shall be fully supplied with glass window panes or an
approved substitute which are without open cracks or holes. Wood, cardboard or
polyethylene or other plastic film are not approved substitutes. A window pane
with a crack or hole must be replaced or the crack or hole sealed with clear
silicone seal. A broken window (pieces missing or exposed glass edge) must be
replaced.

for emergency escape should have a vertical measurement of no more than 44
inches from the sill or fixed portion of the grill to the finished floor.
Exception: If a room used for sleeping has a door leading directly to the
outside of the building at or to grade level.
6.   Screens. In order to provide for required ventilation, dwelling units
which do not have central air conditioning systems shall have fitted screens in
good repair on all operable windows. One window or skylight facing directly
outdoors must be provided in all habitable rooms and must have a screen.
Screens shall provide a continuous barrier to insects. Warning: Screens will
not stop a child from falling out a window; a child shall be kept away from an
open window.

a.   Service. Adequate electric service must be provided to the dwelling.
"Adequate" means a minimum of 60 ampere service with no more than five two-wire
branch circuits connected and a total connected load of less than ten
kilowatts. If a service has six or more two-wire branch circuits, 100 ampere
service at a minimum must be provided. If the connected electrical load exceeds
the capacity of a 100 ampere service, a service of sufficient ampere capacity
to safely bear the connected electrical load shall be furnished. "Edison base"
fuses shall not be permitted as components of any electrical service, and no
more than one two-wire branch circuit shall be connected to any fuse, circuit
breaker or other approved over-current protection device. Drop cords from a
neighboring source, generator or similar source are not "adequate" for purposes
of this Code.
Every new or additional electrical outlet and fixture required by the Code
shall be installed, maintained and connected to a source of electric power in
accordance with the provisions of the North Carolina Building Code.
b.   Wiring. All outlets, switches, wiring and light fixtures shall be safe and
operable. Any new outlets shall be installed to the standards of the North
Carolina State Building Code. Appliances such as refrigerators, washing
machines, dishwashers, microwaves and air conditioners shall be protected by a
grounded receptacle. An ungrounded ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) may
be installed pursuant to the National Electrical Code (NEC); however these are
not recommended for refrigerators. Outlets within 6 feet of a source of water
shall be protected by a grounded outlet or GFCI. An arc-fault interrupter is
recommended, but not required, for extensions of bedroom circuits. No extension
cords shall be spliced or used as fixed wiring or permanently installed to
service appliances or fixtures. Extension cords shall be used only as temporary
extensions for portable equipment not routinely used in an area where
permanently wired receptacles are not available or installed. Cords shall not
be run through openings in walls, ceilings, or doorways; attached or fixed
permanently to any surface; run under carpets or floorings; or plugged into a
power strip. Multi-outlet assemblies (power strips) shall be equipped with fuse
or circuit breaker and used in accordance with the limitation of the product
label of the testing agency. Electrical odor, flickering lights, visibly frayed
wiring, broken switch plates or outlet plates or failure of circuit-tester
check shall be evidence of an unsafe electrical system.
c.   Light fixtures and outlets.
1.   Halls and stairways. Every hall and stairway of every dwelling shall be
lighted, including exterior stairways and stairways in halls and public space.
2.   Every hall, water closet compartment, bathroom, laundry room or furnace
room shall contain at least one ceiling-mounted or wall-mounted fixture outlet.
For purposes of this section a laundry closet shall not be considered a laundry
room.
3.   Bedrooms shall have, in addition at least one wall switch controlled
lighting outlet or ceiling light fixture or permanent fixture controlled by a
pull chain.
4.   In bathrooms, the lighting outlet shall be controlled by a wall switch or
fixture pull chain. In addition to the lighting outlet in every bathroom and
laundry room, there shall be provided at least one receptacle outlet. Any new
or replacement bathroom receptacle outlet shall have ground fault circuit
interrupter protection.
5.   Every habitable room or space shall contain at least two separate and
remote duplex receptacle outlets.
6.   In kitchens, three separate, remote and accessible receptacle outlets
shall be provided, and a wall or ceiling light outlet controlled by a wall
switch or fixture pull-chain shall be provided. An outlet dedicated to powering
an appliance and/or not easily accessible because it is blocked by an
appliance, shall not be counted as a separate outlet. In kitchens with less
than six linear feet of counter top, two of the three required outlets may be
within the counter top space.
Exception: When an existing kitchen area is less than 70 square feet of floor
area, two separate, remote and accessible receptacle outlets shall be provided,
and a wall or ceiling lighting outlet controlled by a wall switch or fixture
pull-chain shall be provided.
(6)   Plumbing.
a.   Sanitary. Every dwelling shall be furnished with a potable water supply
system. "Potable water supply" means direct connection to a well, to a public
water utility or equivalent water service delivery system, and does not include
water delivered through a hose or via containers. Every dwelling shall contain
not less than a kitchen sink, lavatory, tub or shower, and a water closet all
in good working condition and properly connected to a functioning water and
sewer system. Every plumbing fixture and water and waste pipe shall be
maintained in good sanitary working condition. "Properly connected" means
connected with approved plumbing materials (no radiator hose, duct tape, etc.).
Any new, additional or repair plumbing must meet the current requirements of
the North Carolina Building Code. Provided, however, that the kitchen sink
standards enumerated herein shall not apply to hotels, motels and other
transient places unless kitchen sinks are otherwise required.
b.   Location of sanitary facilities. All required plumbing fixtures shall be
located within the dwelling and be accessible to the occupants of the same. The
water closet, tub or shower and lavatory shall be located in a room or
adjoining rooms affording privacy to the user. Required bathrooms shall be
accessible from habitable rooms, hallways, corridors or other protected or
enclosed areas.
c.   Hot and cold water supply. Every dwelling shall have connected to the
kitchen sink, lavatory, bathtub or shower, an adequate supply of both cold and
hot water. All water shall be supplied through a functioning distribution
system connected to a potable water supply.
d.   Water heating. Every dwelling shall have water heating facilities which
appear to be properly installed, appear to be in safe and good working
condition, respond to normal operating controls, and capable of heating water
to such a temperature so as to permit hot water to be drawn consecutively (that
is, at one tap after the other, and not simultaneously) at every required
kitchen sink, lavatory basin, bathtub or shower at a temperature of not less
than 116 degrees F. Such water heating facilities shall be capable of meeting
the requirements of this subsection when the dwelling's heating facilities
required under the provisions of the Code are not in operation. Apartment
houses may use a centralized water heating facility capable of delivering an
amount of hot water in the quantity and at the temperature described above.
Water heaters shall be equipped with approved relief valves, which are piped to
a point not more than six inches above the floor. The pipe material for the
relief valve shall be properly connected and rated for interior water service
lines. The discharge end of the extension tube may not be threaded.
e.   Bathroom access. Bathroom access shall be provided in a manner that does
not require an occupant to leave the dwelling to gain access. Privacy of
bathrooms shall be afforded by doors complete with privacy hardware intended by
the manufacturer for that purpose.
f.   Water closet, lavatory and bath facilities for boarding houses. At least
one flush water closet, lavatory basin, and bathtub or shower, properly
connected to a water and sewer system and in good working condition, shall be
supplied for each four rooms within a rooming house wherever such facilities
are shared. All such facilities shall be located on the floor they serve within
the dwelling so as to be private and reasonably accessible from a common hall
or passageway to all persons sharing such facilities.
(7)   Mechanical.
a.   Heat. Every dwelling shall have heating facilities which appear to be
properly installed, appear to be in safe and good working condition, respond to
normal operating controls, and capable of maintaining a room temperature of 65
degrees in all habitable rooms. Each heating system shall have at least one
readily-adjustable control for regulation of living space temperature in each
dwelling unit. Radiator control knobs in good working order shall be regarded
as a readily- adjustable control.
1.   Where a central heating system is not provided for a dwelling, the
dwelling shall be provided with properly installed baseboard electric heat,
properly installed and properly vented wood or fossil fuel heater(s), or
unvented natural gas heaters having oxygen depletion sensors listed for
residential use by UL, ETL, or other North Carolina recognized testing
laboratory and installed in strict accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions.
2.   The following heating devices do not meet the requirements of subsection
(g)(1)a. of this section: (i) portable electric heating units; and (ii) un-
vented fuel-burning heaters.
3.   The use of unvented fuel-burning heaters is prohibited in any bedroom.
4.   Heating appliance clearances maintained at 36 inches from combustible
materials and/or surfaces, except that clearances may be reduced as provided in
National Fire Protection Association's Standard 211, "Chimneys, Fireplaces,
Vents and Solid Fuel-Burning Appliances," 1992 edition.
5.   Central warm air heating systems for multi-family units have not been
allowed since 1991. The furnaces for shared systems may be repaired or cleaned,
however, may not be reconfigured or replaced unless the entire system is made
to comply with the present North Carolina State Building Code. This means that
ventilation air may not be recirculated from one dwelling unit to another. The
owner and heating contractor will need to address the entire scope of work in
the permitted work including but not limited to fire stopping, damper systems
when necessary; fire-rating mechanical rooms if necessary and allowing proper
access to mechanical areas.
b.   Chimneys.
1.   Chimneys must appear to be safe for use as specified and intended.
"Specified" means use in connection with specific heating appliances or
systems, or limitations of such use. "Intended" means use in connection with
combustion of fuel, for which the following minimum chimney standards apply:
flue liner intact; chimney mortar and bricks secure; flue unobstructed;
fireplace firebricks intact; stove piping placed and secured with clearances as
follows:
(i)   Minimum 12-inch brick clearance separation from combustibles; or
(ii)   Minimum nine-inch air separation for insulated listed stove-piping; or
(iii)   Minimum one-inch air clearance surrounded by six-inch glass fiber
insulation and ventilated thimble assembly; or
(iv)   Minimum two-inch air separation for insulated listed stove-piping with
one-inch air space between inner and outer chimney components; and as otherwise
described in National Fire Protection Association's Standard 211, "Chimneys,
Fireplaces, Vents and Solid Fuel-Burning Appliances," 1992 edition.
2.   Chimneys that do not meet these standards shall either be repaired or
sealed.
c.   Cooking equipment. All cooking equipment and facilities shall be installed
in an approved manner and shall be maintained in safe working condition.
Portable cooking equipment employing flame is prohibited as a substitute for
approved cooking equipment. Portable cooking equipment is prohibited outside
the kitchen area of a boarding or rooming house.
d.   Master meters. All duplex and multi-family dwellings must conform to the
city's Unified Development Ordinance. If permitted in 1977 or later, as
required by N.C.G.S., sec. 143-151.42, each individual dwelling unit must have
separate electric and gas utility meter services.
(8)   General. Violation(s) of state building code regulations for existing
multi-family dwellings. A dwelling that is not in compliance with the state
building code shall be considered unfit and ineligible for a housing
certificate under this Code unless the owner has been granted a building permit
for work that would bring the structure into compliance with the state building
code. Expiration of the permit without completion of such work shall result in
revocation of the housing certificate issued for such dwelling.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03)
Sec. 4-211. Alternate means.
(a)   The housing code coordinator may authorize an alternate means of meeting
the requirements of this Code only under the following circumstances as
established by the owner(s):
(1)   The condition for which the alternate means is sought is not one of the
conditions set forth in section
4-209 of this Code.
(2)   The condition for which the alternate means is sought is an element of
the fundamental and original construction of the dwelling. "Fundamental and
original construction" includes foundation dimensions, ceiling height,
organization of habitable space, and any other condition governed by the
original structure of the dwelling; and
(3)   There exists a demonstrable alternate means of meeting the intent of this
Code.
(b)   In the event that the code enforcement officer withholds approval of one
or more plumbing, electrical, mechanical, structural or fire safety components,
the code enforcement officer may accept approval of such components without
further corrections upon receipt of a report from an appropriately licensed
contractor, architect or engineer certified in North Carolina, as specified by
the code enforcement officer in writing.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03)
Sec. 4-212. Reserved.
Sec. 4-213. Duties of tenants.
This Code is not intended to interfere with or abrogate the duties imposed on
tenants of rental property by N.C.G.S., Chapter 42-43, or with lawful written
agreements between property owners and tenants.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03)
Sec. 4-214. Responsibility of owner.
The owner remains responsible for complying with the provisions of this Code,
even though:
(1)   An obligation is also imposed on the occupants.
(2)   The owner has, by agreement, imposed on the occupant the duty of
complying with this Code.
(3)   In cases where a part of a dwelling unit or dwelling is owned by an
association of owners and the balance of such dwelling unit or dwelling is
owned by an individual owner, responsibility for compliance lies with the owner
of that part of the dwelling unit or dwelling not in compliance with this Code.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03)
Sec. 4-215. Third party inspector program.
(a)   The housing code coordinator shall develop standards and requirements for
certification of third party inspectors as qualified to conduct a housing
inspection under this Code, which standards and requirements shall be approved
by the director of the City of Asheville Building Safety Department. Such
standards and requirements shall include, but not be limited to, training and
education, insurance and bonding, assumption of liability and continuing
education standards. A housing inspection conducted by such an inspector, who
shall be an independent contractor and not a city employee, shall be treated as
if conducted by a code enforcement officer for purposes of enforcement of this
Code.
(b)   The results of an inspection conducted under authority of this section
shall be turned over to the code enforcement officer in written form within
five working days of completion of such inspection. At the time of receipt of
the foregoing report, the code enforcement officer shall proceed to enforce the
provisions of this Code.
(c)   The housing code coordinator shall maintain a listing of approved third-
party inspectors.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03)
Sec. 4-216. Administration of the code
(a)   Powers of the code enforcement officer: The housing code coordinator
shall have such powers as may be necessary, lawful, or convenient to carry out
and effectuate the purpose and provisions of this Code, including without
limiting the generality of the foregoing the following powers:
(1)   To investigate the dwelling conditions in the city in order to determine
which dwellings therein are unfit for human habitation.
(2)   To administer oaths, affirmations, examine witnesses and receive
evidence.
(3)   To enter upon premises for the purpose of making inspections in a manner
that will cause the least possible inconvenience to the persons in possession.
(4)   To appoint and fix the duties, as provided in this Code, of such
officers, agents, and employees as he deems necessary to carry out the purpose
of this Code.
(b)   Inspections.
(1)   It shall be the duty of the code enforcement officer to periodically
examine the dwellings located in the city for the purpose of determining the
fitness of dwellings for human habitation, and for the enforcement and
administration of this Code.
In exercising this power, the code enforcement officer shall have a right to
enter on any premises within the city at all reasonable hours (between 9:00
a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday and at the convenience of the
occupant) for the purpose of inspection or other enforcement action, upon
presentation of proper credentials. Upon refusal after proper notice, the code
enforcement officer shall have the right to inspect pursuant to N.C.G.S.,
article 4A of chapter 15, as amended.
(2)   If, during the course of an inspection, the code enforcement officer
finds evidence of construction in progress that would require a permit (or
permits) pursuant to N.C.G.S., sec. 160A-417, the owner shall produce evidence
that such permit(s) have been obtained prior to issuance of any housing
certificate.
(3)   It shall be the responsibility of the owner to relocate any moveable
obstructions (furniture, boxes, appliances and construction materials, for
example) that would otherwise interfere with a complete housing certificate
inspection. The code enforcement officer shall not be responsible for failure
to detect violations of this Code when such violations are concealed behind,
under or above walls, floors, ceilings or other fixed components of the
dwelling that are not readily accessible. Inspections are primarily usual in
nature and not technically exhaustive.
(4)   Housing authority.
a.   The Asheville Housing Authority ("authority") shall be authorized to
provide inspections under this Code in dwelling units owned or regulated by the
authority. It shall be the responsibility of the authority to ensure that all
inspectors are properly trained to conduct inspections under the City of
Asheville Housing Code on a report form approved by the housing code
coordinator. The authority must maintain a file on all inspections and notify
the housing code coordinator in writing when inspections are completed. Should
evidence show that inspections are not performed in accordance with this Code,
then authorization may be withdrawn by the housing code coordinator.
b.   All complaints received on dwelling units owned or regulated by the
authority shall be processed pursuant to section
4-217 of the Code.
(c)   Housing certificate/life safety letter of compliance.
(1)   For rental dwellings, whether occupied or vacant, the owner is required
to obtain a housing certificate as follows:
a.   Single-family dwellings.
b.   Buildings containing up to five dwelling units; at least one unit must be
inspected.
c.   Buildings containing six or more dwelling units; an inspection shall take
place in 20 percent of the dwelling units in each building. Provided, however,
multi-family complexes with a verifiable maintenance program, a housing
certificate inspection shall take place in ten percent of the dwelling units in
each building.
Selection of units for inspection shall be random in nature and at the
discretion of the code enforcement officer. In a required inspection, if an
average of four or more violations of the standards set forth in section
4-210 of this Code is present in each dwelling unit, an additional 20 percent
of the dwelling units in each building shall be inspected.
d.   Nonconformity. All dwellings not conforming, as of the effective date of
this Code, to the housing certificate requirements of the housing code, adopted
in article VII of chapter 4 of the Code of Ordinances on November 30, 1993, 100
percent of the dwelling units must be inspected under the provisions of this
Code.
e.   Conformity. All dwellings conforming, as of the effective date of this
Code, to the housing certificate requirements of the housing code, adopted in
article VII of chapter 4 of the Code of Ordinances on November 30, 1993, except
as herein provided, shall be deemed conforming to the terms of this Code.
Additionally, all dwellings having received a certificate of occupancy, on or
after July 1, 1994, except as herein provided, shall be deemed conforming to
the terms of this Code.
f.   Annexation. Dwellings annexed into the city shall obtain a housing
certificate in accordance with this Code within five years of annexation, or
upon a change of occupancy, whichever occurs first.
g.   Duration of housing certificate. Any housing certificate deemed conforming
to the terms of this section, or any housing certificate issued pursuant to
this Code, shall apply to all dwelling units within the building inspected. The
housing certificate shall remain valid until there is a failure to maintain the
dwelling in compliance with the terms of this Code. Provided, however, if an
average of four (4) or more violations of the standards set forth in section
4-210 of this Code are identified, the code enforcement officer may invalidate
the housing certificate. If invalidated, a new housing certificate shall be
required. Failure to respond to inspection scheduling efforts on the part of
the code enforcement officer shall be a violation of this Code.
(2)   Owner occupied dwellings. Upon change of occupancy, it shall be a
violation of this Code to occupy the property without a life safety report
addressing the conditions set forth in section
4-209 of this Code. If the life safety report identifies a violation of any of
the standards set forth in section
4-209 of this Code, it shall be a violation of this Code to occupy the property
without a life safety letter of compliance from the code enforcement officer
stating that there is compliance with section
4-209. This subsection (2) shall apply to all owner occupied dwellings except:
a.   If the dwelling conforms as of the effective date of this Code, with the
housing certificate requirements of the housing code, adopted in article VII of
chapter 4 of the Code of Ordinances on November 30, 1993; or
b.   If the dwelling received a certificate of occupancy, on or after July 1,
1994; or
c.   If the dwelling previously received a housing certificate or life safety
letter of compliance under the terms of this Code.
(3)   General.
a.   When a housing certificate has been requested, the city's inspection form
must be completed and re-inspection must be scheduled by the owner within 90
days of the initial inspection. The re- inspection shall consist primarily of a
recheck of Code violations listed on the initial inspection report. Any
additional violations noted at the time of the re-inspection, will become part
of the inspection record and shared with the owner. Additional "life safety/
unsafe conditions" shall be required to be corrected prior to issuance of a
housing certificate. Less serious issues shall be recommended for repair.
b.   The code enforcement officer certifies to the findings of the inspection
only upon the date of issue and not beyond. A disclaimer to this effect shall
appear on all housing certificates and life safety letters of compliance
issued.
c.   No housing certificate, life safety letter of compliance, or temporary
housing certificate shall be issued if electrical service and/or water service
is not present at the time of inspection.
d.   Once a housing certificate or life safety letter of compliance has been
issued, no additional inspections, certificates or letters will be required at
any future change of occupancy as long as the owner maintains the property in
compliance with the standards of this Code.
e.   Nothing herein shall prevent either the buyer or seller from requesting a
housing certificate inspection.
f.   Violations of section
7-5-2 (zoning permits), of the city's unified development ordinance as it may
be amended from time to time, shall be corrected prior to occupancy.
(d)   Temporary housing certificate. Where no violation as described in section
4-209 of this Code is identified, the code enforcement officer may issue a
temporary housing certificate to an owner contingent upon completion of
violations identified in the inspection report. The owner must agree to vacate
the dwelling immediately upon failure to complete the repairs within the time
period specified in the temporary certificate. Upon expiration of the temporary
certificate, the dwelling shall be deemed unfit, and the code enforcement
officer may proceed to enforce this Code. Temporary housing certificates can be
renewed or extended upon request for renewal and must be approved by the code
enforcement officer.
(e)   Fees. The housing code division will charge the owner such inspection
fees as may be established from time to time by the city council as set forth
in the city's fees and charges manual.
(f)   Reports. Inspection findings will be recorded on standardized report
forms and provided to the owner. Such standardized reports shall include
specific references to sections of the Code when any violations are recorded.
The reports shall contain notice of any deficiencies under the Code and inform
the owner of any deadline to remedy the deficiencies. It is the responsibility
of the owner(s) to immediately advise the occupants of any unsafe conditions as
set forth under section
4-209 of the Code.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03)
Sec. 4-217. Enforcement.
(a)   Issuance of complaint.
(1)   Whenever a petition or complaint is filed with the code enforcement
officer by a public authority, or by at least five residents of the city
charging that any dwelling is unfit for human habitation, or whenever it
appears to the code enforcement officer, on his own motion, that any dwelling
is unfit for human habitation, the code enforcement officer shall, if his
preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause
to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwellings a
complaint. The complaint shall list the violations of this Code and contain a
notice that a hearing will be held before the housing code coordinator, at a
place within the city at a time fixed, not less than ten days nor more than 30
days after the serving of said complaint. The notice shall also notify the
owner and parties in interest that they have the right to file an answer to the
complaint and to appear in person or otherwise, and give testimony at the place
and time fixed in the complaint. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of
law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the housing code
coordinator. All complaints and notices of hearing issued by the code
enforcement officer may be filed in the notice of its pendens in the office of
the clerk of superior court for Buncombe County.
(2)   The code enforcement officer may, prior to the issuance of a complaint,
serve the property owner or property owner's agent with a violation notice
giving the property owner a designated date to correct the violation(s).
(b)   Findings of fact and order. If, after such notice and hearing, the
housing code coordinator/designee determines that the dwelling under
consideration is unsafe or unfit for human habitation, according to the
standards of this Code, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in
support of that determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the
owner thereof an order. All orders issued by the housing code coordinator may
be filed in the notice of its pendens in the office of the clerk of superior
court of Buncombe County.
(1)   Deteriorated. If the dwelling is found to be deteriorated as defined in
this Code, the housing code coordinator shall require the owner to repair,
alter, or improve such dwelling so as to bring it into compliance with this
Code within a designated date of the service of the order upon the owner. Such
order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close the dwelling as
a human habitation. Where the housing code coordinator finds that there is
imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action
be taken in such lesser period as may be necessary.
(2)   Dilapidated. If the dwelling is found to be dilapidated as defined in
this Code, the housing code coordinator may require the owner to remove or
demolish such dwelling within a designated date of the service of the order.
Where the housing code coordinator finds that there is imminent danger to life
or other property, he may condemn and/or order that corrective action be taken
in such lesser period as may be necessary. Such order will not bar the owner
from making such repairs as are necessary to bring the dwelling into compliance
with this Code within the corrective action period imposed by such order.
(c)   Service of complaints and orders. Complaints and orders issued by the
code enforcement officer pursuant to this Code shall be served upon persons
either personally or by registered or certified mail, and, in conjunction
therewith, may be served by regular mail. When the manner of service is by
regular mail in conjunction with registered or certified mail, and the
registered or certified mail is returned, but the regular mail is not returned
by the post office within ten days after mailing, service shall be deemed
sufficient. The person mailing such complaint or order by regular mail shall
certify that fact and the date thereof, and such certificate shall be deemed
conclusive in the absence of fraud. If the identifies of any owners or the
whereabouts of such persons are unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by
the code enforcement officer, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the
code enforcement officer makes an affidavit to that effect, then the serving of
such complaint or order upon the unknown owners or other persons may be made by
publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at least once
no later than the time at which personal service would be required under this
article. Where service is made by publication, a notice of the pending
proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises thereby
affected. Failure on the part of any owner or party in interest to receive or
have served upon him any complaint, notice, or order herein provided for shall
not affect or invalidate the proceedings with respect to any other owner or
party in interest or any other person, firm, or corporation.
(d)   Prior orders.
(1)   Prior orders or ordinances not directing demolition. If city council has
adopted an ordinance, or the housing code coordinator has issued an order,
ordering a dwelling to be repaired or vacated and closed, as provided in
section
4-217(b)(1), and if the owner has vacated and closed such dwelling and kept
such dwelling vacated and closed for a period of one year pursuant to the
ordinance or order, then if the city council shall find that the owner has
abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in
order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the
dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health,
safety, morals and welfare of the city in that the dwelling would continue to
deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to
children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities,
would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in
the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might
otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent
and affordable housing in this state, then in such circumstances, the city
council may, after the expiration of such one year period, enact an ordinance
and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
a.   That the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation can
be made at a cost not exceeding 50 percent of the then current value of the
dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner either repair or demolish
and remove the dwelling within 90 days; or
b.   That the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation
cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50 percent of the then current value of
the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the
dwelling within 90 days.
c.   That the ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of
deeds for Buncombe County and indexed in the name of the property owner in the
grantor index. That failure to comply with the ordinance shall authorize the
director to effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.
(2)   Historic district. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the
dwelling is located in a historic district of the city and the historic
district commission determines, after a public hearing as provided by
ordinance, that the dwelling is of particular significance or value toward
maintaining the character of the district, and the dwelling has not been
condemned as unsafe, the order may require that the dwelling be vacated and
closed consistent with N.C.G.S., sec. 160A-400.14(a).
(e)   Action upon failure to comply with order.
(1)   If the owner of a dwelling fails to comply with an order to repair, alter
or improve or to vacate and close the dwelling, the housing code coordinator
may cause the dwelling to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated
and closed; the housing code coordinator may cause to be posted on the main
entrance of any dwelling so closed, a placard with the following words:
"This dwelling is unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this
dwelling for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful."
Occupation of a dwelling so posted shall constitute a misdemeanor.
(2)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the
dwelling, the housing code coordinator may cause such dwelling to be removed or
demolished.
(3)   The order of the housing code coordinator to repair, alter, improve,
vacate and close or remove and demolish shall not be exercised by the city
until city council shall have by ordinance ordered the housing code coordinator
to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this Code with respect to the
particular property or properties which the housing code coordinator shall have
found to be unfit for human habitation or unsafe and which property or
properties shall be described in the ordinance. No such ordinances shall be
adopted to require demolition of a dwelling until the owner has first been
given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity to this Code. Such
ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds for Buncombe
County and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor
index.
Provided, however, nothing in this Code shall be construed to impair or limit
in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause
their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or otherwise.
(4)   The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or improvements, or
vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the housing code coordinator
shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred,
which lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected as the lien
for special assessment provided in N.C.G.S., Article 10 of Chapter 160A. If the
dwelling is removed or demolished by the housing code coordinator, he shall
sell the materials of the dwelling, and any personal property, fixtures or
appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall credit the
proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition and any
balance remaining shall be deposited in the Buncombe County Superior Court by
the housing code coordinator, shall be secured in a manner directed by the
court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled
thereto by final order or decree of the court.
(5)   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling, the
housing code coordinator may file a civil action in the name of the city to
remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature
of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as
parties- defendant any person occupying such a dwelling. The clerk of the
Buncombe County Superior Court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to
appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten
days from the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and
complaint shall be served as provided in N.C.G.S., sec. 42-29. The summons
shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to
have been duly served, and if at the hearing the housing code coordinator
produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the city pursuant to
subsection (d)(3) of this section authorizing the housing code coordinator to
proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment
ordering that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The
judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be enforced in the same
manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under N.C.G.S., sec. 42-
30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be
taken as provided in N.C.G.S., sec. 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment
may be stayed as provided in N.C.G.S., sec. 7A-227. An action to remove an
occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of
a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this section unless such occupant
has been served with notice at least 30 days before the filing of the summary
ejectment proceeding that the city has ordered the housing code coordinator to
proceed to exercise his duties under this section to vacate and close or remove
and demolish the dwelling.
(f)   Notices to organizations. Whenever a determination is made pursuant to
this section that a dwelling must be vacated and closed, or removed or
demolished, under the provisions of this Code, notice of the order shall be
given by first-class mail to any organization, involved in providing or
restoring dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for
such notices. A minimum period of 45 days from the mailing of such notice shall
be given before removal or demolition by action of the housing code
coordinator, to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate with
the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of
providing affordable housing. The housing code coordinator shall certify the
mailing of the notice, and the certification shall be conclusive in the absence
of fraud. Except as herein stated, only an organization that has filed a
written request for such notice shall receive such notice. The sole remedy for
failure to notify shall be an order requiring the housing code coordinator to
wait 45 days before causing removal or demolition.
(g)   Displacement. In enforcing the provisions of this Code, the housing code
coordinator shall make every effort to prevent unnecessary displacement of
occupants, and to the extent possible, discuss with the affordable housing
agencies and other organizations on any alternate housing needs.
(h)   Determination of value. The code enforcement officer is hereby authorized
to fix the reasonable value of any dwelling or abandoned dwelling for the
purpose of this Code. Such value shall be binding unless the owner provides for
delivery of a written appraisal as to the reasonable value of the dwelling
prepared by a North Carolina state-certified residential appraiser within 30
days after receipt of an order from the housing code coordinator.
(i)   Equitable enforcement. In case any dwelling is erected, constructed,
altered, repaired, converted, maintained, or used in violation of this Code or
any order or decision of the housing code coordinator or board made pursuant to
this Code, the housing code coordinator may initiate any appropriate action or
proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or use, to restrain, correct, or abate such violation and to
prevent the occupancy of the dwelling.
(j)   Criminal enforcement. A violation of any provision of this Code shall
constitute a misdemeanor, and the violator may be fined up to $500.00 or up to
30 days imprisonment or both for each offense, in the discretion of the court.
(k)   Civil enforcement.
(1)   Failure to comply with orders. An owner who fails to comply with an order
to repair or to improve, vacate, close or demolish any dwelling determined
unfit for human habitation pursuant to the provisions contained in this Code,
or who permits the occupancy or reoccupancy of an unsafe or unfit dwelling in
violation of this Code shall be subject to a civil penalty of $250.00 for the
first day following the expiration of an order to repair or improve, vacate or
close any occupied dwelling or following a determination that an unfit dwelling
has been reoccupied in violation of this Code. In each instance, a penalty of
$50.00 per day shall be imposed for each subsequent day that such failure to
comply continues. If a person fails to pay the civil penalty within ten days
after being notified of the amount due, the city may recover the penalty
together with all costs by filing a civil action in the general court of
justice in the nature of a suit to collect a debt.
(2)   Failure to obtain a housing certificate. An owner who does not have a
housing certificate on the effective date of this Code, but who was required to
have a housing certificate under the terms of the housing code adopted in
article vii of chapter 4 of the Code of Ordinances on November 30, 1993, or
does not have a housing certificate as required under the terms of this Code,
shall be assessed a penalty of $20.00 per month, per unit for which a housing
certificate has not been obtained. This penalty shall be paid prior to the
issuance of a housing certificate. Additionally, effective January 1, 2004, the
failure to obtain a housing certificate shall subject the owner to an increased
penalty of $150.00 per month, per unit, for which a housing certificate has not
been obtained; provided, however, the maximum penalty hereunder shall not
exceed $600.00 per unit.
(l)   Response time. The city manager shall maintain statistics and monitor
response times to ensure that complaints are responded to within a reasonable
amount of time.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03)
Sec. 4-218. One-step service process.
(a)   In lieu of the procedure set forth in section
4-217 of this Code, the code enforcement officer may proceed as set forth in
this section whenever it appears to the code enforcement officer that any
dwelling is extremely dilapidated and meets the following conditions:
(1)   It has been determined by the code enforcement officer to be either:
a.   At least 50 percent destroyed by fire or other casualty; or
b.   Unable to be repaired, altered or improved to comply with all the
standards established by this Code at a cost of less than 75 percent of its
value;
(2)   It is not occupied; and
(3)   For at least one year, there has been no record of electrical service as
required by section
4-210(e) of this Code and/or no record or evidence of a potable water supply as
required by section
4-210(f) of this Code, or substantially similar conditions that indicate that
the dwelling has not been lawfully occupied.
(b)   The code enforcement officer may serve the property owner and parties in
interest with a notice of violation of the housing code and set a date not less
than 30 days from the date of service of the notice within which the property
owner shall either commence rehabilitation so as to bring the dwelling into
compliance with the housing code or commence demolition proceedings. The notice
shall also inform the property owner that if corrections or demolition
proceedings are not commenced within the time period specified, the code
enforcement officer shall, without further notice or further request of the
governing body, cause the demolition of the dwelling and place a lien against
the property.
(c)   Written objection. If the property owner or party in interest submits
written objection to the code enforcement officer proceeding against the
dwelling within the time period specified in the notice of violation, the code
enforcement officer shall cease any further efforts at compliance under this
section but may proceed in accordance with other provisions of this article. If
the property owner or party in interest does not submit written objection to
the code enforcement officer proceeding against the dwelling within the time
period specified in the notice of violation, the code enforcement officer shall
document that the conditions set forth in subsection (a)(1) exist, enter an
order to that effect, and cause the dwelling to be demolished. The code
enforcement officer shall be under no further obligation to notify or serve the
property owner or party in interest where there is no written objection. The
amount of the cost of demolition by the code enforcement officer shall be a
lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred, which lien
shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected as the lien for
special assessment provided in N.C.G.S., Article 10 of Chapter 160A.
(d)   Civil actions. Civil actions against the City of Asheville for proceeding
under this subsection must be filed within nine months from the date the
violation notice is served upon the aggrieved party.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03)
Sec. 4-219. Appeal procedures.
(a)   To housing code coordinator. Any owner may file a written appeal within
ten days after issuance of the code enforcement officer's report, with the
housing code coordinator. The housing code coordinator is hereby given
authority to rule on any dispute arising out of the interpretation of this Code
by the code enforcement officer. The housing code coordinator will affirm,
reverse, or modify the ruling of the code enforcement officer. Appeals of
decisions or orders of the housing code coordinator shall be made to the
director.
(b)   To board of adjustment. A housing appeals board is hereby created to
which appeals on the record may be taken by an owner or other party in interest
from any decision or order of the director. The zoning board of adjustment of
the City of Asheville shall serve as the housing appeals board and will hear
and determine such appeals on the record.
(1)   An appeal from any decision or order of the director may be taken by any
person aggrieved thereby. Such appeal shall be taken within ten days from the
service of the order and shall be taken by filing with the director and with
the board a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the
appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the director shall
forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which
the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from the decision of the
director refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his
decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is
from a decision of the director requiring the person aggrieved to do any act,
the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the
hearing by the board, unless the director certifies to the board, after the
notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to the petitioner) a suspension
of his requirement would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property or that because the violation charged is transitory in nature a stay
would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case,
proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application, on
notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown. To
this end the board shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the
appeal is taken.
(2)   The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of appeals, shall
give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within a
reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The
board may reverse, affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the decision of
an order. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary
to reverse or modify any decision or order of the director. The board shall
have power also in passing upon appeals in any case where there are practical
difficulties or undue hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of
the Code, to adapt the application of the Code to the necessities of the case
to the end that the spirit of the Code shall be observed, public safety and
welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
(3)   Every decision of the board shall be subject to review by proceedings in
the nature of certiorari instituted in Buncombe County Superior Court within 15
days after the written decision of the board is filed or after a copy thereof
is delivered to the appealing party, whichever is later. The decision of the
board may be delivered to the aggrieved party either by hand delivery or by any
method authorized by the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
(c)   Injunction. Any person aggrieved by a decision rendered by the board may
petition the superior court for an injunction restraining the code enforcement
officer from carrying out the order or decision and the court may upon such
petition, issue a temporary injunction restraining the code enforcement officer
pending a final disposition of the cause; provided, however, that such petition
shall be filed within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the
decision.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03)
Sec. 4-220. Other unlawful acts.
(a)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to remove or
permit the removal of, damage or deface any complaint, notice, order or
certificate posted in accordance with the provisions of this Code, unless the
code enforcement officer consents in writing to such action.
(b)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling or his agent or any
person to lease, re-lease charge or accept rent for occupancy of any dwelling
which does not have a housing certificate in accordance with the requirements
of this Code.
(c)   It shall be unlawful for the owner or owner's agent(s) of any dwelling
subject to the provisions of this Code to fail to furnish to the buyer a copy
of any required inspection findings or report prior to closing or other
property transfer of such dwelling.
(d)   Any violation of this section shall constitute a class 3 misdemeanor, and
the violator may be fined up to $500.00, in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. §
14-4.
(Ord. No. 3055, § 1, 10-14-03; Ord. No. 4910, § 2, 11-9-21)
Sec. 4-221. Reserved.
Sec. 4-222. Invalidity.
Notwithstanding any other evidence of intent, it is hereby declared to be the
controlling intent of the city council of the City of Asheville that if any
provision of this Code or the application thereof to any person, firm, or
corporation or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of this Code and
the application of such provisions to persons, firms, or corporations or
circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid, shall not be
affected thereby.

(Ord. No. 2496, § 5, 6-23-98)
Sec. 4.5-36. Franchise fees.
(a)   Generally. The city hereby determines and declares that the public
rights-of-way to be used by the franchisee in the operation of its franchise
are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city and state at
great expense to their taxpayers; that the grant to the franchisee is a
valuable property right without which the franchisee would be required to
invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and that the
administration of this chapter and the franchise impose upon the city
regulatory and administrative responsibility and expense. For that reason, the
franchisee shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount as designated in
the franchise, but in no event less than five percent of the gross annual
revenues. This annual franchise fee shall be in addition to any other fee and
the obligation to pay such fee shall commence on the effective date of the
franchise, unless otherwise provided by the franchise.
(b)   Other assessments, taxes or fees. The franchise fee required hereunder is
in addition to all other lawful fees, assessments, taxes or payments that the
franchisee may be required under any laws and regulations.
(c)   Payment schedule and reports. The franchisee shall make quarterly
payments to the city of the franchisee fee for the quarters ending on September
30, December 31, March 31 and June 30 of each year, with the payments due from
the franchisee to the city within 45 days after the end of each quarter. At the
time of each quarterly payment, the franchisee shall furnish to the city a
report certified by a certified public accountant showing complete calculations
on which the payment of the franchise fee is based, with such calculations
based upon data separately shown for only that portion of the cable system of
the franchisee which is located within the franchise area. On or before April
1, 2003, and on or before April 1, 2008, the franchisee shall provide to the
city, at no cost to the city, an independent audit, prepared by a certified
public accountant, of the franchise fee payments made to the city for the five
previous calendar year periods (1998-2002 on or before April 1, 2003, and 2003-
2007 on or before April 1, 2008).
(d)   Acceptance by the city. No acceptance of any payment by the city shall be
construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city
may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this
chapter or the franchise or for the performance of any other obligation of the
franchisee under this chapter or the franchise.
(e)   Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise payment
or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, the
franchisee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge at the
annual maximum rate allowed by the state.
(f)   City's right to inspection. The city or its designee shall have the right
to inspect all of the franchisee's records which relate to gross annual
revenues and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be
payable under this chapter and/or the franchise. Audits other than those
required pursuant to section 4.5(c), shall be at the expense of the city,
provided, however, the franchisee shall immediately reimburse the city for all
reasonable audit expenses of the city in the event the audit conducted shows
that franchise fee payments or other payments due to the city are in error in
the amount of five percent or more. Unless contested in writing by the
franchisee, the cost of the audit (if applicable) and any additional amount due
to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following
written notice to the franchisee by the city, which notice shall include a copy
of the city's audit report.

shall provide day-to-day administration and enforcement of the provisions of

franchisee shall comply with all laws and regulations which are now applicable

this chapter to the contrary, the franchisee shall at all times comply with all
laws and regulations. In the event that any actions of the state or federal
government or any agency thereof, or any court of competent jurisdiction upon
final adjudication, substantially reduce in any way the power or authority of
the city under this chapter or the franchise, the city, at its option, may
notify the franchisee that it wishes to negotiate those provisions which are
affected in any way by such modification in laws or regulations. Thereafter,
the franchisee shall negotiate in good faith with the city in the development
of alternate provisions which shall fairly restore the city to the maximum
level of authority and power permitted by laws and regulations. Subject to
applicable laws and regulations, the franchisee shall have the duty, based upon
the results of such negotiations, to modify any of the provisions to such
reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and purposes
of this chapter and the franchise.

authority, as may at any time be lawfully permissible, to regulate the cable
system, the franchise and the franchisee. Should applicable legislative,

permitted to the city, the city may engage in any such additional regulation as

reasonably required by the city for said records.

the right to inspect all facilities and appurtenant property of the cable

or its designee shall have the right to make such tests as it shall find
necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
pertinent provisions of laws and regulations. The franchisee shall have the
right to have a representative present during inspections or testing conducted

upon 45 days written notice from the city to the franchisee (absent emergency
situations) whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be
enhanced thereby.

test, analyze, and report on the performance of its system at the expense of
the franchisee. In the event any deficiencies are not corrected, the city may
require additional tests, full or partial repeat tests, different test
procedures, or tests involving a specific subscriber's terminal at the expense
of the franchisee. Tests shall be conducted within a reasonable time after
requested but not later than 30 days unless mutually agreed upon by the parties

appurtenances from the public rights-of-way and from any city property and
shall restore any property, public or private, to the same or similar condition
as they existed prior to the installation, erection, or construction of the
cable system. Restoration of the public rights-of-way and of city property
shall be in accordance with the directions and specifications of all affected
departments and agencies of the city, and all applicable laws and regulations.
The franchisee, at the option and direction of the city, shall accomplish such
restoration at its expense. Such removal shall be made with the supervision of
the city. If such removal and restoration is not completed within 12 months
after the notice by the city delivered in writing to the franchisee all of the
franchisee's property remaining in the affected public rights-of-way shall, at
the option of the city, shall be deemed abandoned and shall, at the option of
the city, become the property of the city. In the event the franchisee fails or
refuses to remove its cable system or satisfactorily restore all areas to the
condition in which they existed prior to the original construction of the cable
system, the city, at its option, may perform such work and collect the cost
thereof from the franchisee. No surety on any bond nor any letter of credit

possible termination or revocation of the franchise, following applicable
notices of default and cure procedures provided for in this chapter.
(Ord No. 2496, § 25, 6-23-98)
Sec. 4.5-56. No waiver of rights.
No course of dealing between the franchisee and the city nor any delay on the
part of the city in exercising any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver
of any such rights of the city or acquiescence in the actions of the franchisee
in contravention of rights except to the extent expressly waived by the city or
expressly provided for in the franchise.
(Ord. No. 2496, § 26, 6-23-98)
Sec. 4.5-57. Transfer.
(a)   Franchise. A franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in

properly therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written
consent of the city.
(b)   Ownership. The franchisee shall not sell, transfer or dispose of ten
percent or greater ownership interest in the franchisee without the consent of
the city. Every sale, transfer, or disposition of ten percent or greater
ownership interest in the franchisee shall make the franchise subject to
termination or revocation unless and until the city shall have consented
thereto. No consent by the city shall be required, however, for a change of
ownership of limited partners, provided that the following conditions are met:
(1)   It does not result in a change in control;
(2)   Prior to such transfer, the franchisee provides to the city verifiable
information to establish that the transferee is of good character and that the
transfer shall not change the financial, legal and technical ability of the
franchisee to perform fully all obligations required of the franchisee in the
franchise and this chapter; and
(3)   Except for those limited partners in existence as of the commencement
date of the franchise, the change of ownership in limited partners does not
exceed a cumulative amount of 30 percent over the term of the franchise.
(c)   Control. The franchisee shall not change control of the franchisee in
whatever manner exercised without the prior written consent of the city.
(d)   City approval. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the
franchisee shall make the franchise subject to termination or revocation unless
and until the city shall have consented thereto. For the purpose of determining
whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control,
the city may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and other
public interest qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling
party, and the franchisee shall provide the city with all information required
by the city and applicable laws and regulations. Failure to provide all
information requested by the city as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for
denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control. Unless
otherwise provided by applicable laws and regulations, the city reserves the
right to impose reasonable conditions on the franchise to ensure that the
transferee is able to meet existing requirements of the franchise.
(e)   Assumption of control. The city agrees that any financial institution
having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for
the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the obligation to
notify the city in the event that it will take control and operate the cable
system. In the event the ownership or control of the cable system is
transferred to another cable service provider, the city shall have the right to
consent to the transfer in accordance with the process set forth in this
section.
(f)   No waiver of city property rights. The consent or approval of the city or
any other public entity to any transfer of the franchisee shall not constitute
a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the public property or
public rights-of-way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly
subordinate to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise.
(g)   Time periods. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city
will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to
construction or the completion of a rebuild of the cable system.
(h)   Signatory requirement. Any approval by the city of transfer of ownership
or control shall be contingent upon the prospective party becoming a signatory
to the franchise agreement.
(i)   Time frame for city review. Consistent with the Cable Act, the city shall
have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer
that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in
accordance with this chapter and applicable laws and regulations. If the city
fails to render a final decision on the request within 120 days, such request
shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the city agree to an
extension of time.
(j)   Reimbursement. The franchisee shall reimburse the city for all fees and
costs incurred by the city which are associated with the transfer of a
franchise, whether or not the transfer is approved by the city; provided,
however, the reimbursement costs shall not exceed $5,000.00 for transfers
occurring during the first eight years of a franchise term and $10,000.00
during any remaining portion of a franchise term.

that there shall be recoverable by the city, jointly and severally from the
principal and surety, any and all penalties and liquidated damages due to the
city and any and all damages, losses, costs and expenses suffered or incurred

a.   Comply with the provisions of this chapter or the franchise;

purpose of such withdrawal. No later than 30 days after the mailing of the
notice of withdrawal by the city to the franchisee, the franchisee shall
replenish the letter of credit in an amount equal to the amount withdrawn.
Failure to make timely replenishment of such amount to the letter of credit
shall constitute a violation of this chapter and a default under the franchise.
(c)   The bonds or letters of credit shall require 30 days written notice of
any non-renewal, alteration or cancellation to the city and to the franchisee.

following receipt by the city or the franchisee of any notice of cancellation.

credit required hereunder are in addition to all of the rights of the city,
whether reserved by this chapter, the franchise, or authorized by laws and
regulations, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to
such bonds or letters of credit shall affect any right the city may have.
(e)   If the city becomes aware of the financial condition of any bonding or
insurance company issuing a bond or letter of credit to the franchisee as
required in this chapter where, if such conditions were known at the time, the
city would not have approved the surety of the bond or the provider of the
letter of credit or the city would not have found the form of the bond or of
the letter of credit satisfactory or if the financial condition of such bonding
company or financial institution materially changed to the extent that such
approvals would not have been made, the city may, at any time, submit written
notice to the franchisee and require that any such bond or letter of credit be
replaced with such other bond or letter of credit consistent with the
requirements set forth in this chapter.
(f)   Prior to executing remedies provided to the city under the bonds or
guarantees required pursuant to this section, the city shall provide written
notice to the franchisee and a reasonable opportunity for the franchisee to
cure the alleged default in performance.

Sec. 4.5-83. Franchise required; grant of franchise; general provisions.
(a)   Franchise required. No telecommunication system shall be allowed to
occupy or use the public rights-of- way of the city or be allowed to operate
within the city without a franchise. Any telecommunication system located in
the public rights-of-way on the effective date of this article shall obtain a
franchise from the city pursuant to this article within 180 days, unless such
timeframe is extended by the city.

provisions, ordinances, rules and regulations, the city can grant revocable and
non-exclusive franchises to construct, operate and maintain a telecommunication
system within the city and in the public rights-of-way. The specific locations
of the telecommunication system in the public rights-of-way shall be subject to
the approval of the city engineer pursuant to the terms of a franchise and
other applicable local ordinances. The franchise shall constitute both a right
and an obligation to provide the services of a telecommunication system
pursuant to a grantee's certificates of public convenience and necessity and
the North Carolina public utilities laws and regulations. By acceptance of a
franchise, grantee acknowledges and accepts the legal right of the city to
issue the franchise.
(c)   Use of public rights-of-way. For the purpose of operating and maintaining
a telecommunication system within the city, a grantee may erect, install,
construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon,
across and along the public rights-of-way within the city such cabinets,
cables, conduits, converters, drains, equipment, handholes; markers, splice
boxes, surface location markers, vaults and other appurtenances as are
necessary to the operation of the telecommunication system, provided, however,
that, subject to applicable law, any grantee shall comply with all design,
construction, and safety provisions contained in the franchise, this article
and other applicable local ordinances, and any applicable technical standards
and specification of the city.

during the life of the franchise, cooperate with the city to facilitate the
installation of facilities sufficient to meet the city's needs as agreed upon
by both parties.
(e)   Police powers. A grantee's rights under a franchise are subject to the
police powers of the city to adopt and enforce ordinances for the health,
safety and welfare of the public. Subject to applicable law, grantee shall
comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city
pursuant to that power. Nothing in this article or the franchise shall be
deemed to be a waiver of the requirements of the various codes, ordinances,
regulations, standards and specifications regarding permits, fees to be paid,
or manner of construction.
(f)   Franchise nonexclusive. Any franchise granted by the city is
nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time,
additional franchises in accordance with state and federal law, provided any
telecommunication system franchise granted by the city contains substantially
equivalent standards, terms and conditions as are contained herein or any
amendments to this article.
(g)   Time is of the essence of the franchise. Subject to applicable law,
whenever a franchise shall set forth any time for an act to be performed by or
on behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence and any
failure of the grantee to perform within the time allotted shall always be
sufficient material ground for the city to invoke an appropriate penalty
including possible revocation of the franchise.

maintenance and repair to existing facilities, provided said facilities are
legally within the right-of-way. Routine maintenance and repair includes:

franchise payment shall be in addition to any other fee and shall commence and
be paid as set forth in the franchise. The franchise may provide for non-
monetary consideration including but not limited to, additional facilities and

to any applicable statute of limitations.
(d)   Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise payment

permission to use any particular pole or conduit, whether or not belonging to
the city. Grantee shall be responsible for obtaining appropriate permission
from the owners of poles or conduits, including the city, for any installation.
A grantee shall not erect any new poles unless necessary for the provision of
service and approved by the city engineer, or to replace existing poles for the
purpose of maintaining current service. The location of any conduit or wire-
holding structure of a grantee shall not be a vested right and such conduits or

upon order of the city. Where the placement of new conduit is required for an
installation, the city may, at the city's cost and expense for additional or
different materials, require the grantee to install additional facilities or
provide excess capacity to be dedicated for future use as determined by the
city.

with the installation or maintenance of its telecommunication system.
(d)   Approvals and construction plan.
(1)   Prior to the placement or installation of any part of the
telecommunication system in the public rights-of- way, a grantee shall first
submit to the city and other designated parties for approval a construction
plan sealed by a professional engineer licensed in the state, including a
concise description of the facilities proposed to be erected or installed,
specifications and engineering drawings, and a map indicating the proposed
location of all such facilities. A grantee shall include in its plans submitted
to the city engineer the length of the telecommunication system in the public
rights-of-way. The plan shall also include pole numbers and clearances along
the telecommunication system route. As to materials to be used for the
installation, an engineer's seal shall only be required for non-standard
materials.
(2)   A grantee shall provide the city with satisfactory written verification
of grantee's right to attach to poles along the path of the telecommunication
system and that there is sufficient clearance for attachment. A grantee shall
not attach any part of the telecommunication system to city maintained lines
without the prior approval of the city engineer. Prior to receipt of a permit
for construction of the telecommunication system from the city engineer, a
grantee shall submit to the city written verification of approval of the
grantee's final construction plans from the North Carolina Department of
Transportation, where applicable, and evidence of compliance with Article 8 of
N.C.G.S. Chapter 87, the Underground Damage Prevention Act.
(3)   No placement or installation of any part of the telecommunication system
shall be commenced by any person until construction permits and written
approval therefor have been received from the city engineer; provided further,
that such permits and approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and action
thereon shall be taken within a reasonable period of time.
(e)   Requirement for installations.
(1)   All installations shall be underground in those areas of the city where
utilities and cable television serving the area are underground at the time of
installation, or are planned for underground installation within 12 months.
Where the system is installed underground, the construction plans shall
indicate the depth and profiles of facilities to be installed. In areas where
other utility facilities are above ground at the time of installation, a
grantee may install its service above ground on such facilities.
(2)   All above ground cables shall be installed parallel with electric or
telephone lines. Multiple cable configurations shall be arranged in parallel
and bundled with due respect for engineering considerations. Any variance from
the above requirements must be approved by the city engineer in writing.
(3)   At such time as existing electric utilities serving an area are required
to be placed underground by the city, a grantee shall likewise place its
services underground without additional cost to the city or to the individual
subscriber so served within the city. Where not otherwise required to be placed
underground by this article or the franchise, a grantee's system shall be
located underground at the request of an adjacent property owner, if
technologically feasible, provided that the excess cost over the aerial
location shall be borne by such property owner.
(f)   Applicable standards. A grantee shall at all times comply with the rules
and regulations of the North Carolina Utilities Commission; applicable federal,
state and local regulations; and the standards as set forth in the franchise
and this article.
(g)   Interference with persons, improvements, public and private property and
utilities. A grantee's telecommunication system shall be located, erected and
maintained so that such system shall:
(1)   Not endanger or interfere with the health, safety or lives of persons;
(2)   Not interfere with any improvements of the city, county or state;
(3)   Not interfere with the free and proper use of public streets, alleys,
bridges, easements or other public ways, places or property, except to the
minimum extent possible during actual construction, repair or removal;
(4)   Not interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of private
property owners, except to the minimum extent possible during actual
construction, repair or removal; and
(5)   Not obstruct, hinder or interfere with any gas, electric, water or other
utilities, cable, telecommunication or telephone facilities located within the
city.
(h)   Excavation and work in public rights-of-way; restoration; damage.
(1)   A grantee may install cable and other underground facilities by use of
trenching, directional boring, excavation, or other method consistent with
sound engineering practice, and may disturb pavement, curb, gutters, sidewalks,
driveways, or other surfacing in the public rights-of-way as necessary for such
installation, provided the installation has been approved by the city engineer.
Directional boring may be required in certain instances to protect vegetation
and other features in the right-of-way. Manholes and handholes shall not be
visible in residential areas unless approved by the city engineer who may
require a route change. If authorized in writing by the city engineer,
sidewalks may be excavated for the placement of manholes and handholes.
(2)   Excavations or borings made by a grantee in the public rights-of-way,
pursuant to the franchise shall be made in compliance with the ordinances and
regulations of the city in effect at the time of such excavation.
(3)   Prior to any excavation or boring in the public rights-of-way, a grantee
shall notify all other utilities that may be affected by such excavation or
boring of the nature of the work to be performed. Additionally, the services of
North Carolina one-call may be used to notify its member utilities.
(4)   In situations deemed by a grantee to constitute an emergency involving a
danger to the public health, safety and welfare, a grantee shall notify the
city manager and the city engineer of the nature, location and potential
hazard.
(5)   During the installation, repair or removal of a grantee's
telecommunication system in the public rights-of- way, the grantee shall
provide at all times proper signs, signal lights, flagmen, barricades, and
other warning devices for the protection of pedestrian and vehicular traffic in
conformance with the latest manual on uniform traffic control devices for
streets and highways and amendments or supplements thereto.
(6)   A grantee shall exercise due care in the operation, installation,
alteration, repair or removal of its system. If any utility or property of the
city, real or personal, is damaged, impaired or destroyed as a result of either
the negligent or intentional acts of a grantee, its employees, agents or
persons operating under its direction, supervision or control, the grantee
shall be liable to the city for such damages, including but not limited to the
cost to repair or replace the utility or property.
(7)   Immediately after a grantee installs or repairs its system, the grantee
shall refill any excavations according to the technical specifications of the
city. A grantee shall restore and replace landscaping destroyed, disturbed, or
damaged by such work in accordance with the technical specifications of the
city and subject to the inspection of the city engineer.
(8)   If the installation, alteration, repair or removal of the
telecommunication system in the public rights-of- way requires the temporary
removal of bricks, grates, trees or other property or materials belonging to
the city, a grantee shall, until such materials are reinstalled, and in the
exercise of due care, store said property or materials in a safe place
satisfactory to the city to minimize the risk of damage or theft.
(9)   A grantee shall preserve and protect all trees and shrubbery located in
the public rights-of-way from damage by the grantee. A grantee shall comply
with the regulations of the city concerning the preservation and protection of
trees and shrubs. A grantee shall pay to the city the cost of treating,
removing and replacing any tree or shrub in the public rights-of-way which has
been damaged or destroyed as a result of the work of the grantee.
(10)   If a grantee fails, neglects, or refuses to refill such excavations
within 24 hours after the telecommunication system has been installed, repaired
or removed, or fails, neglects or refuses to restore the landscaping as herein
provided within 144 hours after the telecommunication system has been
installed, repaired or removed, then after notice by the city, the grantee
shall pay a deposit to the city in an amount equal to 100 percent of the
estimated cost as determined by the city engineer to do all or such part of
said work as may remain undone. The city may also contract with a third party
to do all or such part of said work as may remain undone at the cost and
expense of the grantee.
Upon completion of the work by the city and after the total cost has been
determined, if the amount of a grantee's deposit exceeds the total cost of the
work, any excess will be refunded to the grantee, without interest, within 15
days of official acceptance of the work by the city. If the amount of a
grantee's deposit is less than 100 percent of the city's final cost, the
grantee shall pay to the city within 15 days of written notification, such
additional amounts as will bring the total funds deposited equal to the total
cost of the work.
(11)   Whenever the city or the North Carolina Department of Transportation or
its successor shall plan to widen, modify, close, relocate, grade or regrade
any public street, sidewalk, or other public way, in which a grantee shall have
installed any of its telecommunication system, it shall be the duty of the
grantee, upon reasonable notice by the proper authority, and at no cost to the
city, to remove or relocate as necessary its telecommunication system;
provided, that nothing herein shall affect any rights under an existing
franchise, license or agreement, to reimbursement of such relocation costs.
(12)   A grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving
permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its lines to permit the
moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering
of lines shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall
have the authority to require such payment in advance. A grantee shall be given
not less than 15 working days' advance notice to arrange for such temporary
line changes.
(13)   All necessary easements over and under private property or North
Carolina Department of Transportation property shall be arranged for by a
grantee. The city neither promises nor contracts to obtain or acquire rights-
of-way for the construction, installation, maintenance or operation of a
grantee's system. A grantee shall provide the city with written verification of
the department of transportation approval for the telecommunication system
which encroaches upon its rights-of-way, and owner approval for encroachment
along any railroad or other rights-of-way on private property.
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 9-23-03)
Sec. 4.5-88. [Reserved.]
Sec. 4.5-89. Transfer of ownership or control.
A transfer of ownership or control of the telecommunication system shall comply
with the North Carolina Utilities Commission Rules And Regulations where
applicable. A grantee shall promptly notify the city of its intent to transfer
ownership or control of the telecommunication system and shall provide the city
with a true copy of the request to transfer ownership or control made to the
North Carolina Utilities Commission and the commission's approval of the
transfer. A transferee is required to accept the grantee's franchise and all of
its terms, provisions, and any amendments within 15 days of the transfer. Such
acceptance shall be in the form approved by the city attorney and attached to
the franchise.
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 9-23-03)
Sec. 4.5-90. Franchise renewal.
The city may grant or deny renewal of a grantee's franchise subject to the
provisions of the Telecommunication Act of 1996, as amended, or other
applicable law. The grantee shall own the telecommunication system, but shall
have no property right in the public rights-of-way upon the completion of the
franchise term.
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 9-23-03)
Sec. 4.5-91. Forfeiture or revocation.
(a)   Grounds for revocation. Subject to applicable law, the city reserves the
right to revoke a franchise and rescind all rights and privileges associated
with a franchise in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article in
the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach
under the franchise:
(1)   If a grantee defaults in the performance of any of the material
obligations under this article, the franchise or such documents, contracts and
other terms and provisions entered into by and between the city and the
grantee.
(2)   If a grantee fails to provide or maintain in full force and effect the
liability and other insurance coverage or the security fund as required in this
article.
(3)   If a grantee violates any orders or rulings of any regulatory body having
jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this article or the franchise and
after notice thereof shall continue the violation and not remedy the same
within 60 days.
(4)   If a grantee attempts to evade any of the provisions of this article or
the franchise or practices any fraud or deceit upon the city or grantee's
subscribers.
(5)   If a grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts or
is adjudged bankrupt.
(6)   If a grantee materially misrepresents facts in the application for or
negotiation of the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof.
(7)   If the transferee of a grantee fails or refuses to accept the franchise
as required in this article.
(b)   Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. A grantee shall not be
declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this
article in any case in which performance of any such provision is prevented for
reasons beyond a grantee's control. A fault shall not be deemed to be beyond
the grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other business entity in
which the grantee holds a controlling interest whether held directly or
indirectly.
(c)   Pending litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory
body or court having jurisdiction over a grantee shall not excuse the grantee
from the performance of its obligations under this article or the franchise.
The city and grantee will abide by the terms of any stay order issued by a
court of competent jurisdiction.
(d)   Procedure prior to revocation.
(1)   The city shall make written demand that a grantee comply with any
material requirement; limitation, term condition, rule or regulation or correct
any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of a
grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such written demand, the
city shall place its request for termination of the grantee's franchise upon a
regular council meeting agenda. The city shall cause to be served upon such
grantee at least seven days prior to the date of such council meeting, a
written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the time and
place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the city clerk at
least once, seven days before such meeting, in a newspaper of general
circulation within the ity.
(2)   The council shall hear any persons interested in the franchise and shall
determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by
the grantee was with just cause.
(3)   If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause,
as reasonably defined by the city, the council shall direct the grantee to
comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are
reasonable.
(4)   If the council shall determine such failure, refusal, or neglect by the
grantee was without just cause, then the council shall, by resolution, declare
that the grantee's franchise shall be terminated and the performance bond and
letter of credit forfeited.
(e)   Disposition of system. In the event a grantee's franchise is revoked or
otherwise terminated, the city may in its sole discretion order the complete
removal of the telecommunication system from the city within a reasonable
period of time as determined by the city, require the original grantee to
maintain and operate its system as set forth in subsection (i) hereinafter, or
the functioning system, at the option of the city, may become the property of
the city.
(f)   Restoration of property. In removing its telecommunication system,
grantee shall not excavate or disturb pavement, curb, gutters, sidewalks,
driveways, or other surfaces in the public rights-of-way. The grantee shall
refill, at its own expense, any excavation and boring that shall be made by it
and shall leave all public ways in as good a condition or better as that
prevailing prior to the grantee's removal of its telecommunication system
without affecting the electrical, television, telephone or other
telecommunication cable, wires or attachments or the utilities. The city shall
inspect and approve the condition of the public rights-of-way and cables,
wires, attachments, and poles after removal. The liability, indemnity,
insurance, performance bond and letter of credit as provided herein shall
continue in full force and effect during the period of removal until full
compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this paragraph and
the franchise.
(g)   Abandonment. If such removal and restoration is not completed by grantee
within 180 days after notice by the city, all of the grantee's property
remaining in the public rights-of-way shall, at the option of the city, be
deemed abandoned and shall, at the option of the city, become the property of
the city.
(h)   Restoration by city; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a failure by
the grantee to complete any work required by subsection (f) above, or any other
work required by city ordinance, within the time as may be established and to
the satisfaction of the city, the city may cause such work to be done and the
grantee shall reimburse the city the cost thereof within 15 days after receipt
of an itemized list of such costs or the city may recover such costs from the
security fund provided by grantee. The city may also seek legal and equitable
relief to enforce the provisions of this section.
(i)   Extended operation. Upon either the expiration or revocation of the
franchise, the city may require the grantee to continue to operate the system
for a period of six months from the date of such expiration or revocation, or
until such time as is mutually agreed upon by the city and grantee.
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 9-23-03)
Sec. 4.5-92. Receivership and foreclosure.
(a)   Termination by insolvency. Any franchise shall, at the option of the
city, cease and terminate 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or
trustee to take over and conduct the business of a grantee whether in a
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless
such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
(1)   Such receiver or trustee shall have, within 120 days after their election
or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of the
franchise, and the receiver or trustee within said 120 days shall have remedied
all defaults under the franchise; and
(2)   Such receiver, or trustee shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises,
whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and
every term, provision and limitation of the franchise.
(b)   Termination by judicial action. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee or any part
thereof, including or excluding the franchise, the city may serve notice of
termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which
event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee thereunder
shall cease and terminate 30 days after service of such notice, unless:
(1)   The North Carolina Utilities Commission shall have approved the transfer
of the franchise, in accordance with its rules and regulations, and
(2)   Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the city to
assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise.
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 9-23-03)
Sec. 4.5-93. Performance bond and letter of credit.
(a)   Security fund.
(1)   At the time a franchise is accepted, the grantee shall issue and deliver
to the city a letter of credit from a federally-insured banking institution and
a performance bond issued by a surety licensed in the State of North Carolina
in amounts to be determined by the city council, and incorporated into the
franchise. The bond and letter of credit shall be a security fund. Failure to
timely obtain, file and maintain said bond and letter of credit shall
constitute a substantial violation within the meaning of this section.
(2)   The security fund shall serve as security for:
a.   The faithful performance by a grantee of all the terms and conditions of
this article and the franchise;
b.   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
grantee's unexcused or uncured failure to comply with all lawful rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant
to the franchise;
c.   The payment by grantee of all liens and taxes, and all damages, claims,
costs or expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason
of any act or default of grantee, and all other payments due the city from
grantee pursuant to this article and the franchise;
d.   The costs and expenses incurred by the city as a result of grantee's
abandonment of the telecommunication system at any time during the term of the
franchise or any extension thereto; and
e.   The damages or loss of revenue caused by a grantee's assignment of the
franchise without the approval of the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
(3)   A grantee shall not use the security fund for other purposes and shall
not assign, pledge or otherwise use the security fund as security for any
purpose. The security fund shall be maintained during the term of the franchise
in the amount specified in the franchise.
(b)   Change in amount of letter of credit. Upon written application by a
grantee, the city may, at its sole option, permit the amount of the letter of
credit to be reduced or waive the requirements for a letter of credit subject
to the conditions set forth below. Reductions granted or denied upon
application by a grantee shall be without prejudice to the grantee's subsequent
applications or to the city's right to require the full letter of credit at any
time thereafter. However, no application shall be made by a grantee within one
year of any prior application.
(c)   Payment from security fund.
(1)   If a grantee fails to pay to the city any payment due under the terms of
the franchise; or, fails to repay to the city, any damages, costs or expenses
which the city shall be compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the
grantee in connection with the franchise, the city may then demand payment from
the security fund.
(2)   The letter of credit shall be made payable upon a draft submitted by the
city and accompanied by the written statement of an appropriately authorized
official for the city that payment is due the city under the terms of the
franchise as a result of a default by grantee. The city shall be the
beneficiary under the performance bond.
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 9-23-03)
Sec. 4.5-94. Insurance.
(a)   Certificates of insurance. Not later than 60 days after the effective
date of the franchise and thereafter continuously throughout the duration of
the franchise and any extensions or renewals thereof, a grantee shall furnish
to the city, certificates of insurance, approved by the city, for all types of
insurance required under this section. Failure to furnish said certificates of
insurance in a timely manner shall constitute a violation of this article and
the franchise.
(b)   Insurance policies.
(1)   All insurance policies maintained pursuant to the franchise shall contain
the following, or a comparable, endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this insurance policy may not be
canceled by the insurance company and the intention not to renew may not be
stated by the insurance company until 30 days after receipt by the city
manager, by registered mail or certified mail, of a written notice of such
intention to cancel or not to renew.
(2)   Any insurance policy obtained by a grantee in compliance with this
section shall be filed and maintained with the city clerk during the term of
the franchise. A grantee shall immediately advise the city of any litigation
that may develop that would affect this insurance.
(3)   All contractual liability insurance policies maintained pursuant to the
franchise shall include an endorsement covering the indemnity clause set forth
in section
4.5-95.
(4)   All insurance policies provided under the provisions of this article or
the franchise shall be written by companies authorized to do business in the
State of North Carolina and approved by the State Commissioner of Insurance.
(c)   General liability insurance.
(1)   A grantee shall maintain, and by its acceptance of the franchise
specifically agrees that it will maintain throughout the term of the franchise,
commercial general liability insurance insuring the grantee in the minimum
amount specified in the franchise, combined single limits applicable to claims
for bodily injury, personal injury and/or property damage relating to grantee's
operations, maintenance and construction under the franchise.
(2)   Such general liability insurance must include coverage for all of the
following: comprehensive form, premises-operations, explosion and collapse
hazard, underground hazard, products/completed operations hazard, contractual
insurance, broad form property damage, and personal injury.
(3)   At any time during the term of the franchise, the city may request that
the city be named as an additional insured under grantee's commercial general
liability insurance policy and the grantee shall comply with such request.
(d)   Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by the
city hereunder, shall limit the liability of a grantee under this article or
the franchise or for damages.
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 9-23-03)
Sec. 4.5-95. Indemnification.
(a)   Release, indemnity and hold harmless. As a condition of the grant of a
franchise, the grantee shall release, indemnify, keep and save harmless the
city, its agents, officials and employees, from any and all responsibility or
liability for any and all damage or injury of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including death resulting therefrom) to all persons, whether agents, officials
or employees of the city or third persons, and to all property proximately
caused by, incident to, resulting from, arising out of, or occurring in
connection with, directly or indirectly, the design, construction,
installation, maintenance, or operation of a telecommunication system by the
grantee (or by any persons acting for the grantee or for whom the grantee is or
is alleged to be in any way responsible), whether such claim may be based in
whole or in part upon contract, tort (including alleged active or passive
negligence or participation in the wrong), or upon any alleged breach of any
duty or obligation on the part of the grantee, its agents, officials and
employees or otherwise.
(b)   Claims. The provisions of this section shall include:
(1)   Any claims for equitable relief or for damages (compensatory or punitive)
against the city, its agents, officials, and employees including alleged injury
to the business of any claimant and shall include any and all losses, damages,
injuries, settlements, judgments, decrees, awards, fines, penalties, claims,
costs and expenses. Expenses as used herein shall include without limitation

connection with investigating any claim or defending any action, and shall also
include reasonable attorneys' fees by reason of the assertion of any such claim
against the city, its agents, officials or employees;
(2)   Any claim for invasion of the right of privacy, for defamation of any

(3)   Any claims arising out of grantee's failure to comply with the provisions
of any federal, state, or local statute, ordinances or regulation applicable to
grantee in its business.
(c)   Broad construction. Any security fund or insurance protection required by
the grantee or the city, shall in no way limit the grantee's responsibility to
release, indemnify, keep and save harmless and defend the city as herein
provided. The intention of this article is to apply and construe broadly in
favor of the city the foregoing provisions subject to the limitations, if any,
set forth in N.C.G.S. 22B-1.
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 9-23-03)
Sec. 4.5-96. Liquidated damages.
(a)   Liquidated damages. The city and the grantee understand and agree that
grantee's violation of any of the time and performance requirements set forth
in this article or in the franchise may result in damage to the city and that
it is and will be impracticable to determine the actual amount of such damage
in the event of delay or nonperformance. Accordingly, subject to applicable
law, whenever the city determines, consistent with subsection (b) hereinafter,
that the grantee has violated any such requirement, the city may charge the
grantee and collect from the security fund, as necessary, the following
liquidated damages:
(1)   For failure to provide "as built" maps, the sum of $100.00 per day for
each day, or part thereof, such failure occurs or continues.
(2)   For failure to comply with the construction or maintenance standards, the
sum of $1,000.00 per day for each day, or part thereof, such failure occurs or
continues.
(3)   For failure to comply with all conditions of city permits, the sum of
$1,000.00 per day for each day, or part thereof, such failure occurs or
continues.
(b)   Unavoidable delay. No charge shall be made to the security fund for an
unavoidable delay. For purposes of this section, "unavoidable delay" means that
period of time during which the grantee is delayed from complying with the time
and performance requirements of the franchise because of acts of God, strikes,
lockouts or other industrial disturbances, acts of public enemy, orders of any
kind of the government of the United States or of the state or any civil or
military authority, insurrections, riots, epidemics, landslides, lightning,
earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, storms, floods, washouts, drought, arrest,
restraining of government and people, civil disturbances, explosions, partial
or entire failure of utilities or equipment, shortages of labor, materials,
supplies or transportation, or any other similar cause not reasonably within
the control of the grantee, but not including reasonably anticipated weather
conditions for the city's geographic area or reasonably anticipated
difficulties with equipment, suppliers or shippers.
(c)   Procedure for imposition of liquidated damages.
(1)   Whenever the city finds that a grantee has violated one or more terms,
conditions or provisions of this article or the franchise, a written notice
shall be sent to grantee informing it of such violation or liability. The
written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the specific violation so as
to afford the grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation. Grantee shall
begin corrective action within five days after receipt of such notice. Grantee
may, within five days of receipt of notice, notify the city that there is a
dispute as to whether a violation or failure has, in fact, occurred; provided,
however, that if the last day of the five- day period falls on a day on which
the city hall is closed, the period shall be extended to include the next day
on which city hall is open for business. Such notice by grantee to the city
shall specify with particularity the matters disputed by grantee and shall stay
the running of the above-described time. In the event grantee fails to request
a hearing, then grantee shall be deemed to have waived any defense whatsoever
to the violation alleged.
a.   The city or its designee shall hear grantee's dispute at a meeting called
in a timely manner. Grantee shall be afforded reasonable notice of the meeting
and afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate in and be heard at this
meeting. The city or its designee shall supplement any decision with written
findings of fact.
b.   If after hearing the dispute the claim is upheld by the city, the grantee
shall have five days from such a determination to remedy the violation or
failure. At any time after that five-day period, the city may draw against the
security fund all damages due it as determined by the city.
(2)   The time for a grantee to correct any violation or liability may be
extended by the city if the necessary action to correct such violation or
liability is of such a nature or character to require more than five days
within which to perform, provided grantee commenced the corrective action
within the five-day period and thereafter uses reasonable diligence, as
determined by the city, to correct the violation or liability.
(3)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in
addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by the franchise or
authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with

(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 7-1-3. Jurisdiction.
(a)   Jurisdiction; general. The provisions of this chapter shall apply within
the corporate limits of the City of Asheville, North Carolina, and within the

(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97; Ord. No. 2860, § 1a, 10-10-01; Ord. No. 3381, §§
1(a), (b), 7-25-06; Ord. No. 4233, § 1a, 9-24-13)
ARTICLE II. OFFICIAL MAP, RULES OF CONSTRUCTION, AND DEFINITIONS
Sec. 7-2-1. Official zoning maps; identification.
The boundaries of zoning districts are effective at the same time this chapter
is effective by the adoption by the city council of a series of maps entitled
"City of Asheville, North Carolina Official Zoning Maps," (hereinafter "zoning
maps"). These zoning maps, together with all amendments adopted by the
Asheville City Council, are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set
forth herein. These zoning maps shall be retained permanently in the office of
the planning and development department of the City of Asheville.
(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 7-2-2. Interpretation of district boundaries.
The following rules of interpretation shall be applicable to the zoning maps:
(1)   District designation. A district name on the zoning maps indicates that
the regulations pertaining to the district designated by that name, or
abbreviation of same, extend throughout the whole area bounded by the district
boundary lines within which such name, or abbreviation, is shown, except as
otherwise provided.
(2)   District boundary; determination. Where uncertainty exists with respect
to the boundaries of the various districts shown on the zoning maps, the
following rules shall be used to interpret the zoning maps:
a.   Where a district boundary is shown to coincide approximately with a
property line or city limit line, the property line or city limit line shall be
considered to be the district boundary, unless otherwise indicated.
b.   In cases where a district boundary line is located within a street or
alley right-of-way or easement, railroad or utility line right-of-way or
easement, river, or stream, it will be considered to be in the center of the
street or alley right-of-way or easement, railroad or utility line right-of-
way or easement, river, or stream. If the actual location of such right-of-way,
easement, river, or stream varies slightly from the location as shown on the
zoning map, then the actual location shall control.
c.   In cases where a district boundary line is shown as being located a
specific distance from a street line or other physical feature, this distance
shall control.
d.   Where a boundary line is shown and its location is not fixed by any of the
rules of this section, and no dimensions are shown, the location of the
boundary shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the zoning maps
unless there exists a metes and bounds description of the boundary line. If
such a metes and bounds description exists, it shall control.
e.   Where the zoning map shows a district boundary dividing a lot, each part
of the lot shall conform with the standards established by this chapter for the
zoning use or overlay district in which that part is located.
f.   In circumstances not covered previously in this section, the board of
adjustment shall interpret the district boundaries.
(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 7-2-3. General rules of construction.
(a)   Interpretation and application of these regulations.
(1)   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, the provisions of
the chapter will be construed to be the minimum requirements adopted to promote
the purposes set forth in section
7-1-2.
(2)   The words "shall", "must", and "will", are mandatory in nature, implying
an obligation or duty to comply with the particular provision. The word "may"
is permissive in nature.
(3)   Except where specifically defined in this chapter, all words shall carry
the standard dictionary meanings.
(4)   Words used in the present tense include the future tense.
(5)   Words used in the singular number include the plural number and the
plural number includes the singular number unless the context of the particular
usage clearly indicates otherwise.
(6)   Words used in the masculine gender include the feminine gender and vice
versa.
(7)   Any act authorized by this chapter to be carried out by a specific
official of the city is, by implication, authorized to be carried out by a
designee of such official.
(b)   Fractional requirements. When any requirement of this chapter results in
a fraction of a unit, a fraction of one-half or more will be considered a whole
unit and a fraction of less than one-half will be disregarded. When applying
this requirement to the calculation of the number of units permitted on a
parcel of land, the following rules shall apply:
(1)   This requirement shall apply only to multi-family residential development
of five units or greater, not to duplexes, triplexes, and quadraplexes on
individual parcels. However, it shall apply to any multi-family residential use
(including two, three, and four-unit buildings) as part of a larger multi-
family residential project or mixed-use development within the NCD and UR
districts.
(2)   In situations where the number of dwelling units allowed on a property is
a fractional number, all fractions of one-half or greater will be rounded up to
the nearest number. For example, a property on which 8.4 units could be
constructed will be limited to eight units, while a property on which 8.5 units
could be constructed will be allowed nine units.
(3)   Such projects receiving increased density under this subsection must also
comply with all development standards found elsewhere in this chapter.
(c)   Relation of this chapter to any pending actions. The adoption of this
chapter shall not affect any action, suit, notice of violation, citation or
proceeding which may be pending at the date this chapter becomes effective. All
rights and liabilities that have been received or created and any violation
that has occurred under any previous provisions of the Code of Ordinances of
the City of Asheville which have been superseded by this chapter are still
valid and may be preserved and enforced.
(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97; Ord. No. 3208, § 1, 1-25-05)
Sec. 7-2-4. Conflicting provisions.
(a)   Relation of this chapter to other regulations. If any provisions of this
UDO are inconsistent with similar provisions of state or federal law, the more
restrictive provision shall control, to the extent permitted by law.
(b)   Conflicting provisions of this chapter. Unless otherwise specifically
stated herein, conflicts and duplications among portions of this UDO shall be
resolved in favor of the more stringent regulation.
(c)   Conflicts with covenants, deed restrictions, etc. This chapter is not
intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or other private agreement.
However, where the regulations of this chapter are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or requirements than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement, then the requirements of this chapter shall govern.
(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97; Ord. No. 3306, § 1(a), 11-22-05; Ord. No. 5114 §
1, 1-28-25)
Sec. 7-2-5. Definitions.
[For the purposes of this chapter, certain terms shall have the meanings

access to a street although this is not a requirement. Courtyards are usually
highly structured with hardscape features with landscaping used to enhance the
space. Depending on the use, courtyards may have benches, tables, and other
pedestrian amenities. The orientation of the courtyard space and buildings can
often create a "heat island" effect that make mitigation by tree planting or
shade structures important.
Large public park: An open space area with access to one or more streets that
functions as a stand-alone green space. They may include active and passive
uses, and usually have both hardscape features and planted landscapes. Large
public parks often include a range of attractions and amenities such as public
gathering areas, seating, performance areas, sculptural elements, fountains,
and richly detailed landscapes. Large public parks provide crucial open space
that improves the quality life for residents and visitors. Large public parks
will be at least one acre in size. Pack Square Park is an example of a large
public park in Asheville.
Plaza space: A structured open space with access to one or more streets with an
emphasis on hardscape elements serving pedestrian needs. They may be public or
privately owned and managed. Plaza spaces are often associated with a building
or special use for which the plaza functions as an adjacent outdoor room.
Landscape elements are secondary in a plaza space and are used to define the
hardscape elements and streetscape. Seating, sculptural elements, shade trees
and other pedestrian amenities should be included in plaza spaces. Plaza spaces
will be at least 5,000 square feet in area.
Pocket park: A landscaped small area intended for passive use only that may
include significant hardscape elements (such as - but not limited to - benches,
artwork, fountains, and lighting) and other amenities geared toward
pedestrians. They may be public or privately managed. In the urban environment
pocket parks are often secondary spaces left over from development projects
that may have limited access to a public street or provide a small respite area
at an intersection of streets. Pocket parks provide important open spaces for
residents and patrons of downtown. Sculpture and special uses are often
appropriate for pocket parks. Pocket parks will be smaller than 5,000 square
feet although many pocket parks are substantially smaller than this. Gracies'
Garden at the corner of Lexington and Patton Avenues is an example of a pocket
park in Asheville.
Small public park: An open space area with access to at least one street that
functions as a stand-alone green space at a neighborhood scale. They may
provide for active and passive use, and provide hardscape and planted landscape
areas. Although they are smaller than large public parks, they can be expected
to have one or more amenities for active or passive use. In the downtown
Asheville Central Business District small public parks will be at least 5,000
square feet, and up to one acre in size. Pritchard Park and Triangle Park are
examples of small public parks in Asheville.
Peak discharge means the maximum instantaneous flow from a given storm
condition at a specific location.
Pedestrian oriented design means development designed with and emphasis on
pedestrian access and interest from adjoining streets and sidewalks. In
pedestrian oriented design, buildings are generally placed close to the street
and the main entrances are oriented to the street sidewalk; additionally, there
are generally windows or display cases along building façades that face the
street. Site characteristics of pedestrian oriented design typically include:
site grading that enhances the relationship of the building to the adjoining
street(s) and sidewalk(s) from the perspective of the pedestrian; parking
facilities placed to the side or rear of the building; and the provision of
pedestrian oriented amenities, such as outdoor dining areas, landscaping/
hardscaping, and seating.
Perennial stream means streams or natural drainage ways that have essentially
continuous flows or are shown as continuous blue lines on the most recent
version of the USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle maps and depicted as a continuous
line on the most recent version of the maps of the Soil Survey of Buncombe
County from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shall be considered a perennial
stream for the purposes of this section.
Performance center means an open, partially enclosed, or fully enclosed
facility designed or intended for use for the gathering of people as an
audience for presentations such as (but not limited to) music, lectures, or
live theater. Performance centers include auditoriums and amphitheaters.

      Zoning permits (section
7-5-2)
      Temporary use permits (section
7-5-3)
      Use by right, subject to special requirements, (section
7-5-4)
      Special use approvals (section
7-5-5)
      Manufactured housing rental community approval (section
7-5-7)
      Subdivision plat approvals (section
7-5-8)
      Site plan review (section
7-5-9)
      Downtown design review (section
7-5-10)
      Certificate of appropriateness approval (section
7-5-11)
      Floodplain development (section
7-5-12)
      Erosion and sedimentation control plans (section
7-5-13)
      Stormwater permits (section
7-5-14)
      Zoning vested rights approvals (section
7-5-15)
      Sign permits (section
7-5-16)
      Driveway access permits (section
7-5-17)
      Riverfront design review (section
7-5-18)
      Certificate of occupancy (section
7-5-19)
      Procedures are set forth in this article for reviewing and granting of
these permits and approvals.
   Applications for all permits identified above may be made at the City of
Asheville Development and Permitting Center, unless otherwise specified. All
required permits may be applied for simultaneously at the development and
permitting center and all required fees may be paid at this location.
Development and permitting center staff shall process the application(s) and
distribute the plans to the appropriate staff persons for review and approval.
Staff of the development and permitting center serve as the primary contact for
information regarding the approval status of the requested permits.
The review procedures described in article V are those required by the City of
Asheville. Other agencies, specifically the Metropolitan Sewerage District of
Buncombe County (MSD), have separate procedures which must be followed in order
to obtain plan approval and/or acceptance of improvements. These agencies must
be contacted to obtain information regarding the proper procedure for approval
of plans and of construction.
(b)   Relationship between different permits and approvals. Building permits
and certificates of occupancy are typically the final forms of approval for
most development within the City of Asheville and its area of extraterritorial
jurisdiction. Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy may be
contingent upon the applicant previously having received one or more other
permits or forms of approval. For example, site plan approval is required prior
to the issuance of a zoning permit to assure that all requirements of this
chapter are being met and erosion control plan approval is required prior to
issuance of a grading permit. Zoning and building permits will be issued for a
development project only after all conditions precedent to the construction of
the development imposed under the provisions of this chapter have been met.
Each section of this article describes a different type of permit or approval
which may be required for a particular project.
(c)   Simultaneous processing of applications.
(1)   This section intends to accommodate, where possible, the simultaneous
processing of applications for different permits and approvals which may be
required for the same project, in order to make the review process as short as
possible. Possibilities for concurrent filing and processing of applications
include, but are not limited to, the following:
a.   A site plan along with a use by right, subject to special requirements;
b.   A site plan along with a variance request;
c.   A preliminary subdivision plat along with an erosion control plan;
d.   A site plan along with a certificate of appropriateness request;
e.   A site plan along with a downtown design review application; and
f.   A site plan along with a traffic impact study.
(2)   No application for the rezoning of property shall be accepted or
processed while an application for any of the approvals or permits listed in
section
7-5-1(a) above is pending for the same property or vice versa.
(3)   Some forms of approval depend upon the applicant having previously
received another form of approval. Approvals such as site plan approval require
the applicant to take certain action within some time period following the
approval to avoid having the approval lapse. The applicant should note that
each of the permits and approvals set forth in this section has its own review
sequence and should take this into consideration when planning the development.
(d)   Application and review fees. Requests for review of various permit and
approval applications required by this section are subject to the payment of
various fees in order to defray the city's administrative costs. The fees for
different types of permits and approvals are set forth in the City of Asheville
Fees and Charges Manual. These fees are determined by the Asheville City
Council and are periodically revised by the council.

Sec. 7-5-2. Zoning permits.
(a)   Purpose. A zoning permit shall be required for the construction or
development of any new use within the planning and regulation jurisdiction of
the City of Asheville. In addition to new uses a zoning permit shall also be
required for expansions of existing uses, as well as for changes of use. The
procedure set forth below shall be followed to obtain a zoning permit for the
construction of single-family and duplex residential development and for other
uses which do not require permits and/or approvals, other than a driveway
access permit and a soil erosion and sedimentation plan approval for projects
disturbing less than 10,000 square feet, as set forth elsewhere in this
article.
(b)   Pre-application procedure. No pre-application conference is required
prior to applying for a zoning permit. Applicants are encouraged to call or
visit the planning and development department prior to requesting a zoning
permit to determine what information is required for the application.

standards set forth in this chapter shall also be provided.
(4)   Annual zoning permits. An annual zoning permit is required for certain
land uses including homestays and short-term vacation rentals. Annual zoning
permits must be renewed each year before the expiration date and in accordance
with the terms of this UDO. Failure to timely renew the annual zoning permit
will result in an expiration of that permit, and can result in a voluntary
forfeiture of all legal rights and claims to continue that use. See section
7-17-3.
(d)   Staff review. The planning and development director shall review the
application and determine whether it is complete within ten working days of its
submittal. If the application is found to be incomplete, the planning and
development director shall notify the applicant of any deficiencies. No further
steps shall be taken to process the application until the applicant corrects
the deficiencies. The planning and development director shall issue a zoning
permit only upon finding that the proposed use or structure satisfies the
requirements set forth in article VIII of this chapter. Provided the
application is complete, failure by the planning and development director to
determine completeness of the application within ten working days shall result
in the refund of any application fee paid. The refund of the application fee
due to the expiration of the ten working days shall not cause the review of the
application to cease. Staff shall continue with the review of the application.
(e)   Public notification. No public notification is required for zoning permit
requests.
(f)   Formal review. No formal review of zoning permit requests is required.
Requests shall be reviewed by appropriate city staff to assure compliance with
all applicable regulations and requirements.
(g)   Variances. Requests for variances from the requirements requiring zoning
permits set forth in this chapter shall be heard by the board of adjustment
under the procedures established in section
7-6-1.
(h)   Appeals. Appeals of the decisions of the planning and development
director shall be heard by the board of adjustment under the procedures
established by section
7-6-2.
(i)   Permit validity. Upon the approval of a zoning permit, the applicant
shall have one year to obtain the required building permit(s). Failure to
commence building permits within this time shall render the zoning permit void.
The zoning permit shall remain valid as long as a valid building permit exists
for the project. Any unapproved change in the approved plans shall render the
zoning permit invalid.
(j)   Violations. Violations of the conditions of the zoning permit shall be
considered a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the enforcement
and penalty provisions set forth in article XVIII of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97; Ord. No. 4637, § 1d, 1-9-18; Ord. No. 4361, § 1a,
3-23-21)
Sec. 7-5-3. Temporary use permits.
(a)   Purpose. To insure that proposed temporary uses comply with the
requirements of this chapter, no use that is classified as a temporary use in
the zoning district in which it is located shall be placed or established on
the property without first receiving a temporary use permit from the planning
and development department.
(b)   Pre-application procedure. No pre-application conference is required
prior to applying for a temporary use permit. Applicants are encouraged to call
or visit the planning and development department prior to requesting a
temporary use permit to determine what information is required for the
application.
(c)   Plan submittal.
(1)   Filling of application. An application for a temporary use permit may be
filed by the owner of the property or by an agent specifically authorized by
the owner to file such application. Where an agent, files the application, the
agent shall provide the planning and development director with documentation
that the owner of the property has authorized the filing of the application.
The application for a temporary use permit shall be filed with the development
and permitting center on a form provided by the center.
(2)   Fees. A permit fee, as established by City of Asheville Fees and Charges
Manual, shall be submitted with the application. In addition, a permit shall be
obtained from the fire department as required by the fire prevention code. If
the temporary use is deemed an event of public interest or will require the
expenditure of money or use of resources by the city (beyond routine
administrative costs) in connection with the implementation of the public
safety plan described in subsection (3) below, the applicant shall pay for
these expenses prior to the initiation of the temporary use or provide a bond
or other satisfactory security for the payment thereof, as identified and
estimated by the city. These expenses may include, but are not limited to, the
pro-rated salary of city or other government employees necessary for the
conduct of the temporary use. City-sponsored or co-sponsored events may be
exempt from these fee requirements. City council may also waive fees for events
deemed to have special economic development benefits.
(3)   Information required. Each application for temporary use permit shall
contain the information required on the application form. The application shall
be accompanied by a sketch plan showing the boundaries of the property, the use
of adjacent properties, the location of the temporary use or structure on the
property, access and parking provisions, restroom facilities, and other
information sufficient to show that the temporary use or structure complies
with the standards set forth in this chapter and chapter 4 of the fire
prevention code.
a.   Persons seeking issuance of a temporary use permit for an event shall file
an application with a minimum of ten days prior to the proposed event date,
unless this time frame is reduced by the planning and development director.
b.   Persons seeking issuance of a temporary use permit for an event of public
interest shall file an application with a minimum of 21 days prior to the
proposed event date, unless this time frame is reduced by the planning and
development director. For uses involving the expected congregation of 100 or
more persons at any one time (otherwise described as "assembly" uses in the
building code), the event shall be deemed an event of public interest and shall
also provide an approved public safety plan identifying the means by which
public safety will be ensured during the conduct of the temporary use. This
public safety plan may include, but is not limited to, such information as:
ingress and egress to and from the site; fencing, screening or buffering to
control noise and/or crowds; provisions for parking and/or overflow parking;
staffing for security and crowd control at the event; and any additional
information that may be required by the police or fire chief. The applicant
shall be responsible for public expenses associated with the public safety plan
as provided in subsection (2) above. If determined necessary by the police
chief or fire chief, the public safety plan will be coordinated with other
affected agencies involved in public safety operations, including but not
limited to the Buncombe County Sheriff, the Buncombe County Emergency
Management Director, appropriate rural fire district personnel and the North
Carolina Division of Alcohol Law Enforcement.
c.   Persons seeking issuance of a temporary use permit for an event on public
property shall file an application with the parks and recreation department in
accordance with the City of Asheville Special Events Guideline.

(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97; Ord. No. 2535, § 3, 1-12-99; Ord. No. 3162, § 1,
9-14-04; Ord. No. 3480, § 1(c), 6-12- 07)
Sec. 7-5-4. Uses by right, subject to special requirements.
(a)   Purpose. Uses by right, subject to special requirements, are uses
permitted by right, provided that the special requirements set forth in
subsection
7-16-1 are met. The special requirements are intended to insure that the uses
fit the intent of the zoning districts within which they are permitted, and
that the uses are compatible with other development permitted within the zoning
districts. Review and approval of these uses are handled by the planning and
development director, who has no discretion to modify the special requirements.
(b)   Pre-application procedure. A pre-application conference is not required
for approval of uses by right, subject to special requirements. Applicants are
encouraged, however, to contact the planning and development director to
discuss the special requirements.
(c)   Plan submittal.
(1)   Filing of application. An application for a permit for a use by right,
subject to special requirements, may be filed by the owner of the property or
by an agent specifically authorized by the owner to file such application.
Where an agent files the application, the agent shall provide documentation
that the owner of the property has authorized the filing of the application.
The application for a permit for a use by right, subject to special
requirements, shall be filed with the development and permitting center on a
form provided by the center.
(2)   Fees. A permit fee, as established by the City of Asheville Fees and
Charges Manual, shall be submitted with the application.
(3)   Information required. Each application for a permit for a use by right,
subject to special requirements, shall contain all information described in
Appendix B (Checklists for applications). The application shall be accompanied
by a site plan meeting the requirements for site plans set forth in Appendix A
(Map and Plan Standards).
(d)   Staff review. The planning and development director shall review the
proposed use and determine if the special requirements for that use have been
met. If the special requirements have been met, the use shall be approved.
Failure to meet all the special requirements shall result in denial of a permit
for the proposed use. The planning and development director shall approve or
deny the proposed restricted use or request more information, if needed, within
ten working days of submittal. If the application is found to be incomplete,
the planning and development director shall notify the applicant of any
deficiencies. No further steps will be taken to process the application until
the applicant corrects the deficiencies. The planning and development director
shall approve the use only upon finding that the proposed use satisfies all
applicable requirements set forth in this chapter. Provided the application is
complete, failure by the planning and development director to review the
application within ten working days shall result in the refund of any
application fees paid.
(e)   Public notification. Public notification is not required.
(f)   Formal review. Formal review is not required.
(g)   Variances. Variances from the special requirements constitute "use
variances" and shall not be permitted.

regarding applications for a use by right, subject to special requirements,
shall be heard by the board of adjustment under the procedures established in
section
7-6-2.
(i)   Permit validity. The permit for a use by right, subject to special
requirements, shall be valid for one year from the date of its issuance.
Failure to initiate construction or otherwise begin the permitted use within
this time shall render the permit void. The planning and development director
may grant a single extension of this time period of up to six months upon
submittal by the applicant of sufficient justification for the extension.
(j)   Violations. Failure to establish or maintain the special requirements is
considered a violation of this chapter and shall subject the offender to the
enforcement and penalty provisions of article XVIII of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 7-5-5. Special use approvals.
(a)   Purpose. Special uses are established to provide for the location of
those uses which are generally compatible with other land uses permitted in a
zoning district but which, because of their unique characteristics or potential
impacts on the surrounding neighborhood and the city as a whole, require
individual consideration of their location, design, configuration, and/or
operation at the particular location proposed. Such individual consideration
may also call for the imposition of individualized conditions in order to
ensure that the use is appropriate at a particular location and to ensure
protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Any use identified in
article VIII and article XVI of this chapter as a special use in a zoning
district shall not be permitted without the approval of the planning and zoning
commission in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in this
subsection
7-5-5.
(b)   Pre-application procedure.
(1)   Conference. Every applicant for a special use is required to meet with
the planning and development director in a pre-application conference prior to
the submittal of a request for approval of a special use. The purposes of this
conference are to provide additional information regarding the review process
and assistance in the preparation of the application.
(2)   Neighborhood meeting. It is required that the developer meet with
representatives of the neighborhood in which the proposed special use will be
located. This meeting, which should be held at the pre-application stage, will
allow the developer to explain the proposed use and to be informed of the
concerns of the neighborhood.
(c)   Plan submittal.
(1)   Filing of application. An application for a special use permit may be
filed by the owner of the property or by an agent specifically authorized by
the owner to file such application. Where an agent files the application, the
agent shall provide documentation that the owner of the property has authorized
the filing of the application. The application for a special use permit shall
be filed with the development services department on a form provided by the
department.
(2)   Fees. A permit fee, as established by the City of Asheville Fees and
Charges Manual, shall be submitted with the application.
(3)   Information required. Each application for a special use permit shall
contain all information described in city-provided Checklists for Applications;
and a notation of the pertinent deed number of the subject property with book
and page reference from the Buncombe County Register of Deeds.
(d)   Staff review.
(1)   Planning and development staff review. Following submittal of the
application and site plans for the special use, they shall be reviewed by the
planning and development director or designee for compliance with the
requirements of this chapter and in consideration of the special use standards
found in Sec.
7-16-2(c) of this chapter and advise the applicant accordingly.
(2)   Submittal of plans to technical review committee ("TRC") for preliminary
review. The planning and development director or designee shall present the
site plans for the special use to the TRC at its next regular meeting. The TRC
shall review the site plan for compliance with existing federal, state, and
local regulations. This review shall be made by the members of the TRC and by
any other agencies or officials as determined by the planning and development
director. For special uses in
7-16-2 that require review for compliance with the Downtown Review Design
Guidelines-such review shall be conducted by the Downtown Design Review
Committee and the recommendation forwarded to the Planning and Zoning
Commission as part of its review of the special use permit request.
(3)   Action by technical review committee. Upon submittal and review of a
complete application for a special use permit, the TRC may make one of the
following recommendations:
a.   Approval. If the TRC recommends approval, the planning and development
director or designee shall forward the recommendation and the special use
application to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a final decision reached
after a quasi-judicial hearing.
b.   Approval with conditions. If the TRC recommends approval with conditions,
the applicant may revise the plan to meet the conditions of the approval and
resubmit it. The revised plan shall be reviewed by the planning and development
director or designee and, if it meets all of the conditions, shall forward the
recommendation and the special use application to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for a final decision reached after a quasi-judicial hearing.
c.   Denial. If the TRC recommends denial of the request, the reasons for
denial shall be provided in writing to the applicant. The site plan may be
revised to address the reasons for denial and resubmitted in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter. After an opportunity to revise has been
granted, and concerns remain unaddressed, the recommendation for denial and
special use application shall be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning for a
final decision reached after a quasi-judicial hearing.
   While TRC preliminary review and recommendation are considered useful for
ensuring to the greatest extent that applications meet all applicable laws and
regulations, the TRC recommendations are not determinative and no part of the
recommendation may be used as the sole basis for the Planning and Zoning
Commission’s final quasi-judicial decision.
d.   Timing. The TRC shall make its recommendation within the timeframe
specified by the published TRC schedule. Provided the application and site plan
are complete, failure by the TRC to make its recommendation within the
timeframe specified by the published TRC schedule shall result in the refund of
any application fees paid.
(e)   Formal Quasi-Judicial Review.
(1)   Public hearing. Upon receipt of a notice from the planning and
development director, their designee or the applicant requesting a hearing on
the application and site plan for a special use permit, a quasi-judicial
hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be scheduled.
(2)   Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
a.   Review of special use permit request. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall follow quasi-judicial procedures as required by N.C.G.S. § 160D-406 in
determining special use permit decisions.
b.   Decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Before a special use
permit is granted, the Planning and Zoning Commission must find that the
application meets all of the Special Use Standards found in Sec.
7-16-2(c) of this chapter based on competent, material, and substantial
evidence presented at the hearing. The decision on the special use application
shall be by a simple majority vote of those members of the commission present
at the meeting at which the action is taken. The special use permit decision
shall be effective upon filing of the written decision with the secretary to
the commission. The decision of the commission shall be delivered within a
reasonable time by electronic mail, personal delivery or first-class mail to
the applicant, landowner, and any person who has submitted a written request
for a copy prior to the date the decision becomes effective.
   If approved by the planning and zoning commission, no permits may be issued
related to the approved special use permit pertinent to the specific property
until the property owner has recorded the approved plan and conditions at the
Buncombe County Register of Deeds including notation of the pertinent deed
number with book and page reference.
c.   Transfer of approval. A special use approval is not transferable from one
property to another, but may be transferred to a subsequent owner of the
property.
d.   Resubmission of denied applications. No application for approval of a
development project (special use, site plan, project plan) shall be filed with
or accepted by the City if that project is identical or substantially similar
to a special use application which has been denied by the planning and zoning
commission within one year of the final action by the planning and zoning
denying the request.
(f)   Public notification. Notice of quasi-judicial hearings or public meetings
required under this section for special use approvals shall be provided in
accordance with the provisions of section
7-5-20 of this chapter. Additional notice provisions may be required in
accordance with section
7-16-2 of this chapter.
(g)   Project phasing. If a project approved as a special use is to be
developed in phases, a master plan for the entire development site must be
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission at the same time and in the same
manner the special use permit application is considered.
   Final plans for phases of the special use may be submitted in stages and
shall be approved by City staff provided that the following requirements are
met:
(1)   All stages shall be shown with precise boundaries on the master plan and
shall be numbered in the expected order of development.
(2)   Each phase must be able to exist independently of subsequent phases by
meeting all applicable laws and regulations as if the phase were a separate
project.
(3)   All the data required for the project as a whole shall be given for each
stage shown on the plan.
(4)   A proportionate share of the open space and common facilities shall be
included in each stage of the development.
(5)   The phasing shall be consistent with the traffic circulation, drainage,
and utilities plan for the entire master plan for the special use.
(6)   Each phase of the special use must comply with any and all conditions
attached to the approval of the special use permit by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
(h)   Conditions. Reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards may be
imposed on these special use permits. Where appropriate, such conditions may
include requirements that street and utility rights-of-way be dedicated to the
public and that provision be made for recreational space and facilities. The
planning and zoning commission may prescribe dimensional requirements (height,
setback, etc.) that are different from the requirements of the corresponding
general zoning classification, and may prescribe development and design
standards that are different from those set out in article XI; provided, that
any request for a modification to a dimensional requirement or development and
design standard that is less restrictive than would be applicable for the
underlying general zoning classification must be specifically described in any
notices required for the public hearing on the special use permit application,
and must be set out separately in any ordinance issuing said special use
permit, together with an explanation of the reason for the modification. Except
as modified pursuant to this paragraph, all standards and requirements
applicable to the underlying general zoning district must be met. Variances to
the standards established by any special use permit shall not be allowed.
(i)   Appeals. An appeal from the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commision
regarding a special use application and site plan may be made by an aggrieved
party and shall be made to the Superior Court of Buncombe County in the nature
of certiorari. Any such petition to the Superior Court shall be filed with the
court no later than 30 days after a written copy of the decision of the
planning and zoning commission is received by the applicant.
(j)   Permit validity. Approvals of a special use application and site plan
shall be valid for two years from the date of approval by the Planning and
Zoning Commission. An extension of up to one additional year may be granted by
the Planning and Zoning Commission upon submittal by the application of
sufficient justification for the extension. Appropriate conditions may be added
to the initial approval or extension approval to guarantee site maintenance and
security. Failure to obtain a zoning permit or otherwise being the permitted
use, within this time shall render the special use approval void. Nothing
herein shall be construed to extend any time limitations prescribed by statute
or by other ordinances in this chapter.
   Permits for the phased development of a special use project shall remain
valid for the time approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission as part of
the special use approval of the master plan for the special use.
(k)   Minor Modifications. Minor modifications to a special use permit that do
not involve a change in uses permitted or the density of overall development
permitted may be reviewed and approved administratively. Any other
modifications or revocation of a special use permit shall follow the same
process for the granting of the original special use permit.
(l)   Violations. Violations of the special use permit or of any of the
conditions attached to the approval shall be considered a violation of this
chapter and subject to the enforcement and penalty provisions of article XVIII
of this chapter.

No. 2843, § 1(b), adopted Aug. 28, 2001.
Sec. 7-5-7. Manufactured housing community (MHC) approval.
(a)   Purpose. The review procedure for manufactured housing communities is
required for developments which propose the provision of two or more
manufactured homes or manufactured home spaces for rent. This review procedure
is designed to assure that the communities comply with the design standards set
forth in subsection
7-9-5. Public comment, particularly from owners of neighboring property, is
provided for through this review procedure.
The manufactured housing community review process is a two-part procedure which
involves the approval of a master plan, as well as the rezoning of the property
to the manufactured housing community overlay district. The manufactured
housing community overlay district is not mapped or affixed to particular
parcels until after an application by a developer and approval by the Asheville
City Council.
When applied to a specific geographic area, the manufactured housing community
overlay district shall have the effect of allowing development to be designed,
reviewed, approved, constructed and managed according to the provisions of
section
7-9-5, rather than as required by the underlying zoning district.
(b)   Pre-application procedure.
(1)   Conference. Prior to the submittal of an application for approval of a
manufactured housing community, the applicant is required to meet with the
planning and development director in a pre- application conference. The
purposes of this conference are to provide clarification and assistance in the
preparation and submission of plans for approval. The sketch plan, as described
below, shall be presented for review during the conference.
(2)   Sketch plan.
a.   Required for review. A sketch plan is required for review by the planning
and development director for all proposed manufactured housing communities.
b.   Preparation. The sketch plan shall be prepared in accordance with Appendix
A (Map and Plan Standards) and submitted to the planning and development
department.
(3)   Neighborhood meeting. It is highly recommended that the developer meet
with representatives of the neighborhood in which the proposed project is
located. This meeting, which should be held at the pre- application stage, will
allow the developer to explain the proposed project and to be informed of the
concerns of the neighborhood.
(c)   Plan submittal.
(1)   Filing of application. An application for approval of a manufactured
housing community may be filed by the owner of the property or by an agent
specifically authorized by the owner to file such application. Where an agent
files the application, the agent shall provide documentation that the owner of
the property has authorized the filing of the application. The application for
a manufactured housing community shall be filed with the development and
permitting center on a form provided by the center.
(2)   Fees. Fees as established by the City of Asheville's Fees and Charges
Manual shall be due and payable when the site plan is submitted.
(3)   Information required.

development director shall present site plans for manufactured housing
communities to the technical review committee at its next regular meeting. The
technical review committee shall review the site plan for compliance with
existing federal, state, and local regulations. This review shall be made by
the members of the technical review committee and by any other agencies or
officials as determined by the planning and development director.
(3)   Action by technical review committee.
a.   Timing. The technical review committee shall take action within ten
working days of reviewing the site plan. Provided the application is complete,
failure by the technical review committee to take action within ten working
days shall result in the refund of any application fees paid. The refund of the
application fee due to the expiration of the ten working days shall not cause
the review of the application to cease. Staff shall continue with the review of
the application.
b.   Approval. If the site plan is approved by the technical review committee,
the planning and development director shall present the site plan and the
manufactured housing community (MHC district) designation for review and
approval at the next regular meeting of the Asheville Planning and Zoning
Commission.
c.   Conditional approval. If the site plan receives conditional approval from
the technical review committee ("TRC"), the applicant shall revise the plan
based upon the conditions of the approval and resubmit it. The revised plan
shall be reviewed by the planning and development director and if it meets all
the approval conditions, the site plan and the MHC District designation shall

7-5-20 of this chapter.
(g)   Project phasing. If a project is to be developed in phases, a master plan
for the entire development site must be approved by the Asheville Planning and
Zoning Commission prior to the beginning of construction on any phase.
Final plans for the phases of the manufactured housing community development
may be submitted in stages and shall be approved by the planning and
development department staff provided that the following requirements are met:
(1)   All stages shall be shown with precise boundaries on the master plan and
shall be numbered in the expected order of development.
(2)   Each phase must be able to exist independently of subsequent phases by
meeting all applicable laws and regulations as if the phase were a separate

Sec. 7-5-8. Subdivision plat approvals.
(a)   Major subdivisions.
(1)   Purpose and application. The major subdivision review process is required
for those divisions of land into two or more lots where the extension of public
streets or private streets built to City of Asheville standards is required.
Review of the preliminary plat by the Technical Review Committee ("TRC") is
required under the major subdivision review process. Review and approval of the
final plat is done by the technical review staff.
(2)   Pre-application procedure.
a.   Conference. It is required that every applicant for a major subdivision
meet with the designated staff in a conference prior to the submittal of a
subdivision plat. The purpose of this conference is to provide clarification
and assistance in the preparation and submission of plats for approval.
b.   Sketch plan. A sketch plan shall be submitted to the development services
department prior to or at the pre-application conference. Upon submittal of the
sketch plan, the designated staff shall conduct an initial review to determine
whether the proposed subdivision is a major subdivision.
c.   Neighborhood Meeting. The prospective applicant shall meet with the
surrounding community during the pre-application phase. No application for
Level II development shall be accepted for review by the city unless the
following criteria are met:
1.   A community meeting shall be held with the surrounding residents of the

a form provided by the city prior to submittal of any application for Level II
development.
(3)   Preliminary plat/site plan submittal.
a.   Plat/Site plan(s) required. A preliminary plat/site plan(s) for a proposed
major subdivision shall be prepared by a professional land surveyor, licensed
landscape architect, or licensed engineer and shall be prepared in accordance
with the Unified Development Ordinance ("UDO"), the City of Asheville Standard
Details and Specifications Manual, other applicable city ordinances, city
policies and state law.
b.   Filing of application. A complete application packet containing all
information as required by the development services director shall be submitted
according to the established schedule of the TRC prior to the technical review
committee meeting at which it is to be reviewed.

7-5-20(b)(2).
d.   Review and action at TRC. The preliminary plat of a proposed major
subdivision shall first be reviewed by the designated staff for compliance with
the subdivision regulations and other applicable provisions. Unless required to
be reviewed by the HRC as set forth in subsection (e) below, the designated
staff shall then present the preliminary plat to the TRC at the next regular
meeting of the TRC following receipt of the application. Review of the
preliminary plat by the TRC will be ministerial in nature, and limited to
compliance with the regulations set forth in this UDO. The TRC may vote to
approve, approve with conditions, or deny the preliminary plat. The preliminary
plat decision is considered final on the date the TRC renders its decision.
Once the preliminary plat is approved, the applicant may proceed with
infrastructure construction and final plat approval in accordance with such
approval. If the preliminary plat is not approved, the TRC shall set forth in
writing the reasons for denying approval of the plat.
e.   Historic overlay districts and local historic landmarks. All lots of
proposed subdivisions located in a historic overlay district or of land
designated as a local historic landmark shall be reviewed by the Historic
Resources Commission ("HRC") for issuance of a preliminary approval to ensure
that any potential development on the proposed subdivided lot(s) that would
require a certificate of appropriateness would not be incongruous with the
special character of the historic district and/or local historic landmark in
terms of building setback, orientation and consistency with the historic
development pattern. HRC approval shall precede TRC review, if applicable. The
process for HRC review of proposed subdivisions and preliminary approval shall
be quasi-judicial; decisions shall be made based on the applicable ordinances
and historic design standards guidelines. Subsequent to final subdivision
approval, a separately issued certificate of appropriateness(s) will be
required for any proposed construction and/or actual site development (if not
included as part of the initial subdivision review) prior to issuance of
building and zoning permits in accordance with section
7-5-11 of the City Code.
f.   Approvals. Approval of the preliminary plat for major subdivisions shall
be valid for two years from the date of approval by the TRC. The final plat for
the major subdivision shall be approved and recorded prior to the end of this
two-year period. An HRC approved subdivision shall be valid for two years from
the date of approval by the HRC. Major subdivisions with more than 20 lots
shall be exempt from this time limit as set forth in this section, but are
instead subject to the phasing schedule appearing in the approved preliminary
plat; however, under no circumstances shall this phasing period exceed five
years.
(4)   Guarantee in lieu of construction of improvements. In lieu of completion
of construction of the required improvements and utilities prior to final plat
approval, the property owner may submit to the city a performance guarantee as
set forth in Article XV.
(5)   Final plat. The final plat of a major subdivision shall be reviewed by
the designated staff for compliance with the requirements of this chapter and
for conformity with the approved preliminary plat. Substantial changes from the
preliminary plat, as determined by the planning and development director, or
their designee, shall require an additional review by the TRC, to ensure
compliance with existing regulations. Provided the final plat is complete, and
no further review is determined to be required, the designated staff shall act
on the final plat of major subdivisions within 30 days of receipt of the plat.
Following final plat approval, the applicant shall record the plat for the
major subdivision in accordance with this subsection. No lots in a subdivision
shall be sold prior to approval by the city and recording of a plat for the
subdivision.
a.   Recordation and signatures.
1.   Signatures. Upon approval of a final plat for major subdivisions, the plat
shall be signed in the appropriate place by the designated staff and by the
owner(s).
2.   Recordation. A final plat for major subdivisions must be recorded in the
office of the Register of Deeds for Buncombe County in compliance with the
North Carolina General Statutes within 30 days following approval by the city.
No plat shall be considered finally approved until the plat has been recorded.
3.   Phasing. Final plats for subdivisions developed in phases shall be
recorded in accordance with the schedule set forth in the preliminary plat and
approved by the TRC. The applicant may request, in writing, adjustments of the
approved schedule and the designated staff may grant extensions of up to 12
months for each phase.
(6)   Acceptance of rights-of-way and easements. The approval of a final plat
does not constitute acceptance for maintenance or other purposes of
improvements in rights-of-way, such as utility lines, street paving, drainage
facilities, or sidewalks. Such improvements, when located within the corporate
limits of the City of Asheville, may be accepted only by action by the City of
Asheville City Council following inspection and approval.
(7)   Open space dedication and acceptance. Land designated as public open
space or a park on a plat shall be considered to be offered for dedication but
not accepted until the Asheville City Council has by express action done so.
Until such dedication has been accepted, such areas may be used for open space
purposes by its owner or by an association representing owners of lots within
the subdivision. Land so offered for dedication shall not be used for any
purpose inconsistent with the proposed public use without the approval of the
Asheville City Council.
(b)   Minor subdivisions.
(1)   Purpose. The minor subdivision review process is required for those
divisions of land into two or more lots which do not require the extension of
public streets or private streets built to City of Asheville standards. Review
and approval of the subdivision plat by the staff permits a speedy review while
insuring that the proposed subdivision meets all requirements established by
the City of Asheville.
(2)   Pre-application conference. It is recommended that every subdivision
applicant meet with the designated staff in a conference prior to the submittal
of a subdivision plat. The purpose of this conference is to provide
clarification and assistance in the preparation and submission of plats for
approval.
(3)   Plan submittal.
a.   Plan required. Plats for minor subdivisions shall be prepared by a
professional land surveyor in accordance with all applicable city standards,
including those set forth by the UDO, the City of Asheville Standard Details
and Specifications Manual, other applicable city ordinances, city policies and
state law.
b.   Filing of application. Plats and a complete application packet containing
all information established by the development services director for minor
subdivisions shall be submitted to the development services department.
(4)   Staff review. Unless review by the HRC is required by subsection (5)
below, the plat for a proposed minor subdivision shall be reviewed by the
designated staff for compliance with these subdivision regulations and other
applicable provisions. The review shall also include compliance by the plat
with other ordinances and regulations of the City of Asheville.
Provided the application is complete, the planning and development director
shall take action on the plat of the proposed minor subdivision within ten
working days of its submittal. Following approval, the applicant shall record
the plat for a minor subdivision in accordance with this subsection.
(5)   Historic overlay districts and local historic landmarks. All lots of
proposed subdivisions located in a historic overlay district or of land
designated as a local historic landmark shall be reviewed by the HRC for
issuance of a preliminary approval to ensure that any potential development on
the proposed subdivided lot(s) that would require a certificate of
appropriateness would not be incongruous with the special character of the
historic district and/or local historic landmark in terms of building setback,
orientation and consistency with the historic development pattern. HRC approval
shall precede TRC review, if applicable. The process for HRC review of proposed
subdivisions and preliminary approval shall be quasi-judicial; decisions shall
be made based on the applicable ordinances principles and historic guidelines.
Subsequent to subdivision final approval, a separately issued certificate of
appropriateness(s) will be required for any proposed construction and/or actual
site development (if not included as part of the initial subdivision review) on
the lot(s) prior to issuance of building and zoning permits in accordance with
the provisions of section
7-5-11 of the City Code.
(6)   Public notification. No public notification is required for minor
subdivision review.
(7)   Final plat approval.
a.   Recordation and signatures.
1.   Signatures. Upon approval of a plat for minor subdivisions, the plat shall
be signed in the appropriate place by the designated staff and by the owner(s).
2.   Recordation. A plat for minor subdivisions must be recorded in the office
of the Register of Deeds for Buncombe County in compliance with the North
Carolina General Statutes within 30 days following approval by the city. No
plat shall be considered finally approved until the plat has been recorded. No
lots in a subdivision shall be sold prior to approval by the city and recording
of a plat for the subdivision.
(c)   Fees. For all categories of subdivision, fees as established by the City
of Asheville Fees and Charges Manual shall be due and payable when the
application is submitted.
(d)   Appeals. All appeals from preliminary and final plat approvals shall be
to Buncombe County Superior Court in accordance with state law.
(e)   Violations. Violations of the provisions of this section shall be subject
to the enforcement and penalty provisions set forth in article XVIII of this
chapter.

ARTICLE VI. VARIANCES, ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 1
 
Notes
  Editor's note(s)—
1 Ord. No. 4403, § 1a, adopted Apr. 14, 2015, changed the title of Art. VI from
  "Variances and Administrative Appeals" to read as set out.
Sec. 7-6-1. Variances.
(a)   Purpose. The variance process administered by the board of adjustment is
a quasi-judicial process intended to provide limited relief from the
requirements of this chapter in those cases where strict application of a
particular requirement will create an unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use
of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this chapter. It is not intended
that variances be granted merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens
that the requirements of this chapter may impose on property owners in general
or to increase the profitability of a proposed development. Rather, it is
intended to provide relief where the requirements of this chapter render the
land difficult to use because of some unique physical attribute of the property
itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variance is
requested.
(b)   Provisions which may not be varied by the board of adjustment:
(1)   Other than those exceptions explicitly noted, in no event shall the board
of adjustment grant a variance to any special requirement set out in article
XVI for a use by right subject to special requirements, or grant a variance
with respect to any special use permit or conditional zoning district ordinance
adopted pursuant to this chapter.
(2)   In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance which would
modify, alter, change, or suspend the special requirements set forth in article
XVI of this chapter, for a use by right, subject to special requirements, or a
special use.
(3)   In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance to the flood
protection provisions within the designated floodway district which would
result in any increase in the flood levels during the regulatory flood
discharge.
(4)   In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance which would
permit the creation of a non- conforming lot except that the board may grant a
variance permitting a reduction in lot area and dimensional standards, for an
individual lot located in residential districts, provided that the variance
does not permit a reduction of greater than ten percent in the required lot
area and dimensional standards. Provided further, applications for such
variance for additional lot(s) under common ownership or located within the
same development shall not be submitted within three years of submittal of the
previous application, regardless of the decision of the board on the previous
application.
(5)   In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance from the
design guidelines established for local historic districts and historic
landmarks.

and regulations.
(7)   Reserved.
(8)   In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance from the
landscape and buffering standards set forth in section
7-11-1 of this chapter.
(c)   Applications.
(1)   An application for a variance may be filed only by the owner of the land
affected by the variance or an agent specifically authorized in writing by the
owner to file such application.
(2)   Before filing the application, the applicant is strongly encouraged to
meet with the planning and development director or the engineering director if
proceeding under sections
7-5-12,
7-12-1 or
7-12-2 of this chapter to discuss the proposed variance and to become more
familiar with the applicable requirements and approval procedures of the city.
(3)   An application for a variance shall be filed with the online permit
system, or the planning director or their designee, if proceeding under section
7-5-12,
7-12-1, or
7-12-2, on a form prescribed by the director, and containing such information
and plans as required on the application form. The notice of appeal shall state
the grounds for the appeal.
(4)   The application shall be accompanied by a fee as set forth in the City of
Asheville's Fees and Charges Manual.
(5)   Once an application has been accepted as complete by the online permit
system, the planning director or their designee, the planning and development
director or the engineering director, if proceeding under section
7-5-12,
7-12-1 or
7-12-2, the application will be scheduled for consideration at a public hearing
by the board of adjustment; provided, however, all appeals and requests for
variances under sections
7-5-12 and
7-12-1 of this chapter shall initially be heard by the specifications review
committee.
(d)   Action by the board of adjustment.
(1)   Upon receiving the application materials, the board of adjustment shall
hold a quasi-judicial hearing on a proposed variance. Notice of the hearing
shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of section
7-5-20 of this chapter. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the
rules of procedure of the board of adjustment and in accordance with the North
Carolina General Statutes.
(2)   In considering the application, the board of adjustment shall review the
application materials, the staff recommendation, the general purpose and
standards set forth in this article for the granting of variances, and all
testimony and evidence received by the board of adjustment at the public
hearing.
(3)   After conducting the quasi-judicial hearing, the board of adjustment may:
a.   Deny the application;
b.   Conduct an additional hearing on the application; or
c.   Grant the application. The concurring vote of four-fifths of the board of
adjustment shall be necessary to grant a variance.
   Any approval or denial of the request shall be accompanied by written
findings that the variance meets or does not meet each of the standards set
forth in subsection
7-6-1(e) below: except the standards for flood protection regulation variances
are set forth in subsection
7-6-1(f). The written decision shall be signed by the chair or other duly
authorized member of the board. A quasi-judicial decision is effective upon
filing the written decision with the secretary to the board.
(4)   Appropriate conditions, which must be reasonably related to the condition
or circumstance that gives rise to the need for a variance, may be imposed on
any approval issued by the board of adjustment.
(e)   Standard of review. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying
out the strict letter of this ordinance, the board of adjustment shall grant a
variance upon a showing of all the following:
(1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the
ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
(2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property,
such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal
circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common
to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a
variance.
(3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the
property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
(4)   The variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of the
ordinance such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is
achieved.
No change in permitted uses may be authorized by the variance. Appropriate
conditions may be imposed on any variance provided that the conditions are
reasonably related to the variance.
(f)   Standard of review—flood regulations variances. A variance from the
standards set forth in section
7-12-1 of this chapter for flood protection may be granted permitting the
erection of a structure with a lowest floor elevation, including basement,
lower than the regulatory flood datum if all of the following are met:
(1)   The property on which the structure is to be erected is an isolated lot
of one-half acre or less, contiguous to and surrounded by existing structures
constructed below such required first floor elevation;
(2)   Good and sufficient cause exists for the granting of the variance;
(3)   Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant;
(4)   The issuance of the variance would not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense;
(5)   The variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief; and
(6)   The variance would not have the effect of nullifying the intent and
purposes of this chapter.
(g)   Standard of review—sign variances. See section
7-13-9 of this chapter.
(h)   Effect of approval or denial.
(1)   After the board of adjustment approves a variance, the applicant shall
follow all appropriate procedures set forth in article V of this chapter for
the receipt of permits, certificates, and other approvals necessary in order to
proceed with development.
(2)   An application for a rehearing may be made in accordance with the board
of adjustment's rules of procedure.
(i)   Appeals. Any appeal from the decision of the board of adjustment may be
made by an aggrieved party and shall be made to the Superior Court of Buncombe
County in the nature of certiorari. Any such petition to the Superior Court
shall be filed no later than 30 days, as provided in N.C.G.S. §160D-1405, after
a written copy of the decision of the board of adjustment is provided to the
applicant.

Sec. 7-6-2. Appeals of administrative decisions.
(a)   Purpose. Appeals to the board of adjustment from the decisions of the
administrative staff of the city are permitted as provided for in this chapter.
(b)   Decisions which may be appealed. Any order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by an administrative officer or other boards or commissions
charged with enforcing the provisions of this chapter may be appealed to the
board of adjustment as set forth herein.
(c)   Persons who may file and appeal. Any person who has standing under
N.C.G.S. §160D-1402(c) or the city may appeal a decision to the board of
adjustment. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for appeal.
(d)   Filing of an appeal.
(1)   An application for appeal shall be filed with the online permit system,
or the planning director or their designee who will then forward to the
planning and development director on a form prescribed by the director and
contain such information as required on the application form.
(2)   The application shall be accompanied by a fee as set forth in the City of
Asheville's Fees and Charges Manual.
(3)   Any appeal of an administrative decision must be filed no later than 30
days from receipt of written notice of the decision. For purposes of this
section, "filed" means received by the online permit system, or the planning
director or their designee.
(4)   Once an application is accepted as complete by the planning and
development director, the application will be scheduled for consideration at a
public hearing by the board of adjustment.
(5)   The filing of an appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement
order shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the contested action unless
the planning and development director, chief building inspector, or the
official who made the decision, certifies to the board of adjustment that, in
his/her opinion, by reason of facts stated in the certification, such a stay
would cause imminent peril to life and property, or because the violation is
transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the
ordinance. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by restraining
order which may be granted by the Superior Court of Buncombe County on notice
to the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken, with due cause
shown. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with
the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board of
adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is
filed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or
otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the
ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or
permissions to use such property. In these situations the appellant may request
and the board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or
building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
(e)   Action by the board of adjustment.
(1)   Upon receiving the application materials, the board of adjustment shall
hold a quasi-judicial hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing shall be
provided in accordance with the provisions of section
7-5-20 of this chapter. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the
rules of procedure of the board of adjustment and in accordance with the North
Carolina General Statutes.
(2)   Either at the hearing or a subsequent meeting, the board of adjustment
shall adopt an order reversing, affirming, or modifying the contested action.
(3)   The board of adjustment shall not reverse or modify the contested action
unless it finds that the administrative officer erred in the application or
interpretation of the terms of this chapter.
(4)   The board of adjustment shall not reverse or modify the contested action
unless there is a concurring majority vote of the board members.
(5)   Nothing herein shall prevent the planning and development director or
his/her designee from pursuing an informal resolution of the matter appealed
from. In such cases, the planning and development director or his/her designee
shall report such resolution to the board of adjustment.
(f)   Effect of reversal or modification. In the event that the board of
adjustment reverses or modifies the contested action, all subsequent actions
taken by administrative officers with regard to the subject matter shall be in
accordance with the reversal or modification granted by the board of adjustment
unless an appeal is taken on the board's decision.
(g)   Appeal from board of adjustment. Any such petition to the superior court
shall be filed no later than 30 days after a written copy of the decision is
provided to the applicant, as provided in N.C.G.S. §160D-1405(d).

Sec. 7-6-3. Variances for reasonable accommodations.
(a)   Purpose. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make
a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with
a disability as provided in N.C.G.S. §160D-705(d). This section provides a
procedure for making requests for reasonable accommodations in land use, zoning
and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures for the City of
Asheville to comply fully with the intent and purpose of federal laws.
Nothing in this section requires persons with disabilities or handicaps, or
operators of family care homes or group homes for persons with disabilities or
handicaps acting or operating in accordance with applicable zoning, licensing
or land use laws or practices, to seek reasonable accommodation under this
section.
(b)   Eligible applicants.
(1)   This section is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as
disabled or handicapped under federal law. A person recovering from substance
abuse is considered a person with a disability or handicap; however, a person
who is currently engaging in the illegal use of controlled substances is not.
(2)   A request for a reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a
disability or handicap, his or her legal representative, or a provider of
housing for persons with disabilities or handicaps in the city's land use and
zoning regulations, policies, or practices when the application of such may act
as a barrier to affording such person[s] equal opportunity to use and enjoy a
dwelling in accordance with the law.
(c)   Eligible requests.
(1)   A request for a reasonable accommodation may include a modification or
exception to the rules, standards and/or practices for the siting, development,
and use of housing or housing-related facilities in this Unified Development
Ordinance, that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a
disability or handicap an equal opportunity to a dwelling of his or her choice.
(d)   Applications.
(1)   The City of Asheville's Development Services Department shall provide
applicants for a reasonable accommodation with an application form, eliciting
the following information:
a.   The applicant's name, address and telephone number;
b.   Name, address, and telephone number of the property owner and the current
address for which the request is being made;
c.   The current actual use of the property;
d.   The basis for the claim that the applicant is considered disabled or
handicapped under federal law;
e.   The UDO provision, regulation or policy from which reasonable
accommodation is being requested;
f.   Explanation of why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make
specific property available for the individual.
(2)   If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable
accommodation, the city will provide assistance to ensure that the process is
accessible.
(3)   A reasonable accommodation shall not affect an individual's obligations
to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested
accommodation.
(4)   Any information which relates to the applicant's disability or handicap
and is identified by the applicant as confidential shall be retained in a
manner so as to respect the privacy rights of the applicant and shall not be
made available for public inspection.
(5)   An application for a reasonable accommodation under this section shall be
submitted to the city clerk who will forward copies of the request to the
director of development services. No filing fee shall be required for such
application.
(e)   Application review.
(1)   Review authority. A request for a reasonable accommodation shall be
reviewed, and a determination shall be made, by the board of adjustment.
(2)   Action and procedures of the board of adjustment.
a.   Upon receiving a complete application, the board of adjustment shall hold
a quasi-judicial hearing on the proposed reasonable accommodation within 60
days, unless this requirement is waived by the applicant. Notice of the hearing
shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of section
7-5-20 of this chapter. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the
rules of procedure of the board of adjustment and in accordance with the North
Carolina General Statutes.
b.   In considering the application, the board of adjustment shall review the
application materials, the standards set forth in this section, and all
testimony and evidence received by the board of adjustment at the quasi-
judicial hearing.
c.   After conducting the hearing, the board of adjustment may:
            i.   Grant the application. The concurring vote of four-fifths of
the board of adjustment shall be necessary to grant a reasonable accommodation;
or
            ii.   Deny the application. Any approval or denial of the request
shall be accompanied by written findings of fact and conclusions of law
determining that the request for reasonable accommodation meets or does not
meet each of the standards set forth in subsection (e)(3) below. The written
decision shall be signed by the chair or other duly authorized member of the
board. The decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the
secretary to the board.
(3)   Standard of review. The board of adjustment shall grant an exception or
modification to any provision of this section as a reasonable accommodation
under federal law if the board finds, based on the competent, material and
substantial evidence, that the proposed accommodation:
a.   Will be used by an individual or individuals with a disability or handicap
protected under federal law;
b.   Is "reasonable." An accommodation will be determined to be reasonable if
it would not undermine the legitimate purposes and effects of existing zoning
regulations, and if it will not impose significant financial and administrative
burdens upon the city and/or constitute a substantial or fundamental alteration
of the city's ordinance provisions; and
c.   Is "necessary." An accommodation will be determined to be necessary if it
would provide direct or meaningful therapeutic amelioration of the effects of
the particular disability or handicap, and would afford handicapped or disabled
persons equal opportunity to enjoy and use housing in residential districts in
the city.
(4)   Decision. The board of adjustment shall issue a written decision on a
request for reasonable accommodation within 60 days of the date of the quasi-
judicial hearing.
(5)   Appeals. Any appeal from the decision of the board of adjustment may be
made by an aggrieved party and shall be made to the Superior Court of Buncombe
County in the nature of certiorari in accordance with the procedures and
requirements set forth in N.C.G.S. § 160D-1402.

zoning study is requested. The area for which the zoning study is requested
must be defined by the petitioners requesting the zoning study and may be of
any size and include any number of individual contiguous parcels, including a
public street. The area defined by the petitioners will be used by city staff
to determine if the required 51 percent of property owners owning at least 51
percent of the property have signed the petition requesting the zoning study.
Upon confirmation that the petition for a zoning study is valid, it shall be
forwarded to the Asheville City Council for a determination of whether the
zoning study should be initiated for the defined area and any portion thereof.
The city council may initiate the zoning study, elect not to initiate the
zoning study, or reduce the size of the area to be included in the zoning study
and initiate a zoning study of the reduced area.
(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97)

Sec. 7-7-6 Reserved.
Editor's note(s)—Ord. No. 4381, § 1(A1), adopted June 8, 2021, repealed § 7-7-
6, which pertained to protests and derived from Ord. No. 2369, § 1, adopted May

Sec. 7-7-7. Waiting period for subsequent applications.
(a)   Waiting period - general. When an application for a zoning amendment has
been approved or denied by the Asheville City Council, no rezoning application
covering the same property shall be accepted or considered within 12 months
after the date of the approval or denial. This restriction shall apply
regardless of whether or not the new application is for a zoning classification
different from the original application.
(b)   Waiting period - waiver. The waiting period required by this section may
be waived by a three-fourths vote of Asheville City Council if it determines
that there have been substantial changes in conditions or circumstances which

(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 7-7-8. Conditional zoning.
(a)   Purpose. Conditional zoning is established to provide for flexibility in
the development of property while ensuring that the development is compatible
with neighboring uses. Conditional zoning affords a degree of certainty in land
use decisions not possible when rezoning to a general use district. Additional
conditions, standards and regulations are attached to a proposed development to
ensure that the activities and operations are compatible with the surrounding
uses and with applicable adopted plans in accordance with the requirements of
this section.
(b)   Conditional zoning districts. Conditional zoning is available to any of
the general zoning classifications enumerated in this chapter, except for those
that require a master plan as part of the application (e.g. Urban Village).
Expansion zoning districts are only allowed as conditional zoning districts for
Level III projects and as otherwise indicated in the Table_of_Permitted_Uses
and this UDO. Applicants for Level III projects shall select the most
applicable expansion district based on the proposed use(s). The conditional
zoning designation shall be indicated on all zoning maps and other official
documents with the suffix, "CZ" (e.g. RM-8 CZ; IND CZ; COM EXP CZ).
(c)   General requirements. The following provision shall apply in the
administration of conditional zoning.
(1)   A conditional zoning application shall be considered only upon submittal
of a complete application by the owner of the affected property or a duly
authorized representative of the property owner.
(2)   Development plans shall be prepared by a licensed design professional and
shall be prepared in accordance with the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO),
the City of Asheville Standard Specifications and Details Manual, other
applicable city ordinances, city policies and state law.
(3)   All standards and requirements of the corresponding general use zoning
district or expansion district shall be met, except to the extent that the
conditions imposed by the conditional zoning may be more or less restrictive
than the development standards if such conditions comply with the comprehensive
plan or other adopted plans, and/or except where the requirements are modified
in accordance with subsection
7-7-8(c)(6). A conditional zoning involving an expansion district must meet all
standards and requirements of the expansion district.
(4)   No uses shall be permitted except those enumerated in the ordinance
adopting the conditional zoning.
(5)   The conditions agreed upon pursuant to the conditional zoning approval
shall be stated in the adopting ordinance and may limit the uses which are
permitted on the property. By way of illustration and not limitation,
conditions may specify location on the property of the proposed structure(s),
the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities
such as parking lots, driveways, access streets, and sidewalks, the location
and extent of landscaping, buffer areas and open space, the timing of
development, the height of structures, the design and orientation of
structures, the location and extent of rights-of-way and other areas to be
dedicated for public purposes, and other such matters as may be identified as
appropriate for the proposed development.
(6)   Minor modifications to the approved site plan may be reviewed and
approved administratively provided that they do not involve a change in
permitted uses, changes in overall density or substantial changes to the
configuration of the development that affect the operation or impacts of the
development. Any other modification of the conditions and standards in a
conditional zoning district shall be approved by the city council following
this review process as an amendment to the conditional zoning ordinance and may
be referred to the technical review committee as appropriate. The planning and
urban design director shall in every case have the discretion to decline to
exercise the power to approve minor modifications as provided for herein, and
may require the applicant to seek an amendment to the conditional zoning
ordinance.
(7)   When adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the city council shall
also approve a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an
adopted comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plans that are
applicable, and briefly explain why the council considers the action taken to
be reasonable and in the public interest. That statement is not subject to
judicial review.
(8)   Any violation of a provision of a conditional zoning ordinance shall be
treated the same as any other violation of this chapter and shall be subject to
the same remedies and penalties as any other such violation.
(9)   If no action has been taken to obtain a zoning permit or otherwise begin
development of the property in accordance with the conditional zoning ordinance
within 24 months of its approval by city council, the planning and urban design
director may initiate appropriate action to rezone the affected property to any
other classification. The conditional zoning ordinance may provide a specific
duration of the approval. Appropriate approval conditions may be added to
guarantee site maintenance and security. Nothing herein shall be construed to
extend any time limitations prescribed by statute or by other ordinances in
this chapter.
(10)   If the use(s) commenced pursuant to a conditional zoning ordinance is
abandoned or discontinued as described in article 17 the planning and urban
design director may initiate appropriate action to rezone the affected property
to any other classification or the applicant may seek an amendment to the
conditional zoning approval by following the process outlined in this chapter.
(11)   No variances or special use permits may be issued for developments on
property that is subject to a conditional zoning ordinance.
(d)   Pre-application procedure.

applicant and staff an opportunity to discuss the rezoning request, the
requirements for completing the review schedule, contact persons for services
and permits, and information regarding site plans, landscaping, and development
requirements.
   The staff can also determine if any special reviews will be required, such
as reviews by the historic resources commission, the tree commission, Asheville
Area Riverfront Redevelopment Commission, or downtown commission.
(2)   Neighborhood meeting. The prospective applicant shall meet with the
surrounding community during the pre-application phase. No application for
conditional zoning shall be accepted for review by the city unless the
following criteria are met:
a.   A community meeting shall be held with the surrounding residents of the
proposed development site at least 14 days but not more than four months prior
to any application submission to the city. This meeting shall follow the
principals outlined in the “Neighborhood and Community Meeting Guide for
Development” (Guide) as maintained by the city.
b.   Notification requirements. The meeting shall be advertised as follows:

zoning commission.
(4)   Review by the planning and zoning commission. Following review by the
technical review committee and other bodies, as required, the planning and
zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on the application for
conditional zoning. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided in
accordance with the provisions of section
7-5-20 of this chapter. After holding the public hearing, the planning and
zoning commission may recommend approval of the application, including
recommending conditions for the zoning; recommend denial of the application; or

the consistency of the proposal with the comprehensive plan and other adopted
plans.
(5)   Review by city council. Upon receipt of the recommendations from the
planning and zoning commission, the city council shall hold a public hearing on
the application for conditional zoning. Notice of the public hearing shall be
provided in accordance with the provisions of section
7-5-20 of this chapter and the North Carolina General Statutes.
The city council's consideration of an application for conditional zoning is
legislative in nature, and the council may consider any relevant information in
its deliberations. Consideration shall be given to adopted land use plans for
the area, small area plans, corridor plans, and other land use policy
documents, and to surrounding land uses. The council may adopt or not adopt a
conditional zoning ordinance, or may continue its consideration of the
application as necessary or appropriate.
(6)   Conditions. During the adoption of a conditional zoning ordinance,
specific conditions may be proposed by the petitioner, city council, planning

any permits, the applicant must submit detailed plans incorporating all
conditions to the technical review committee for final review.
(8)   Map amendment. Upon adoption of a conditional zoning ordinance, the
official zoning map of the City of Asheville shall be amended to add the
conditional zoning district. The city clerk shall maintain a book or other
official record for conditional zoning ordinances, and each conditional zoning
ordinance shall be filed therein. Failure to comply with this provision shall
not render the ordinance invalid.
If approved by the city council, no permits may be issued on the subject
property until the property owner has recorded the approved plan and conditions
pertinent to the specific property at the Buncombe County Register of Deeds,
including a notation of the pertinent deed number with book and page reference.

ARTICLE VIII. - GENERAL USE AND EXPANSION DISTRICTS[3]
Footnotes:
--- (3) --- Editor's note— Ord. No. 4560, § 1i, adopted February 14, 2017
changed the title of art. VIII from "General Use Districts" to General Use and
Expansion Districts."
Sec. 7-8-1. Enumeration and description of districts; designation of districts
on official zoning maps.
(a)   Criteria for zoning districts. For the purposes set forth in article I,
the City of Asheville and its extraterritorial jurisdiction are divided into
zoning districts taking into account the design, size, and/or location of one
or more of the following:
(1)   Transportation facilities, including streets, sidewalks, and bridges;
(2)   Schools, parks, greenways, and other public facilities and requirements;
(3)   Police protection;
(4)   Fire protection;
(5)   Sanitary sewer and stormwater drainage structures;
(6)   Water supplies for purposes of fire protection and consumption;
(7)   Access and location to other utility services;
(8)   Potential hazards from fire, flooding, and diseases;
(9)   Access to light and air from buildings;
(10)   Access for fire and police protection and refuse collection;
(11)   Protection for occupants of dwellings from noise, dust, and gases caused
by traffic and other uses;
(12)   Topography and other natural features; and/or
(13)   Current uses of land and buildings for residences, businesses,
industries, places of worship, schools, and for other uses and heights of
buildings, the size and location of yards, and the density of population in
each of the zoning districts hereinafter mentioned.
(b)   Enumeration and descriptions of zoning districts. There are three types
of zoning districts:
(1)   General use districts are those in which a variety of uses are permitted.
The general use districts established in this article are classified from
"highest" to "lowest" in the following order:
         "Highest"
         RS-2 Residential Single-Family Low-Density District
         RS-4 Residential Single-Family Medium Density District
         RS-8 Residential Single-Family High Density District
         RM-6 Residential Multi-Family Low Density District
         RM-8 Residential Multi-Family Medium Density District
         RM-16 Residential Multi-Family High Density District
         Neighborhood Business District
         Office District
         Office II District
         Office/Business District
         Community Business I District
         Community Business II District
         Urban Residential District
         Neighborhood Corridor District
         Haywood Road Form District
         River Arts Form District
         Urban Village District
         Urban Place District
         Resort District
         Institutional District
         Highway Business District
         Regional Business District
         Central Business District
         River District
         Commercial Industrial District
         Light Industrial District
         Industrial District
         "Lowest"
      For any district where an overlay district is found, the overlay district
shall have the same order as the general use district for the purpose of
determining its hierarchy under the table.
(2)   Overlay districts are zoning districts which overlap one or more general
use districts. Overlay districts (article IX) involve additional regulations on
some or all property within underlying general use districts. The following
overlay districts are established:
a.   Reserved.
b.   Historic preservation overlay district(s). Asheville's historic areas are
important assets to the city. The protecting and conserving of the historic
areas is encouraged through the establishment of historic preservation overlay
districts. Designation of an area as a historic district and the development of
design standards for the area help preserve the architectural integrity of the
area and stabilize and enhance property values. Historic districts, protected
by designation as preservation overlays, serve as valuable educational tools
and as tourist attractions.
c.   Downtown design review overlay district. Urban design review assists in
protecting the downtown local architectural heritage and in the preservation of
the considerable economic investments that have occurred over the years. The
downtown design review process seeks to encourage renovation and new
development in a manner that will promote visual harmony, enhance the
historical integrity, and develop creative design solutions. While the design
guidelines will not dictate architectural styles, they will suggest a variety
of design options for achieving compatibility within the designated boundaries.
d.   Manufactured housing and manufactured housing community overlay districts.
The manufactured housing and manufactured housing community overlay districts
are established to provide a procedure for identifying areas in which
manufactured housing may be located and to establish standards for individual
manufactured homes and for the development of communities. These overlay
districts are intended to expand the range of housing opportunities available
to residents of Asheville while assuring that manufactured housing is
compatible with existing development.
e.   Blue Ridge Parkway Overlay District. Realizing the importance of the Blue
Ridge Parkway to the economy of Asheville and western North Carolina, the Blue
Ridge Parkway Overlay District is created to protect and preserve the unique
features of this asset to the city. The standards established in this district
will protect the scenic quality of the parkway and reduce encroachment on its
rural setting.
f.   Transition overlay district. Several areas in the City of Asheville are
experiencing development pressures which are pushing the areas toward change.
The location of most of these area on the edge of residential neighborhoods
means that changes in these areas could have a significant impact on the
adjacent neighborhoods. Transition overlay districts are established to allow
these areas to change while assuring that the change is compatible with
adjacent areas. Standards are developed individually for each area and designed
to meet each area's unique needs. Involvement of area property owners and
residents in the preparation of development standards is encouraged.
(3)   Conditional districts are zoning districts which provide for flexibility
in the development of property while ensuring that the development is
compatible with neighboring uses. Conditional zoning districts are available
for any of the general use zoning classifications enumerated in this ordinance;
moreover, there are certain conditional districts that are not associated with
an existing general use district and may only be considered with Level III
developments. These districts include:
         Central Business Expansion District
         Institutional Expansion District
         Commercial Expansion District
         Residential Expansion District
         Industrial Expansion District
         Lodging Expansion District
         Mixed Use Expansion District
(c)   Designation of districts on official zoning maps. Each district shall be
shown on the official zoning maps of the City of Asheville, North Carolina, a
copy of which is located in the city planning and development department. Said
set of maps, and all district designations, boundaries, figures, letters, and
symbols shown on such maps are hereby declared to be a part of this chapter.
(d)   Table of Permitted Uses. The table is a summary listing of uses that are
fully defined in section
7-2-5.

(1)   Any use not listed is not allowed unless the planning and development
director determines that the use is similar to a listed use. When determining
whether a proposed use is similar to a listed use, the planning and development
director will consider the following:
a.   The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use.
b.   The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to
the proposed use.
c.   Relative amounts of sales.
d.   The customer type.
e.   The relative number of employees.
f.   Hours of operation.
g.   Building and site arrangement.
h.   Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements.
i.   The number of vehicle trips generated.
j.   How the proposed use is advertised.
k.   The likely impact on surrounding properties.
l.   Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other
activities on the site.
(2)   Where a use is determined not to be similar to any listed use, a text
amendment is required prior to establishment of that use.

Sec. 7-8-18. Central Business District.
(a)   Purpose. It shall be the purpose of the Central Business District to
reinforce the downtown as the urban center of Asheville and Western North
Carolina, encouraging private and public investment which will preserve the
Central Business District as the primary retail, office, hotel, institutional,
cultural and entertainment center of our community. It is further the purpose
of this district to encourage a strong supportive retail center along with high
density residential development which will complement other downtown uses and
surrounding neighborhoods. A high priority is placed on design, integrating new
uses into and with existing architecture in a respectful and cohesive manner.
Design review guidelines in place for the downtown area remain as a companion
document for urban design decisions. Development within this district should
facilitate the circulation patterns and needs of individuals and business
alike. A well-balanced transportation system for this district must recognize
the importance of all forms of movements, be it pedestrian, bicycling, transit,
automobile, or truck in nature.
(b)   Allowable land uses. All permitted uses, special uses, conditional uses
and uses expressly prohibited are identified in subsection
7-8-1(d), Table of Permitted Uses. Standards for special uses and conditional
uses can be found in article XVI of this chapter.
(c)   Reserved.
(d)   Reserved.
(e)   Reserved.
(f)   Development standards—Downtown. The following development standards apply
to all parcels zoned Central Business District for new construction and/or
changes that modify the exterior walls and/or roof of an existing building that
are located within the boundaries of the Downtown Design Review Overlay
District, as described in section
7-9-3 of this chapter. Routine maintenance, repairs or replacement of same or
similar materials on existing buildings are exempt from these requirements.
(1)   Density standards. None.
(2)   Structure size standards. Structure size shall not be limited except that
height and design and operational standards shall apply.
(3)   Lot size standards. None.
(4)   Lot width standards. None.
(5)   Setback standards. The following minimum setbacks shall be required for
uses in the Central Business District.
Front:
Minimum setback: Zero feet from the right-of-way line. For corner lots
buildings are to be placed at the corner.
Maximum setback: Zero feet from the right-of-way line. The following exceptions
to the maximum setback may be permitted. The agency or official responsible for
project review may consider allowing greater setbacks under one or more of the
following circumstances:
a.   A setback of up to 50 feet from the edge of the curb may be approved for
places of worship, civic and governmental buildings, and residential projects
that will provide a public space, such as a courtyard or plaza space.
b.   A setback of up to 20 feet for uses in the district providing courtyard or
plaza spaces in the setback area.
Courtyard and plaza areas should meet definitions located in
7-2-5 of this chapter which describe form and purpose. The main façade of the
building must face this setback area.
c.   An adopted plan or other official document of the city recommends a
greater setback.
d.   A greater setback is determined as part of a design review process or is
the result of an addition (that is otherwise compliant with this article) to an
existing building.
Side: None required, except that a 15-foot setback will be required when
adjacent to residentially zoned property.
Rear: None required, except that a 15-foot setback will be required when
adjacent to residentially zoned property.
(6)   Impervious surface standards. None.
(7)   Height standards. For the definition of height see building height in
section
7-2-5  of this chapter. The minimum height for new structures in the Central
Business District will be two stories (a minimum of 24 feet). Maximum building
height will be determined according to the context transition edge map, the
height zone map, the height zone edge setback and shadow impacts described
below and with maps following this section.
a.   The two-story requirement for new construction will mean that:
1.   A second floor is provided as a full occupiable floor and a mezzanine
level will not be sufficient to meet this requirement; and
2.   Civic uses such as places of worship, arenas, auditoriums, and performance
centers will not be required to meet the two-story requirement described in
subsection 1. above.
b.   Context transition edge: The first step in determining the height
permitted for a structure is to review the context transition edge map found at
the end of this section to determine if it is applicable to the specific
property. This map shows areas where a gradual scale transition is required for
new downtown construction from nearby established residential neighborhoods.
The map reflects a specific height overlay for properties located near the
context transition edge (a 100-foot-wide area measured from the transition
line). Buildings located within this transition edge will have their actual
height determined by using the formula for height: H = D/1.5; (where H is the
height of the building and D is the distance from the transition edge). The one
exception is that a two-story structure with a 15-foot setback when adjacent to
residentially zoned property is exempt from the formula requirements.

IMAGES/0-0-0-76.png]
c.   Height zones: Measurement of height: The second step in determining the
height permitted for a structure is to review the building height zone map
located at the end of this section.
(1)   The intermediate height zone is 145 feet and the tallest height zone is
265 feet.
(2)   Actual building heights may exceed this height by an additional overall
amount of 50 feet to accommodate such uses as the final occupied floor,
mechanical penthouses and roof cap features.
d.   Height zone edge setback from the right-of-way: To protect certain views
in downtown, as illustrated on the height zone map by a dashed line (specific
to portions of four streets listed below), a height zone edge setback is
established. The height zones for the intermediate height zone and the tallest
height zone follow property lines except for the following streets where a
height transition between these two zones 40 feet wide measured from the right-
of-way line edge will be observed:
(1.)   College Street between the tunnel and Town Mountain Road.
(2.)   Haywood Street between Battery Park Avenue and N. French Broad Avenue
(south side).
(3.)   Patton Avenue from Pearl Street to Otis Street (both sides of street)
and continuing from Otis Street to the point of Pritchard Park (south side).
(4.)   Hilliard Avenue between Clingman Avenue and Pearl Street (north side).
e.   Shadow impact limits: Shadows from new construction on large or small
public parks or public plazas are limited by the following standard:
(1.)   Shadows impacts on any one point are limited to no more than two hours
between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on the spring or fall equinox at
ground level; March 21 or September 21 respectively.
(2.)   Where no right-of-way exists between the proposed project and the public
park or plaza, a 50-foot buffer free of any shadow limitations will be
observed.
This shadow impact standard will not apply to smaller public spaces such as
pocket parks or private plazas, parks and courtyards. See the definition for
parks specific to the Central Business District in section
7-2-5 of this chapter for further clarification.
f.   One story additions to existing buildings are approved under the following
circumstances:
1.   Additions are permitted when they are:
a.   1,000 square feet or less, or
b.   The addition does not expand the footprint of the existing building by
more than 20 percent; and
c.   The addition is located no closer than five feet of the primary façade of
an existing contributing structure in the Downtown National Register District,
or is located at the rear of the existing building so there is no affect on the
primary façade, or for non-contributing structures is placed to make the
existing building either equal to or more compliant with setback requirements;
and
d.   As measured from the primary street façade, the width of the addition
shall not exceed 50 percent of the width of the existing building, and
e.   Other fenestration and design requirements if any, apply.
2.   One-story accessory structures, that are in support of a primary use on a
site are allowed when:
a.   Placement of the accessory structure is behind or to the side of the
primary building or in the case of outside dining spaces for restaurants, may
be placed at the front of the lot to enhance activity at the sidewalk level,
and
b.   Fenestration and design requirements if any, apply.
Other additions that fall outside of these provisions may be considered by the
planning and zoning commission following the usual process for variances, which
includes a recommendation from the downtown commission.
(8)   Landscaping/buffering standards. Landscaping and/or buffering shall be
provided as required by section
7-11-3 of this chapter.
(9)   Parking/loading standards. If provided, loading facilities shall be
placed along alleys or streets not identified on the Key Pedestrian Streets map
(found at the end of this section) when available. There shall be no
requirements for off-street parking in the Central Business District except for
hotels with all required parking to be provided on-site. No parking is allowed
between the building and any abutting street.
Parking garages placed on a key pedestrian street shall provide a full
habitable story and use along the street-side facade(s) with a minimum depth of
15 feet and an average minimum depth of 20 feet, or shall comply with the
design and operation standards for openings and design organization
requirements for new construction.
(10)   Sidewalk standards. Sidewalks shall be provided as required by and
pursuant to the requirements for sidewalks as set forth in section
7-11-8 of this chapter.
(11)   Access standards. Vehicular entries shall be a maximum of 24 feet in
width. In addition driveway curb cuts are limited to a single standard driveway
per 200 feet along a block face per development. Automobile access and services
from a rear alley is encouraged.
(12)   Open space standards. Open space shall be provided as required by
section
7-11-4 of this chapter.
(13)   Design and operational standards.
a.   The following requirements apply to all buildings in the CBD: Street wall
and step-back requirements:    In order to enhance the traditional scale of
downtown and ensure adequate air and light at the sidewalk level and
neighboring properties, a visual demarcation will be established across the
façade of the building at a height that is defined as the street wall.
Corresponding to this elevation on the façade a step-back across the front or
side(s) will be provided and in limited circumstances described below, other
alternatives may apply to ensure variety in new construction.
(1.)   Street wall height: The street wall height and specific alternatives are
established in the following ways:
a.   If the property is located within the Traditional Downtown Core area as
illustrated on the map following this section, the street wall will be set at
between two and four stories with a recommendation to reflect the height of
neighboring buildings;
b.   If the property is located outside the Traditional Downtown Core the
street wall will be established by a one-to-one relationship to the width of
the right-of-way (ROW). For example, a ROW of 50 feet would result in a maximum
street wall height of 50 feet. Depending on the site the following scenarios
may apply:
1.   If a parcel fronts on more than one street, the street wall shall be
established by:
a.   The ROW width of the key pedestrian street if applicable; or
b.   Measuring the ROW from the side of the building with the primary
pedestrian entrance.
2.   The street wall may wrap around to the side(s) at the same height or be
re-established based on the ROW of the side street. For the purposes of this
section frontage on a service alley will be treated the same as an internal
property line and therefore would not require a street wall step- back, or;
c.   Throughout the CBD, a building that provides a setback along the frontage
line to create a plaza or courtyard area (minimum depth ten feet), will not be
required to establish a street wall. This setback area must exceed two-thirds
of the building width along the frontage line; or
d.   For areas outside the Traditional Downtown Core where the ROW area is
greater than 75 feet, a building is not required to provide a street wall step-
back or side step-back. Buildings in these situations will be required to meet
other design and operational standards as applicable; or
e.   Throughout the CBD, a variance may be sought as set forth in section
7-5-9.1 from the step-back requirements by meeting design guidelines that
specify a clear visual demarcation provided between the base of the building
and upper floors corresponding to the height of the street wall. The requested
variance shall not result in conflict with building code requirements; or
f.   Throughout the CBD, buildings determined to be signature buildings or
proposed for landmark locations may seek a variance as set forth in section
7-5-9.1 from street wall and step-back requirements when they meet design
guidelines specific to landmarks. See the Public View Corridors map for
recommended landmark locations.
g.   When an existing one-story building that is a contributing structure in
the downtown national register district will be incorporated into a development
proposal that may include a single or multi-story addition, it will be deemed
to satisfy the requirement or that portion of the requirement for the
streetwall.

(2.)   Step-back requirement: In order to enhance the traditional scale of
downtown and ensure adequate air and light at the sidewalk level and
neighboring properties a step-back at the street wall height is required
according to the following standards. In no case shall the required step-back
(s) decrease the buildable area by more than ten percent:
a.   At the street wall height a minimum ten-foot-wide step-back is observed
along at least two-thirds of the length of the street-side façade (the
remaining one- third may be provided at up to two hundred percent (2 x) of the
street wall height); or
b.   A side step-back may be provided as an alternative according to the
following requirements as applicable.
1.   At the street wall height, a 40-foot-wide step-back is provided along the
side of the proposed structure. This 40-foot-wide step-back may be split
between two sides (such as 20 feet each side);
2.   Buildings taller than 75 feet shall provide a side step-back that equals
one-half of the width of the façade above 75 feet*.
* The step-back amount may be split between two sides.
* See street wall height description to determine the height of the
corresponding street wall.

(3.)   Design organization: Buildings shall demonstrate a building design
organization on each façade such as but not limited to a base-middle-cap
organization, vertical articulation or other organizing principle.
Building caps: Downtown Asheville has a wealth of buildings with distinctive
caps that use special forms and materials. The unique diversity of building
caps has become a defining feature of the downtown skyline. In order to frame
views and provide attractive landmarks that enhance the skyline of the downtown
area, building caps are required. See the design guidelines regarding building
caps for recommendations in addition to the following requirements:
a.   Provide a cap to enhance a base-middle-cap oriented design; or
b.   Provide a cornice or other decorative band for flat roofs to serve as a
cap.
(4.)   Pedestrian entrances: All buildings shall have their primary pedestrian
entrance on a frontage line. If the site is located on a key pedestrian street
then the primary pedestrian entrance shall be located along that street. See
the Asheville Downtown Design Guidelines for additional recommendations.
(5.)   Windows, doors and other openings. Building fenestration is required
because it enhances the character of downtown Asheville by providing features
of visual interest at the sidewalk for the benefit of pedestrians, by defining
the scale of buildings between the ground floor and upper floors and by
improving the skyline vista of Asheville. The following requirements apply:
a.   For buildings along streets designated as key pedestrian streets (see map
at the end of this section), at least 70 percent of the street-level façade is
composed of windows, doors and other openings.
b.   For buildings along streets that are not designated as key pedestrian
streets, at least 50 percent of the street-level façade is composed of windows,
doors and other openings.
c.   Residential buildings shall provide at least 30 percent (40 percent for
live/work units) windows, doors or other openings along the street-level façade
unless located along a key pedestrian street where it will be required to meet
the 70 percent standard noted above.
d.   All buildings are required to provide a minimum of 20 percent of the upper
story areas as windows, doors or other openings with each face calculated
independently. This requirement applies to exposed building sides unless
otherwise restricted by the NC State Building Code.
e.   At street-level, areas of opaque wall may extend no more than 20 feet
horizontally before beginning a window, door or other opening.
f.   Glass may be tinted but shall not be reflective.
g.   When the façade of a building follows the natural grade of a sloping site,
windows and other openings which may start out at pedestrian-level quickly go
overhead and no longer relate to the sidewalk; in these situations where the
surface level of the floor reaches six feet or more above the sidewalk, that
floor will be deemed to no longer be at the pedestrian level. Requirements for
windows, doors or other openings will be reassessed for the remaining ground
level façade length.
b.   The following requirements apply to buildings taller than 75 feet for
additional floors extending above this point:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/4317f255d3be89fb2864b8c9033ec06d02a5daf4/
IMAGES/0-0-0-82.png]
(1.)   Floor plate limited:
a.   For parcels 20,000 square feet and larger, the gross floor plate area is
limited to 40 percent of the lot area;
b.   For parcels smaller than 20,000 square feet, gross floor plate area may
not exceed 8,000 square feet.
c.   For parcels greater than 16,000 square feet, the agency or official
responsible for project review may consider floor plates up to 50 percent if it
is surrounded by substantial permanent public or private open space that allows
for views and access to direct sunlight.
(2.)   Maximum dimension defined: The maximum horizontal wall dimension in any
direction is limited to 145 feet for additional floors above the 75 feet.
(3.)   External vista points: Photomontages modeling the proposed building are
required from each of the established external vista points as a tool to
evaluate development proposals:
Merrimon Avenue at Gracelyn Street
College Street at the west side of the tunnel
Stephens-Lee Recreation Center
Biltmore Avenue at Short Coxe Avenue
I-240 at the Smokey Park Bridge
Town Mountain Road at the bridge over I-240
(4.)   Public view corridors: If a project lies within a public view corridor
based on the map following this section a photomontage from the internal vista
point is required and where possible, building mass should be oriented to
preserve views and roof forms should help to frame views.
c.   Additional site related standards for all projects: Street furnishings:
Street furnishings placed in the public right-of-way shall be approved by the
department of public works and will include but not be limited to benches, tree
grates, lighting fixtures and waste receptacles.
Mechanical equipment and appurtenances necessary for the function of the
building shall be enclosed and screened or otherwise designed to be integral
with the overall building design, including but not limited to elevators,
stairs, cooling towers and vent stacks.
The design of the base of a building, as well as the quality and durability of
its materials, shall be emphasized at the first floor of structures. Exterior
insulation and finish systems (EIFS) are prohibited as a base material.
Private dumpsters and freestanding service equipment shall be screened by solid
partitions or other screening.
Development on key pedestrian streets shall meet the following requirements:
For new construction along key pedestrian streets, buildings are required to be
constructed along a minimum of 80 percent of the frontage line of the lot. This
standard is not intended to restrict site access especially for smaller lots.
Access is covered under access standards above. On corner lots the 80 percent
frontage requirement applies to the primary street.
(14)   Downtown design review guidelines. All construction work requiring
building, sign, demolition, and zoning permits and projects requesting a
variance, within the downtown boundaries designated by the Asheville City
Council, shall be submitted for mandatory review, voluntary compliance with the
adopted Downtown Asheville Design Review Guidelines, with the exception of
locally designated historic landmarks which shall be reviewed by the Historic
Resources Commission of Asheville and Buncombe County in accordance with the
applicable review procedures of the historic resources commission.
(15)   Emergency wireless communications. Communication requirements shall be
provided as required by section
7-11-9 of this chapter.

Sec. 7-8-19. River District.
(a)   Purpose. River District is hereby created to celebrate, conserve,
promote, and manage those areas on both sides of the French Broad and Swannanoa
Rivers within the corporate limits and those areas of extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the City of Asheville, North Carolina. These zoning standards
will ensure that new development is compatible with and enhances the unique
river resources as called for in Asheville's Comprehensive Plan and addenda. It
is the intent of these standards to promote economic revitalization throughout
the river valleys while providing for an opportunity for enjoyment of the river
by a maximum number of citizens, neighbors, and guests. The Riverfront Plan,
the Riverfront Open Space Guidelines, and the River District Design Review
Guidelines are companion documents to these regulations.
The goals of the River District are to:
(1)   Promote the protection and improvement of the French Broad and Swannanoa
Rivers as water resources;
(2)   Allow a mixture of river oriented land uses (residential, recreational,
office/institutional, commercial, manufacturing, industrial, open space, and
agricultural) to develop and prosper together through the establishment of
specific development standards;
(3)   Promote responsible development that will result minimal stormwater
runoff, soil erosion, river bank destabilization, grading, and flood damage;
(4)   Promote the preservation of a vegetative river resource corridor between
the top of the river bank and new development to protect property from flooding
and to enhance water quality;
(5)   Encourage the planting of specific riparian landscaping that will aid in
controlling erosion, improving water quality, reducing stormwater runoff,
enhancing fish and wildlife habitats, and protecting visual quality;
(6)   Promote the protection of existing natural areas, wetlands, and habitats,
especially bluffs along the rivers;
(7)   Encourage the establishment of vegetative buffer yards between
incompatible land uses to lessen negative impacts;
(8)   Encourage the conservation, protection, and promotion of the district's
natural, cultural, and historic resources to enhance its value as a significant
amenity to Asheville's citizens, neighbors, and tourists;
(9)   Encourage the creation of identifiable neighborhoods within the district
through preferred land uses and the enhancement of their historical
significance through coordinated physical amenities;
(10)   Promote improvements to existing infrastructure and the coordination of
all new utility improvements;
(11)   Promote the rivers as a gateway to the city by encouraging the
improvement of physical connections to Downtown, West Asheville, Biltmore
Village, U.N.C.-A., A. B. Technical Community College, Warren Wilson College,
Blue Ridge Parkway, and the N.C. Arboretum and encourage the provision of
controlled public access directly to the water; and
(12)   Encourage the development of different uses on different floors of
multiple story buildings.
The development of a pedestrian trail/greenway along the rivers is encouraged
within the River District. Land owners are encouraged to dedicate/grant a dry
land right-of-way or easement within the river resource yard. The public
pedestrian trail/greenway along the rivers would be a part of the proposed
greenway system for the City of Asheville as designated in the Greenway Master
Plan.
Land owners are additionally encouraged to dedicate or grant a dry-land right-
of-way or easement for use and maintenance by the Asheville Fire Department as
a river emergency/rescue point.
(b)   Allowable land uses. All permitted uses, special uses, conditional uses
and uses expressly prohibited are identified in subsection
7-8-1(d), Table of Permitted Uses. Standards for special uses and conditional
uses can be found in article XVI of this chapter.

depth, with a maximum depth of 50 feet and a minimum depth of 20 feet shall be
required of those properties abutting the French Broad River and Swannanoa
River banks for all new development on these lots. This river resource yard is
to be measured from the top of the banks of the rivers at the time of site plan
approval. Existing continuous tree stands should be preserved to stabilize the
river banks. Selective pruning or removal of diseased trees and shrubs in the
river resource yard is permissible, provided that a live room system stays
intact to provide for bank stabilization, erosion control, and improved water
quality. Dead and diseased vegetation may be removed. Walkways, trails, river
access areas, and similar activities may occur within the River Resource Yard.

Sec. 7-8-23. Urban Village District.
(a)   Purpose. The Urban Village District is established to create mixed use
development that is economically vital, pedestrian-oriented and contributes to
the place-making character of the built environment. The Urban Village District
offers the unique opportunity to provide quality and long lasting retail,
office and residential uses in an organized layout that encourages the full
range of access by patrons and users, and offers innovative high quality design
of structures, public amenities and pedestrian facilities. The development and
design standards set forth in this district intend to accomplish the following
purposes:
(1)   Provide safe and convenient access to shopping and other essential
services to:
Pedestrians,
Bicyclists,
Transit riders, and
Persons with disabilities.
(2)   Effective traffic flow through:
Access management, and
Improved internal and external connectivity.
(3)   Create a built environment that serves to:
Enhance gateway corridors,
Preserve historic heritage,
Promote economic development and an improved tax base for the city, and
Celebrate Asheville's distinction from other cities.
(4)   Promote sustainable use of limited land and investment resources by:
Encouraging higher building densities,
Allowing efficient shared parking areas, making cost effective use of existing
infra-structure,
Showcasing innovative high quality development,
Providing adaptive re-use of under-performing retail properties,
Ensuring multi-modal transportation access,
Insuring internal and external connectedness,
Developing a durable framework of infrastructure and built structures that can
accommodate future renovations,
Upgrades and rehabilitation, and
Reestablishing the public realm, civic pride, and sense of community ownership
in new developments.
(b)   Allowable land uses. All permitted uses, special uses, conditional uses
and uses expressly prohibited are identified in subsection
7-8-1(d), Table of Permitted Uses. Standards for special uses and conditional
uses can be found in article XVI of this chapter.
(c)   Reserved.
(d)   Reserved.
(e)   Reserved.
(f)   Development standards.
(1)   Master plan required.
a.   Unless initiated by the city pursuant to its zoning authority, Urban
Village District projects are required to submit a master plan with the zoning
application for the entire parcel that indicates the general street network,
the land use configuration within that network, the ultimate proposed
development intensity (including the number of residential units and gross
square footage of all nonresidential uses), and the proposed structure heights
for the Urban Village. For initiation of this zoning classification, properties
may fall under more than one ownership so long as there exist covenants or
other legally binding agreements that address cross-access, cross- parking and
other similar issues affecting joint operation of the projects.
b.   After the establishment of the Urban Village District zoning, regardless
of scale, Urban Village District development projects shall be approved under
the Level II site plan review process. Multi- phase projects must submit
drawings and elevations along with the approved master plan at the time of
Level II review. A traffic impact analysis will be required for all Urban
Village projects and shall be submitted with the Level II application. Projects
for the Urban Village District shall be reviewed for compliance with the
standards set forth in the ordinance.
c.   Revisions to approved Urban Village District master plans may be approved
by the city council or by the planning and development director depending on
the type of revisions being requested. City council shall review any revisions
to a master plan that increases the overall development intensity, changes the
proposed mix of uses by increasing or reducing any use category by 25 percent
or more, or increases the maximum building height from that shown on the
approved master plan. Additionally, city council shall review any revision to a
master plan that results in a decrease in the amount of perimeter open space or
perimeter parking lot buffering, or in a 25 percent or greater reduction in the
number of proposed blocks from that shown on the approved master plan. For the
purpose of determining overall development intensity, one residential unit
shall be regarded as the equivalent of 500 square feet of office floor area;
one residential unit shall be regarded as the equivalent of 200 square feet of
commercial floor area; and 1,000 square feet of office space shall be regarded
as the equivalent of 350 square feet of commercial floor area. For other uses,
the planning and development director shall determine the equivalency factor
using quantifiable information such as automobile trip generation data. In
reviewing master plan revisions, the city council shall follow the same public
hearing process used to approve the initial master plan; at its discretion, the
city council may refer the proposed revisions to the planning and zoning
commission for their recommendation. The planning and development director is
authorized to review and approve all other revisions to master plans. In
approving revisions to a master plan, the planning and development director
shall analyze the revisions in terms of compliance with the specific
requirements of the Urban Village Zoning District, the general development
pattern approved by city council, and the overall development concept,
including the mix of uses, of the initial approved masRer plan. In the event
the planning and development director denies the proposed revisions, the
property owner may request that the city council review the revisions following
the same public hearing process as provided above.
(2)   Density standards. Maximum residential density shall not be limited,
except by other standards such as building height, parking, landscaping and
buffering, open space, and traffic impact analysis.
(3)   Structure size standards. The structure size shall not be limited except
by other standards such as building height, parking, landscaping and buffering,
open space, and traffic impact analysis.
(4)   Area standards. The minimum area required to establish an Urban Village
District shall be five acres.
(5)   Lot size standards. There is no minimum lot size in an Urban Village
District.
(6)   Street design standards. Internal streets in the Urban Village District
shall be designed using the Asheville Standards And Specifications Manual (or
as approved by the city engineer) but shall contain: pedestrian zone area,
travel lane area, center medians if any, on-street parking. The sight
visibility triangle requirement noted in article XI may be modified at the
review of the city engineer.
(7)   Lot width standards. None
(8)   Setbacks.
Minimum setback: Zero feet from the right-of-way.
Maximum setback: 15 feet from the street as measured from back of curb, except
as follows:
a.   Arcades and awnings may encroach into the setback area.
b.   Mixed use office/retail structures may be setback from the back of curb up
to 25 feet if at least ten feet in front of the structure includes an arcade,
forecourt, dooryard, or courtyard offering public amenities.
c.   Institutional and public uses may be setback a maximum of 75 feet as
measured from back of curb for projects that incorporate a courtyard or green.
Courtyard and green areas may include landscape portions but shall also include
hardscape paving elements for public meeting or gathering. The main façade of
institutional and public use structures must face this setback area.
d.   Single-family residential structures may be setback up to 25 feet from
back of curb and may include a dooryard, courtyard, porch and fence.
e.   Multifamily residential structure setback areas may include a courtyard up
to 25 feet deep. The courtyard may not be wider than one-third of the building
length unless approved by the director of planning and development.
f.   Variations in setback requirements may be granted by the city council to
address issues of context, including but not limited to alignment of buildings
in the same blockface, street classification on the thoroughfare plan, and
proposed or existing public greens, pedestrian zones and courtyards.
g.   Buildings may be set back up to 40 feet from back of curb for topographic
reasons subject to the following requirements:
· A pedestrian zone and sidewalk is provided at the back of the curb meeting UV
standards and may include street trees and other streetscape enhancements;
· The top of the retaining wall (excluding handrails, etc.) does not exceed
five feet above (or below depending on the specific topographic grade) the
sidewalk level;
· The area above (or below depending on the specific topographic grade) the
retaining wall and adjacent to the building includes uses to encourage a lively
pedestrian space and shall be considered an active pedestrian level;
· Building frontages facing this active pedestrian level shall meet
fenestration requirements as described in the ordinance.
· No more than 50 percent of the length of the façade of the building is
separated from the main sidewalk level with the use of a retaining wall. The
remaining 50 percent of the street frontage must:
1.   Have upper and lower sidewalks join at the same grade as a single
sidewalk, or
2.   Connect the upper and lower sidewalks through no more than five steps or a
ramp at no more than a one to 12 slope. The steps described in this scenario
are the steps running parallel to the face of the building connecting to the
sidewalk area.
(9)   Impervious surface standards. None.
(10)   Height standards.
a.   Minimum height: 15 feet. Maximum height: 100 feet. It is the intent of
this section that the predominant height of structures in Urban Village
Districts be between two and six stories in height. In applying this provision,
single story structures shall not exceed 50 percent of the total gross building
footprint of structures included in the master plan. Any structure taller than
four stories shall be designed with a cornice at the fourth story level, with
those portions of the structure taller than four stories being set back at a
minimum of ten feet from the cornice level. Any structure taller than six
stories shall be located internally to the site unless the surrounding context
supports such height.
b.   As part of its approval of the master plan, increases in maximum height of
a structure may be allowed by the city council not to exceed 150 feet, based on
such factors as topography, relationship to other structures in the area, and
compliance with applicable design guidelines. For structures exceeding 100 feet
in height, the minimum cornice level setback shall be 20 feet or a second
cornice level with a minimum setback of 10 feet shall be established at a point
between floors five through eight.
(11)   Design and operational standards.
a.   Orientation. Buildings shall be oriented towards their primary access
street. On corner lots, the building must be located at the corner. Single-
family residential units located on a corner are exempt from this requirement.
Building sides should appear similar to their fronts.
b.   Entrances. All buildings should include well-defined entrances facing the
street at regular intervals. An operable entrance on each primary façade should
be provided to encourage access by pedestrians. Buildings on corner lots may
place the entrance at the corner eliminating the need for side entrances.
c.   Windows, doors and other openings. The first floor of all new structures
in the Urban Village District shall be designed in a way that a minimum of 45
percent of the length of the first floor street frontage incorporates either
windows, doors and other openings to complement pedestrian scale activity.
Structures shall have windows evenly distributed across the façade. Upper story
windows, doors and other openings shall make up at least 30 percent of the wall
surface. Residential-only buildings that are identified on the approved
masterplan may reduce the openings along the ground floor street facing façade
to 30 percent. All storefront windows shall be transparent or lightly tinted
and shall not appear false or applied. Windows are also required along the
sides of structures that are visible from roadways or have parking adjacent to
them. Exceptions to these standards may be made by the city council in order to
achieve compliance with LEED or NC building energy code standards, to
accommodate public art or to allow alternative fenestration approaches provided
the intent of this section is met by the building exhibiting a primary focus on
pedestrian interest.
d.   Variances. Requests for variances of the design and operational standards
set forth in this subsection may be granted by the planning and zoning
commission, which is hereby designated to perform the duties of a board
adjustment for this purpose.
(12)   Internal access and connectivity. The site shall be traversed by a
network of internal streets built according to the Asheville Standards and
Specifications Manual (or as approved by the city engineer). Internal streets
should seek to avoid cul-de-sacs and dead end roads and other features that
hamper connectivity. However, roads may terminate at a monumental structure or
a green. In such cases, a sidewalk or other connection must be provided to
ensure the goals of connectivity. In addition, internal streets are also
required to have sidewalks and street trees. A bus shelter is required for
Urban Village Districts. Larger projects may require more shelters as
determined by the Traffic Impact Analysis and or by the transit director.
Connectivity is a goal of the internal street system and external connections
to areas outside and adjacent to the Urban Village should be created where
possible and appropriate. Blocks are required throughout the site to provide
access to different village areas and to encourage multi-modal transportation
options. Only one driveway per block face shall be allowed for blocks shorter
than 350 feet; up to two driveways may be allowed in blocks 350 feet or longer
provided measures are taken to maintain pedestrian interest and safety. Single-
family (including townhome) and duplex uses are exempt from this driveway
restriction. Parking and loading access from service alleys for all uses,
however, is encouraged, and such alleys, when approved as part of the street
network of the master plan, shall be exempt from the requirements of this
section.
(13)   Block length. Block length may vary but shall not exceed 500 feet in
length. For blocks on local streets that are 350 feet or longer, a mid-block
pedestrian street crossing is required which may also include a parking lot
driveway and/or pedestrian passageway between two or more buildings, and shall
have curb extensions (bulbouts) for ease and safety of pedestrian street
crossing (per the Asheville Standards and Specifications Manual). Collector
streets may also require mid-block pedestrian crossings as noted above.
Variations in block length and pedestrian crossing requirements may be approved
by the city engineer provided the intent of this section is met.
(14)   Pedestrian zone and sidewalks. The pedestrian zone is the area between
the street curb and the building edge or for access roads, the street curb and
the ROW area. The pedestrian zone includes sidewalks, street trees and other
pedestrian amenities. The pedestrian zone will generally be 15 feet wide along
primary streets in the Urban Village District but may be wider depending on the
setback pattern. On secondary streets, the city engineer may accept a 12-foot
wide pedestrian zone after evaluation of traffic and circulation patterns.
Sidewalks in Urban Village Districts shall be required along one side of access
streets and both sides of internal streets throughout the development. If
appropriate to the design of the Urban Village, greenway paths may be
substituted for sidewalks in residential areas to provide connections. The
sidewalk shall be a minimum of seven feet wide in the Urban Village District.
In solely residential areas containing less than eight units per acre,
sidewalks are only required to be five feet wide. With institutional and public
uses that have an increased setback, a sidewalk shall connect the building
façade entrance with the street. The sidewalk may be as wide as the entire
pedestrian area. Arcades, awnings, outdoor dining, shelters, seating areas,
fountains, street trees, additional landscaped areas and other pedestrian
amenities may be a part of this pedestrian area so long as seven feet of clear
walking space is maintained. The pedestrian area may also be used to create an
area for waiting, pick up and drop off. At locations such as intersections and
other crosswalks, curb extensions (bulb-outs) are required to create safer
pedestrian crossings. No fee in lieu of construction of sidewalks will be
accepted in urban village districts.
(15)   Parking/loading standards. Parking facilities shall be provided as per
the parking, loading and access standards, article 11 of this code with the
exceptions noted below:
a.   Amount of parking. Parking spaces in the Urban Village District shall be
reviewed at the master plan level. The maximum number of spaces allowed in
Urban Villages shall be the minimum required in the parking section in article
11 since this district can take advantage of shared parking opportunities.
Parking spaces in parking structures shall be exempt from parking space
calculations.
b.   On-street parking. On-street parking is required for all local streets and
for collector streets as approved by the city engineer. On-street parking may
take the form of parallel or angle parking and shall be built according to the
Asheville Standards and Specifications Manual. On-street parking shall be
counted when calculating the maximum number of spaces allowed.
c.   Off-street parking. Uses in the Urban Village District are not required to
provide off-street parking. Off street parking lots are encouraged to be
provided at the side or rear of buildings or the interior of a block of
buildings and not closer to the street than the edge profile of the structures.
No more than 20 percent of parking that is provided in the Urban Village
District shall be in the form of off-street surface lots not located to the
side or rear of buildings. Off-street parking shall not be adjacent to street
intersections. No parking is permitted in any setback area. No more than 50
percent of the parking spaces provided may be in the form of off-street surface
parking, with other parking to be accommodated in on-street or structured
parking. Phased development may exceed the allowable amount of surface parking
for time frames determined in master plan approval provided that full
development of all phases meets the above requirements.
d.   Bicycle parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided as per article 11
except that the five percent calculation of total parking spaces will include
on-street and off-street spaces provided in the master plan. Bicycle parking
shall be distributed throughout the project use area.
e.   Loading standards. Urban Village Districts may share on-street and off-
street loading facilities and are therefore allowed to provide these facilities
at half the rate listed for the applicable uses. On- street loading spaces may
be counted toward the project loading requirements.
(16)   Street trees. Street trees are required in the pedestrian zone and along
access roads at an average rate of one tree every 40 feet and shall be selected
from the City of Asheville recommended tree species list for durable large
maturing trees. Trees may be planted in minimum of five foot by five-foot
square pits close to the curb edge of the sidewalk. Tree frames and grates are
not required but are recommended especially near store entrances, other
sidewalk constraints, points of ingress or egress, or public gathering areas.
If tree grates are not used, an organic surfacing material shall be used to
level the surface of the tree pit with the sidewalk. This material shall
receive regular maintenance. To offer flexibility in the tree planting
requirements, trees may be planted in planting strips adjacent to the curb edge
of the sidewalk. Planting strips shall be no narrower than five feet wide.
Planting strips may include grass, flowers and other plant materials where
appropriate. Planting strips may not be appropriate in pedestrian gathering
areas.
(17)   Landscape/buffering standards. Landscaping and buffering shall be in
accordance with article 11 [of the UDO] of the code with exceptions as noted
below. Surface parking lots shall include interior and perimeter tree plantings
made up of deciduous trees at a rate of one tree for every 1,500 square feet of
parking and shall be selected from the City of Asheville Recommended Species
Tree List for durable large sized trees. No parking space may be farther than
45 feet from a tree. Parking areas adjacent to roadways will require buffering
from the street as noted in article 11 [of the UDO] with the exception that the
buffer planting area shall be a minimum of eight feet wide. Residential
structures within the Urban Village may have up to a 100 percent reduction in
buffering requirements from the rest of the Urban Village. Buffering for Urban
Village District projects is measured and reviewed from the parcel lot lines
used to establish the district and not on an internal lot-by-lot basis. The
Urban Village development projects shall be considered a high impact use based
on the existing adjacent land use table in article 11 [of the UDO]; however,
required buffering of neighboring uses may be reduced by the director of
planning and development depending on the compatibility of the design of the

of the front of any building facade must be located, measured as a minimum and
maximum setback range from the edge of the right-of-way that may be a private
or public street. In cases where required streetscape elements are installed on
private property the building setbacks shall be measured from the back of the
streetscape elements.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/4317f255d3be89fb2864b8c9033ec06d02a5daf4/
IMAGES/0-0-0-114.png]
The required percentage specifies the amount of the front building facade that
must be located in the BTZ, measured based on the width of the building divided
by the width of the lot. Driveways and open spaces. Permitted driveways and
open spaces may be removed from the BTZ calculations. Open spaces within the
BTZ shall measure at least 60 feet deep and 25 feet wide.
b.   The BTZ applies up to the minimum required building height.
2.   Corner lots. On a corner lot, a building facade must be placed within the

BTZ shall be applied.
4.   Uses allowed. With the exception of parking spaces and outdoor storage,
all structures and uses (including outdoor dining) allowed on the lot are
allowed in the BTZ.
5.   Driveways. In no case will driveway access to a lot be denied because of
the build-to requirement.
G.   Nonconforming build-to zone.
1.   Additions. Expansion of an existing building which is unable to meet the
build-to requirement, must comply with the following nonconforming provisions:
a.   Front: Addition. Any addition to the front that exceed 50 percent of the
existing footprint must be placed in the BTZ; however, the addition does not
have to meet the build-to percentage for the lot. A front addition is not
allowed on a contributing structure in a National Register Historic District or
a structure that is eligible for historic designation (although a variance may
be granted where a hardship exists, including but not limited to a conflict
with the NC Building Code or specific purposes for the addition that make a
front location the most technically, not financially feasible option).

activity connects housing to jobs.
2.   Height. Building height is limited to four stories. Additional stories are
allowed for the provision of affordable units, to not exceed six stories.
3.   Front setbacks. Ground floor facades are located within a reasonable
distance to the street to encourage pedestrian activity while allowing design
flexibility.
4.   Use. A broad range of commercial and residential uses are allowed.
However, to encourage maximum levels of pedestrian activity and accessibility.
B.   Block and lot criteria.

A.   Allowable land uses.
1.   All permitted uses, special uses, conditional uses and uses expressly
prohibited are identified in subsection

uses can be found in article XVI of this chapter. The following are exceptions
to subsection
7-8-1(d):
a.   Public, Recreational, Commercial, or Industrial uses shall make up at
least ten percent of the total project gross square footage.
b.   Gasoline sales.
i.   Gasoline pumps in Urban Place Form Districts shall not be located between
any street and the principal structures, and shall be designed to be
subordinate to the primary uses of the site.
c.   Drive-through facilities or uses.
i.   Drive through facilities shall be limited to one drive through lane.
ii.   Any part of drive through facilities (i.e. drive through lanes, stacking,
ordering stations, pick-up windows, etc.) shall not be located between a street
and the principal structures, and shall be designed to be subordinate to the
primary uses of the site.
d.   Commercial/Business Uses. On parcels larger than five acres, the maximum
limit for Commercial/Business Uses shall be 20,000 square feet unless the

units shall accept Rental Assistance like Housing Choice Vouchers.
iii.   Small individual commercial spaces measuring 1,000 square feet or less

level view from adjacent property or adjacent public right-of-way (not
including an alley). In addition, any ground story facade treatment (building
materials, windows, and architectural detailing) must be continued on upper
stories.
4.   Parking structure entries must not exceed 16 feet clear height and 24 feet
clear width and be spaced at least 150 feet apart.

façade(s) with a minimum depth of 20 feet.
4.0. Site development.
4.1.   Streets and connectivity.
A.   Master planned large sites.
1.   Sites over two acres in size shall propose a master plan for the entire
parcel that will be presented at the required pre-application meeting and that
will be reviewed by staff and submitted with the zoning application.
2.   The master plan shall indicate the general street network and rights-of-
way, the land use configuration within that network, the proposed development
intensity (including the number of residential units and gross square footage
of all nonresidential uses), and the proposed structure heights.
3.   The master plan may include properties that fall under more than one
ownership so long as there exist covenants or other legally binding agreements
that address cross-access, cross parking and other similar issues affecting
joint operation of the projects.
4.   After approval of the master plan, regardless of scale, Urban Place Form
District development projects shall be reviewed under applicable development
review procedures as outlines in Article V of the UDO.

extended into the development on their proper projection.
b.   Additional new streets shall strive to meet the ideal block length of 200
feet, and shall comply with the city's standards and specifications for
streets.
c.   New street stubs to adjacent commercial properties are required where the
difference in grade is less than 15 percent.
d.   Existing connections to nearby properties shall be maintained for cross
access and shall not be closed unless improved connections are provided.
2.   Streets shall avoid cul-de-sacs and dead end roads and other features that
hamper current or future connectivity, unless there is no possible alternative.
3.   Streets may terminate at a monumental structure or a public open space
such as a park or a plaza. In such cases, a sidewalk or other connection must
be provided to ensure network connectivity.
4.   Proposed streets may not exceed the maximum block length and (if
applicable) maximum block perimeter.
C.   Pedestrian zones.

1.0.   General provisions.
1.1.   Purpose. The purpose of the Haywood Road Form District is to implement
the Haywood Road Corridor Charrette Report and the Haywood Road Vision Plan.
1.2.   Intent. It is the intent of this Haywood Road Form District to:
1.   Where feasible, preserve and enhance existing buildings and structures
along the corridor.
2.   Ensure a high quality of development for new construction;
3.   Reduce the bulk and mass of buildings;
4.   Ensure adequate distribution of height and mass throughout the corridor,
with larger buildings located closer to Patton Avenue;
5.   Allow for a mix of uses at a variety of scales;
6.   Promote additional housing types and housing opportunities;
7.   Make the corridor more walkable and pedestrian-friendly;
8.   Implement the complete streets model by enhancing multi-modal
transportation options, including transit, bicycle and pedestrian connections;
9.   Calm traffic and improve vehicular circulation;
10.   Support existing businesses; and
11.   Ensure adequate transitions from the corridor to adjacent residential
neighborhoods.
1.3.   Applicability.
   A.   Territorial application. The Haywood Road Form District applies to all
property located within the Haywood Road Corridor, as shown in subsection 2.1.
   B.   Application of chapter 7, Development.
1.   The following requirements of chapter 7 do not apply in the Haywood Road
Form District, unless expressly stated otherwise:
   a.   Section
7-10-2. Required setbacks; allowable encroachments into required setbacks.
   b.   Section
7-11-4. Open space standards.
   c.   Section
7-11-6. Traffic impact analysis.
   d.   Reserved.
   e.   Subsection
7-11-2c. Off- street parking requirements.
   f.   Subsections
7-13-4b and c. On-premises signs and single and multi-tenant signs.
   g.   When pertaining only to establishing a new eating and drinking
establishment, microbrewery, or nightclub, the Land use impact columns of the
Table of Permitted Uses (section
7-8-1(d)) for comparing land uses will not apply and parking will always be
required for the new use following the provisions in the Haywood Road Form
Based code.
2.   The use of buildings and land within the Haywood Road Form District is
subject to all other regulations as well as the Haywood Road Form District,
whether or not such other provisions are specifically referenced in the Haywood
Road Form District. References to other regulations or provisions of the
Haywood Road Form District are for the convenience of the reader. The lack of a
cross-reference does not exempt a land, building, structure or use from other
regulations.
3.   It will be unlikely that a single developer will be able to implement the
street cross section details found within each district pertaining to road
width, bike lanes and streetscape details for the corridor without more control
of the roadway by the City of Asheville. Minimal sidewalk and street tree
requirements will be reviewed for compliance as a part of project submittals.
4.   Overhead power lines along the corridor may not permit a building within
close proximity to an easement area associated with the lines; if subject to
these imposed restrictions which may overlap the property line, buildings may
measure their setback(s) from the line of the easement and not the edge of the
right-of-way.

street right-of- way line.
b.   On corner lots, the side street setback is measured at a right angle from
the side street right-of-way line.
c.   The rear setback is measured at a right angle from the rear property line
or the rear right-of-way or easement line where there is an alley. The rear
property line is the property line opposite to the primary street property
line.
d.   All lot lines which are not primary street, side street or rear lot lines
are considered side interior lot lines for the purpose of measuring setbacks.
Side interior setbacks are measured at a right angle from the side property
line.
3.   Primary street designation.
a.   Where only one street abuts a lot, that street is considered a primary
street.
b.   Where more than one street abuts a lot, Haywood Road or Patton Avenue are

E.   Build-to zone (BTZ).
1.   Defined.
a.   The build-to zone (BTZ) is the area on the lot where a certain percent-
age of the front building facade must be located, measured as a minirnum and
maximum setback range from the edge of the right-of-way. In cases where
required streetscape elemnents are installed on private property the building
setbacks shall be measured from the back of the streetscape elements.
b.   The required percentage specifies the amount of the front building facade
that must be located in the build-to zone, measured based on the width of the
building divided by the width of the lot. In cases where driveway access is
needed, the driveway width may be removed from the BTZ calculations.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2092.png]
3.   Uses allowed. With the exception of parking spaces and outdoor storage,
all structures and uses (including outdoor dining) allowed on the lot are
allowed in the build-to zone.
F.   Nonconforming build-to zone.
1.   Additions. Expansion of an existing building which is unable to meet the
build-to requirement must comply with the following nonconforming provisions:
a.   Front: Addition. Any addition to the front that exceed 50 percent of the
existing footprint must be placed in the build-to zone; however, the addition
does not have to meet the build-to percentage for the lot. A front addition is
not allowed on a contributing structure in a National Register District or a
structure that is eligible for historic designation (although a variance may be
granted where a hardship exists, including but not limited to a conflict with
the Building Code or specific purposes for the addition that make a front
location the most technically (not financially) feasible option.

installation sidewalk and street trees as shown in subsection 2.3 through
subsection 2.6. Modified dimensions may be approved by the city traffic
engineer to account for existing street widths and building locations.
2.   The required sidewalk may be wholly or partially located on private
property, provided the sidewalk is located within an easement permanently
dedicated to the city.
3.   Where vehicular access is provided to a site, it must occur from a side
street and not from Haywood Road, unless this option is determined infeasible
by the city traffic engineer. For sites that must be accessed from Haywood
Road, no more than one driveway is allowed with a maximum width of 24 feet.

3.0.   Land use.
3.1.   Classification of uses. This section establishes the uses allowed. A lot
or building must be occupied with only the uses allowed in this section. Any
one or more allowed uses may be established on a lot, subject to the
requirements of this section, and in compliance with all applicable
requirements of this Haywood Road Form District.
A.   Principal uses.
1.   Allowed principal uses by sub-district are shown in the Table of Permitted
Uses in section
7-8-1(d).
2.   Any use not listed is not allowed unless the planning and development
director determines that the use is similar to a listed use. Prohibited uses
found in the Table of Uses in
7-8-1d of this chapter also apply to the Haywood Road Form District.
3.   When determining whether a proposed use is similar to a listed use, the
planning and development director will consider the following:
a.   The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use.
b.   The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to
the proposed use.
c.   Relative amounts of sales.
d.   The customer type.
e.   The relative number of employees.
f.   Hours of operation.
g.   Building and site arrangement.
h.   Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements.
i.   The number of vehicle trips generated.
j.   How the proposed use is advertised.
k.   The likely impact on surrounding properties.
l.   Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other
activities on the site.
4.   Where a use is determined not to be similar to any listed use, a text
amendment is required prior to establishment of that use.
B.   Accessory uses.
1.   Accessory uses and structures are permitted in conjunction with an allowed
principal use. Accessory uses and structures must be accessory and clearly and
customarily incidental and subordinate to a permitted principal use or
structure.
2.   No accessory use or structure may be established prior to the
establishment of a permitted principal use or structure.
3.   All accessory structures must meet the requirements of subsection 2.0.
4.   The planning and development director is authorized to determine when a
use or structure is accessory. In order to classify a use or structure as
accessory, the planning and development director must determine that the use or
structure:
a.   Is subordinate to the principal use in terms of area, extent and purpose;
b.   Contributes to the comfort, convenience or necessity of occupants of the
principal use or structure served;
c.   Is located on the same lot as the principal use or structure, or on a
contiguous lot in the same ownership;
d.   Does not involve operations not in keeping with the character of the
principal use or structure served; and
e.   Is not of a nature likely to attract visitors in larger numbers than would
normally be expected for the principal use or structure.
C.   Temporary uses.
1.   Temporary uses are allowed following provisions found in Article 14 of the
UDO.
3.2.   Permitted use table. See Table of Permitted Uses section
7-8-1(d) for a list of permitted uses in the Haywood Road Form District.
3.3.   Special standards.
A.   Drive-through facility.
1.   Adequate space must be made available on-site for the stacking, storage
and queuing of vehicles.
2.   Vehicles using drive-through facilities may not encroach on or interfere
with the public use of streets and sidewalks by vehicles or pedestrians.
3.   All drive-through areas, including but not limited to menu boards,
stacking lanes, trash receptacles, ordering box, drive up windows, and other
objects associated with the drive-through area, must be located to the side or
rear of the building. Drive-through windows and lanes may not be placed between
the street and the associated building.
4.   A restaurant with a drive- through must provide at least four queuing
spaces, measured from the first pick-up window.
5.   A bank or pharmacy with a drive-through must provide at least three
queuing spaces per drive-through lane, measured from the teller box or window.
6.   All other uses determined by the city traffic engineer.
B.   Live-work.
1.   In a mixed-use building containing live-work units, at a minhnum, the
ground floor primary street-facing fa,ade must be activated with permitted

the street. Additionally, proposed subdivisions within historic districts must
be reviewed by the HRC as part of the overall subdivision review process in
accordance with article XV of this chapter.
(f)   Authentic restoration and reconstruction.
(1)   Authentic restoration or reconstruction is permitted, subject to approval
of the HRC, even though the authentic restoration or reconstruction does not
meet with current setback and other requirements and standards of article VIII
of this chapter. Authentic restoration or reconstruction shall mean exact
replication of an historic structure to include, but not limited to siting,
scale, massing, and materials of structure. Where it is found by the HRC that
an application for a building permit covers activity consisting of an authentic
restoration or reconstruction in the same location as the original location and
in the original structural conformation for a structure of historic and/or
architectural significance to the historic district, such activity may be
approved by the HRC.
(2)   The board of adjustment hears requests for variances from the
requirements for setback and other standards established by article VIII of
this chapter.
a.   The board of adjustment, may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions
to the granting of such variances so that the public health, safety, and
general welfare shall be protected.
b.   The board of adjustment shall not be authorized, in action undertaken by
this subsection, to approve a use of property which is not permitted by right
within the zoning district in which the property is located.
(g)   Parking waiver. Where the HRC, in considering an application for a
certificate of appropriateness, shall find that the number of off-street
parking spaces required by zoning regulations for a building or structure for
which a building permit is requested would render the building incongruous with
the historic aspects of the historic district, it may recommend to the board of
adjustment that a variance be granted from the off-street parking requirements.
The board of adjustment may authorize a lesser number of off-street parking
spaces provided the board finds, in addition to the required findings for
granting a variance, as follows:
(1)   That the reduced number of spaces will not create problems due to
increased on-street parking; and
(2)   That the reduced number of spaces will not constitute a threat to the
public safety.
(h)   Certificate of appropriateness.
(1)   From and after the designation of a historic district, no exterior
portion of any building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences,
light fixtures, steps, pavement, landscape and color or other appurtenant
features), nor above ground utility structure, nor any type of outdoor
advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished
within such historic district until after an application for a certificate of
appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the HRC. Further, no
historic sign, significant landscape, archeological and natural features of the
area associated with such a structure or building shall be altered, moved, or
removed within such historic district until after an application for a
certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the HRC.
Further, no subdivision of land within a historic district shall be approved
until it has been reviewed and approved in accordance with the provisions of
section
7-5-8 of this chapter. This provision shall not apply to subdivisions which are
exempted pursuant to section
7-15-1 of this chapter.
No building permit granted for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving,
or demolishing structures within the historic districts shall be issued prior
to the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness by the HRC.
A certificate of appropriateness may be issued subject to reasonable conditions
to carry out the purposes of this section. A certificate of appropriateness
shall be required whether or not a building permit is required. Any building
permit or such other permit not issued in conformity with this section shall be
invalid.
For the purpose of this section, "exterior features" shall include the
architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior
building or other structure, including the kind, texture and color of the
building materials, the size and scale of the building, and the type, color and
style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and other appurtenant
fixtures and important landscape and natural features of the lot on which the
building or other structure is located. In the case of outdoor advertising
signs, "exterior features" shall be construed to mean the style, material,
size, and location of all such signs. Such "exterior features" also included
historic signs, significant landscape, archaeological, and natural features of
the area.
The HRC shall have no jurisdiction over interior arrangement and shall take no
action under this section except for the purpose of preventing the
construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving, or demolition of
buildings, structures, appurtenant fixtures, outdoor advertising signs, or
other significant features in the historic district which would be incongruous
with the special character of the historic district.
(2)   Permitted alterations and uses for historic buildings within historic
district. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in the historic
district which does not involve a substantial change in design, material, or
outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction, re-construction,
alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the chief
building inspector or his designee shall certify in writing to the HRC is
required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition.
(3)   Delay in demolition of buildings within historic district. An application
for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the relocation, demolition, or
destruction of a building or structure or the removal or obliteration of an
archeological resource within the historic district may not be denied except
for as set forth hereinafter. However, the effective date of such a certificate
may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the date of approval of the
certificate of appropriateness. The maximum period of delay authorized by this
subsection shall be reduced by the HRC where it finds that the owner would
suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or
return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period the HRC
may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a
means of preserving the building, structure of site. If the HRC finds that the
building, structure or site has no special significance or value toward
maintaining the character of the historic district, it shall waive all or part
of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.
If the HRC has voted to recommend designation of an area as a historic
district, and final designation has not been made by the city council, the
demolition or destruction of any building, structure, or site located in the
proposed historic district may be delayed by the HRC for a period of up to 180
days or until the city council takes final action on the designation, whichever
occurs first.
It shall constitute a violation of this chapter by the property owner where any
building or structure which is located within a historic district is subject to
demolition by neglect; provided, however, where the property owner can show
evidence of undue economic hardship satisfactory to the HRC, no violation shall
be deemed to have occurred.
An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition
or destruction of a building, structure, or site determined by the State
Historic Preservation officer, or his/her successor, as having statewide
significance as defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic
Places may be denied except where the HRC finds that the owner would suffer
extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return by
virtue of the denial.
The procedures for obtaining a certificate of appropriateness are set forth in
section
7-5-11 of this chapter.

impacts associated with lodging and related land use activities. The intent of
this overlay district is to establish standards to guide the size, location,
design, development and operational standards of future hotel development.
(b)   Permitted uses. In addition to the uses permitted in the underlying
zoning district, large and small hotels shall be permitted in the hotel overlay
district provided that hotels meet the design and operational standards set
forth in this subsection. Hotel uses are further limited to the following
subdistricts as follows:
Hotel Overlay District A - Large and small hotels
Hotel Overlay District B - Small hotels only
(c)   Designation of hotel district. The designation of properties as a hotel
overlay district shall be treated as a zoning map amendment with the
designation of these districts subject to the procedures and requirements set
forth in Article VII of this chapter. The boundaries of each hotel district
shall be identified on the Official Zoning Maps of the City of Asheville with
copies of these maps maintained in the Planning and Urban Design Department.
(d)   Scope of overlay districts and relationship to other regulations. The
hotel overlay district standards are applied in conjunction with the underlying
zoning district but may modify any portion of the standards of the underlying
zoning district. The provisions of the hotel overlay district may apply
additional requirements, or allow exceptions to general regulations. When there
is conflict between the hotel overlay district and the standards established by
the underlying zoning district or other regulations of this chapter, the hotel
overlay district standards shall control, unless located in the Central
Business District, Biltmore Village Historic District, or the River Arts Form
Code District, in which case the development requirements of these districts
shall control unless specifically indicated otherwise as in sections (g)(2)(a),
(g)(3)(a) and (c) below.
(e)   Adoption criteria. A Hotel Overlay District may be extended if all the
following criteria are met:
(1)   The future land use designation of the property proposed for the hotel
district includes hotels as a suitable land use;
(2)   Property is directly adjacent and contiguous to other Hotel Overlay
District areas.
(3)   Property is further than 100 feet from other residentially zoned
property.
(4)   Utility and transportation infrastructure is adequate to meet the needs
of the development without public investment; and
(5)   No publicly funded housing, services, or programming located adjacent to
the proposed hotel district are displaced or negatively impacted by the
development.
(f)   Review. Developments within the hotel district shall follow the processes
outlined in Article V of this Chapter except that all hotels or mixed-use
developments that include a hotel as a primary use, may be reviewed as a Level
I or Level II provided the total square footage of the uses other than the
hotel are less than 100,000 square feet:

Sec. 7-9-9. Conditional Use District.
From and after July 1, 2005, the Conditional Use District shall not be
available for use in rezoning property within the zoning jurisdiction of the
City of Asheville. Any conditional use district ordinance adopted prior to July
1, 2005, shall remain valid and subject to the provisions contained herein and
in the adopted ordinances establishing said districts.
(a)   Purpose. The Conditional Use District is established to provide for
flexibility in the development of property while ensuring that the development
is compatible with neighboring uses. Additional standards and regulations may
be attached to a proposed development to ensure compatibility with the
surrounding uses and with applicable adopted plans in accordance with the
requirements of this ordinance. When applying for designation as a Conditional
Use District, the owner shall specify the nature of the proposed development
and shall propose conditions to ensure compatibility between the development
and the surrounding uses.
(b)   General requirements. The use of the Conditional Use District is strongly
encouraged due to the refinement of requests permitted by this option.
Conditional use overlay zoning affords a degree of certainty in land use
decisions not possible when rezoning to a general use district.
(1)   A Conditional Use District application shall be considered only upon
request by the property owner or a duly authorized representative of the
property owner.
(2)   Prior to submittal of the application, it is strongly recommended that
the applicant meet with representatives of the surrounding property owners and
of the surrounding neighborhood(s) to discuss the proposed development.
(3)   All standards and requirements of the underlying zoning district shall be
met, except to the extent that the conditions imposed by the conditional use
zoning are more restrictive than the underlying standards.
(4)   No use shall be permitted except those allowed by approval of a
conditional use permit.
(5)   The conditions imposed pursuant to the conditional use permit approval
shall be stated on the permit and may limit the uses which are permitted on the
property. Such conditions may further specify location on the property of the
proposed structure(s), the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of
supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets, the
location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas, the timing
of development, the height of structures, the location and extent of rights-of-
way and other areas to be dedicated for public purposes, and other such matters
as may be identified as appropriate for the proposed development.
(6)   Minor modifications of the approved conditional use permit may be
approved by the planning and development director. The minor modifications
authorized herein are intended to provide relief where conditions, established
by the conditional use permit granted, create a hardship based upon a unique
physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the
property which was not known at the time of permit approval and which
subsequently rendered the land difficult or impossible to use due to the
condition(s) imposed. The permit holder shall bear the burden of proof to
secure the modification(s). Such modifications shall be limited to the
following:
a.   A deviation of up to ten percent or 24 inches, whichever is greater, from
the approved setback, provided that the conditions for approving a deviation
from the required setback established by subsection
7-11-8(c)(1) of this chapter are met.
b.   A reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of parking spaces required
for the use provided that the conditions established by subsection
7-11-8(c)(2) of this chapter are met.
(7)   Any violation of a condition included in the approval of a conditional
use permit shall be treated the same as any other violation of this chapter and
shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any other such
violation.
(8)   If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is
found to be illegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail to accept any
condition, the approval of such Conditional Use District shall be null and
void, the property shall revert to its previous zoning classification and the
conditional use permit shall be deemed revoked, all without further action by
the city council.
(9)   If no action has been taken to begin development of the property in
accordance with the approved conditional use permit within 24 months of its
approval by city council, the Conditional Use District zoning shall be null and
void, the property shall revert to its previous zoning classification and the
conditional use permit shall be deemed revoked, all without further action of
the city council.
(10)   If the use or uses commenced pursuant to a permit issued under this
section are deemed abandoned or discontinued pursuant to sections
7-17-5 or 7-17-6, then the conditional use permit issued pursuant to this
section shall be deemed revoked, the Conditional Use District zoning shall be
null and void, and the property shall revert to its previous zoning
classification, without action by the city council.
(c)   Application procedure. Applications for Conditional Use District zoning
and for issuance of a conditional use permit shall be processed, considered,
and voted upon using the same procedures and subject to the same requirements
as those established by sections 7-7 and
7-5-5 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided below:
(1)   The application shall include site plans, landscape plans, building
elevations, floor plans, and such other information required to provide the
approving bodies with a complete and accurate description of the proposed
development.
(2)   The application and supporting materials shall be reviewed by the
technical review committee in accordance with the procedures set forth in
section
7-5-5 of this chapter prior to the meeting of the planning and zoning
commission at which the application is to be considered. Notice of this meeting
shall be provided as the same is required for a public hearing for rezoning
property as set forth in subsection
7-5-20(a)(4) of this chapter. The recommendations and comments of the technical
review committee shall be reported to the planning and zoning commission.
(3)   In establishing conditional districts, the city council may prescribe
dimensional requirements (height, setback, etc.) that are different from the
requirements of the corresponding general zoning classification, and may
prescribe development and design standards that are different from those set
out in article XI; provided, that any request for a modification to a
dimensional requirement or development and design standards (landscape,
parking, etc.) that is less restrictive than would be applicable for the
corresponding general zoning classification must be specifically described in
any notices required for the public hearing on the conditional zoning
application, if it is part of the application, and must be set out separately
in any ordinance establishing said conditional zoning district, together with
an explanation of the reason for the modification. Except as modified pursuant
to this paragraph, or pursuant to paragraph (6), below, all standards and
requirements of the corresponding general zoning district must be met.
Variances to the standards established for any conditional zoning shall not be
allowed.
(4)   Upon receipt of the recommendations from the planning and zoning
commission, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the requests for
Conditional Use District zoning and issuance of a conditional use permit.
Notice of the public hearing shall be provided in accordance with the
provisions of section
7-5-20 of this chapter. The city council shall take separate actions on
consideration of the zoning request and the conditional use permit request.
(5)   The Asheville City Council shall not approve the conditional use permit
unless and until it has approved the rezoning request. The standards for
granting conditional use permits under this section shall be the same as for
conditional use permits issued pursuant to subsection
7-16-2(c).
(6)   Upon review of the requests for approval of Conditional Use District
zoning, the Asheville City Council may authorize the amendment of the official
zoning map of the City of Asheville to add the Conditional Use District zoning
and issue the conditional use permit for the proposed development; deny the
requests for the zoning and issuance of the conditional use permit; or continue
the consideration of the requests in order to receive further information
regarding the requests.
(7)   In approving the conditional use permit, the Asheville City Council may
impose such conditions and requirements as it deems necessary in order for the
purpose and intent of this chapter to be served.
(8)   The Conditional Use District zoning and conditional use permit authorized
and approved as provided herein shall be perpetually binding upon the affected
property unless subsequently changed or amended as provided for in this
chapter.

Sec. 7-9-10. Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District.
(a)   General description. The Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District is
established to assist in the advancement and implementation of the Charlotte
Street Corridor Plan (the "Plan"). The district provides for and encourages a
mixture of uses, including medium density business and service uses serving
several residential neighborhoods, and medium to high density residential uses.
Additionally, the district encourages development which is compatible with its
surroundings and provides incentives for property owners to develop property in
a manner that is consistent with the goals and recommendations of the plan.
This district may serve as a workplace and/or residence for many individuals
and should be sensitive to a significant pedestrian population, but also
provide for adequate and safe vehicular access.
(b)   Permitted uses. The uses permitted within the Charlotte Street Transition
Overlay District shall be those listed as permitted uses within the underlying
general use zoning district(s).
(c)   Prohibited uses. The uses prohibited within the Charlotte Street
Transition Overlay District shall be those listed as prohibited uses within the
underlying general use zoning district(s).
(d)   Uses by right subject to special requirements. The uses by right subject
to special requirements within the Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District
shall be those listed as uses by right subject to special requirements within
the underlying general use zoning district(s).
(e)   Conditional uses. The conditional uses within the Charlotte Street
Transition Overlay District shall be those listed as conditional uses within
the underlying general use zoning district(s).
(f)   Development standards.
(1)   Structure size standards.
a.   New structures in the Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District may
have a building footprint of not more than 6,000 square feet. The gross floor
area of new structures shall not exceed 12,000 square feet.
b.   Existing structures may not be expanded to exceed a footprint or gross
floor area of 12,000 square feet.
c.   Structures may exceed the permitted structure size indicated in subsection
a. above, up to 25 percent above the maximum structure size if the specific
design criteria set forth in paragraph (2)b. below, are met.
(2)   Design criteria.
a.   General principles and intent of the design criteria:
The intent of the following design criteria is to maintain and strengthen the
unique historic character of Charlotte Street by helping to ensure that new
buildings are architecturally compatible with the historic character of the
street and that design characteristics are employed which are consistent with
the historic architectural vocabulary of the area. These characteristics
include historic building forms and silhouettes, proportions, treatments,
exterior materials, massing and/or architectural style. Additionally, it is
intended that the front elevations and overall massing of new buildings be
pedestrian scaled and related to the street.
It is not the intent that new buildings mimic historic designs, but rather that
they combine elements from the historic design palette in new ways to achieve a
design which is compatible with and complementary to the historic character of
the street.
In general, the predominant historic style of architecture within the
boundaries of the overlay district is of a residential form with pitched roofs,
porches and paned windows and is less urban than the structures south of E.
Chestnut Street. To a lesser degree, brick historic commercial structures exist
in the corridor and these have pitched roofs and sometimes use a combination of
brick and stucco.
When developing designs for new buildings, it is advisable to reference
existing historic buildings or other documentation to identify elements that
are to be used in the project.
b.   Specific design criteria:
1.   The proposed structure shall be two stories as measured from the Charlotte
Street side of the building.
2.   Roof forms shall be similar to those used historically within the
boundaries of the overlay district. The dominant roof shapes shall be gabled or
hipped. The minimum roof pitch shall be 5:12. Gable ends shall face the street.
The addition of dormers is permitted. Areas of flat roofs are discouraged and
shall not exceed 25 percent of the primary façade and shall be located behind a
sloped roof or parapet.
3.   All rooftop equipment shall be fully screened from view and the method of
screening shall be integrated into the overall building design, for example
within or behind pitched roofs. Ground mounted equipment shall be located to
the rear of buildings and shall be screened with an enclosure compatible with
the architectural style of the structure and/or evergreen plant material that
provides an opaque screen.
4.   Where new building façades will be wider than 35 feet, the façade surface
shall be subdivided into portions not exceeding this distance by varying
setbacks, roof forms and perhaps materials. This subdivision of the façade
surface will break up the façade into increments similar to historic façade
widths found within the boundaries of the overlay district.
5.   Use building materials that are similar to those used historically. These
include "pebbledash" or "rough-cast" stucco, wood shingles, and horizontal wood
siding for buildings which are residential in character. Brick was typically
used for original historic commercial structures, sometimes in combination with
stucco above or as a foundation material for structures which are residential
in character. Stone was also used, to a lesser degree, as a material at the
foundation or first floor level with shingles or stucco above.
6.   A minimum of 40 percent of the first floor and 20 percent of the upper
floor(s) on the front façade shall have window/door fenestration. Windows shall
be set to the inside of the building face wall. Tinted or mirrored glass is not
permitted.
7.   Skylights shall not be used on the front façades.
(3)   Additional design standards. Structures which incorporate all of the
design criteria in subsection (2)b. above, may further exceed the permitted
structure size indicated in subsection (1) above, according to the total number
of points received for incorporating the following elements in the proposed
development.
Developments accumulating between 50 and 79 points shall be allowed to exceed
the permitted structure size indicated in item (1) up to 50 percent above the
maximum structure size. Developments accumulating 80 or more points shall be
allowed to exceed the permitted structure size indicated in subsection (1)
above, up to 75 percent above the maximum structure size.
a.   The proposed structure is a "mixed use" building, housing two or more
distinct use types (i.e. retail, office, residential, etc.); and (point totals
are cumulative):
1.   No single use type exceeds 75 percent of the total gross square footage of
the building: 30 points.
2.   If residential uses are provided which occupy at least 40 percent of the
total gross square footage of the building: 40 points.
3.   If residential uses are provided which occupy at least 40 percent of the
total gross square footage or the building and at least 25 percent of those
units are designed to have a total net square footage of 600 square feet or
less: 45 points.
b.   The proposed structure contains one or more of the following uses with an
operable storefront entrance facing the street:
Bakeries
Barber shops and salons
Bicycle shops
Bookstores
Candy, pastry, ice cream and snack shops
Delicatessens
Florists
Fruit and vegetable markets
Gift shops
Grocery stores
Hardware/garden supply stores
Pharmacies
Restaurants
Tailors/dressmaker shops
Video rental stores
Other similar uses which serve the surrounding community and which may generate
significant pedestrian activity: 20 points
c.   The landscaping for the proposed development exceeds the requirements of
subsections
7-11-3(f) and (g) of this Code by at least 50 percent. (Hardscape which
incorporates features that are pedestrian oriented may be used in combination
with or instead of landscaping along the street frontage of the lot). Examples
of these features include benches, outdoor dining, planting boxes, etc. Street
trees and hardscape features shall be consistent with any approved streetscape
plan for the area: 20 points.
d.   A connection is made between the parking area of the developing property
and the parking area of one or both adjoining properties which allows for
internal circulation between properties and results in there being only one
drive entrance on Charlotte Street to access the developing property: 15
points.
e.   Entrances to the proposed structure are defined either by front porches,
if designed with a residential character, or are recessed from the primary
façade and defined with awnings or canopies: 15 points
f.   The proposed development is designed to sensitively preserve the principal
historic structure(s) on the site. For the purposes of this section, historic
buildings shall be defined as contributing structures within the boundaries of
a National Register Historic District or those that are eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places: 20 points.
Demolition of a historic structure: Minus 20 points.
g.   A minimum of 25 percent of the total number of residential dwelling units

ARTICLE X. GENERAL DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Sec. 7-10-1. Number of principal buildings per lot.
(a)   General. There shall be no limit on the number of principal buildings on
an individual lot, except as indicated in (b) below, and, provided that all
other requirements set forth in this chapter or other federal, state, or local
laws are met.
(b)   Single-family dwellings. There shall be no more than one single-family
dwelling on an individual lot in a single-family residential zoning district,
unless otherwise provided in this chapter. This requirement does not affect the
use of accessory dwelling units in conjunction with the standards set forth in
this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97; Ord. No. 3328, § 1(k), 1-24-06; Ord. No. 4431, §
1d, 6-23-15; Ord. No. 4608, § 1(l), 8- 22-17)
Sec. 7-10-2. Required setbacks; allowable encroachments into required setbacks.
(a)   General. A building, structure, or lot shall not be developed, used, or
occupied unless it meets the minimum setback requirements set forth in article
VIII and article X of this chapter for the use or overlay zoning district in
which it is located, except as otherwise established in this chapter for
particular uses or for encroachments as set forth in (f) below. See also
section
7-10-4, Requirements for Lots Along Thoroughfares.
(b)   Method of calculation.
(1)   Minimum setback. Minimum setback is the space defined by measuring
perpendicularly from and along the entire boundary of the lot (property line)
to the building line. Front setbacks shall be measured from the street right-
of-way line, except, on streets greater than 45 feet in travel lane width, the
setback shall be measured from the edge of the travel lane. The accompanying
corner lot, street side setback shall also be measured from the edge of the
travel lane. In no case shall the minimum setback be closer to the street than
the right-of-way line. A setback may be the front, rear, or side setback. For
illustrations of the location of front, rear, or side setbacks, see Figure 10-
1. Except as set forth for through lots in subsection
7-10-2(d) below, there shall be one front setback area which is determined at
the time of site plan approval or zoning permit issuance.

fig. 10-1
(2)   Overlap of setbacks. When more than one setback depth applies, the
greatest setback dimension requirement must be met.
(c)   Corner lots - setbacks. Unless otherwise specified in the zoning district
or overlay zoning district regulations, the second street side of a corner lot
shall have a setback requirement of 50 percent of the front setback requirement
in that district. Alleys are not classified as secondary side streets and would
only require typical side setbacks.

IMAGES/0-0-0-220.png]
fig. 10-2
(d)   Through lots - setbacks. Unless otherwise specified in the zoning
district or overlay zoning district regulations, both street sides of through
lots shall be considered a front yard and shall conform to the front setback
requirements or the established building lines in the area (see subsection
7-10-2(e) below). Parcels abutting an alley at the rear of the lot are not
considered through lots and rear setback requirements would apply along the
rear property line.

fig. 10-3
(e)   Adjusting building lines. Where there are lots which comprise 50 percent
or more of the entire length of the street frontage on the same side of the
street, and within the block, and which are developed such that buildings on
those lots have front setback depths with a variation of not more than ten
feet, no building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be required
to have a front setback greater than the average front setback depth of those
lots. Provided further, no front setback need exceed the average setback of the
two adjoining buildings on either side thereof, if such two adjoining buildings
are less than 200 feet apart.

(f)   Allowable encroachments into required setbacks. The following buildings
and structures may encroach upon required setbacks as set forth below unless
specifically prohibited elsewhere in this chapter.
(1)   Sills, cornices, and similar ornamental features projecting from the
principal building may encroach up to 18 inches into any required setback.
(2)   Bay windows, balconies, and similar features projecting from the
principal building may encroach up to three feet into any required setback.
(3)   Decks, steps, uncovered porches, patios, and terraces may encroach into a
required side or rear setback, but no closer than six feet to the side or rear
property line.
(4)   Steps, terraces, and patios and uncovered decks with a height of not more
than 30 inches may encroach up to ten feet into a required front setback.
Handrails installed in conjunction with steps, decks, etc. shall not be
included in figuring the height of the steps, terraces, patios and uncovered
decks.
(5)   Accessory buildings and structures (see article XIV of this chapter) may
encroach into any required side and rear setback, but no closer than six feet

(7)   Handicapped accessibility and life safety features (such as ramps, fire
escapes, etc.) that are required by the North Carolina State Building Code may
encroach into any required setback, but no closer than three feet from a side
or rear property line. If a handicapped accessibility or life safety feature
cannot meet this requirement due to the location of an existing structure or
other impeding site feature on a residential lot, then the setback requirement
for these structures can be adjusted to the extent necessary by the planning
director.
(8)   Setbacks shall not be required for bus shelters and benches, which may
overlap property lines and encroach into public right-of-way, provided they do
not restrict vehicular or pedestrian flow or obstruct sight visibility
triangles as required by subsection
7-11-2(g) of this chapter.
(g)   Outdoor storage and displays.
(1)   Where and when permitted, the outdoor storage and display of materials or
products related to a business and not otherwise classified as temporary under
subsection (2) must comply with all building setback requirements for the
district in which the business is located. Should required buffers, street tree
planting strips, or other landscaped areas exceed the width of the building
setback, then the greater of these distances shall apply.
(2)   The temporary outdoor display of products is allowed to encroach within
required building setbacks, but cannot be located within required buffers,
street tree planting strips, or other landscaped areas required under section
7-11-3. For the purposes of this provision, temporary outdoor displays are
defined as products that are placed outside during operating hours for the
business and removed at other times.
(3)   The placement of outdoor storage and displays shall not reduce the amount
of parking on a site below the minimum standards defined in section
7-11-2.

(5)   Parking surface treatment. The material for surface parking spaces and
corresponding access drives required by this section shall consist of suitable
paving material which will prevent the exposure of subsoil. Suitable paving
material for required parking areas includes, but is not limited to asphalt,
porous asphalt, concrete, compacted stone (road bond), gravel, and aggregates
such as bituminous surface treatment (BST) and "chip and seal".
Porous paving blocks and pervious paving materials are permitted and encouraged
as material for parking lots. The use of grass as a parking lot surface is
permitted for overflow and intermittent parking. Pervious paving systems are
required for parking spaces which exceed the maximum number of spaces required
by subsection
7-11-2(c). The use of grass or other vegetation as a parking surface is
permitted only for parking spaces which are provided in excess of the maximum
number of parking spaces required by subsection
7-11-2(c) or used for intermittent or overflow parking. Parking lots associated
with arenas, sporting facilities, amphitheaters, fairgrounds, and religious
institutions may, however, use grass or other vegetation for the entire parking
lot.
Additional requirements are as follows:
a.   Parking lots utilizing road bond, gravel or other vegetative surfacing are
prohibited within the Central Business District, unless otherwise allowed under
Article XIV.
b.   Parking lots utilizing road bond or gravel shall provide such material
with a minimum thickness of at least four inches and must be maintained in a
stable condition.
c.   Parking lots utilizing road bond or gravel shall be designed and
constructed such that siltation resulting from stormwater run-off does not
enter adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. The lots must be designed so
as to prevent loose stone, aggregate or other materials from leaving the lot.
d.   All driveway aprons, which are defined as that portion of the parking lot
entrance which abuts the street, shall consist of concrete, asphalt, or
bituminous surface treatment for a length of at least ten lineal feet starting
at the street and extending into the driveway. Subsection
7-11-2(g) sets forth specific driveway entrance requirements.
e.   The individual parking spaces shall be delineated in all parking lots,
except lots utilizing road bond, gravel, grass or other vegetative surfacing.
f.   All handicapped parking spaces and corresponding access paths to the
building entrance shall consist of concrete, asphalt or bituminous surface
treatment.
g.   All driveways with an average grade exceeding five percent shall consist
of concrete, asphalt or bituminous surface treatment.
h.   Parking spaces serving one, two, three and four family dwellings are
exempt from the requirements of this subsection.
i.   All driveways and parking lots shall be of sufficient strength and
thickness to safely support fire emergency vehicles.
(6)   Use of public rights-of way for access and maneuvering. No access to
individual off-street parking spaces shall be allowed directly from public
rights-of-way. Public rights-of-way shall not be used for maneuvering in the
process of entering or leaving individual off-street parking spaces. Public
rights-of- way may be used for maneuvering by delivery vehicles entering or
leaving off-street loading berths as set forth in subsection
7-11-2 (c), but those berths shall be designed so that no public rights-of-way
are blocked by parked delivery vehicles.
(7)   Parking lot landscaping requirements are described in section
7-11-3 of this chapter.
(8)   Parking lot sign requirements are described in article XIII of this
chapter.
(c)   Off-street parking requirements.
(1)   Number of spaces required. The requirements for off-street parking are
set forth in the table below. For uses not covered in this table, the
appropriate number of maximum and minimum parking spaces based upon the most
recent Parking Generation edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

(2)   Bicycle parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided for all uses except
single family dwellings and duplex dwellings. The minimum number of bicycle
parking spaces shall be one (1) bicycle parking space or ten percent (10%) of
the total number of dwelling units, whichever is greater. The bicycle parking
requirement shall be ten percent (10%) of the maximum parking spaces if it is
any other development. Bicycle parking facilities shall include standard bike
racks and other secured, lockable facilities. Bike parking shall be located
within 50 feet of a publicly-accessible entrance.
(3)   Parking requirements for urban residential developments. Residential
developments located within the area described below shall not be required to
provide off-street parking if on-street parking is permitted on the street(s)
on which the development is proposed and the developer investigates with the
Asheville Transit Authority the provision of a transit stop to serve the
development. The boundaries of the area shall be:
To the north, one mile from the Central Business District boundary;
To the south, one mile from the Central Business District boundary;
To the west, the French Broad River; and
To the east, the ridge of Town Mountain and the ridge of Beaucatcher Mountain.
This area shall be identified on a map kept in the office of the City of
Asheville Planning and Development Department.
(4)   Parking requirements for the River Parking Reduction Area. All properties
located within the River Parking Reduction Area (see map: Planning and
Development Department) will be eligible for reductions based on the following:
a.   Projects with a base requirement of 30 spaces or less may receive a 50
percent reduction.
b.   Projects with a base requirement of 31—50 spaces may receive a 30 percent
reduction.
c.   Projects with a base requirement of 51—75 spaces may receive a 20 percent
reduction.
These reductions may not be combined with other reductions offered through
individual zoning districts.
(d)   Off-street loading requirements.
(1)   An area shall be provided for loading and unloading delivery vehicles for
all institutions, businesses, or industries of more than 5,000 square feet in
gross floor area, except in the Central Business District.
(2)   The minimum size of an off-street loading berth shall be 250 square feet
plus any additional area needed for maneuvering delivery vehicles.
(3)   The number of berths required is based on the gross floor area of the
building and is as follows:
 
Gross Floor Area (Sq. Ft.) Minimum Number of Berths
5,000 - 24,999             1
25,000 - 49,999            2
50,000 - 74,999            3
75,000 and over            4 plus 1 for each additional 50,000 sq. ft.
 
(e)   Shared and remote parking.
(1)   Shared parking. The planning and development director shall approve the
joint use of up to 100 percent of the required parking spaces for two or more
uses located on the same parcel or adjacent parcels, provided that the
developer can demonstrate that the uses will not overlap in hours of operation
or in demand for the shared spaces.
Any sharing of required parking spaces by uses located on different parcels
shall be guaranteed by a written agreement between the owner of the parking
area and the owner of any use located on a different parcel and served by the
parking area.
Should the uses change such that the new uses overlap in hours of operation or
in demand for the shared spaces, the shared parking approval shall become void.
Parking meeting the requirements of this chapter shall then be provided for
each use.
(2)   Remote parking. If the required number of parking spaces for any land use
cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is
located, such parking space may be provided on any land within 500 feet walking
distance of the property on which the principal use is located, provided that
the zoning use regulations for the district in which the remote parking space
is located permit the principal use which the parking spaces serve.
Any remote parking spaces located on a different parcel than the use for which
the remote parking spaces serve shall be guaranteed by a written agreement
between the owner of the remote parking area and the owner of the use located
on a different parcel and served by the remote parking area. Change of
ownership of either parcel shall require a renewal of the agreement.
(3)   Shared and remote parking shall not be permitted for hotel uses.
(f)   On-street parking. On-street parking spaces may be counted toward the
fulfillment of the off-street parking requirements for a development, subject
to the following standards. Any on-street parking space meeting these standards
shall count as 0.75 of a required off-street parking space.
(1)   The on-street parking spaces are newly constructed as part of a
development. No existing on-street parking spaces may be counted except as
permitted for a particular use district.
(2)   There shall be a minimum of four contiguous on-street spaces constructed
for the development.
(3)   All counted spaces must comply with the City of Asheville Standard
Specifications and Details Manual for on-street parking spaces.
(4)   Parking spaces must be located not more than 500 feet from the proposed
development. Parking spaces that are located more than 150 feet from the
proposed development must be located within a zoning classification that
permits the use served and must not be located adjacent to property that is not
within a zoning classification that permits said use.
(5)   Sidewalks must abut all counted on-street parking spaces in such a
fashion as to allow direct pedestrian connectivity to the building or
development served by the spaces. For the purpose of this section, parking
spaces located directly across a street from a building or development may be
counted, if a crosswalk (marked or unmarked) is provided for convenient
pedestrian access.
(6)   Street modifications (including curbs, sidewalks, paving and marking
locations) associated with any counted on-street parking shall be reviewed by
the city public works and transportation departments for compliance with the
City of Asheville Standard Specifications and Details Manual. Parking shall not
restrict existing access to abutting parcels.
(7)   Any on-street spaces created in accordance with this provision shall be
public parking spaces and not for the exclusive use of the development. Full
access easements or rights-of-way incorporating the parking and the abutting
sidewalks shall be conveyed to the city.
Approved on-street parking spaces shall not be considered to violate the
provisions of this chapter restricting parking within setbacks or those
provisions of this chapter requiring that parking be provided at the side or
rear of a development and that it be no closer to the street than the edge of
the structure.
(g)   Access point requirements (Driveways). The following standards shall be
met when designing vehicular access points from public streets to individual
properties:
(1)   Width of access points. The width of access points shall be measured
parallel to the street at the point beyond the driveway apron radius, according
to the following:
a.   For single-family structures and duplexes, the following standards shall
apply:
Minimum width within the front setback: 9 feet
Maximum width within the front setback: 18 feet
b.   For multifamily residential structures located within 150 feet of a
publicly-maintained road, the following standards shall be applied:
Minimum width within the front setback: 9 feet
Maximum width within the front setback: 36 feet
c.   For multifamily residential structures located beyond 150 feet of a
publicly-maintained road and for commercial property, the following standards
shall be applied:
Minimum width within the front setback: 20 feet
Maximum width within the front setback: 36 feet

(2)   Distance from street intersections.
a.   Minimum distances between access points and street intersections shall be
determined by the access triangle. No access points shall be permitted within
the access triangle. The access triangle is that triangle formed by the
intersecting undisturbed right-of-way lines ("A" and "B" in the graphic below)
and a line connecting the ends of the undisturbed right-of-way lines.

Figure 11-6
b.   The undisturbed right-of-way lines ("A" and "B" in the graphic above)
extend from the intersection of the right-of-way lines and have a specific
length as defined by the table below.
 
Street Type              Length of Undisturbed Length of Undisturbed Right-
                         Right-of-way "A"      of-way "B"
Residential Access       25 feet               25 feet
Residential Subcollector 50 feet               50 feet
Residential Collector    75 feet               75 feet
Arterial                 100 feet              100 feet
 
c.   Where the length of the required undisturbed right-of-way exceeds the
street frontage of the lot, one access point shall be permitted along the
property line furthest from the intersection.
(3)   Distance from other access points. The distance measured along the right-
of-way line between the tangent projection of the inside edges of adjacent
access points shall be at least 25 feet.

Figure 11-7
(4)   Distance from property line. Unless the access point will be shared
between two or more adjoining properties, all access points shall be located at
least five feet from all property lines perpendicular to the street. Shared
access points are encouraged to reduce the amount of impervious surface area
and to limit the number of access points along a street.

(h)   Sight visibility triangles at street intersections.
(1)   Sight visibility triangle required. In order to ensure visibility at
intersections, sight visibility triangles shall be maintained at all
intersections of public streets, private streets, and driveway access points.
(2)   Public street intersections. At an intersection of two public streets
with no traffic sign or other device, a sight visibility triangle is that
triangle formed by the street right-of-way lines and a line connecting them at
points 50 feet from the intersection of the street right-of-way lines.
(3)   All other intersections. At all other types of intersections, a sight
triangle is defined as that triangle formed by a ten-foot side measured along
the right-of-way of the minor approach from the right-of- way of the major
approach, and a 50-foot side measured along the right-of-way of the major
approach from the right-of-way of the minor approach.
a.   For intersections formed by two public streets with a traffic control sign
or other device, the minor approach is the street which must stop or yield.

Figure 11-9
b.   For intersections formed by a public street and a private street or
driveway, the public street is the major approach.
c.   For a private street or driveway, the short side of the sight visibility
triangle shall be measured along the edge of the private street or driveway.

(4)   Sight visibility at state-maintained intersections. On roadways
maintained by the North Carolina Department of Transportation, additional sight
visibility triangle requirements may be applied by that department.
(5)   Applicability and exemptions. Within the triangles identified above, and
except as provided below, no structure, sign, plant, shrub, tree, berm, fence,
wall, or other object of any kind or parking or storage of automobiles shall be
installed, constructed, set out or maintained so as to obstruct cross-
visibility at a level between three and ten feet above the level of the center
of the street intersection. These restrictions shall not apply to:
a.   Existing natural grades which, by reason of natural topography, rise three
feet above the level of the center of the intersection;
b.   Trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in such manner that no limbs or
foliage extend into the area between three and ten feet above the level of the
intersection;
c.   Fire hydrants, public utility poles, street markers, governmental signs,
and traffic control devices;
d.   Any structure, sign, plant, shrub, tree, berm, wall, or fence located in
the Central Business District;
e.   Trees which are planted in order to meet the street tree requirement as
set forth in subsection
7-11-3(f).
(i)   Access onto residential streets by nonresidential uses
(1)   Access onto residential streets limited. In order to preserve the
residential character of streets that function primarily to provide direct
access to residences, access onto these streets by nonresidential uses shall be
limited. Those streets abutted primarily by residential uses and that provide
direct access to these residences shall be considered to be a residential
street. These standards shall not apply to those nonresidential uses permitted
by right, subject to special requirements, or as conditional uses in
residential zoning districts. Furthermore, these standards shall not apply to
nonresidential uses located in nonresidential or mixed use zoning districts
that are located on residential streets and have their only access from
residential streets.
(2)   Standards for access for nonresidential uses. Nonresidential uses located
on corner lots, through lots, or other lots with frontage on more than one
street shall have their access from those streets that are non-residentially
zoned. Access onto residentially zoned streets or streets dominated by
residential uses shall not be allowed.
(j)   General requirements for access to streets for residential lots.
(1)   General. All residential lots must abut a public street or an approved
private street built to public street standards: Residential lots shall meet
the minimum lot width requirements of the applicable zoning district where they
abut a street, except for lots on a cul-de-sac or flag lots.
(2)   Lots on a cul-de-sac. A lot on a cul-de-sac shall be a minimum of 25 feet
at the front property line, and shall be 80 percent of the required lot width
at the front setback line.
(3)   Flag lots. A flag lot on parcels identified within Appendix 7-F may be
approved if it meets the following requirements:
a.   A flag lot shall serve only single-family residential development and
accessory buildings.
b.   The minimum width of the flag lot at the street shall not be less than 20
feet.
c.   Minimum width of the flagpole portion of the lot shall be 20 feet.
d.   The flagpole portion of the lot shall not be used to calculate compliance
with minimum lot area, width, and depth or to provide off-street parking.
e.   Where public water is available, any occupied building on the flag lot
must be within 500 feet of a fire hydrant, as specified in the Asheville Fire
Prevention Code. This distance shall be measured along the street, then along
the flagpole portion of the lot, and then in a straight line to the building
location.
f.   Where public sewer is available, occupied buildings on the flag lot shall
have a gravity sewer service line, or the sewer requirement shall be noted on
the preliminary plat.
g.   Use of a shared driveway to serve a flag lot and an adjoining lot is
permitted and encouraged.
h.   Maximum length for the flagpole portion of the lot shall be 250 feet.
i.   No more than one lot in a subdivision of less than eight lots shall be a
flag lot. No more than two lots or ten percent of the total lots in the
subdivision, whichever is greater, shall be flag lots in a subdivision of eight
or more lots.
j.   Maximum lot area for a flag lot, excluding the flag pole, may not exceed
12,000 square feet unless located in an RS-2 zoning district, where a flag lot
may not exceed 24,000 square feet.
(3.1)   Flag lots located on parcels not included in Appendix 7-F. A flag lot
may be approved if it meets the following requirements:
a.   A flag lot shall serve only single-family residential development and
accessory buildings.
b.   The minimum width of the flag lot at the street or along any part of the
flag pole shall not be less than 16 feet unless the driveway is shared with the
parent parcel and recorded on the plat as such, in such a case the minimum
width of the flag lot may be reduced to 10 feet.
c.   Where public water is available, any occupied building on the flag lot
must be within 500 feet of a fire hydrant, as specified in the Asheville Fire
Prevention Code. This distance shall be measured along the street, then along
the flagpole portion of the lot, and then in a straight line to the building
location.
d.   Use of a shared driveway to serve a flag lot and an adjoining lot is
permitted and encouraged.
e.   Maximum length for the flagpole portion of the lot shall be 250 feet.
f.   No more than two lots in a subdivision of less than eight lots shall be
flag lots. No more than twenty five percent of the total lots shall be flag
lots in any subdivision of eight or more lots.
g.   Maximum lot area for a flag lot, excluding the flagpole, may not exceed
12,000 square feet unless located in an RS-2 zoning district, where a flag lot
may not exceed 24,000 square feet.
h.   The minimum front setback for the flag lot shall be six feet unless a
duplex or two attached single family dwellings are proposed to straddle the
parent parcel and flag lot, in which case no setbacks shall be required between
the parent parcel (rear setback waived) and the flag lot (front setback
waived).
i.   Structure size on flag lots shall be limited to a maximum 1,000 square
feet building footprint area and a maximum of 1,400 square feet gross floor
area.
j.   The side yard setback for the portion of the parent parcel abutting the
lot line of the flagpole section of the flag lot may be reduced to 3 feet.
(k)   General requirements for access to streets for non-residential lots.
Except as set forth below, lots used for non-residential purposes must abut a
public street or an approved private street built to public street standards.
Lots or parcels used for non-residential purposes are not required to abut a
public street if all of the following requirements are met.
(1)   An easement or right-of-way with a minimum width of 30 feet connects the
lot to a public street.
(2)   The easement or right-of-way is recorded in the Office of the Register of
Deeds for Buncombe County.
(3)   A paved road with a minimum width of 20 feet (not including parking)
provides access from the lot(s) or parcel(s) to a public street.
(4)   The access road is located within the recorded easement or right-of-way.
(5)   The access road shall be constructed to the standards established by the
City of Asheville for commercial streets.
(6)   A road maintenance agreement, which identifies the responsibilities for
the maintenance of the access road and clearly states that the City of
Asheville is not responsible for maintenance of the road, is prepared and
recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds for Buncombe County.
(7)   Not more than five lots nor more than ten acres shall be served by the
easement or right-of-way.

Sec. 7-11-3. Landscape and buffering standards.
(a)   Purpose. The City of Asheville has an abundant and diverse tree and
vegetative cover that contributes to the aesthetic value of the city and
provides numerous ecological and economic benefits. Asheville's location on the
habitable edge of the Appalachian Mountains (one of the oldest ranges in the
world); its truly fascinating cultural heritage; the accidents of history that
endowed the city with more of than its share of memorable architecture; its
site on the French Broad River (one of the country's oldest rivers—and the only
one in the Southeast that flows north); and its location in the center of a
geographical area that includes four neighboring states, make Asheville truly
different from all other American cities. The landscape and buffering standards
set forth below require landscaping between dissimilar zoning, along public
rights-of-way, in and around parking lots and outdoor storage areas, and on
properties supporting new development or extensive re-development, in order to:
(1)   Encourage the preservation and health of existing trees, tree canopies,
and other existing vegetation, and to replenish removed vegetation;
(2)   Improve and protect the visual quality of the City of Asheville, city
forests, and forested view sheds, and minimize potential negative impacts of
development such as noise, dust, glare of lights, parking lots, traffic, heat,
overcrowding, and odor;
(3)   Provide environmental benefits, such as climate modification, decreased
energy consumption, reduced stormwater runoff, decreased erosion, improved
water and air quality, and protection of wildlife habitat;
(4)   Provide a transition between dissimilar zoning districts to protect
abutting properties from potential negative impacts of neighboring development,
particularly between residential-commercial interfaces, and to preserve the
character and value of a property and provide a sense of privacy;
(5)   Improve standards for quantity, location, size, spacing, protection, and
maintenance of plants and other screening materials to assure a high level of
quality in the appearance of Asheville while allowing flexibility to promote
well designed and creative landscape plantings.
(6)   Enforce the maintenance of landscaping installed to meet the requirements
of these high standards to ensure that the landscaping continues to thrive and
enhance the visual quality of the City of Asheville.
(b)   Applicability. Landscape standards are required for developments within
the City of Asheville's zoning jurisdiction, including the extraterritorial
jurisdiction. Applicants are advised to meet with planning and development
department staff prior to submitting a site plan to discuss applicable
landscape requirements, other ordinance requirements, and coordination of
plantings with utility plans. A landscape plan drawn to scale must be submitted
with the site plan and prepared in accordance with the standards established by
the planning and development department. Separate landscape requirements are
considered cumulative unless noted otherwise.
(1)   Development of property as referenced in section
7-11-1 must bring the entire site into full compliance with the requirements of
article XI of this chapter (parking, loading, access, landscape and buffering,
open space and traffic impact analysis).
(1.1)   The following types of development must only comply with the landscape
and buffering standards that are specifically defined in each of the following
sections:
a.   Existing unpaved vehicular use areas of which less than 50 percent is
paved or existing paved vehicular use areas of which less than 50 percent is
demolished and repaved must meet the parking lot landscape requirements in
subsection
7-11-3(d)(4) only for the disturbed area. For properties where the area of
disturbance is located along the perimeter of the vehicular use are the
following landscape standards shall also be required adjacent to the disturbed
area, if applicable: property line buffer, street buffer, street trees.
Maintenance and repair of disturbed areas less than 500 square feet are exempt
from this requirement with an exception that any landscaping removed to
accommodate the maintenance or repair of such areas must be replaced with
vegetation equivalent to that which was removed.
b.   Building expansions or additions that are less than 50 percent of the pre-
expansion floor area must meet the landscaping requirements only in the area
around the addition which is parallel to any edge of the expansion area and
extending to the property line or street pavement edge (see illustration
below):

expansion /addition
c.   Building expansions or additions occurring on properties zoned Commercial
Industrial or Industrial that result in an expansion of less than five percent
of the pre-expansion floor area or 3,000 square feet in size whichever is less,
are not required to meet additional landscape standards. Cumulative expansions
occurring over a three-year period that exceed this threshold shall have to
meet all applicable landscape standards.
(2)   Central business district alternatives. In order to preserve and promote
existing development patterns within the Central Business District specific
landscape requirements are described below:
a.   The CBD areas within the Downtown Design Review Overlay District are
exempt from building impact landscaping and property line buffers;
b.   Other CBD areas are exempt from building impact landscaping but developers
will be required to provide a property line buffer which may be the standard
buffer outlined in [section]
7-11-3 or an alternative buffer described in the ordinance for the district [in
section]
7-8-18;
c.   All CBD areas may modify the requirement for a street buffer by placing a
wall at a minimum height of three feet in place of the required shrubs;
d.   Street tree, parking lot and screening requirements shall apply as
described in the ordinance.
(3)   Urban zoning district exemption. In order to promote a high density,
urban form of development within these districts, the tree save requirements of
this subsection shall not apply to properties zoned Urban Village (UV),
Neighborhood Corridor (NCD), Urban Residential (URD), and Urban Place (UP).
(c)   Preservation and protection of existing vegetation. Preserving existing
vegetation protects the visual quality of the City of Asheville's urban
landscape and should be encouraged.
(1)   Credits and other incentives to preserve vegetation. Projects intending
to preserve existing vegetation in order to receive credit for required
landscaping must graphically show the location of each tree on a the landscape
plan and must note the dbh (diameter at breast height) and species of each
tree. Any development that proposes to preserve existing vegetation will
receive credit for that vegetation at the rate of:
 
Diameter at Breast Height                # of Tree Credits
2" — 6"                                1
7" — 12"                               2
13" — 18"                              3
19" — 24"                              4
25"                                      +5
Shrubs will be credited at a rate of 1:1
 
In order to receive credit, preserved vegetation must be in good health and
condition and must meet the spacing requirements of the standards it is
intended to satisfy. Protective barriers must also be shown on the landscape
and grading plans in accordance with the requirements of this section. If a
preserved tree dies within 24 months of completion of the project, it must be
replaced with the total number of trees which were credited to the existing
tree. No credit will be given to invasive-exotic species. 
(2)   Protection of existing trees during construction. No grading or other
land-disturbing activity can occur on a site with existing trees which are
designated to be preserved in order to meet the landscaping requirements until
protective barriers are installed by the developer and inspected by the
planning and development director. The dbh of the preserved trees and the
location of protective barriers must be shown on the landscape and grading
plans with the dimension between the tree trunk and barrier indicated.
a.   Placement of protective barriers. Barricades shall be placed around the
critical root zone of preserved trees that are within 50 feet of any grading or
construction activity. The critical root zone is a circle extending around the
tree with a one-foot radius for every one inch of tree diameter. All protective
barriers must include clear and visible signage that describes the delineated
area as a "Tree Protection Area", or equivalent. All protective barriers and
signs must be maintained throughout the building construction process.
b.   Protective barriers shall consist of either:
· A fence which is at least three feet high and constructed in a post and rail
configuration, using two by four posts and one by four rails; or

tree/fence
c.   Prohibited activities. All contractors must be made aware of the areas
designated for protection. No disturbance can occur within the tree protection
area including:
· Grading
· Filling
· Parking
· Storage of debris or materials, including topsoil
· Sedimentation and erosion control measures
· Disposal of hazardous wastes or concrete washout
· Attaching of nails, ropes, cables, signs, or fencing to any preserved tree.
d.   Permissible encroachments. Where physical site constraints exist,
utilities may encroach into the tree protection area provided they are tunneled
at least two feet directly below the tree roots to minimize root damage. A
construction detail shall be required.
Other encroachments various in nature may be permitted provided that the
contractor follows- through on the written recommendation of a certified
arborist or consulting arborist to minimize any potential impact and certify
that the activity will not damage the tree under normal circumstances.
e.   Silt fencing. If silt fencing is required to control sedimentation, the
fencing must be placed along the uphill edge of a tree protection zone in order
to prevent sediment from accumulating in the critical root zone area (refer to
the City of Asheville's Standards and Specifications Manual for details).
(d)   Standards. Landscape requirements are broken down in the following
categories:
a.   Property line buffer — Landscaping along property lines separating
different zoning districts.
b.   Street buffer — Landscaping along street rights-of-way between parking
areas and pedestrian zones.
c.   Street trees — Shade trees planted along street frontages to improve the
pedestrian environment and enhance the urban streetscape.
d.   Parking lot landscaping — Landscaping in and around vehicular use areas.
e.   Building impact landscaping — Landscaping used to enhance the site.
f.   Screening — Landscaping around utility use, outdoor storage, and loading
areas.
(1)   Property line buffer. Some land uses may create an adverse impact when
developed adjacent to other less intensive land uses commonly found in certain
zoning districts. Bufferyards shall be required for proposed developments
adjacent to parcels of dissimilar zoning designations to provide a transition
between districts of varying intensities. The bufferyard width and number of
plantings required will vary depending on the degree of difference between the
zoning designations and shall be the responsibility of the property owner
developing or changing the land use.
a.   Bufferyard types. The amount of plant material required in a bufferyard
area is measured per 100 linear feet and is based on the following table.
 
Bufferyard   Evergreen Deciduous     Deciduous     Shrubs  Shrubs (Small)
Type         Trees     Trees (Large) Trees (Small) (Large)
A — 20' wid4         3             3             10*     10*
B — 30' wid6         5             5             15*     15*
* 50 percent of all shrubs must be evergreen.
b.   Buffer determination. The type of buffer required is based on the
following table. Table is to be read in one direction only starting from the
proposed development site zoning column.

Expansion Zoning Districts (except CBD EXP) B   B
 
c.   Buffer location. Buffers shall extend along the entire property line which
is adjacent to the properties of dissimilar zoning designation. Buffers are to
be located on the property of the person developing the new or changing land
use, between the property line and any vehicular use areas, buildings, storage,
service areas, or other area of activity.
d.   Species composition. Plantings in buffer areas shall be an appropriate mix
of native species or other species suitable to naturalizing in woodland
settings. Buffers in the river district shall be composed of species
appropriate to a river environment. Consult the City of Asheville Recommended
Species List for a list of approved species.
e.   Placement of buffer plantings. The exact placement of the required plants
shall be the decision of the developer or designer, but shall be approved by
the planning and development director. Plants should be placed in a manner to
serve as an effective and attractive screen year-round when viewed from any
area accessible to the public or from adjacent properties. Trees or shrubs
should be planted at least five feet away from the property line to ensure
maintenance access and to avoid encroaching upon neighboring property.
f.   Setbacks. Wherein a setback and bufferyard are required along the same
property line that with the greatest dimensional width shall be applicable. If
the setback is greater than the bufferyard, the total number of required plant
material shall be distributed throughout the wider setback.
g.   Corner lots and through lots. No buffer will be required along the front
property line of any lot; however, a lot with more than one street face will
require a buffer along the secondary street face when it is adjacent to a
dissimilar zoning district. Buffer requirements are waived in lieu of street
trees and street buffers, as applicable, provided the building façade is that
street frontage is pedestrian oriented with functioning pedestrian entrances
that open onto public sidewalks.
h.   Encroachments. The following site features may be permitted to penetrate
or encroach into a required buffer area provided that the total number of
required plantings is still met.
· Approved driveway openings
· Pedestrian or bicycle paths
· Designated greenways
· Utilities
· Walls/fences
i.   Prohibitions in a buffer. The following are specifically prohibited from
encroaching into required buffer areas:
· Loading areas
· Storage areas
· Parking areas
· Driveways and drive aisles, other than approved openings
· Dumpsters
· Stormwater retention/detention structures
j.   Buffer along the Blue Ridge Parkway. In order to preserve views and
mitigate the impacts of adjacent development from the Blue Ridge Parkway or
other scenic corridors officially designated by city council or the North
Carolina Department of Transportation, new developments adjacent to these
corridors shall provide a Type 'B' buffer as required by this subsection.
k.   Grading activity in the bufferyard. When possible, grading should not
occur within a required bufferyard. If grading within the required bufferyard
proves necessary then the developer is required to plant trees and shrubs which
are 50 percent larger than otherwise required in order to quickly re-establish
a visual buffer. Grading in the required bufferyard shall not exceed a 3:
1 slope.
l.   Overlapping requirements. Fifty percent of buffer plants that are within
15 feet of a vehicular use area may also be counted towards the parking lot
landscaping.
(2)   Street buffers. Street buffers are designed to provide for a separation
of activities and a more comfortable pedestrian environment. The street buffer
is required in addition to the street trees planted in a ten-foot planting
strip as required in subsection
7-11-2(d)(3)(c).
a.   Street buffer determination. Vehicular use areas greater than 4,000 square
fee that are located within 50 feet of the edge of a street must be buffered
from the street.
b.   Calculating the requirement. One evergreen or deciduous shrub planted for
every five linear feet of buffer required. Species selected must achieve a
minimum of three feet in height at maturity.

street buffer
(3)   Street trees. Street trees are required for all new developments except
for single- or two-family homes. This requirement is designed to create or
enhance an attractive streetscape pattern while contributing to Asheville's
urban forest and a more comfortable pedestrian environment.
a.   Street tree determination. Street trees are required along all street
frontages.
b.   Calculating the requirement. Street tree requirements are as follows:
· Overhead utilities present — One small maturing tree (less than 35 feet in
height at maturity) for every 30 linear feet of property abutting a street.
· All other conditions — One large maturing tree (greater than 35 feet in
height at maturity) for every 40 linear feet of property abutting a street.
c.   Street tree spacing. Trees may be evenly spaced or staggered to
accommodate other site features. In no case shall a required street tree be
closer than 15 feet or farther than 65 feet from another required tree. No
street tree shall be farther than 20 feet from the edge of pavement or, in
cases of planned road widening, 20 feet from the proposed edge of pavement.
Existing trees credited towards street tree requirements shall meet spacing
requirements.

tree spacing
d.   Planting strip. Trees shall be placed in a planting strip the width of
which may vary but shall maintain a minimum of not less than seven feet and an
average width of ten feet. The planting area must be covered with living
material, including groundcover and/or shrubs, except for mulched areas
directly around the trees so that no soil is exposed. No stone much is
permitted in the planting strip. Sidewalks may interrupt the planting strip
provided the width on either side of the sidewalk totals ten feet. (See the
City of Asheville Standards and Specifications Manual for detail(s))
e.   Street trees in Urban Zoning Districts. Street trees required within the
Central Business, Urban Village, Neighborhood Corridor, Urban Residential and
Urban Place districts may utilize other urban forms and technologies such as
tree pits with grates or trenches. New trees where sidewalk construction is
required shall provide a minimum root zone area of 300 cubic feet of
organically amended soil, or structural soil alternative, in one of the
following forms:
i.   A reinforced suspended sidewalk system around a tree grate;
ii.   A continuous planting area between trees that is a minimum of four feet
wide;
iii.   A system of tree grates or previous paving that allows water
infiltration and oxygen exchange for tree root systems;
iv.   An on-street bulb-out which has been reviewed and approved by the traffic
engineer for traffic safety.
f.   Trees in public rights-of-way. Street trees may be located within the
city's rights-of-way but must be of a species approved by the city arborist.
Trees located in other public rights-of-way must provide an encroachment
agreement from the regulating agency.
(4)   Parking lot landscaping. Trees and shrubs are required in and around
parking lots in order to provide attractive views from roads and adjacent
properties, provide shade to reduce the heat generated by impervious surfaces,
reduce glare from parking lots, and to help filter exhaust from vehicles.
a.   Parking lot determination. Parking lots with six or more spaces shall
require parking lot landscaping.
b.   Calculating the requirement. One deciduous tree and four shrubs for
required for every 1,500 square feet of vehicular use area (VUA). At least 75
percent of the required deciduous parking lot trees must be large-maturing
trees. Trees and shrubs must be planted within 15 feet of the vehicular use
area to count as parking lot landscaping.
c.   Interior rows of parking. When more than four trees are required in a
parking lot with interior rows, 50 percent of the trees and shrubs must be
planted in islands or medians located within the parking lot.
d.   Multiple parking bays. When more than four bays of parking are proposed,
an interior island with an average width of 20 feet and a length equivalent to
the length of the average parking bay is required. This island must be planted
and include a pedestrian walkway no less than five feet wide and placed in a
location that enhances pedestrian circulation, preferably leading directly to a
building entrance or sidewalk.

perimeter parking
f.   Minimum island size. The minimum island size shall be 200 square feet of
pervious planting surface per tree. Islands must maintain an average width of
ten feet with a minimum width no less than five feet.
g.   Protection of trees. Curbing, bollards, or parking barriers shall protect
trees and shrubs within five feet of the edge of the pavement. Trees and shrubs
in islands should be set back at least three feet from the curb so as not to
interfere with car doors opening.
h.   Canopy coverage. Each parking space shall be located within 60 feet of a
tree as measured from the trunk of the tree to the closest point of the parking
space.
i.   Parking decks. Exposed parking decks are required to plant a minimum of
one tree and two shrubs for every 30 linear feet of the parking structure's
perimeter. Trees shall be planted within 20 feet of the structure. This
requirement shall be waived for any side of the structure where the property
line buffer standards of subsection
7-11-2(d)(1) require a greater number of plantings.
j.   Additional landscaping required for parking lots exceeding the maximum
number of parking spaces. When the number of parking spaces exceeds the maximum
city parking standards as set forth in section
7-11-1, one tree and two shrubs per 1,000 square feet of the additional
vehicular use area shall be required in addition to the minimum requirements of
this subsection.
k.   Landscaping of parking areas and other uses by right, subject to special
requirements and conditional uses. All parking areas required for specified
uses outlined in article XVI shall be screened from adjacent properties with a
mix of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs to result in a vegetative
screen that is 75 percent opaque year round.
(5)   Building impact landscaping. Building impact landscaping shall be
required for new or existing buildings in order to soften views from roads and
adjacent properties, provide shade to reduce the heat generated by impervious
surfaces, reduce glare, and to help enhance the urban landscape.
a.   Building impact determination. All new developments with an existing or
proposed building with a footprint greater than 3,000 square feet. Developments
with more than one building shall combine the total footprint areas.
b.   Calculating the requirement. One tree and two shrubs for every 1,000
square feet of building footprint. Trees and shrubs may be planted anywhere on
site.
(6)   Screening of dumpsters, loading docks, outdoor storage areas, and utility
structures. All dumpsters, loading docks, mechanical equipment, residential
garbage containers (over four), or utility structures visible from a public
street or adjacent property line shall be screened unless already screened by
an intervening building or bufferyard. All enclosed outdoor storage areas
greater than 25 square feet shall also be screened from adjacent properties and
streets. Screen types include:
· A continuous hedge of evergreen trees and/or densely twigged deciduous trees
planted in a seven- foot strip spaced no more than eight feet apart.
· A fence or wall with a minimum height of six feet with the finished side of
the fence facing the abutting property or street. Fences longer than 25 linear
feet shall be landscaped with trees and/or shrubs planted in a minimum five-
foot planting area, except around access areas, spaced no farther than eight
feet apart in order to screen at least 50 percent of the fence or wall. Such
wall landscaping planting area.
(7)   Tree save areas. Residential projects shall preserve a portion of a site
area dedicated to the preservation and/or establishment of natural woodland
areas. These areas shall be delineated on the required site plan or final plat.
a.   Tree save area determination. All new residential multi-family
developments of eight or more units and major subdivisions of eight or more
lots are required to have dedicated tree save areas. See subsection
7-11-3(b)(3) for exemptions.
b.   Calculating the requirement. Thirty percent of the total site area must be
delineated on an approved site plan or an approved preliminary and final plat
as tree save area. Each acre of designated tree save area must be planted at
the following rate; areas less than one acre will be required a pro-rated
amount plants:
 
Minimum Number of Trees/Shrubs Minimum Size
14 Large Maturing Trees        2 inch caliper
7 Large Maturing Trees         3 inch caliper
5 Understory Trees             1.5 inch caliper
50 Shrubs                      18" high or 3 gal. container
 
c.   Species composition. Trees and shrubs native to Western North Carolina
must be used. No single tree species shall constitute more than 20 percent of
the total requirement. No single species shall constitute more than 30 percent
of the total shrub requirement; native rhododendron or mountain laurel may
constitute 50 percent of the total shrub requirement.
d.   Minimum tree save area size. Tree save areas may be divided into more than
one pocket provided no single area is less than 5,000 square feet.
e.   Qualifying areas. Open, common space areas and required property line
buffers may be included in the required tree save areas. For major
subdivisions, a minimum of 50 percent of the required open space area shall
also be tree save area.
(e)   Alternative compliance. The landscape requirements are intended to set
minimum standards for quality development and environmental protection; site
conditions or other reasons may justify the need to request an alternate method
of compliance. The applicant must submit a plan of the area for which
alternative compliance is requested to the planning and development director.
The site plan shall show existing site features and any newly proposed
features, if applicable.
(1)   Alternative buffers. Buffer requirements may be adjusted through an
alternative compliance determination if one or more of the following objective
standards are met:
a.   Vertical separation. When a topographical change greater than 15 feet
exists, a buffer width may be reduced by 50 percent provided the balance of the
buffer material is placed at the top of the bank. Plantings may be placed on
the high side of the bank provided the bank does not exceed a 3:1 slope. A
section drawing is required.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/4317f255d3be89fb2864b8c9033ec06d02a5daf4/

vertical sep
b.   Horizontal separation. When an undisturbed area is greater than twice the
required buffer width, the number of required plant material in a buffer may be
reduced by 50 percent.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/4317f255d3be89fb2864b8c9033ec06d02a5daf4/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2474.png]
horizontal sep
c.   Geologic features, drainage channels or streams. The placement of plant
material may be adjusted to accommodate the natural features of a site provided
the total amount of required plant material is provided.
d.   Plant communities. The composition of a plant material in a buffer may be
adjusted to accommodate a naturally occurring plant community or a documented
historical pattern provided an equivalent number of plants are provided.
e.   Site constraints. For all infill and/or adaptive re-use sites where
existing utilities, structures, and/or other infrastructure creates a physical
constraint to providing the required buffers; buffer widths and plantings may
be reduced by 50 percent with the installation of a six-foot high, opaque
privacy fence or wall (finished face out). Plantings must be located within a
seven-foot side planting area located on the exterior of the fence facing the
adjacent property. This alternative may not be used when existing parking
infrastructure exceeds minimum parking requirements.
(2)   Alternative buffering from the street. Buffering from the street
requirements may be adjusted through an alternative compliance determination if
the following objective standards are met:
a.   A natural grade change or manmade berm creates a minimum three-foot
vertical separation and is completely covered with trees, shrubs, perennials,
and/or groundcover.
(3)   Alternative parking lot landscaping. Parking lot landscaping requirements
may be adjusted through an alternative compliance determination if one or more
of the following objective standards are met:
i.   Island size. The minimum island size of 200 square feet of planting area
per tree may be reduced to:
· 100 square feet per tree provided that a minimum width of four feet is
maintained and, when combined with a subsurface structure, provides a total
aerated area greater than 300 square feet per tree. Construction detail must be
provided.
· 150 square feet per tree provided that a minimum width of five feet is
maintained and, when combined with a pervious block paver, provides a total
pervious surface area greater than 300 square feet. Construction detail must be
provided.
· 150 square feet per tree provided that the islands are existing and the trees
are found to be in good health and are identified to be preserved on the
landscape plan.
ii.   Interior plantings (total number of plantings). The requirement for
plantings in interior islands may be reduced by 30 percent if all interior
islands and/or perimeter parking lot landscaping are designed to allow for
water collection and retention. These islands shall be planted with water
tolerant species and shall not be fenced. Construction detail(s) must be
provided.
iii.   Tree spacing and interior planting. The requirement for all parking
spaces to be located within 60 feet of a tree may be waived for businesses
whose parking fields double as outdoor display or storage areas, and the
requirement for plantings in interior islands may be reduced by 50 percent,
provided that the total interior island requirements are met with larger
consolidated islands where a minimum of 50 percent (total square footage) of
the islands are designed to allow for water collection and retention. The
islands shall be focused towards the perimeter of the site or in a central area
and designed so that stormwater runoff can be captured through bio- swales and
or constructed wetlands installed in these areas. These islands shall be
planted with water tolerant species and shall not be fenced. In no case shall
this standard be applied to typical parking lots where the vehicles are not
owned by a single entity. Construction detail(s) must be provided. This
reduction for tree spacing and interior planting shall not be applied to other
categories of landscaping required by this ordinance.
(4)   Alternative street tree requirements. Street tree requirements may be
adjusted through alternative compliance if one or more of the following
objective standards are met:
a.   Planting strip width. The required ten-foot wide planting strip for street
trees may be reduced if one or more of the following objective standards apply:
· An existing sidewalk, building(s) and/or other infrastructure prevents its
installation. In no case shall the planting strip be less than five feet wide
or planting area less than 200 square feet per large maturing tree, or 150
square feet per small maturing tree.
· The predominant existing street tree pattern within 500 feet (both directions
on both sides of the street) displays a different pattern. In no case shall the
planting strip be less than five feet wide.
· A subsurface structure is used to allow for an aerated area of 200 square
feet per tree. Construction detail must be provided.
· An adopted streetscape plan, corridor plan, and/or neighborhood plan calls
for a different standard and the development complies with this standard.
(5)   Other alternative compliance requests. All other alternative compliance
requests not identified in this subsection may be reviewed by the Asheville
Tree Commission who will act as an advisory board to the planning director. The
applicant for such a request shall submit a list of all adjacent property
owners to be notified by mail at least ten days in advance of the meeting of
the tree commission where the request is to be considered. All notices shall be
sent with delivery confirmation and shall state:
· A general description of the request
· The time and place of the meeting
· Contact information
· The requirements of this section (i—vii) with a description of how the
request meets each of these standards.
The commission, upon consideration of such a request may recommend approval,
approval with conditions, or denial of the request. After receiving the
recommendations of the tree commission, the planning director shall make the
final decision on such requests, and shall provide a copy of that decision to
any adjacent property owners who have requested one. In the event that the
planning director rejects the tree commission's recommendation, all adjacent
property owners will be notified in writing. Except as set forth in subsection
7-11-3(e)(5)b. below, the tree commission may not recommend, nor the planning
director approve, an alternative that reduces the standard requirements by more
than 50 percent. Applicants or other aggrieved parties may appeal a decision to
the Asheville Board of Adjustment in the manner provided for appeals of
administrative decisions in article VI of this chapter.
a.   Alternative compliance standards. No request for alternative compliance
under this section may be approved unless the information provided in support
of the request shows the following:
i.   The site in question is affected by physical conditions or constraints,
not attributable to proposed site design or building design, that make
compliance with the standard requirements practically impossible.
ii.   The physical conditions or constraints are not a result of the
applicant's own actions.
iii.   The proposed alternative will not present a safety hazard.
iv.   That proposed alternative will, upon maturity, provide landscaping that
is equal to or better than the standards requirements.
v.   The proposed alternative is designed to address plant health and vigor.
vi.   The proposed alternative is reasonably compatible with the natural and
topographic features of the site.
vii.   The proposed alternative supports the purpose statement noted in
7-11-2(a).
b.   Alternative compliance with existing structures and utilities. The
Asheville Tree Commission may recommend (and the planning director may approve)
landscape alternatives with a greater than 50 percent reduction where the
location of existing structures or utilities creates a situation where an
applicant wishing to reuse/rehabilitate a structure is unable to comply. In
these situations, the tree commission may recommend any degree of reduction but
shall also consider on-site alternatives to the landscape standards in order to
mitigate the loss of the required landscaping. Mitigation measures should be
considered by the commission in addition to the alternative compliance
standards set forth in subsection a. above.
(f)   Compliance and maintenance. Vegetation shall be planted and maintained to
ensure the best chance of survival and to reduce the potential expense of
replacing damaged plant materials
(1)   Certificate of compliance. Landscaping must be installed and inspected by
the City of Asheville prior to receiving a certificate of compliance. If the
season or weather conditions prohibit planting the materials, the developer may
provide a bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial surety in
an amount equal to one and one-half times the estimated cost of installing the
required landscaping to guarantee the completion of the required planting. Upon
approval of the financial surety, the certificate of compliance shall be
issued. The financial surety shall be for a period not to exceed 12 months. The
surety shall be canceled and/or returned upon completion of the required
landscaping.
If a developer provides satisfactory evidence that a bond or surety as required
by this paragraph has been requested and that the developer and project
otherwise qualify for said bond or surety, and that said request has been
turned down by two or more financial institutions for reasons unrelated to the
qualifications of the developer or project, the planning director may enter
into an agreement with the developer for the delayed completion of the required
work; provided, that said agreement may not apply to improvements or features
that are required for safety purposes, or are prescribed by statute or state
codes or regulations. By way of illustration and not limitation, said agreement
(1) shall establish a schedule for the completion of improvements, (2) shall
contain provisions relating to enforcement of its terms, and (3) shall specify
penalties for breach, (4) shall be subject to approval of the city attorney,
and (5) may be recorded in the office of the register of deeds wherein the
property is located. 
(2)   Maintenance. The owner or lessee of the property where landscaping is
required shall be responsible for the maintenance and protection of all
required and preserved plant and screening material. Landscaped areas shall be
maintained in good condition and kept free of debris. When street trees planted
to satisfy the requirements of 7-11-3(d)(3) are located in the public right-of-
way, they shall be maintained by the owner of the property that originally
installed said street trees for a period of two years after planting. 
(3)   Plant specifications.
a.   Recommended plant species. Plants may be chosen from the recommended plant
species list as maintained by the City. Specific riparian species, as
identified in the recommended species list, trees and shrubs for damp sites and
river districts, shall be required for developments located within the 100-year
flood plain. The list encourages the use of plant materials which are
indigenous to this region and are readily available from local nurseries. Plant
materials which are not on the list may also be used following approval from
the director of Development Services or designee.
b.   Minimum plant size requirements. All required vegetation shall meet the
following minimum size requirements at planting. Additionally, all plants must
meet the requirements of the most recent edition of the American Standards for
Nursery Stock, ANSI 260.1. Plants must be healthy, well- branched, and free of
disease and insect infestation.
i.   Large-maturing deciduous tree: Greater than 35 feet at maturity. Minimum
size at planting shall be two inches caliper and 12 to 14-foot height.
ii.   Small-maturing deciduous tree: Smaller than 35 feet at maturity. The
minimum tree size shall be at least one and one-half inch caliper or eight to
ten feet high at time of planting.
iii.   Evergreen tree: Minimum height of six feet at time of planting.
iv.   Large shrub: Minimum five gallon container or ten-inch root ball with a
height of 24 inches at time of planting.
v.   Small shrub: Minimum three gallon container or eight-inch root ball with a
height of 18 inches at time of planting.
(4)   Tree pruning standards. Trees located within the city's public right-of-
way cannot be pruned or removed without a permit from the Asheville Public
Works Department as required by chapter 20 of the Code of Ordinances of the
City of Asheville. All other required trees shall be pruned in accordance with
the American National Standard for Tree Care operations A300 published by the
American National Standards Institute. Tree owners and their agents are
encouraged to hire businesses that employ certified arborists who can supervise
the pruning work on site and ensure that proper pruning is being performed (See
the City of Asheville Standards and Specifications Manual for details). In
addition, the following standards shall apply to required trees:
a.   Co-dominant stems less than four inches in diameter at the fork shall be
pruned off and one main stem shall remain.
b.   Pruning shall be done such that a tree's natural form is maintained by the
greatest extent possible.
c.   Tree topping or heading is not permitted.
d.   Reasons for which tree pruning is not permitted include, but are not
limited to:
· Sign installation, clearance, or visibility; excluding traffic, directional,
warning, or information signs owned by any public or semi-public agency.
· Visibility of a structure and/or outdoor display area.
· Clearance for equipment traffic or storage, the erection of temporary
structures, or materials storage within the tree protection zone.
(5)   Failure to maintain. Failure to maintain or replace dead, damaged, or
diseased material or failure to maintain or repair a fence or wall installed as
a buffer shall constitute a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to
the penalty provisions in section
7-18-2 if not corrected or replaced within 30 days of notification. If an act
of God or other catastrophic event occurs which destroys a large quantity of
vegetation, the owner or lessee shall have 120 days to replant. Replaced plant
material must be in compliance with the minimum size, spacing, and quantity
standards of this chapter.
(6)   Un-approved removal or noncompliant pruning. Removing required
landscaping or undertaking pruning actions that do not conform to the
requirements of this section shall constitute a violation of this chapter and
shall be subject to the penalties described in chapter 10, appendix B.
Additionally, all affected areas must be replanted to current standards.
(g)   Clearing of land time limit. In districts where speculative grading is
prohibited and land is cleared through issuance of a grading permit; the owner
shall be required to replant the cleared property to its original state based
on tree counts and other information originally submitted to the City of
Asheville if construction does not begin within six months from the date that
the grading activity ceases.

Sec. 7-11-4. Open space standards.
(a)   Purpose. The open space standards contained herein are established to
provide for the reservation and protection of open spaces in both residential
and non-residential developments located in the City of Asheville. Providing
open space serves a variety of purposes, including promoting an environmental
ethic by creating comfortable, welcoming, accessible spaces that provide for
refuge, recreation, and contemplation in an outdoor environment. Open spaces
support a livable city by providing places and tree cover for shade, stormwater
mitigation, heat island mitigation, air quality, a diversity of wildlife
habitat, social opportunities, and the associated mental health benefits.
(b)   Applicability. These standards shall apply to:
1.   Major or minor subdivisions
2.   New construction meeting the threshold of a level I, II, or III
development project
(c)   Exemptions. The following are exempted from open space requirements.
1.   Projects located in the following zoning districts: CBD, CBD EXP, River
Arts Form District.
2.   Properties with historic landmark designations.
3.   Residential developments of seven or less units or lots
4.   Building expansions or additions that are less than 50% of the pre-
expansion gross floor area.
5.   Major subdivisions that, as an alternative to providing open space,
increase areas dedicated to Tree Canopy Preservation by an additional 10
percent.
(d)   General.
1.   Open space typologies.
a.   Recreational open space. Open space may include active or passive
recreation such as outdoor swimming pools, playgrounds, sport courts, dog
parks, community gardens, parks, pavilions, courtyards, seating areas, outdoor
dining areas, plazas or upper-level facilities such as shared or common
balconies, rooftop decks or rooftop gardens.
b.   Natural open space. Up to 50% of the required open space may include
naturally-occurring resources such as open water, streams, riparian areas,
wetlands, forested areas, tree canopy preservation areas, aquatic buffers/
floodplains and designated steep slope areas. In order to qualify, natural open
space areas must also provide pedestrian access on a path that must meet the
following:
i.   In addition to the path, at least one other amenity must be provided such
as seating/ benches, picnic tables, or viewing platforms;
ii.   The average slope of the path shall be less than 15 percent;
iii.   Paths must measure at least 80% of the longest distance (length or
width) of the open space or 500 feet, whichever is less.
c.   Public amenities. Land set aside for public use including greenways,
sidewalks, streetscape and hardscape areas that allow for public gathering such
as sidewalk cafe areas, areas containing public art, and similar urban
amenities that measure at least 14 feet wide may be counted in their entirety.
d.   Stormwater control measures. Above ground land used for stormwater
management (provided such land is not separately fenced) that is developed
using stormwater green infrastructure design methods and integrated into the
pedestrian experience (e.g. rain gardens, bioswales, green roofs or similar
features). Dry and wet detention basins, constructed wetlands, or similar
structures that have no pedestrian access (e.g. integrated trail, bench,
overlook, or other similar feature) shall not count for more than 25% of the
required open space.
e.   Property line buffer. Land designated as a property line buffer when
providing pedestrian access and with an average slope of less than 15 percent.
2.   Designation of open space. Areas that are shown as open space shall be
identified and recorded. Recorded documents may include: approved site plans,
subdivision plats, easements, or deeds.
3.   Subdivisions. Open space shall be located on its own lot, without any
homes, and commonly owned and/or deed restricted as open space.
4.   Availability. Open spaces may be restricted to owners, residents, or
members of a community or organization that is related to the development for
which the open space was required. If the open space is designated as a public
amenity, it shall be made available to the public but may be privately
maintained unless otherwise agreed to by the city.
5.   Maintenance. The owner or lessee of the property designated as the open
space shall be responsible for the maintenance of the open space area. Open
space areas, furniture, and required vegetation, shall be maintained in good
condition and shall be kept clear of debris and graffiti. Failure to maintain
the area shall constitute a violation of this chapter and subject the violator
to the penalty provisions of section
7-18-2. Alternatively, if approved and accepted by the city, the land may be
dedicated for public use and thereafter maintained by the city.
6.   Open space in perpetuity. All required open space shall be maintained in
perpetuity in accordance with the approved plan, unless an amendment to the
plan is approved.
(e)   Standards. Open space shall be provided based on the following.
1.   Quantity. The amount of required open space shall be based on the total
parcel area, except that for subdivisions road rights-of-way shall be
subtracted.
 
DEVELOPMENT TYPE        PERCENT OPEN SPACE
                        Less than 1 acre 1 acre or more
Subdivisions (8+ lots)  15%*
                        8-19 units: 10%
Multifamily Residential 20-49 units: 15% 50%*
                        50+ units: 20%
Non-Residential         10%              50%*
Mixed-use               10%              50%*
* See Permitted reductions, below
 
2.   Dimensions.
a.   Minimum dimension. The minimum dimension of any open space shall measure
at least 10 feet in all directions, except that rooftop or balcony open spaces
shall have a minimum dimension of seven feet in all directions.
b.   Minimum area. The minimum size of individual areas designated as open
spaces shall not be less than 400 square feet.
c.   Setbacks. Required setbacks may be counted towards open space but shall
not constitute more than 50 percent of the open space requirement.
d.   Subdivisions. In residential subdivisions, open spaces shall have at least
one side along street frontage that measures an average of at least 40 feet
wide for a minimum depth of 20 feet. As an alternative, a path or trail
measuring a minimum of 12 feet in width may be used to connect the street
frontage to a designated open space. In this alternative of a path to open
space, the required open space is increased to 120 percent of the required open
space and must provide pedestrian access that shall be identified and recorded
as such on the subdivision plat.
e.   Greenways. Greenways that are constructed for open space shall meet the
dimensional requirements as defined in the Standards and Specifications Details
Manual (SSMD). Fee-in-lieu may be applied for greenway areas that do not
provide sufficient open space on site.
f.   Contiguity. Open space should adjoin any neighboring areas of open space,
tree preservation areas, or other protected areas and non-protected natural
areas. In addition, open space shall meet the following requirements:
i.   At least 50 percent of the required open space must be located in one
contiguous area.
ii.   Open spaces containing retaining walls over 18 inches in height must
provide a walkable connection that is a minimum of six feet wide.
3.   Permeability. Open space areas shall not include surfaces that are more
than 50 percent impervious. This shall not apply to greenways. For open space
purposes, impervious surfaces that drain into designated open spaces using
stormwater green infrastructure techniques (e.g. disconnected impervious
surfaces, infiltration strip, bioswale, etc.) shall be considered pervious.
4.   Special open space standards.
a.   Projects in the Haywood Road Form District shall be subject to the open
space standards enumerated in that district alone.
b.   Projects located in the UV, NCD, and URD zoning districts shall follow the
standards enumerated above in addition to the special standards identified in
those zoning districts.
(f)   Permitted reductions of required open space. As an incentive for design
alternatives providing other public benefits, the open space requirements may
be reduced according to the options below.
1.   For development projects encompassing parcels one acre or more in size,
open space requirements may be reduced to the standards assigned to parcels
that are less than one acre if either:
a.   Stormwater. A project elects to meet the stormwater requirements found in
Sec.
7-12-2(f) or is otherwise required to meet those same requirements; in cases
where the pre-development runoff coefficient value or curve number of the site
is greater than 0.35 or 55, respectively, the pre-development runoff
coefficient value/curve number to be applied shall be 0.35/55, or
b.   Affordable housing. The project is predominantly (at least 50 percent)
residential and over 30 percent of the units meet the city's affordable housing
standard of being affordable to those at or below the percentage of area median
income specified in the City's Land Use Incentive (LUIG) policy with half of
the affordable units accepting rental assistance/housing choice vouchers.
2.   Open space requirements may be reduced by five percent when meeting the
following design elements:
a.   Cohesion. At least 70 percent of the required open space is contiguous.
b.   Slope. All required open space shall have an average slope of less than 15
percent with at least 50 percent of the open space maintaining an average slope
that is five percent or less.
c.   Shape. The shape of the open space shall be rectangular with the longest
dimension less than 160 percent of the shortest dimension, unless the average
width is greater than 40 feet.
d.   Seating. Seating shall be provided for the open space. For every 250
square feet of required open space, one linear foot of seating shall be
provided. Seating shall provide a mix of seating types, such as conventional
seating with armrests and backs as well as informal seating (i.e. steps, edges
of raised planters, boulders, etc).
3.   Greenways. If any portion of the site of the proposed development is
identified on the greenway master plan, and if the developer/applicant agrees
to dedicate all of the land necessary to complete the section of the greenway
through the subject property at no cost to the City, the open space requirement
may be reduced per the following:
a.   When the greenway easement is over ten percent of the site area, the open
space requirement shall be satisfied.
1.   When the greenway easement is less than ten percent of the site area,
additional open space shall be provided to meet a cumulative total of at least
ten percent, with a preference for the provision of open space to be adjacent
to the greenway.
(g)   Prohibitions. In no case shall open space contain any of the following:
1.   Streets, driveways, or parking areas
2.   Above-ground utility cabinets larger than two square feet
3.   Fenced stormwater ponds
4.   Structures, other than recreation community facilities such as outdoor
pools, playgrounds, and open air gazebos and pavilions
5.   Hazardous or toxic waste or materials as defined by state or federal
regulations (except if covered by a city-approved mitigation plan)
6.   Overhead electric transmission lines or their rights-of-way
7.   Natural gas transmission line rights-of-way
8.   Interior parking lot planting islands
(h)   Fee-in-lieu for open space. For open space requirements of 5,000 square
feet or less where the property does not contain a designated greenway as shown
on the Greenway Master Plan, a property owner may elect to pay a fee-in-lieu of
open space instead of providing the open space. In accordance with North
Carolina Statutes, this fee shall be calculated by using the pro rata value of
the designated open space based on the tax assessed value of the development or
subdivision as established by Buncombe County and shall be used to acquire or
develop recreation or open space areas serving residents of the development or
subdivision for which the fee was collected or more than one subdivision or
development within the immediate area. For open space requirements of more than
5,000 square feet, fee in lieu may not be used to satisfy the requirements.

(4)   Notwithstanding the above information, approval of a site specific
development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not
confer a zoning vested right unless and until the necessary variance is
obtained.
(5)   The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the
application of overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not
affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations
that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land-
use regulation by the City of Asheville, including, but not limited to,
building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. Otherwise
applicable new or amended regulations shall become effective with respect to
property that is subject to a site specific development plan upon the
expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this section.
(6)   A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and
run with the applicable property. After approval of a site specific development
plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise
such right while applicable.
(d)   Approval procedures and approving authority.
(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, an application for site

site specific development plan, the applicant must indicate at the time of
application, on a form to be provided by the City of Asheville, that a zoning
vested right is being sought.
(4)   Each map, plat, site plan, or other document evidencing a site specific
development plan shall contain the following notation: "Approval of this plan
establishes a zoning vested right under N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 160A-385.1. Unless
terminated at an earlier date, the zoning vested right shall be valid until
(date)."
(5)   Following approval or conditional approval of a site specific development
plan, nothing in this section shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews
and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the
original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not
inconsistent with the original approval.
(6)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit the revocation of the original
approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and

plat for a proposed subdivision shall not expire or be revoked because of the
running of time while a zoning vested right under this section is outstanding.
(f)   Termination. A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this
section shall terminate:
(1)   At the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and
uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed;
(2)   With the written consent of the affected landowner;
(3)   Upon findings by the Asheville City Council, by ordinance after notice
and a public hearing, that natural or manmade hazards on or in the immediate
vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the
public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as
contemplated in the site specific development plan;
(4)   Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all costs,
expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not
limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural
planning, marketing, legal, and other consultant's fees incurred after approval
by the city, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid.
Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property
which is caused by such action;
(5)   Upon findings by the Asheville City Council, by ordinance after notice

right with respect to the properties subject to the petition has been
established under N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 160A-385.1 or N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 153A-
344.1. A statement that declares that no zoning vested right has been
established under N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 160A-385.1 or N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 153A-
344.1, or the failure to sign a statement declaring whether or not a zoning
vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner and any
such zoning vested right shall be terminated.
(h)   Limitations. Nothing in this section is intended or shall be deemed to
create any vested right other than those established pursuant to N.C. Gen.
Stat. sec. 160A-385.1.
(i)   Repeal. In the event that N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 160A-385.1 is repealed,

(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97; Ord. No. 3417, § 1(d), 11-28-06)
Sec. 7-11-6. Traffic impact analysis.
(a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure that applicants for new
construction, additions and/or expansions to existing structures, and/or
changes of use consider and mitigate the impact of the development on the
existing and/or proposed roadway system. While the city and the State of North
Carolina recognize their responsibility to build and maintain a public
transportation system, the project applicants may need to assist in improving
transportation facilities in order to maintain the existing level of service by
accommodating additional traffic generated by the development. These
transportation facilities involve pedestrian, non-motorized vehicular traffic
and motorized vehicular traffic. The city's traffic engineering division will
provide any necessary assistance in the preliminary review of these
requirements.
(b)   Traffic impact analysis required. All proposals for new construction,
additions and/or expansions to existing structures, and/or changes of use which
will result in total peak hour trips equal to or greater than 100 peak hour
trips using trip generation rates from the most recent edition of the Trip
Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers shall
include an analysis of the traffic to be generated. The traffic impact analysis
shall be submitted with the project application and shall include the following
information:
(1)   Introduction and summary.
a.   Purpose of report and study objectives.
b.   Executive summary.
1.   Site location and study area.
2.   Development description.
3.   Principal findings.
4.   Conclusions.
5.   Recommendations.
(2)   Proposed development (site and nearby)
a.   Off-site development - provide map (the city's traffic engineer will
identify).
b.   Description of on-site development.
1.   Land use and intensity.
2.   Location - provide vicinity map.
3.   Site plan.
4.   Zoning.
5.   Phasing and timing.
(3)   Area conditions.
a.   Study area (includes the project area and extends to any intersection
where the volume of peak hour traffic on any approach leg will be increased by
ten percent or more as a result of the additional traffic generated by the

Sec. 7-11-7. Flexible development standards.
(a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide the planning and
development director, design review boards, and city council, as applicable,
with the authority to allow deviations from the development standards for
setbacks, front and corner side setbacks, lot area and dimension, number of
parking spaces, signage, open space, landscaping, height, and building floor
area set forth in this chapter provided that certain conditions exist. The
intent of this section is to promote the orderly and efficient development of
property.
(b)   Approval of flexible development standards. Regardless of the minimum
development standards otherwise required in this Code, the planning and
development director shall administer the following flexible development
standards for the purpose of facilitating the orderly development and
redevelopment of property within the City of Asheville. Determination of the
applicability of flexible development standards shall be made by the planning
and development director, design review boards, and city council, as applicable
and as provided in this section. The planning and development director, design
review boards, and city council may place conditions on an approval to assure
that the circumstances which warranted the application of the flexible
development standards are maintained. Decisions by the planning and development
director shall be in writing and may be appealed to the board of adjustment by
following the procedures for such appeals provided in section
7-6-2 of this chapter.
(c)   Flexible development standards permitted. The cumulative total of any
flexible development standard applied to a property by category or location
shall not exceed the maximums set forth in this section. The planning and
development director shall maintain appropriate records to insure compliance
with this provision.
(1)   Setbacks. The planning and development director is authorized to approve
requests that deviate from required setbacks set forth in article VIII of this
chapter as follows:
a.   Building additions - all zoning districts. Setbacks may be adjusted when
flexibility is needed to accommodate a building addition that is less than 50
percent of the pre-existing gross floor area. In these instances, a deviation
of ten percent or 24 inches, whichever is greater, may be granted upon
determining that one or more of the following conditions exists:
i.   The lot does not meet the dimensional standards established for the zoning
district in which it is located.
ii.   The structure is physically in line with an existing, legally established
wall or walls of a principal structure already within the minimum setback area.
iii.   The part of the proposed structure that would encroach into the minimum
setback area is less than 50 percent of the width of the affected building
facade(s), provided the part of the structure that would encroach into a front
setback shall either be open, unheated space (such as a porch or screen room)
or not subject to occupancy (such as a chimney).
iv.   The part of the proposed structure that encroaches into the minimum
setback area is necessitated by a life-safety code, flood hazard reduction,
Americans with Disabilities Act standard, or other public safety code
requirements.
b.   Structures located in local historic districts and local historic
landmarks. Setbacks may be adjusted for structures undergoing design review
when flexibility is needed in order to comply with design standards. In these
instances setbacks may be adjusted as follows:
i.   Primary structures. Setbacks may be adjusted up to ten percent or 24
inches, whichever is greater.
ii.   Accessory structures. Side and rear setbacks may be adjusted up to 36
inches.
(2)   Parking garages and parking lots. Except for parking required for
residential development of less than five units, the planning and development
director is authorized to approve parking garages and parking lots in
connection with a permitted use that has up to 25 percent less than the
required number of spaces set forth in article XI of this chapter upon
determining that one or more of the following conditions exists:
a.   The applicant is proposing an adaptive reuse that does not expand the pre-
existing floor area of an existing structure with a permitted use.
b.   The applicant is constructing an addition to an existing structure or site
and sufficient new parking will be provided to accommodate the additional
square footage without reducing the amount of parking serving the existing
structure or site prior to the addition.
c.   The proposed parking lot or garage will allow the preservation of an
existing aquatic buffer or floodway.
d.   The proposed parking lot or garage will accommodate a tree canopy
preservation area where the entirety of the requirement is met by preserving
existing canopy.
These reductions may not be used in conjunction with reductions offered
elsewhere in this chapter.
(3)   Variances. No variances shall be allowed under article VI of this chapter
with regard to deviations from development standards that have been approved
pursuant to this section of the city Code nor shall any deviations from these
development standards make void or otherwise modify any variance decision by
the board of adjustment.

Sec. 7-11-8. Sidewalk requirements.
(a)   Purpose. The purposes of this section are to insure that adequate
provision of transportation and other public requirements, the promotion of
health, safety and the general welfare and the coordination of streets and
other public facilities are considered in the development and use of property
and that development and use of property are done in accordance with an adopted
City of Asheville (herein "city"), transportation or corridor plan, including
but not limited to such plans as the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP),
greenway, neighborhood, small area, and pedestrian thoroughfare plans. The city
council hereby incorporates by reference as if set forth in full herein the
findings of the city's pedestrian thoroughfare plan and further finds and
declares that the construction of sidewalks advances those interests of the
city and, in order to accomplish those purposes, this section sets out
requirements for the construction of sidewalks and, where a developer requests
it and certain conditions exist, for the payment of a fee in lieu of the
requirement for construction of sidewalks.
(b)   Guidelines for requiring sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required for all
new construction and for renovations, additions and/or expansions to existing
structures which fall into one or more of the following categories:
(1)   All new single-family residential development which consists of 20 or
more single-family homes;
(2)   All new multi-family residential development, except for the construction
of less than ten units;
(3)   All new office, institutional, commercial, and industrial development;
(4)   All existing office, institutional, commercial, and industrial
development additions or expansions to structures where the expansion results
in an increase of more than 75 percent value of the structure as defined in
section 7-11-1 of this chapter.
(5)   All new streets, improved streets or extension to streets.
(c)   Additional conditions for requiring sidewalks. Notwithstanding subsection
(b) above, the following findings must be made prior to the city engineer/
designee requiring the construction of a new sidewalk or a "fee in lieu of
constructing a sidewalk” for an applicable project. One or more of the
following conditions must be met, as determined by the city engineer/designee.
(1)   The applicable project area, including the street frontage, is identified
as a needed pedestrian linkage within an adopted city transportation or
corridor plan, including but not limited to such plans as the Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP), greenway, neighborhood, small area, and pedestrian
thoroughfare plans.
(2)   The current or projected (within five years) average daily traffic count
(ADT) for the street is 300 vehicles per day or more as determined by the city
traffic engineer. Traffic generated from the applicable project or any
additions to the applicable project will be included in calculating the ADT for
this condition.
In the event that the sidewalk is not required, the developer must provide a
recorded easement, if necessary, for the future development of the sidewalk.
The developer wherever practical shall grade for the future development of a
sidewalk.
(d)   Public and private streets. Sidewalks shall be constructed along all
public and private street frontages that meet the requirements of subsection(c)
above of the lot for which the development is proposed.
All sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the standards set forth
in the city's Standard Specifications and Details Manual.
(e)   Fee in lieu of construction. Where a new sidewalk is required to be
constructed, a fee in lieu of that sidewalk may be paid if one or more of the
following conditions apply:
(1)   The sidewalk is proposed to be constructed within an existing right-of-
way where sufficient right-of-way or easement width does not exist or cannot be
dedicated to build the sidewalk without reducing existing transportation
facilities such as travel lanes, on-street parking, bike lanes, and the
adaptive reuse or preservation of an existing building or structure prevents
extending the sidewalk onto private property. In these instances, compliance to
the maximum extent practicable is required and a fee is paid for the balance of
sidewalk not constructed.
(2)   The sidewalk is a part of a publicly funded project that includes
sidewalks and construction is scheduled to begin within two years of
permitting. In this case, the developer would pay the fee based on the public
agency's design.
(3)   The total project costs are less than $100,000.00 and the cost of the
construction of the sidewalk would exceed 15 percent of the total cost of the
approved project.
(4)   The traffic volumes on an existing road, including any added trips
expected as a result of the project, do not exceed 500 vehicles per day and the
required sidewalk is more than 1,320 feet (one-fourth mile) from an existing
sidewalk, measured from the closest points along the road frontage.
(5)   When the sidewalk would require the relocation of multiple public utility
facilities or structures.
(6)   The sidewalk would be located in a floodway and a no rise certification
can not be obtained and a CLOMR cannot be approved without the requirement of
purchasing additional affected properties.
(7)   The sidewalk would require construction and/or grading to occur on
adjacent property to connect to future sidewalk and where there is no right-of-
way or easement available. In these instances, compliance to the maximum extent
practicable is required and a fee is paid for the balance of sidewalk not
constructed. Additionally, an easement sufficient to provide future connections
shall be provided.
The fee shall be based on the amounts identified in the city's Fees and Charges
Manual and may be prorated based on partial compliance. In no case shall the
fee in lieu of constructing the sidewalk exceed 15 percent of the total cost of
the approved project. The total cost of the project shall include all
construction costs associated with the improvement as approved by the city.
In the event that a fee in lieu of constructing a sidewalk is approved, the
developer must provide a recorded easement if necessary for the future
development of the sidewalk. All fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of
the zoning permit and shall not transfer to future projects on the same
property.
The developer wherever practical shall grade for the future development of a
sidewalk.
(f)   Use of fees. All fees collected by the city pursuant to these provisions
shall be accounted for separately from other monies, shall be expended only for
the construction or rehabilitation of sidewalks or other pedestrian
improvements in the city.

(a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure that buildings and
structures shall not interfere with the city's communication network.
Developments shall be modified to accommodate the needs of the city's
communications network, to eliminate any interference a development would
create or otherwise accommodate the needs of the city's communication network
within the development proposal. Adequate provisions shall be made for a radio
signal booster system which will correct for a reduction in the radio signal to
a level below that required to assure the 95 percent area coverage reliability
needed for public safety communications.
(b)   Radio signal booster system required. Except as otherwise provided no
person shall maintain, own, erect, or construct, any building or structure or
any part thereof, or cause the same to be done which fails to support adequate
radio coverage for public safety entities, including, but not limited to,
firefighters, emergency medical services and police officers. The following
structures are exempt from these requirements:
(1)   Single-family residential buildings; any building constructed of wood
frame; any building 25 feet high or less; as long as none of the aforementioned
buildings make primary use of metal on concrete construction or contain below
grade storage or parking areas. For purposes of this section, parking
structures are included in the definition of buildings, and stair shafts are
included in the definition of all parts of a building, but elevators may be
excluded.
(2)   Buildings constructed prior to the effective date of this section
(February 12, 2008) shall be required to comply with public safety radio
coverage provisions of this section. However, should exempted structures
undergo renovation or modification where the cost of the renovation or
modification exceeds 75 percent of the appraised value of the structure this
exemption shall not apply.
(c)   Easements. The city may require an easement to utilize the roof for
communications infrastructure components to support current and future public
safety communication needs. This includes, but is not limited to a 12 feet × 25
feet rooftop area for; antennas, base stations, UPS power supplies, and
microwave dish antennas. The building owners shall provide a secure climate
controlled environment, no less than ten feet × 20 feet × ten feet, suitable
for sensitive electronic equipment. This room shall be located within the top
floor of roof area to allow for less than 100-foot cable runs to the antenna
locations. Power for the equipment in this room shall be fed from the building
emergency generator. Additional construction specifications will be made
available as required.
(d)   Specifications. All emergency wireless communications shall be
constructed in accordance with the standards set forth in the City of Asheville
Standards and Specifications Manual.
(e)   Alternative standards. Based on sound telecommunication engineering
practices, the information technology director or his designee may approve
alternative standards that are equal to or better than those set forth in this
chapter and in the City of Asheville Standards and Specifications Manual.

soften and spread the light being distributed from the light source thereby
reducing direct glare.
(c)   Light measurement technique. Light level measurements shall be made at
the property line of the property upon which light to be measured is being
generated. If measurement on private property is not possible or practical,
light level measurements may be made at the boundary of the public street
right-of-way that adjoins the property of the complainant or at any other
location on the property of the complainant. Measurements shall be made at
finished grade (ground level), with the light-registering portion of the meter
held parallel to the ground pointing up. The meter shall have cosine and color
correction and have an accuracy tolerance of no greater than plus or minus five
percent. Measurements shall be taken with a light meter that has been
calibrated within two years. Light levels are specified, calculated and
measured in footcandles. All footcandle values below are maintained
footcandles.

shall comply with the following light levels limits, uniformity ratios and
other criteria listed below:
a.   Open parking facilities - For lighted parking lots the recommended minimum
light level shall be no less than 0.2 footcandles. All light levels are
measured at ground level. The minimum light level requirements vary depending
on the activity classification. The specified minimum FC value above 0.2 FC as
outlined in the following table means that the lowest light level point or
location in the parking lot must not exceed the minimum stated FC value in the
table (i.e. 0.9 FC for large shopping centers). An average to minimum
uniformity ratio of 4:1 means that the average FC to minimum FC ratio cannot be
worse (higher) than 4:1. See the following table:

ARTICLE XII. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION STANDARDS
Sec. 7-12-1. Flood damage prevention.
(a)   Authority, purpose, objectives, findings.
(1)   Authority: This section is adopted pursuant to Part 6, Article 21 of
Chapter 143; Article 6 of Chapter 153A; Article 8 of Chapter 160A; and Article
7, 9, and 11 of Chapter 160D of the North Carolina General Statutes.
(2)   Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to promote public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
a.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
b.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
c.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation and
restrain of floodwaters;
d.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
e.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(3)   Objectives: The objectives of this section are to:
a.   Protect human life, safety, and health;
b.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas
mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that
are located in flood prone areas;
c.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
d.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
e.   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
f.   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood
hazard area;
g.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
damage;
h.   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
i.   Make flood insurance available to the community through the National Flood
Insurance Program; and
j.   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains.
k.   Maintain the City's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(4)   Findings:
a.   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Asheville
(city) are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
b.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
(b)   General provisions.
(1)   Applicability: This section shall apply to all special flood hazard areas
within the city's territorial jurisdiction, including extra-territorial
jurisdictions (ETJs), as allowed by law, of the City of Asheville.
(2)   Effect upon outstanding floodplain development permits: Nothing herein
contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size, or

entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
n.   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a flood
hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for the
more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood elevation
shall apply.
o.   The Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation ("RFPE"), where Base Flood
Elevations (BFEs) have been determined, shall be the BFE plus the freeboard of
two (2) feet. In "Special Flood Hazard Areas" where no BFE has been
established, the RFPE this elevation shall be at least two (2) feet above the
highest adjacent grade.
p.   If the elevation requirement for any development differs from that imposed
by the North Carolina State Building Code, said development shall be permitted
to exceed its maximum height limitation by an amount equal to the difference in
the elevation requirements set by this ordinance and that of the State Building
Code.
(2)   Specific standards: In all special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in subsection 7-12-1 (b)
(3), or subsection 7-12-1 (e)(3), the following provisions, in addition to the
provisions of subsection 7-12-1 (e)(1), are required:
a.   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of
any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation as defined in section 7-2-5.
b.   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure shall have
the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation as defined in section 7-2-5. Structures located in
zones referenced on the FIRM as A, AE, AO, and A1-30, may be flood- proofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO zones, as reference on the FIRM, the
flood-proofing elevation shall be in accordance with subsection 7-12-1 (e)(6)b.
A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in subsection 7-12-1 (d)
(3), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
c.   Manufactured homes.
1.   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the
reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation as defined in section 7-2-5.
2.   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored

certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most current
edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured Homes
adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to N.C.G.S. 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is
above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
3.   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of subsection 7-12-1(e)(2)d.
4.   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of
all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home
parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This plan shall be
filed with and approved by the floodplain administrator and the local emergency
management coordinator.
d.   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed areas of new construction and
substantially improved structures which are below the lowest floor:
1.   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used
for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area
shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door)
or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior door), or entry
to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such
enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, except
to enclose storage areas;
2.   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to the
regulatory flood protection elevation;
3.   Shall include, in zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, as referenced on the FIRM,
flood openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the
openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
meet or exceed the following minimum design criteria:

foot above the adjacent grade;
(v)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings
or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions; and
(vi)    Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for
regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or
wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure
and requires flood openings as outlined above.
e.   Additions/improvements.
1.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition
and/or improvement is in combination with any interior modifications to the
existing structure are:
(i)   Not a substantial improvement: the addition and/or improvement must be
designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non- conforming
than the existing structure.
(ii)   A substantial improvement: Both the existing structure and the addition
and/or improvement must comply with the standards for new construction.
2.   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
3.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the addition
and/or improvement is in combination with any interior modifications to the
existing structure are:
(i)   Not a substantial improvement: the addition and/or improvement must only
comply with the standards for new construction.
(ii)   A substantial improvement: Both the existing structure and the addition
and/or improvement must comply with the standards for new construction.
4.   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one (1) year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market
value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply
with the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the
one (1) year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of
that building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance.
If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered
substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
requirement does not, however, include either:
(i)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing
health, sanitary or safety code violations identified and notified by the
building official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living
conditions.
(ii)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, as
determined by obtainment of a variance as specified in section 7-12-1(f).
f.   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
1.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and
ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is

2.   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible for the
removal of the temporary structure;
3.   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be removed
(i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or immediately upon
flood warning notification);
4.   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
5.   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside the
special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
h.   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages,
etc.) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the following
criteria shall be met:
1.   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation (including
working, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas);
2.   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
3.   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;

forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in
conformance with the provisions of subsection 7-12-1(e)(2)d.3.
An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet that
satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or flood-
proofing certificate. Elevation or flood- proofing certifications are required
for all other accessory structures in accordance with subsection 7-12-1(d)(3).
(3)   Standards for floodplains without established base flood elevations:
Within the special flood hazard areas designated as approximate zone A as
referenced on the FIRM and established in subsection 7-12-1 (b)(3), where no
base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following
provisions, in addition to the provisions of subsection 7-12-1 (e)(1), shall
apply:
a.   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet
each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is
greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
b.   The base flood elevation (BFE) used in determining the regulatory flood
protection elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria:
1.   When BFE data is available from other sources, all new construction and
substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all
applicable provisions of this section and shall be elevated or flood-proofed in
accordance with standards in subsection 7-12-1(e)(1) and (2).
2.   When floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other source,
all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway areas shall
also comply with the requirements of subsection 7-12-1(e)(2) and (5).
3.   All subdivision, manufactured home parks and other development proposals
shall provide BFE data if development is greater than five acres or has more
than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such BFE data shall be adopted by
reference in accordance with subsection 7-12-1(b)(3) and utilized in
implementing this chapter.
4.   When BFE data is not available from a federal, state, or other source as
outlined above the reference level shall be elevated or flood-proofed
(nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All
other applicable provisions of subsection 7-12-1(e) shall also apply.
(4)   Standards for riverine floodplains with BFE but without established
floodways or non-encroachment areas: Along rivers and streams where BFE data is
provided by FEMA or is available but neither floodway nor non-encroachment
areas are identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS
report, the following requirements shall apply to all development within such
areas:
a.   Standards of subsection 7-12-1(e)(1) and (2); and
b.   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation during the occurrence of the base flood more than one foot at any
point within the community.
(5)   Floodways and non-encroachment areas: Areas designated as floodways or
non-encroachment areas are located within the special flood hazard areas
established in subsection 7-12-1 (b)(3). The floodways and non-encroachment
areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that
have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The
following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in subsection 7-12-1
(e)(1) and (2), shall apply to all development within such areas:
a.   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
1.   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment will not increase the
water surface elevations during the occurrence of the base flood, based on
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a registered professional
engineer in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the
floodplain administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit, or
2.   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A
letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the
proposed encroachment.
b.   If subsection 7-12-1(e)(5)a. is satisfied, all development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
c.   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured
homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the
following provisions are met:
1.   The anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection 7-12-1(e)(2)c; and
2.   The no encroachment standard of subsection 7-12-1(e)(5)a.
d.   No new habitable structures or substantial improvements to habitable
structures shall be permitted in floodways and non-encroachment areas, except
this subsection shall not be applicable to structures that have substantial
damage, provided the rebuilt habitable structure meets the standards of this
Section (7-12-1).
(6)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (zone AO as referenced on the
FIRM): Located within the special flood hazard areas established in subsection
7-12-1(b)(3), are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to subsection 7-12-1(e)(1) and
(2), all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following
requirements:
a.   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth number
specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a freeboard of
two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two feet above the
highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
b.   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be flood-proofed to
the same level as required in subsection 7-12-1(e)(6)a. so that the structure,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that level shall
be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required in
accordance with subsection 7-12-1(d)(3) and subsection 7-12-1(e)(2)b.
c.   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes, to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(7)   Nonconforming uses: A structure(s) or the use(s) of a structure or
premises which are lawful before the effective date of this section, or before
any amendment to this section after that date, but which is not in conformity
with the provisions herein may be continued as a nonconforming use, or for the
purposes of this section may be changed to another nonconforming use (changes
in use shall be made in conformance with subsection 7-12-1(e)). Changes in
ownership of any property under the jurisdiction of this section shall not
affect the continued operation of the nonconforming use. All nonconforming uses
shall be subject to the following conditions:
a.   Any substantial improvement of a nonconforming structure shall be made in
compliance with the provisions of this section.
b.   If the nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 180 or more
consecutive days, and there are no substantial good faith efforts to re-
establish the use during this period, any future use of the building and/or
premises shall conform to this section. Obtaining permits to maintain the
existing use or significant continuous efforts to market the property for sale
or lease for the existing use (e.g., MLS listing, realtor contract, etc.),
shall be regarded as substantial good faith efforts. A nonconforming use shall
be deemed discontinued after a period of more than two years regardless of any
substantial good faith efforts to re-establish the use and any future use of
the building and/or premises shall conform to section.
c.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7-17-4, if any nonconforming use
or structure or substantial improvement is destroyed or substantially damaged
by any means, including floods, said use or structure may only be repaired or
replaced if it is brought into compliance with the requirements of this
ordinance (Sec. 7-12-1. Flood Damage Prevention). In all instances, a
registered professional engineer shall provide the floodplain administrator
with an acceptable certification demonstrating that said replacement would not
result in an increase in the current regulatory flood elevation.
d.   Any use which has been permitted as a restricted use and is in full
compliance with this section and attached standards shall be considered a
conforming use.
e.   Any change of a nonconforming use as specified herein shall be approved by
the board of adjustment under the provisions of this section. Proposed changes
in a nonconforming use to a residential use shall be expressly prohibited.
(f)   Variances.
(1)   Petition for a variance: Any aggrieved person may petition for a variance
to the board adjustment for the following:
a.   The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
b.   Functionally dependent facilities provided the provisions of subsections
7-12-1(f)(3) and (f)(4) have been satisfied, and such facilities are protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threats to public safety.
c.   Any other type of development, provided it meets the requirements of this
section.
(2)   Prerequisites to considering a request for a variance: Prior to
considering a request for a variance, the board of adjustment shall be provided
with a written report from the floodplain administrator specifying whether all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in this
section have been met. Additionally, a separate written report addressing each
of the following factors shall be submitted with the application for a
variance:
a.   Whether there exists any danger that materials may be swept onto other
lands to the injury of others;
b.   Whether there is any danger to life and property due to flooding or
erosion damage;
c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as a functionally
dependent facility, where applicable;
f.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
k.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(3)   Requirements for the granting of variances: The board of adjustment may
only grant a variance if the applicant satisfies all of the following
requirements:
a.   The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to
afford relief.
b.   No development permit has been approved. [For purposes of this section,
trade permits (i.e. to elevate electric structures and get power back on) or
permits associated with post-event demolition and debris removal are not
considered development permits.]
c.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
d.   Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship.
e.   The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create
nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
f.   The granting of the variances will not make the structure in violation of
other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances; and
g.   The granting of the variance is within the designated floodway or non-
encroachment area and will not result in any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge.
(4)   Conditions: The board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives of this section.
(5)   Special facilities: Solid waste disposal facilities or sites, hazardous
waste management facilities, salvage yards, auto salvage-wrecking yards, and
chemical storage facilities that are located in special flood hazard areas are

requirements, the following additional requirements are met.
a.   The use serves a critical need in the community.
b.   No feasible location exists for the use outside the special flood hazard
area.
c.   The reference level of any structure is elevated or flood-proofed to at
least the regulatory flood protection elevation.
d.   The use complies with all other applicable federal, state and local laws.
e.   The city has notified the Secretary of the North Carolina Department of
Public Safety of an application for the issuance of a variance at least 30
calendar days prior to the consideration of the variance request.
(6)   Notice: The floodplain administrator shall provide written notice to any
applicant to whom a variance is granted specifying the difference between the
base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be
built and that such construction below the BFE increases risks to life and
property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the BFE will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25.00
per $100.00 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a
record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
(7)   Records: The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the State of North Carolina upon request.
(g)   Entry upon public/private property.

should fail to take prompt corrective action to remedy the violation, then the
floodplain administrator shall proceed in accordance with subsection 7-12-1(i)
of this section.
(i)   Enforcement.
(1)   Civil penalty: Any person who violates the flood protection regulations
of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty. The maximum civil penalty
for a violation is $25,000.00. A civil penalty may be assessed from the date of
the violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate
violation. The floodplain administrator is hereby charged with the
responsibility of preparing a table of civil penalties, setting forth the per
day and maximum penalties that may be assessed for violations of this section
taking into consideration the guidelines for penalty assessment as outlined
herein, so as to be in compliance with the $25,000.00 maximum civil penalty
involving the same subject matter within a six-month period of time.
(2)   Civil penalty assessment: Upon the failure to comply within the time
frame set forth in the notice of violation, the floodplain administrator shall
give notice of assessment of a civil penalty by providing notice of the civil
penalty amount and the basis for assessment to the person assessed. The
assessment of a penalty shall be served personally or by any means authorized
under Rule 4 of the N.C. Rules of Civil Procedure and shall direct the violator
to either pay the assessment or contest the assessment in writing, within 30
days after receipt of the notice of assessment. The office of the floodplain
administrator shall initially assess the civil penalty.
(3)   Guidelines for penalty assessment: In determining the amount of the
penalty to assess, the floodplain administrator shall be guided by the degree
and extent of harm to the natural resources of the city, to the public health,
or to private property resulting from the violation; the duration and gravity
of the violation; the effect on water quality; the cost of rectifying the
damage; the amount of money the violator saved by noncompliance, whether the
violation was committed willfully and the prior record of the violation in
complying or failing to comply with this ordinance.
(4)   Criminal penalties: A violation of this section subjects the offender to
a civil penalty pursuant to the authority granted by N.C.G.S. 160A-175 and does
not subject the offender to the criminal penalty provisions of N.C.G.S. 14-
4 and section 1-5 of Chapter 1 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of
Asheville.
(5)   Stop work order: If, through inspection, it is determined that a building
or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in
violation of this section, or other applicable local development regulation or
any state law delegated to the local government for enforcement purposes in
lieu of the state undertaken in substantial violation of any state or local
law, or in a manner that endangers life or property, staff may order the work
or activity to be immediately stopped. The stop- work order shall be in writing
and directed to the person doing or in charge of the work. The stop-work order
shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reason(s) for the
stoppage, and the condition(s) under which the work may be resumed. The city
shall send the stop work order in writing pursuant to section 7-12-1(h)(2)
above.
(6)   Revocation: The floodplain administrator may revoke and require the
return of the floodplain development permit by notifying the permit holder in
writing stating the reason(s) for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for
any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, and
specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state
or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing
the permit. Any floodplain development permit mistakenly issued in violation of
an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. The notice of revocation
shall be served in writing pursuant to section 7-12-1(h)(1) above, stating the
reason for the revocation and the revocation shall follow the same permit
approval and review process required for issuance of the permit, including
notice requirements.
(7)   Permit reinstatement. A new permit application and approved plan
including all permit fees must be submitted prior to reinstatement of the
revoked permit. For permit reinstatement, the site must be deemed to be in
compliance with the requirements of this section and all penalties have been
paid in full or penalty appeal has been filed within the given time frame.
(8)   Order to abate: If, subsequent to an appeal hearing, the floodplain
administrator find that the building or development is in violation of this
section, a written order shall be issued to the property owner requiring the
owner to remedy the violation and such remedial action may consist of an order
to alter, vacate, remove, or demolish the building, as long as the notice of
violation provided prior notice that such an order may be entered and such
order may require that such remedial action be taken not less than 60 calendar
days, nor more than 180 calendar days. Where the floodplain administrator finds
that there is imminent danger to life or other property, the order may require
that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. An
appeal may be taken from the order as set forth herein.
(9)   Action for failure to comply and failure to appeal and/or pay: If
violations are not cured or corrected within the time specified in the notice
of violation and/or the violator fails to give timely notice of appeal or fails
to pay the civil penalty assessed within the prescribed time period, then the
matter may be referred to the city's debt set-off program and/or referred to
the city attorney for institution of a civil action in the name of the city in
a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition to, or in lieu of, the other
remedies set forth in this section, the city attorney may institute an
injunctive action, mandamus action, or other appropriate proceeding. Upon
determining that an alleged violation is occurring or is threatened, a court
hearing an appeal for relief shall enter such orders and/or judgments as are
necessary to abate or prevent the violation. The institution of an action for
injunctive or other relief under this section shall not relieve any party to
such proceeding from any civil penalty prescribed by this section for
violations of this section.
(j)   Appeals.
(1)   Appeals: Any aggrieved party may file an appeal for or from the issuance
of a variance, or from a penalty assessment, notice of violation, permit
disapproval, order, requirement, determination or interpretation rendered under
the provisions of this section. The appeals process shall be as follows:
a.   To the floodplain administrator: With the exception of appealing for the
issuance of a variance, all appeals must initially be heard by the floodplain
administrator. The appeal must be submitted in writing within 30 days of
receipt of an adverse action and shall specify the specific grounds for relief
and what relief is requested. The floodplain administrator shall schedule a
hearing no later than 30 days from receipt of the written notice of appeal. The
owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present
arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter. Further appeal may be taken to
the board of adjustment as set forth below. in the absence of an appeal, the
order of the floodplain administrator shall be final.
b.   To the Asheville Board of Adjustment: Further appeal may be taken to the
Asheville Board of Adjustment in accordance with and pursuant to the written
requirements of the board and section 7-6-2 of the UDO.
c.   To the Buncombe County Superior Court: Every decision of the board shall

Sec. 7-12-2. Stormwater, soil erosion and sedimentation control, illicit
discharge and connection ordinance.
(a)   Authority, purpose, objective, findings, jurisdiction, applicability,
exemptions.
(1)   Authority: This section is adopted pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 143-214.7 and
applicable rules promulgated by the North Carolina Environmental Management
Commission (NCEMC) thereunder; Session Law 2006- 246; chapter 160A (Cities and
Towns), article 14; chapter 160D (Local Planning and Development Regulation)
article 9; section 5 of the North Carolina Constitution; chapter 113A, article
4 (Sedimentation Pollution Control); article 21, part 6 (Floodway Regulations).
(2)   Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to comply with the federal and
corresponding state stormwater discharge National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) regulations; to protect, maintain and enhance the
environment of the City of Asheville (City), by establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the potential adverse effects of
increased stormwater runoff associated with both future development and
existing developed land and non-point and point source pollution associated
with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges into
municipal stormwater systems; to regulate the clearing, grading, excavation,
filling and manipulation of the earth and the moving and storing of waters in
order to control and prevent accelerated soil erosion and sedimentation; and to
establish decision-making processes for development that protect the integrity
of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources.
(3)   Objectives: To assure the city of the authority to take any action
required by it to obtain and comply with its NPDES permit for stormwater
discharges. Among other things, these regulations require the city to establish
legal authority which authorizes or enables the city at a minimum to:
a.   Control the contribution of pollutants to the city's MS4 and receiving
waters by stormwater discharges associated with residential, commercial,
industrial, and related facility activity and the quality of stormwater
discharged from sites of residential, commercial, industrial, and related
facility activity; and
b.   Prohibit illicit discharges and illicit connections to the city's MS4 and
receiving waters; and control the discharge to the city's MS4 and receiving
waters, of spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater; and
c.   Control through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of pollutants
from one municipal stormwater system to another; and
d.   Control accelerated erosion and sedimentation; and
e.   Require compliance with conditions in ordinances, permits, contracts or
orders as follows:
1.   To establish and implement all inspection, surveillance and monitoring
procedures necessary to determine compliance and noncompliance with permit
conditions including the prohibition of illicit discharges and illicit
connections to the city's MS4 and receiving waters;
2.   To require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as
practicable for the applicable design storm in order to reduce flooding, stream
bank erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature,
and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats for
biological/ecological function and drainage;
3.   To encourage the use of better management and site design practices, such
as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of
green space and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable
(MEP);
4.   To establish provisions for the short-term and long-term responsibility
for and maintenance of structural and non-structural stormwater BMPs to ensure
that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and
pose no threat to public safety; and to minimize public and private property
damage resulting from erosion, sedimentation and flooding; and to regulate
developments that create demand for public investment in flood control works.
(4)   Findings:
a.   Stormwater runoff can have a significant adverse impact on the health,
safety and general welfare of the city and on the quality of life of its
citizens. These impacts can be in the form of pollution to our water bodies,
erosion and sedimentation, flooding and other degrading impacts.
b.   The sedimentation of streams, lakes, wetlands and other waters of this
State constitute a major pollution problem. Sedimentation occurs from the
erosion or depositing of soil and other materials into the waters. Control of
erosion and sedimentation is deemed vital to the public interest and necessary
to public health and welfare, and expenditures of funds for erosion and
sedimentation control programs shall be deemed for a public purpose.
c.   Changes in land use can create adverse impacts. The city has been
designated a Phase II Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Community
under the NPDES and is required to obtain a permit pursuant to the 1972 Federal
Water Pollution Control Act as amended in 1987 as well as the applicable and
statutory laws promulgated thereunder. In response to these requirements this
jurisdiction is compelled to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those
included in this section.
d.   The city is in a unique geographic area with steep slopes, erodible soils,
extreme rainfall patterns and other unique factors that require special
attention and specifically different requirements from other jurisdictions.
(5)   Jurisdiction: With the exception of applying subsection
7-12-2(k), pertaining to the prohibition, detection and elimination of illicit
connections, illicit discharges and improper disposal to the stormwater system
in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, this section shall apply to the
territorial and extraterritorial jurisdictions of the city as well as to all
properties owned by the city within Buncombe County to include the areas
designated on the map entitled "Phase II Stormwater Map of the City of
Asheville, North Carolina" ("the Stormwater Map"), which is adopted
simultaneously herewith along with all explanatory matters contained thereon
and made a part of this section.
(6)   Applicability: Unless exempted pursuant to subsection
7-12-2(a)(7) below, beginning with and subsequent to its effective date, this
section shall be applicable as follows:
a.   All development and redevelopment, including, but not limited to, site
plan applications, subdivision applications, and land disturbing applications.
b.   The provisions of subsection
7-12-2(k), pertaining to prohibition, detection and elimination of illicit
connections, illicit discharges and improper disposal to the stormwater system
shall apply to all properties, lands, city's MS4 and waters of the state within
the territorial jurisdiction of the city as well as to all properties owned by
the city within Buncombe County.
(7)   Exemptions:
a.   The following activities for land disturbance shall be exempt from the
provisions of the erosion prevention and sediment control regulations of
subsection
7-12-2(e):
1.   An activity, including breeding and grazing of livestock, undertaken on
agricultural land for the production of plants and animals useful to man,
including, but not limited to: forage and sod crops, grain and feed crops,
tobacco, cotton, and peanuts, dairy animals and dairy products, poultry and
poultry products, livestock, including beef cattle, sheep, swine, horses,
ponies, mules, and goats, bees and apiary products, and fur producing animals.
2.   An activity undertaken on forestland for the production and harvesting of
timber and timber products and conducted in accordance with best management
practices set out in Forest Practice Guidelines Related to Water Quality and
the Forestry Best Management Practices Manual, as adopted by the North Carolina
Division of Forest Resources. If land disturbing activity undertaken on
forestland for the production and harvesting of timber and timber products is
not conducted in accordance with Forest Practice Guidelines Related to Water
Quality and the Forestry Best Management Practices Manual, the provisions of

submitting the permit application that it has been approved, approved with
conditions, approved with performance reservations, or disapproved.
c.   Approval: If the stormwater administrator finds that the permit
application complies with the standards of this section, the stormwater
administrator shall approve the application. The stormwater administrator may
impose conditions of approval as needed to ensure compliance with this section,
or other local, state or federal regulations. The conditions shall be included
as part of the approval.
d.   Disapproval for content: The stormwater administrator shall disapprove a
permit application if it is found that the application fails to comply with the
standards of this section, and shall notify the applicant of the reason(s) for
the disapproval. The applicant shall have an opportunity to submit a revised
application.
e.   Other disapproval: The stormwater administrator shall disapprove a permit
application if implementation of the permit application would result in a
violation of the rules adopted by the NCEMC to protect riparian buffers along
surface waters. In the event that a permit application is disapproved pursuant
to this paragraph, the stormwater administrator shall notify the director of
the Division of Land Resources (DLR) of NCDENR of such disapproval within ten
days. The city shall advise the applicant and the director of the DLR in
writing as to the specific reasons that the plan was disapproved. A permit
application may also be disapproved upon finding that an applicant, or a
parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of the applicant is:
1.   Conducting or has conducted development, redevelopment or land disturbing
activity without an approved plan, or has received notice of violation of an
approved plan and grading and stormwater permit previously approved by NCEMC or
a local government pursuant to the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act (Act)
and has not complied with the notice within the time specified in the notice.
2.   Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to the Act or a local
ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act by the time the payment is due.
3.   Has been convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to NCGS 113A-64(b) or any
criminal provision of a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act; or (For

the two years prior to the application date).
4.   Has failed to substantially comply with state rules or local ordinances
and regulations adopted pursuant to the Act.
f.   Failure to timely approve: Failure to approve, approve with modifications,
or disapprove a complete permit application with formal plans within 30 days of
receipt shall be deemed approved. Failure to approve, approve with
modifications, or disapprove a permit application with a sketch plan within 15
days of receipt shall be deemed approved.
g.   Review of revised permit application: The stormwater administrator will
review each revised permit application submitted and within 15 days of receipt
thereof, will notify the person submitting the permit application that it has
been approved, approved with modifications, approved with performance
reservations, or disapproved.
h.   Failure to recognize: Any failure of the stormwater administrator in
administering this section to include but not limited to: recognizing hazardous
conditions, failure to disapprove the permit application, failure to inspect,
to issue a notice of violation, assess a civil penalty or file a civil action,
shall not relieve the owner from responsibility for the conditions or damages
resulting therefrom and shall not result in the city, its officers or
employees, being responsible for the damages resulting therefrom.
i.   Failure to timely submit revised application: If a revised permit
application is not resubmitted within 180 days from the date the applicant was
notified of the disapproval, the permit application shall be considered
withdrawn, and a new submittal for the same or substantially the same project
shall be required along with the appropriate fee.
j.   Amendment to a plan: Applications for amendment of a permit application in
written and/or graphic form may be made at any time under the same conditions
as the original permit application. Until such time as said amendment is
approved by the stormwater administrator, the land disturbing activity shall
not proceed except in accordance with the permit application as originally
approved. The review process for the amendment shall be the same as for a new
permit application submittal.
(6)   Other considerations of the review and approval process:
a.   Display of approved plan and permit: The approved plan and grading and
stormwater permit must be kept on file at the job site until the job is
stabilized and completed.
b.   Revised permit application after approval: The stormwater administrator
may, after approving a permit application, require a revised application upon
making the following findings:
1.   Either upon review of such permit application or on inspection of the job
site, determines that a significant risk of accelerated erosion, off-site
sedimentation, or risk of damage due to stormwater flows exists.
2.   Upon finding that the erosion and sedimentation control or the post-
construction stormwater control measures presented in the permit application
are inadequate to meet the requirements of this section.
c.   Status of work: Pending the preparation of the revised permit application,
work shall cease or may continue under conditions outlined by the stormwater
administrator.
(d)   Permit close out and release requirements.
(1)   Permit close out: For all development, redevelopment and land disturbing
activity, which requires a grading and stormwater permit pursuant to the
provisions of this section, no certificate of compliance or occupancy shall be
issued by the city without a final release of the grading and stormwater permit
by the stormwater administrator, except where multiple units are served by a
single grading and stormwater permit, in which case the city may elect to
withhold a percentage of permits or certificates of occupancy until a final
release of any required performance securities.
(2)   Final release requirements:
a.   As-built record drawings: For all development, redevelopment and land
disturbing activity which require structural BMPs, stormwater management
control facilities, conveyances and related improvements, an as-built record
drawing must be submitted and approved by the stormwater administrator. The as-
built record drawing shall be certified, signed and sealed by a North Carolina
professional engineer or landscape architect. Requirements for the as-built
record drawing and submittal can be found in the stormwater BMP manual.
b.   Certificates of completion: For all development, redevelopment and land
disturbing activity which require structural BMPs, stormwater management
control facilities, conveyances, and related improvements, a certificate of
completion must be submitted by the professional engineer or landscape
architect, the property owner, the developer and the contractor to the
stormwater administrator. The certificate serves to certify that all facilities
and improvements have been constructed and installed per the approved design
plan, as-built record drawing and requirements set forth in the stormwater BMP
manual. The certificate of completion form shall be available from the office
of the stormwater administrator.
c.   Operation and maintenance agreement: For all development, redevelopment
and land disturbing activity which require structural BMPs or stormwater
management control facilities, an operation and maintenance agreement must be
submitted and approved by the stormwater administrator, on a form available
from the office of the stormwater administrator.
d.   Slope stability certifications: For all development, redevelopment and
land disturbing activity which require a slope stability certificate in
accordance with the provisions of this section, the slope stability certificate
must be submitted and approved by the stormwater administrator. The slope
stability form shall be available from the office of the stormwater
administrator.
e.   Other requirements: Depending on the scope of the development,
redevelopment and land disturbing activity, other items may be required for
final approval. These may include, but are not limited to, easements and plats.
(3)   Final inspection: The stormwater administrator shall perform a final
inspection verifying that all disturbed areas have been stabilized, that all
permanent erosion control measures and stormwater management BMPs, facilities
and improvements have been installed per the approved design plan, as- built
record drawing and compliance with all requirements set forth in the stormwater
BMP manual. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until there is a
final inspection signed by the stormwater administrator.
(e)   Erosion prevention and sediment control.
(1)   Basic control objectives: An erosion and sedimentation control plan shall
be disapproved if the plan fails to address the basic control objectives. The
basic control objectives which are to be considered in developing and
implementing an erosion and sedimentation control plan are:
a.   Identify critical areas: On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion
and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/
or sedimentation are to be identified and receive special attention;
b.   Limit time of exposure: All land disturbing activities are to be planned
and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest practicable time;
c.   Limit exposed area: All land disturbing activities are to be planned and
conducted to limit the size of the area to be exposed at any one time;
d.   Control surface water: Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed
areas shall be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period
of exposure;
e.   Control sedimentation: All land disturbing activities shall be planned and
conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage; and
f.   Manage stormwater runoff: When the increase in the velocity of stormwater
runoff resulting from a land disturbing activity is sufficient to cause
accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans must include measures
to control the velocity to the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated
erosion of the site and increased sedimentation in the stream.
(2)   Mandatory standards for land disturbing activity:
a.   Land disturbing activity subject to this section shall be undertaken in
accordance with the following requirements:
1.   Land disturbing activity shall not occur within a 30-foot undisturbed
buffer around all perennial and intermittent surface waters.
2.   Land disturbing activity described in subsection (a)(7)(c)(1) of this
section shall observe a buffer zone around lakes and natural watercourses along
the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation
within the 25 percent of the buffer zone nearest the land disturbing activity.
3.   Land disturbing activity occurring pursuant to a decision rendered under
subsection (j) of this section shall meet the buffer requirements established
in that decision.
4.   Measurement of aquatic buffer width: The width of the undisturbed buffer
is measured horizontally from the top of bank to the landward side of the
watercourse (i.e. moving perpendicularly away from the water toward uplands or
disturbed areas.
5.   Overgrowth of greenery: Removal of invasive species, undergrowth and
selective thinning of trees smaller than four inches in diameter is allowed
within the aquatic buffer provided notice is given to the office of the
stormwater administrator.
6.   Stabilization of riverbanks: Most land disturbing activities in and on the
bank of perennial and intermittent waters are regulated by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers under Section 4040 of the Federal CWA and the North Carolina
Division of Water Quality under Section 401 of the Federal CWA. In addition, a
grading permit is required unless the activity is exempt as described in
subsection
7-12-2(a)(7). In all cases, and to the maximum extent practicable, riverbank
stabilization activities must use bioengineering methods and principles of
natural design rather than concrete walls and other hardened structures.
7.   Trout buffers: No land disturbing activity shall be undertaken within an
aquatic buffer adjacent to designated trout waters, as classified by the NCEMC
that will cause adverse temperature fluctuations in the trout waters, as set
forth in 15 NCAC 2B.0211 "Fresh Surface Water Classification and Standards."
Exceptions and variances to buffers along designated trout streams may only be
granted by DENR—Division of Land Resources.
b.   Grading activity in a designated landscape buffer zone. When developing a
site in a designated landscape buffer zone, the following shall apply:
1.   Land disturbance is permitted in the designated landscape buffer zone and
the developer is required to plant trees and shrubs which are 50 percent larger
than normally required in order to reestablish quickly a visual buffer.
2.   Utilities are to be installed along the edge of the designated landscape
buffer zone and cross perpendicular to the designated landscape buffer zone.
Land disturbance that occurs in a designated landscape buffer zone shall not
result in a slope that exceeds 3:1. Developers will be encouraged to provide as
gradual a slope as practicable in the buffer area to provide increased soil
stability and a better planting environment for buffer trees and shrubs.
3.   The land disturbing activity shall be conducted in accordance with the
approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.
c.   Grading along property line: For land disturbing activities for which a
formal erosion and sedimentation control plan is required by this section, no
grading activity or land disturbance may be conducted within ten feet of any
property line unless written notice of the grading activity or land disturbance
has been provided to the adjacent property owner and approval of the stormwater
administrator has been received. Grading for access point and utility
extensions shall be exempt from this subsection.
d.   Grading without an approved development plan: Land disturbance without an
approved development plan, defined as the grading (including mass tree removal)
of a site for which no development plan has been approved, shall not be
permitted.
1.   A landscape plan must be approved by the planning department and an
erosion control plan must be approved by the stormwater administrator prior to
initiation of the land disturbing activity. No grading and stormwater permits
shall be issued prior to review and approval of the landscape plan by the
planning department.
2.   The landscape plan must show the location of existing trees to be
preserved and the location and type of any required buffer yard trees and
street trees which will remain. The determination of the type of buffer
required shall be based upon the most intense development permitted in the
zoning district in which the project being graded is located.
3.   All required trees shall be planted within 30 days of completion of the
land disturbance activity or within 12 months of the date the land disturbance
activity was initiated, whichever is less. This time period may be extended
through the posting of a financial guarantee as provided for in section
7-11-2 of the UDO.
4.   An effective permanent ground cover shall be applied on the site within 14
days of completion of the land disturbing activity unless completion occurs
outside a growing season, in which case an effective temporary ground cover
shall be applied within 14 days. No ground cover shall be required for bare
rock.
e.   Graded slopes and fills:
1.   Angle: The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the
angle that can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion
control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left exposed will, within
14 days of completion of any phase of grading, be planted or otherwise provided
with temporary or permanent ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to
restrain erosion. The angle for graded slopes and fills must be demonstrated to
be stable. Stable is the condition where the soil remains in its original
configuration, with or without mechanical constraints. The use of gunite or
similar materials is not allowed as a method for slope stabilization.
2.   Benches: Terracing or slope breaks should be used on steep slopes to
reduce the length of cut and fill slopes to prevent erosion and formation of
gullies. Benches should be five feet wide, rounded at the edges, and spaced
according to the following table:
 
Slope     Spacing
50% (2:1) No more than 20 vertical feet
33% (3:1) No more than 35 vertical feet
25% (4:1) No more than 45 vertical feet
 
3.   Compaction requirement: All fill slopes shall be compacted full depth to
not less than 95 percent maximum density (Standard Proctor), shall be placed on
a surface cleared of growth and debris, and be properly benched and drained.
4.   Severe slopes: All constructed severe slopes greater than 2:1 shall be
designed by a North Carolina registered professional engineer. Additionally,
for constructed severe slopes greater than five feet in height, an inspection
and a stability certificate are required by a North Carolina registered
professional engineer with geotechnical expertise sufficient to perform the
inspection and stability analysis. For all constructed severe slopes within
proposed or existing public rights-of-way, periodic inspections and compaction
reports are required by a North Carolina registered professional engineer with
geotechnical expertise.
5.   Slope setback requirements: Setback from existing adjacent property and
rights-of-way lines is required for retaining walls and constructed moderate
and severe slopes as indicated. For the purpose of this subsection, constructed
moderate and severe slopes shall include those created for the construction of
retaining walls. The setback shall be measured from and applied for both the
head and the toe of the slope.
a)   The setback shall be equal to the maximum height of the slope.
b)   The required setback may be reduced if a subsurface exploration analysis
of the area is completed by a North Carolina registered professional engineer
with geotechnical expertise and the analysis indicates that the reduction in
the setback will not cause greater risk of damage to adjacent public and
private properties.
6.   Stability certificate findings: At a minimum, the stability certificate
must state that the slope is free of failures, including, but not limited to
cracks, sloughs and slippages, that the compaction requirement as set forth
above has been met, that soil should remain in its original configuration and
that temporary or permanent ground cover is provided. The stability certificate
must be submitted and approved before a certificate of occupancy is issued.
f.   Fill material: Unless a permit from NCDENR—Division of Waste Management to
operate a landfill is on file for the official site, acceptable fill material
shall be free of organic or other degradable materials, masonry, concrete and
brick in sizes exceeding 12 inches, and any materials which would cause the
site to be regulated as a landfill by the State of North Carolina.
g.   Access and haul roads: Temporary access and haul roads, other than public
roads, constructed or used in connection with any land disturbing activity
shall be considered a part of such activity.
h.   Allowable disturbances:
1.   Maximum limits of disturbance at one time: Land disturbance in any area
with a natural average slope in excess of 15 percent shall be limited to
disturbing not more than five acres at a time. Any one disturbed area must be
stabilized per the requirements of the soil erosion and sediment control
standards as set forth in this section prior to beginning disturbance on any
subsequent area.
a)   The stormwater administrator may grant a waiver to the five-acre
limitation but only if: (i) the disturbance does not exceed 20 acres; and (ii)
the erosion and sediment controls in the formal plan are designed for a 50-year
storm; and (iii) a North Carolina licensed registered professional is
contracted with to perform all required inspections as required by subsection
7-12-2(g)(5); and (iv) the area of disturbance is located a minimum of 50 feet
from a perennial or intermittent stream or down slope properties.
b)   For the purposes of this provision, non-contiguous areas located within
1,500 feet of each other and owned and/or developed by the same person(s) shall
be considered the same project.
2.   Steep slope and others: For properties where steep slope and/or ridgetop
protection regulations apply, as defined in section
7-12-4 of the UDO, limits on maximum allowable disturbance shall be as
indicated by those applicable regulations. The as-built record drawing must be
submitted and approved by the stormwater administrator prior to final
inspection approval for any phase of land disturbing activity.
3.   Security for re-vegetation: A security for re-vegetation is required for
all land disturbances which exceeds five acres. The security shall be in the
form of a construction bond, letter of credit, or certified check and must be
provided prior to the issuance of the grading and stormwater permit. The
security shall be sufficient to re-vegetate proposed disturbed areas and shall
be valid for one year from the issuance of the permit and be updated throughout
the process.
i.   Borrow and waste area:
1.   When the person conducting the land disturbing activity is also the person
conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, areas from which borrow is
obtained and which are not regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of
1971, and waste areas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by
NCDENR—Division of Waste Management, shall be considered as part of the land
disturbing activity where the borrow material is being used or from which the
waste material originated. When the person conducting the land disturbing
activity is not the person obtaining the borrow and/or disposing of the waste,
these areas shall be considered a separate land disturbing activity.
2.   The formal plan shall include a soil volume balance calculation and state
if there will be borrowed or waste fill material used. If borrowed or waste
fill material is generated, an approved grading permit must be secured for the
borrow or waste material site prior to initiation of any land disturbing
activity, unless the site is not excluded by the mining or landfill act.
(3)   Design and performance standards:
a.   Design storm protection: Erosion and sedimentation control measures,
structures, and devices shall be planned, designed, and constructed to provide
protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the ten-year
storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil
Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation
Practices", or other acceptable calculation procedures. If an area has been
listed on the watershed overlay zone inventory by the stormwater administrator,
erosion control measures for such sites or specific measures on a site shall be
designed for, at a minimum, the 25-year storm. The watershed overlay zone
inventory is available from the office of the stormwater administrator. The
watershed overlay zone inventory shall be subject to a bi-annual review, the
process and method for such a review shall be established by policy of the
stormwater administrator.
b.   Innovative measures: Erosion and sedimentation measures applied alone or
in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if they are
sufficient to prevent adverse secondary consequences. Innovative techniques and
ideas will be considered and may be used following approval by the stormwater
administrator if it can be demonstrated that such techniques and ideas are
likely to produce successful results.
c.   Watershed overlay zone: In watershed overlay zones, the following design
standards shall apply:
1.   Uncovered areas in watershed overlay zones shall be limited at any time to
a maximum total area of 20 acres within the boundaries of the site. Only the
portion of the land disturbing activity within a watershed overlay zone shall
be governed by this section. Larger areas may be uncovered within the
boundaries of the site with the written approval of the stormwater
administrator.
2.   Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices within
watershed overlay zones shall be planned, designed and constructed to provide
protection from the runoff of the 25-year storm which produces the maximum peak
rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States
Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering
Field Manual for Conservation Practices" or other calculations or procedures
generally recognized in the field including those adopted by any other agency
of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or
association and approved by the stormwater administrator.
3.   Sediment basins within watershed overlay zones shall be designed and
constructed such that the basin will have an overall sediment removal
efficiency of at least 85 percent and a settling efficiency of at least 70
percent for the 40 micron (0.04 millimeter) size soil particle transported into
the basin by the runoff of that two-year storm which produces the maximum peak
rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States
Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's "National Engineering
Field Manual for Conservation Practices" or other calculations or procedures
generally recognized in the field including those adopted by any other agency
of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or
association and approved by the stormwater administrator.
4.   Newly constructed open channels in watershed overlay zones shall be
designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one
vertical (2:1) if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil
conditions permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using
mechanical devices, structural devices or other acceptable ditch liners. In any
event, the angle for side slopes shall be sufficient to restrain accelerated
erosion.
5.   Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for any
portion of a land disturbing activity in a watershed overlay zone within 14
days following completion of construction. When construction activity has
ceased in a particular site of a larger development, effective permanent ground
cover must be applied within 14 days from the date of the last land disturbing
activity.
6.   Any additional reasonable measures determined by the stormwater
administrator to be required to bring the City of Asheville into compliance, or
to maintain compliance with, provisions of the city's NPDES stormwater
discharge permit, a total maximum daily load (TMDL) once approved by the State
of North Carolina or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for one or more
pollutants, a consent decree or other order issued under the provisions of the
Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) or other federal or state law or
regulation.
(4)   Stormwater outlet protection:
a.   Intent: Stream banks and channels downstream from any land disturbing
activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion
caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land disturbing activity.
b.   Performance standard: Persons engaged in land disturbing activity shall
conduct such activity so that the post-construction velocity of the ten-year
storm runoff in the receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not
exceed the greater of:
1.   The non-erosive velocities for the downstream channel conditions as
specified in the North Carolina Erosion and Sediment Control Planning and
Design Manual, or
2.   The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse
prior to development.
c.   Acceptable management measures: Measures applied alone or in combination
to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no
objectionable secondary consequences. The city recognizes that the management
of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion
is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered
and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results.
Some alternatives, while not exhaustive, are to:
1.   Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including
measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas
rendered impervious;
2.   Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or
roughened swales and waterways in place of closed drains and high velocity
paved sections;
3.   Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities to
reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge;
4.   Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross
sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining; and
5.   Upgrade or replace the receiving device structure, or watercourse, such
that it will receive and conduct the flow to a point where it is no longer
subject to degradation from the increased rate of flow or increased velocity.
d.   Non-applicability: This subsection pertaining to stormwater outlet
protection shall not apply where the applicant can demonstrate through engineer
analysis on the sealed plans that stormwater discharge volumes and velocities
will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse.
(5)   Operations in lakes or natural watercourses: Land disturbing activity in
connection with construction in, on, over, or under a lake or natural
watercourse falls within the jurisdiction of appropriate state and federal
agencies, including but not limited to NCDENR—Division of Water Quality and the
Army Corps of Engineers. Developers should consult with the appropriate state
and/or federal agencies to obtain the necessary permits and requirements. In
all cases and to the maximum extent practicable, operations in lakes and
natural watercourses shall minimize the extent and duration of disruption of
the stream channel. Where relocation of a stream forms an essential part of the
proposed activity, the relocation shall minimize unnecessary changes in the
stream flow characteristics.
(6)   Uncovered areas:
a.   Ground cover: Whenever land disturbing activity is undertaken on a site,
the person conducting the land disturbing activity shall install erosion and
sedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to retain the
sediment generated by the land disturbing activity within the boundaries of the
site during construction upon and development of said site, and shall plant or
otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after
completion of construction or development. Provisions for a ground cover
sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished within 14 days following
completion of construction or development. To the maximum extent practicable,
native or indigenous plant species shall be used for permanent ground cover.
b.   Existing uncovered areas: All uncovered areas existing on the effective
date of this section which resulted from land disturbing activities, and are
subject to continued accelerated erosion, and are causing off-site damage from
sedimentation, shall be provided with a ground cover or other protective
measures, structures, or devices sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion and
control off-site sedimentation.
c.   Extensive control measures: The stormwater administrator reserves the
right to require preparation and approval of an erosion control plan in any
instance wherein extensive control measures are required.
d.   Planned reservoir: This section shall not require ground cover on cleared
land forming the future basin of a planned reservoir.
e.   Fee: No fee shall apply to work required under this subsection except when
the stormwater administrator exercises the right to require an erosion control
plan.
(7)   Responsibility for installation, operation, and maintenance of temporary
and permanent soil erosion and sedimentation control measures:
a.   During construction: During the development of a site, the person
conducting the land disturbing activity shall install and maintain all
temporary and permanent soil erosion and sedimentation control measures as
required by the approved plan, by any provision of this section, by any order
adopted pursuant to this section, or any provision of the North Carolina
Sediment Pollution Control Act.
b.   After construction: After site development, the property owner or person
in possession or control of the land shall install and/or maintain all
necessary permanent soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, except
those installed within a road or street right-of-way or easement accepted for
maintenance by a government agency.
c.   Clean up requirements: When sediment is transported onto a public road
surface, the road shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day. Sediment
shall be removed from the roads by shoveling or sweeping and transported to a
sediment control disposal area. Street washing shall be allowed only after
sediment is removed in this manner.
d.   Cost of clean-up by city: If the city must clean-up off-site sedimentation
or mitigate other erosion related public safety and environmental hazards, the
person in violation will be charged for the cost of the cleanup in addition to
the civil penalty. The cleanup cost shall include personnel wages, equipment
usage, and related administrative overhead costs. If the violator does not pay
for the cleanup cost, revoked permits shall not be re-issued. Additionally, the
city shall proceed in accordance with the enforcement provisions of this
section to collect the cost of the clean up.
e.   Restoration of land and waters: The city may require a person who engaged
in a land disturbing activity and failed to retain sediment generated by the
activity, as required by NCGS 113A-57(3), to restore the waters and land
affected by the failure so as to minimize the detrimental effects of the
resulting pollution by sedimentation. This authority is in addition to any
other civil penalty or equitable relief.
f.   Additional measures: Whenever the city determines that significant erosion
and sedimentation is occurring as a result of land disturbing activity, despite
application and maintenance of protective practices, the person conducting the
land disturbing activity will be required to and shall take additional
protective action.
(f)   Post-construction stormwater control.
(1)   Standards for stormwater quantity control: All development and
redevelopment to which this subsection applies shall comply with the standards
herein. The design of facilities to comply with these standards shall be based
on procedures contained in the stormwater BMP manual or as approved by the
stormwater administrator guided by the spirit, purpose and intent of this
section. The minimum "post-construction" stormwater control requirements
included in the stormwater management plan shall provide management measures
necessary to accomplish the following:
a.   Limit the two-year and ten-year developed peak discharge rates to pre-
developed peak discharge rates using a duration of 24-hours with a SCS Type II
design storm and pass the 50-year, 24-hour storm event. The stormwater
administrator may require control to pre-development rates for the 25-year, 24-
hour storm, if by using existing watershed master plan analysis it is found
that that additional flow reduction is required to protect downstream
properties, natural and built drainage facilities due to the additional peak
flows from the 25-year 24-hour storm event.
b.   Provide extended detention for the difference between the pre-development
and post development volume of the 2-year 24-hour SCS Type II design storm. The
increase in runoff volume must be detained between 24-hours to 72-hours.
Provided that the stormwater administrator may require volume control for the
difference between the pre-development and post development volume of the 25-
year 24-hour storm if by using existing watershed master plan analysis it is
found that that additional volume reduction is required to protect downstream
properties, natural and built drainage facilities due to the additional runoff
volumes from the 25- year 24-hour storm event.
(2)   Standards for stormwater quality control: All development and
redevelopment to which this subsection applies shall comply with the standards
herein. The design of facilities to accomplish these standards shall be based
on procedures contained in the stormwater BMP manual or approved by the
stormwater administrator. The minimum "post-construction" stormwater control
requirements included in the stormwater management plan shall provide
management measures necessary to accomplish the following:
a.   Control and treat the stormwater runoff leaving the site from the first
one inch of rain. The volume of runoff from the first inch of rain must be
detained between 48 hours to 120 hours.
b.   All structural stormwater treatment systems used to meet the requirements
of the program shall be designed to have a minimum of 85 percent average annual
removal for total suspended solids.
c.   General engineering design criteria for all projects shall be in
accordance with 15A NCAC 2H.1008(c).
d.   If the developer utilizes stormwater sheetflow measures across aquatic
buffers, filtration, [bioretention], enhanced on-site infiltration, and/or
other effective measures thereby managing both the stormwater quantity and
quality, the post-construction stormwater control standards described in
subsection
7-12-2(f)(1) and (2) above shall be altered or waived by the stormwater
administrator to the extent that the measures provide the same level of
treatment, discharge, and velocity control as would be accomplished under the
post-construction stormwater control standards using the methods defined in the
BMP manual.
(3)   Aquatic buffers: Post construction:
a.   Aquatic buffer: A 30-foot undisturbed aquatic buffer shall be required
along perennial and intermittent waterbodies. Landowners may challenge the
classification of a stream (i.e. perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), using the
methods for delineating waters developed by the North Carolina Division of
Water Quality. Property owners are responsible for the cost of having the
necessary field investigations performed by competent persons. By approval of
this ordinance, the North Carolina Division of Water Quality hereby authorizes
appropriately trained city staff to make a field determination of the stream
classification.
b.   Reduction of excess aquatic buffer: Property owners may petition the
stormwater administrator for reduction of the portion of any undisturbed
aquatic buffer that exceeds state minimum requirements if the property owner
agrees to establish and maintain:
1.   Vegetation within the aquatic buffer to meet standards set forth in the
best management practices manual or approved by the stormwater administrator as
being in accord with such manual; and
2.   A level-spreader outside of the aquatic buffer ensuring sheet flow
entering the buffer or undertakes other mitigating stormwater management
measures approved by the stormwater administrator as acceptable under industry
standards.
c.   Buffer width: The width of the undisturbed aquatic buffer is measured
horizontally from the top of bank to the landward side of the watercourse.
(i.e. moving perpendicularly away from the water toward uplands or disturbed
areas).
d.   Substantial improvements: For substantial improvements on parcels that
have previously been developed, the aquatic buffer must be restored by removing
built-upon areas from the aquatic buffer and by planting and landscaping the
aquatic buffer per landscape requirements as set forth in the UDO where
practicable. If complete restoration of the aquatic buffer is not practicable,
other mitigating stormwater management measures that enhance the function of
the available buffer or otherwise substantially replace the function of the
aquatic buffer may be used for compliance with this section, as approved by the
stormwater administrator.
(4)   Additional standards for special situations:
a.   Trout waters: In addition to the standards for stormwater handling set out
in the stormwater BMP manual, development and redevelopment that drains in
whole or in part to trout waters shall design and implement the best stormwater
practices that do not result in a sustained increase in the receiving water
temperature and allow on-site stormwater treatment devices such as infiltration
areas, bio-retention areas, and level spreaders as added controls, while
meeting the other requirements of this section.
b.   Watershed overlay zones: In addition to the standards for stormwater
handling set out in the stormwater BMP manual, development and redevelopment
that is in whole or in part within a watershed overlay zone shall implement
additional measures determined by the stormwater administrator to be required
to bring the City of Asheville into compliance or to maintain compliance with
provisions of the city's NPDES stormwater discharge permit, a total maximum
daily load (TMDL) once approved by the State of North Carolina or the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency for one or more pollutants, a consent decree or
other order issued under the provisions of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et
seq.) or other federal or state law or regulation.
(5)   On-site waste water:
a.   Operation and maintenance requirements: New and replaced onsite systems
for domestic wastewater installed after the effective date of this ordinance
must be approved and permitted by the Buncombe County Health Department. Both
the Buncombe County septic permit and documentation showing the operation and
maintenance for the system are required before a permit may be issued.
b.   Standards for operation and maintenance: Onsite systems for domestic
wastewater covered by this section shall be operated and maintained so as to
avoid adverse effects on surface water and groundwater, including
eutrophication of surface water and microbial or nitrate contamination of
groundwater. Septic tank residuals shall be pumped whenever necessary to assure
the proper operation of the system to meet these standards, and the seepage
shall be reused or disposed of in a manner that does not present significant
risks to human health, surface water or groundwater.
(6)   Standards for stormwater control measures:
a.   Stormwater BMP manual: To assist in the design and evaluation of
stormwater management facilities in the city, the stormwater administrator
shall prepare and adopt a stormwater BMP manual. The stormwater BMP manual
shall contain recommended design procedures and criteria presented for
conducting evaluations of practices. The intention of the stormwater BMP manual
is to establish uniform design practices; it neither replaces the need for
engineering judgment nor precludes the use of information not presented. Other
accepted engineering procedures may be used to evaluate practices if approved
by the stormwater administrator.
1.   If the specifications or guidelines of the stormwater BMP manual are more
restrictive or apply a higher standard than other laws or regulations, that
fact shall not prevent application of the specifications or guidelines in the
stormwater BMP manual.
2.   If the standards, specifications, guidelines, policies, criteria, or other
information in the stormwater BMP manual are amended subsequent to the
submittal of an application for approval pursuant to this section but prior to
approval, the old information shall control and shall be utilized in reviewing
the application and in implementing this section with regard to the
application.
3.   The stormwater BMP manual may be updated and expanded from time to time,
based on advancements in technology and engineering, improved knowledge of
local conditions, or local monitoring or maintenance experience.
b.   Evaluation according to contents of the stormwater BMP manual: All
stormwater control measures and stormwater treatment practices (also referred
to as best management practices, or BMPs) required under this section shall be
evaluated by the stormwater administrator according to the policies, criteria,
and information, including technical specifications and standards and the
specific design criteria for each stormwater practice, in the stormwater BMP
manual. The stormwater administrator shall determine whether they will be
adequate to meet the requirements of this section.
c.   Determination of adequacy; presumptions and alternatives: Stormwater
treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained in
accordance with the criteria and specifications in the stormwater BMP manual
will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality and quantity performance
standards of this section. Whenever an applicant proposes to utilize a practice
or practices not designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria and
specifications in the stormwater BMP manual, the applicant shall have the
burden of demonstrating that the practice(s) will satisfy the minimum water
quality and quantity performance standards of this section. The stormwater
administrator may require the applicant to provide such documentation,
calculations, and examples as necessary to determine whether such an
affirmative showing is made.
(7)   Locations and dedication of BMPs, facilities and improvements:
a.   Upon review and recommendation of the stormwater administrator and the
director of public works, city council may approve BMPs being located within
the city's public rights-of-way. In determining whether to allow a BMP within a
city public right-of-way, the factors to consider shall consist of, but not be
limited to, whether the BMP is a public benefit, the annual cost to the city to
maintain the BMP, the potential liability the BMP exposes to the city, and any
other related factors.
b.   The city may accept dedication, subject to final approval from city
council, of any existing or future BMPs and stormwater management facilities
for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this
section and any other policies of the city and includes adequate and perpetual
access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and
regular maintenance. The city may require as a condition of public acceptance,
that the owner arrange for funding costs associated with future maintenance of
the BMP or stormwater management facility. Nothing herein shall require the
city to accept maintenance of any BMP or stormwater management facility.
(8)   Operation and maintenance of structural BMPs:
a.   Operation and maintenance agreement: The applicant or owner of a site that
is required to have a structural BMP pursuant to this section must execute an
operation and maintenance agreement prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for development or redevelopment. The form "Operation and Maintenance
Agreement," shall be provided by the office of the stormwater administrator.
b.   Content of operation and maintenance agreement: The operation and
maintenance agreement shall require the property owner(s) to maintain, repair,
and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms,
conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the structural BMP, and the right
of the city to abate a violation. Additionally, it shall grant the city a right
of entry in the event the stormwater administrator has reason to believe it has
become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the
structural BMP. In no case, however, shall the right of entry confer an
obligation on the city to assume responsibility for the structural BMP.
Additionally, the agreement shall include language to bind the parties thereto
and all subsequent owners, successors and assigns, of the site, portions of the
site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP.
c.   Maintenance responsibility: The final responsibility for complying with
the operation and maintenance agreement provided herein remains with the
property owner.
d.   Failure to maintain: If the owner fails to maintain the structural BMP in
accordance with the operation and maintenance agreement, the city shall proceed
in accordance with subsection
7-12-2(i). Any costs incurred by the city to abate such failure shall be
recovered by the city at 120 percent of the actual cost.
e.   Recordation: The operation and maintenance agreement shall be referenced
on the final plat; and if there is no final plat, then the agreement shall be
referenced on an as-built record drawing and also recorded in the Buncombe
County Register of Deeds Office, so as to appear in the chain of title of all
subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching principles, at the
expense of the owner/applicant prior to the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy.
f.   Deed restrictions and protective covenants: Upon conveyance of real
property that is subject to or should be subject to a recorded operation and
maintenance agreement, the property owner shall include in the deed of
conveyance, deed restrictions, and protective covenants, imposing upon the new
owner the responsibility for maintenance of the structural BMPs. Failure to
know of the existence of structural BMPs on property prior to purchase is not
an excuse from the obligation to maintain the structural BMPs. A failure to
include deed restrictions and protective covenants as required by this
subsection constitutes negligence per se.
(g)   Inspections and investigations.
(1)   City inspections:
a.   Inspections: The city shall perform routine, random, complaint based,
systematic inspections or a combination hereof to ensure continued compliance
with the requirements of this section. The city may also conduct joint
inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws
during or post construction. Notice of the right to inspect shall be included
in the approval of each permit application.
b.   Purpose of inspections: Inspections may include, but are not limited to,
compliance checks of the approved plan and the grading and stormwater permit,
reviewing for compliance with the standards of the stormwater BMP manual,
reviewing land disturbing activity and plan effectiveness, reviewing
maintenance and repair records, sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in BMPs, and evaluating the condition of
BMPs.
(2)   City investigations: The city shall have the power to conduct an
investigation as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as
prescribed in this section and, for this purpose, to enter at reasonable times
upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and
inspecting the sites of any activity regulated in this section. No person shall
refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city,
who requests such entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents
appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, willfully
resist, delay or interfere with any such representative while in the process of
carrying out his/her official duties.
(3)   Administrative inspection warrant: If the owner or occupant of any
property refuses to permit such inspection, the stormwater administrator shall
proceed to obtain an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to NCGS 15-
27.2. No person shall obstruct, hamper or interfere with the office of the
stormwater administrator while carrying out the official duties of this
section.
(4)   Written statements/filing of reports: The city shall also have the power
to require written statements, or filing of reports under oath, with respect to
pertinent questions relating to activity under this section.
(5)   Private inspections during construction:
a.   Contract inspections: A contract is required between the person
financially responsible and a licensed professional for all initial inspections
required by subsection
7-12-2(g)5.d.2. below.
b.   Contract requirements: The contract required by subsection a. above shall
at a minimum provide that the licensed professional will be available for the
duration of the construction of the project in order to design new stormwater
measures and/or more effective or different erosion sedimentation control
measures in the event that the initial controls are ineffective and provide
effective and immediate alternatives for compliance with this section should a
dispute arise between the parties.
c.   Exemptions: The following lots or sites shall be exempt from the
inspection requirements of this subsection:
1.   Land disturbance of 25,000 square feet or less; provided however, steep
slope lots with a perennial or intermittent stream located within 100 feet
downhill of land disturbance are limited to the percentage of disturbed area on
the lot as shown in the table of allowable disturbances set forth in section
7-12-4 of the steep slope regulations of the UDO.
2.   For steep slope areas as set forth under section
7-12-4 of the steep slope regulations of the UDO, only those disturbances that
fall within the table of allowable disturbances shall be exempt from the
inspection requirement of this subsection.
3.   Sites where land disturbance for construction of a single-family home or
comparable structure such as a duplex that disturbs less than 40 percent of the
lot and retains, at a minimum, a 30-foot aquatic buffer. Conveyance channels in
the buffer area shall be protected in accordance with the field manual of the
N.C. Department of Natural Resources.
d.   Inspection requirements:
1.   Certificate of inspection agreement: A notarized certificate of inspection
agreement on a form available from the office of the stormwater administrator
stating the existence of the contract required hereinabove must be received and
approved by the Stormwater administrator before a grading and stormwater permit
is issued. All stormwater management facilities and BMPs must be inspected.
2.   Initial inspection: A licensed North Carolina registered professional such
as an engineer or landscape architect must perform all initial inspections and
must sign the initial inspection report. Initial inspections shall be conducted
for the purpose of ensuring that installations required by the approved plan
are in place and have been installed consistent with the approved plan. An
initial inspection shall be performed as many times as necessary for the
licensed registered professional to render a professional opinion as to whether
the measures installed on site have been properly installed and are
substantially sufficient to comply with the control regulations of this
section.
3.   Weekly inspections: A North Carolina registered professional engineer,
landscape architect or an inspector holding certification from an erosion and
sediment control inspection program acceptable to the stormwater administrator
shall conduct weekly inspections for lots where steep slope and/or ridgetop
protection regulations apply.
4.   Bi-weekly inspections: A North Carolina registered professional engineer,
landscape architect or an inspector holding certification from an erosion and
sediment control inspection program acceptable to the stormwater administrator
shall conduct bi-weekly inspections on all non-exempt sites of land disturbing
activity after the initial inspection.
5.   Additional inspections: If a determination is made by the office of the
stormwater administrator that a site continues to violate the provisions of
this section, meaning that the site has been issued a written notice of
violation three or more times in a six-month time frame, the stormwater
administrator shall require that all inspections, whether weekly or bi-weekly,
be performed by a professional engineer or landscape architect only.
6.   Inspection filings: The initial and signed inspection report must be filed
with the stormwater administrator prior to the commencement of any land
disturbing activity. All weekly inspections and bi-weekly inspections must be
kept on inspection logs and retained at the site.
7.   Inspection violations: It shall constitute a violation of this section if
inspection logs are not on site or made available to city inspectors upon
request.
e.   Falsification of reports. Falsification of reports shall constitute a
violation of this section.
f.   Forms. Standardized certificate of inspection agreements, reporting forms
and reporting process are available upon request from the office of the
stormwater administrator.
(6)   Private inspections post-construction:
a.   Due diligence: The owner of each structural BMP installed pursuant to this
section shall continuously perform due diligence inspections to ensure that the
structural BMP is continuing to function in controlling stormwater quality and
quantity at the degree or amount of function for which the structural BMP was
designed.
b.   Annual maintenance inspection and report by owner: The owner of any
structural BMP installed pursuant to this section shall annually submit to the
stormwater administrator an inspection report from a qualified registered North
Carolina professional engineer or landscape architect performing services only
in their area of competence. The inspection report shall contain all of the
following:
1.   The name and address of the property owner;
2.   The recorded book and page number of the lot of each structural BMP;
3.   A statement that an inspection was made of all structural BMPs;
4.   The date the inspection was made;
5.   A statement that all inspected structural BMPs are performing properly and
are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the approved maintenance
agreement required by this section; and
6.   The original signature and seal of the engineer or landscape architect.
(7)   Records of installation and maintenance activities: The owner of each
structural BMP shall keep records of inspection, maintenance, and repairs for
at least five years from the date of creation of the record and shall submit
the same upon reasonable request to the stormwater administrator.
(h)   Violations and notices.
(1)   General violations: Among other violations not specifically set forth
herein, it shall constitute a violation of this section for any person to fail
to comply with an approved plan, the grading and stormwater permit, applicable
requirements including the failure to provide ground cover, standards, or
limitations imposed by this section, or the terms or conditions of any permit
or other development or redevelopment approval or authorization granted
pursuant to this section; to engage in land disturbing activity without the
required approved plan and permit and to falsify reports required under this
section. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation.
(2)   Immediate violations: It shall constitute an immediate violation of this
section if through inspection the office of the stormwater administrator
determines that an immediate civil penalty is warranted based upon the table of
penalties set forth hereinafter.
(3)   Notice of violation: If through inspection, it is determined that a
person has violated this section, the office of the stormwater administrator
shall immediately serve a notice of violation upon that person. The notice
shall be in writing and served by personal delivery, electronic delivery or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. In addition service may
be made in accordance with Rule 4 of the N.C. Rules of Civil Procedure. The
notice of violation shall be served upon the holder of the development approval
and the landowner of the property involved, if the landowner is not the holder
of the development approval and may provide by similar means to the financially
responsible party or occupant of the property or the person undertaking the
work or activity. In addition the notice of violation may be posted on the
property involved, in accordance with N.C.G.S. § 160D-404(a). The notice shall
contain the following:
a.   The measures needed to comply, the time within such measures must be
completed and warn that failure to correct the violation within the time period
shall subject the violator to civil and/or other enforcement action.
b.   In determining the measures required and the time allowed for compliance,
the office of the stormwater administrator shall take into consideration the
economic feasibility, technology, the quantity of work required, and shall set
reasonable and attainable time limits of compliance.
(4)   Notice of compliance: Once the violation has been cured, the development,
redevelopment and land disturbing activity is in compliance and any penalties
assessed have been paid in full or the penalty appeal has been filed within the
given time frame; a notice of compliance shall be sent to the financially
responsible party.
(i)   Enforcement.
(1)   Civil penalty for soil erosion and sedimentation violations: Any person
who violates any of the provisions of the soil erosion and sedimentation
control requirements of this section and/or who initiates a land disturbing
activity for which an erosion control plan is required except in accordance
with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, shall be
subject to a civil penalty and in some cases, as set forth in the table of
penalties below, an immediate civil penalty. The maximum civil penalty for a
violation is $5,000.00. A civil penalty may be assessed from the date of the
violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate
violation.
(2)   Civil penalty for stormwater control, illicit discharge and connection
violations: Any person who violates the stormwater control, illicit discharge
and connection regulations of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty
and in some cases, as set forth in the table of penalties below, an immediate
civil penalty. The maximum civil penalty for a violation is $25,000.00;
however; for a continuing violation the maximum per day per violation penalty
shall be $10,000.00, unless a civil penalty has been imposed against the
violator within the five years preceding the current violation. A civil penalty
may be assessed from the date of the violation. Each day of a continuing
violation shall constitute a separate violation.
(3)   Civil penalty assessment: Upon the failure to comply within the time
frame set forth in the notice of violation, the stormwater administrator shall
give notice of assessment of a civil penalty by providing notice of the civil
penalty amount and the basis for assessment to the person assessed. Provided
however, the assessment of an immediate civil penalty shall be deemed compliant
with the requirement for prior service of a notice of violation if served
simultaneously with the notice of violation. The assessment of a penalty and an
immediate civil penalty shall be served personally or by any means authorized
under Rule 4 of the N.C. Rules of Civil Procedure and shall direct the violator
to either pay the assessment or contest the assessment in writing, within 30
days after receipt of the notice of assessment. The office of the stormwater
administrator shall initially assess the civil penalty. In determining the
amount of the civil penalty to assess, personnel of the office of the
stormwater administrator shall be guided strictly by the table of penalties as
set forth herein.

                               is greater
 
a.   Guidelines for penalty assessment: Upon appeal of the civil penalty
assessment to the stormwater administrator, the stormwater administrator shall
be guided by the following standards and guidelines in affirming in whole or in
part, reversing in whole or in part or modifying the penalty imposed:
1.   Soil erosion and sedimentation penalty:
a)   The severity of the violation: whether slight, moderate or severe;
b)   The degree and harm caused by the violation along with the type of
violation;
c)   The duration, cause, extent of any off-site damage which may have
resulted;
d)   The effectiveness of action taken by the violator and adherence to the
approved plan;
e)   The cost of rectifying any damage, the amount of money the violator saved
by noncompliance and the estimated cost of installing and/or maintaining
corrective sediment control measures and staff investigative costs;
f)   Whether the violation was committed willfully and the prior record of the
violator in complying or failing to comply with referenced subsection.
2.   Stormwater control, illicit discharge and connection penalty:
a)   The degree and extent of harm to the natural resources and/or public
roadways of the city;
b)   The degree and extent of harm to the public health, or to private property
resulting from the violation;
c)   The duration and gravity of the violation;
d)   The effect on ground or surface water quantity/quality or on air quality;
e)   The cost of rectifying the damage;
f)   The amount of money the violator saved by noncompliance;
g)   Whether the violation was committed willfully;
h)   The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with
referenced subsection.
(4)   Criminal penalties: A violation of this section subjects the offender to
a civil penalty pursuant to the authority granted by NCGS 160A-175 and does not
subject the offender to the criminal penalty provisions of NCGS 14-4 and
Section
1-5 of Chapter 1 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Asheville.
(5)   Stop inspections order: A stop inspection order may be issued for a site
by the office of the stormwater administrator with all inspection approvals for
and all other permitted activity suspended if the site is not brought into
compliance within the time period for cure as set forth in the notice of
violation issued under this section. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the
office of the director of building safety and upon receipt, a stop inspection
order shall be issued from said office. Once the violation has been brought
into compliance, a notice shall be sent to the office of the director of
building safety and the stop inspection order shall be removed.
(6)   Suspension: The stormwater administrator may suspend any grading and/or
stormwater permit for any violation of the provisions of this section if the
site is not brought into compliance within the time period for cure as set
forth in the notice of violation. To suspend a grading and/or stormwater
permit, the stormwater administrator shall serve a notice of continuing
violation and permit suspension which shall comply with the notice of violation
requirements of subsection
7-12-2(h)(3), upon the financially responsible party. The notice may be served
by any means authorized under Rule 4 of the N.C. Rules of Civil Procedure. Once
the violation has been cured and all penalties have been paid in full or
penalty appeal has been filed within the given time frame, the suspension shall
be lifted and notice of such shall be sent to the financially responsible
party.
(7)   Revocation: The stormwater administrator may revoke any grading and/or
stormwater permit if the site is not brought into compliance within the time
period for cure as set forth in the notice of continuing violation and permit
suspension. The notice of revocation shall be served in writing pursuant to
section
7-12-2(h)(3) above, stating the reason for the revocation and the revocation
shall follow the same permit approval and review process required for issuance
of the permit, including notice requirements.
(8)   Permit reinstatement: A new permit application and approved plan
including all permit fees must be submitted prior to reinstatement of the
revoked permits. For permit reinstatement, the site must be deemed to be in
compliance with the requirements of this section and all penalties have been
paid in full or penalty appeal has been filed within the given time frame.
(9)   Stop work order: If, through inspection, it is determined that a land
disturbing activity is being conducted in violation of this section or of any
rule adopted or order issued pursuant to this section, or other applicable
local development regulation or any state law delegated to the local government
for enforcement purposes in lieu of the state undertaken in substantial
violation of any state or local law, or in a manner that endangers life or
property, and that the violation is knowing and willful, and that either: (a)
off-site sedimentation has eliminated or severely degraded a use in a lake or
natural watercourse or that such degradation is imminent; or (b) off-site
sedimentation has caused severe damage to adjacent land or that such damage is
imminent; or (c) the land disturbing activity is being conducted without an
approved plan, the stormwater administrator, upon compliance with all of the
procedural requirements of N.C.G.S. § 113A-65.1, may issue a stop work order,
the duration of which is not to exceed five days. The stop work order shall be
served by the sheriff of Buncombe County or some other person duly authorized
by law to serve process as provided by Rule 4 of the N.C. Rules of Civil
Procedure.
(10)   Summary abatement: If through inspection, the stormwater administrator
determines that a violation occurring under this section represents an imminent
threat to life or property, the stormwater administrator shall take such action
as may be necessary to protect the public and correct the violation.
(11)   Abatement: If an order directing the correction of a violation
representing a threat to life or property is not complied with within the
applicable period of time, the city may, after notice to the owner, enter the
land and perform all necessary work to abate the threat to life or property.
Notice shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the financially
responsible party by hand delivery; by certified mail, return receipt
requested; or by any other means allowed by Rule 4 of the N.C. Rules of Civil
Procedure.
(12)   Cost of abatement lien against property: The city may assess the owner
of the subject property with the cost of any work performed by the city
pursuant to an abatement, which cost shall be a lien on such property and may
be collected as provided in N.C.G.S. § 160A-193. Notice shall be provided five
days prior to entry and performance of necessary work by the city. For
stormwater management facilities, the owners of all property served by the
facility shall be jointly and severally responsible to the city for the
maintenance of the facility and liable for any costs incurred by the city. All
such properties are jointly and severally subject to the imposition of liens
for said costs.
(13)   Action for failure to comply and failure to pay civil penalty: If
violations are not cured or corrected within the time specified in the notice
of violation and/or the violator fails to give timely notice of appeal or fails
to pay the civil penalty assessed within the prescribed time period, then the
matter may be referred to the city's debt set-off program and/or referred to
the city attorney for institution of a civil action in the name of the city in
a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition to, or in lieu of, the other
remedies set forth in this section, the city attorney may institute an
injunctive action, mandamus action, or other appropriate proceeding. Upon
determining that an alleged violation is occurring or is threatened, a court
hearing an appeal for relief shall enter such orders and/or judgments as are
necessary to abate or prevent the violation. The institution of an action for
injunctive or other relief under this section shall not relieve any party to
such proceeding from any civil penalty prescribed by this section for
violations of this section.
(j)   Variances, exceptions and appeals.
(1)   Variances: Any aggrieved person may petition for a variance to the board
of adjustment to use one's land in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
section. Variances may also be requested from the aquatic buffer requirements,
deed restrictions and protective covenants required herein. Reasonable and
appropriate conditions and safeguards may be imposed on any variance granted.
Merely providing that the variance would permit a greater profit from the
property shall not be considered adequate justification for a variance. All of
the procedural requirements of the entity charged with granting a variance
shall be met by the applicant. Provided however, only the NCDENR—Division of
Land Resources may grant a variance or exception as herein below set forth, to
aquatic buffers along designated trout streams. The stormwater administrator
may support an applicant's appeal for a variance if the applicant's application
satisfies all of the following criteria:
a.   Unnecessary hardships would result from strict application of this
section.
b.   The hardships result from conditions that are peculiar to the property,
such as the location, size, or topography of the property.
c.   The hardships did not result from actions taken by the applicant.
d.   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent
of this section; will protect water quality; will secure public safety and
welfare; and will preserve substantial justice.
(2)   Exceptions: The stormwater administrator may approve plans that do not
comply with the mandatory standards of subsection
7-12-2(e)(2) of this section if the land disturbing activity is for the
construction of facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or natural
water course or work done for the purposes of creating trails, walkways, river
access areas, and similar facilities along the rivers, creeks or streams. Where
one or more measures required under subsection
7-12-2(e)(2) are not practicable, the stormwater administrator may approve
plans provided that additional measures are installed that provide the same
level of treatment, discharge and velocity control.
a.   Required exceptions: Notwithstanding the variance allowance herein, the
stormwater administrator shall grant an exception from the aquatic buffer
requirements, deed restrictions and protective covenants in any of the
following instances:
1.   When there is a lack of practical alternatives for a road crossing,
railroad crossing, bridge, airport facility, or utility crossing as long as it
is located, designed, constructed, and maintained to minimize disturbance,
provide pollutant removal, protect against erosion and sedimentation, have the
least adverse effects on aquatic life and habitat, and protect water quality to
the maximum extent practicable through the use of the BMPs.
2.   When there is a lack of practical alternatives for a stormwater management
facility; a stormwater management pond; or a utility, including, but not
limited to, water, sewer, or gas construction and maintenance corridor, as long
as it is located 15 feet landward of all perennial and intermittent surface
waters and as long as it is located designed, constructed, and maintained to
minimize disturbance, provide pollutant removal, protect against erosion and
sedimentation, have the least adverse effects on aquatic life and habitat, and
protect water quality to the maximum extent practicable through the use of
BMPs.
3.   A lack of practical alternatives may be shown by demonstrating that,
considering the potential for a reduction in size, configuration, or density of
the proposed activity and all alternative designs, the basic project purpose
cannot be practically accomplished in a manner which would avoid or result in
less adverse impact to surface waters.
b.   Limitation of aquatic buffer with a granted exception: Where a temporary
and minimal disturbance has been permitted as an exception to the aquatic
buffer, to the extent practicable, land disturbing activities in the aquatic
buffer shall be limited to a maximum of ten percent of the total length of the
aquatic buffer within the site to be disturbed such that there is not more than
100 linear feet of disturbance in each 1,000 linear feet of aquatic buffer.
(3)   Appeals: Any aggrieved party may file an appeal for or from the issuance
of a variance, or from the denial/grant of an exception, penalty assessment,
notice of violation, permit disapproval/modification, order, requirement,
determination or interpretation rendered under the provisions of this section.
The appeals process shall be as follows:
a.   To the stormwater administrator: With the exception of appealing for the
issuance of a variance, all appeals must initially be heard by the stormwater
administrator. The appeal must be submitted in writing within 30 days of
receipt of an adverse action (for the disapproval or modification of a permit
application for failing to meet the erosion prevention and sediment control
provisions of this section, the appeal must be submitted within 15 days) and
shall specify the specific grounds for relief and what relief is requested. The
stormwater administrator shall render a decision no later than 30 days from
receipt of the written appeal. Further appeal may be taken to the soil erosion/
stormwater review committee as established herein, within 30 days from the date
of receipt of the decision of the stormwater administrator.
b.   To the soil erosion/stormwater review committee: A soil erosion/stormwater
review committee (committee) is hereby created for the purpose of hearing
appeals taken from the stormwater administrator. The committee shall be
composed of five members as follows: two city department directors designated
by the city manager, one member of the planning and zoning commission, and two
members appointed by the Asheville City Council, one a resident of the City of
Asheville and the other from either the City of Asheville or the extra-
territorial jurisdiction (ETJ) of the city, at least one of whom shall have a
professional accreditation in the practice of stormwater management, erosion
and sediment control, or related areas of professional practice. A simple
majority of the appointed members shall constitute a quorum. The committee
shall hold an organizational meeting within a reasonable period of time after
adoption of this section to appoint a chair and adopt rules of procedure to
govern appeals as herein authorized. An appeal may be taken to the committee
within 30 days of receipt of the written decision of the stormwater
administrator. The appeal must be submitted in writing and shall specify why
the stormwater administrator's decision is erroneous and what relief is
requested. The committee shall take reasonable steps to ensure that written
decisions are rendered within a reasonable period of time after the hearing.
c.   To the Asheville Board of Adjustment: Further appeal may be taken to the
Asheville Board of Adjustment in accordance with and pursuant to the written
requirements of the board and section
7-6-2 of the UDO. Provided however, appeals regarding disapproval or
modification of a permit application based upon failing to meet the erosion
prevention and sediment control provision of this section, may not be taken to
the Asheville Board of Adjustment and, if an appeal is desired, such appeal may
be taken from inception, directly to the North Carolina Sedimentation
Commission pursuant to NCGS 113A-61(c) and Title 15A, NCAC 4B.0118(d).
d.   To the Buncombe County Superior Court: Every decision of the board shall
be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of
certiorari. Petition for review by the superior court shall be filed with the
clerk of superior court within 30 days after the decision of the board is filed
in the office of the board or after a written copy thereof is delivered to
every person who has filed a written request for such copy with the board at
the time of its hearing of the case, whichever is later. The appeal shall be
limited to the record before the board.
(k)   Prohibition, detection and elimination of illicit connections, illicit
discharges and improper disposal to the stormwater system.
(1)   Connections: It is unlawful for any person to connect any pipe, open

c.   Where such connections exist in violation of this section and said
connections were made prior to adoption of this provision or any other
ordinance prohibiting such connections, the property owner or the person using
said connection shall remove the connection within one year following the
effective date of this section. However, the one-year grace period shall not
apply to connections which may result in the discharge of hazardous materials
or other discharges which pose an immediate threat to health and safety, or are
likely to result in immediate injury and harm to real or personal property,
natural resources, wildlife, or habitat.
d.   Where it is determined that said connection:
1.   May result in the discharge of hazardous materials or may pose an
immediate threat to health and safety, or is likely to result in immediate
injury and harm to real or personal property, natural resources, wildlife, or
habitat, or
2.   Was made in violation of any applicable regulation or ordinance, other
than this section; the stormwater administrator shall designate the time within
which the connection shall be removed. In setting the time limit for
compliance, the stormwater administrator shall take into consideration: the
quantity and complexity of the work; the consequence of delay; the potential
harm to the environment, to the public health, and to public and private
property; and the cost of remedying the damage.
(7)   Spills: Spills or leaks of polluting substances released, discharged to,
or having the potential to be released or discharged to the stormwater
conveyance system, shall be contained, controlled, collected, and properly
disposed. All affected areas shall be restored to their pre-existing condition.

immediately prior to their release or discharge, and persons owning the
property on which the substances were released or discharged, shall immediately
notify the fire chief of the release or discharge, as well as making any
required notifications under state and federal law. Notification shall not
relieve any person of any expenses related to the restoration, loss, damage, or
any other liability which may be incurred as a result of said spill or leak,
nor shall such notification relieve any person from other liability which may
be imposed by state or other law.
(9)   Nuisance: Illicit discharges and illicit connections which exist within
the city's jurisdiction are hereby found, deemed, and declared to be dangerous
or prejudiced to the public health or safety and are found, deemed, and
declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated.
(10)   Monitoring and inspections related to illicit discharge program:
a.   Water quality monitoring: The stormwater administrator shall monitor the
quantity of, and the concentration of pollutants in stormwater discharges from
the areas and/or locations designated in the City of Asheville SWMP.

Sec. 7-12-3. Protected mountain ridges.
(a)   Purpose. The purpose of this provision is to expand the coverage of the
Mountain Ridge Protection Act of 1983 (as amended) in the City of Asheville and
the extraterritorial planning jurisdiction of the City of Asheville to further
regulate the construction of tall buildings or structures on mountain ridges.
This expanded regulation will insure that supplying water to, and disposing of
sewage from, buildings at high elevations does not infringe on the groundwater
rights and endanger the health of those persons living at lower elevations;
that adequate fire protection will be available; that such buildings or
structures will not be a hazard to air navigation; and that such tall buildings
will not detract from the natural beauty of the mountains.
(b)   Authority. This provision is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred
by N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 113A-208(a), as amended.
(c)   Jurisdiction. This provision shall apply to the construction of tall
buildings or structures as defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 113A-206(3), on
protected mountain ridges as defined hereinafter within the corporate limits of
the City of Asheville, North Carolina, and within the extraterritorial planning
jurisdiction of the City of Asheville in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. sec.
113A-208, as amended.
(d)   Tall buildings or structures. "Tall buildings or structures" include any
building, structure, or unit within a multi-unit building with a vertical
height of more than 40 feet measured from the top of the foundation of said
building, structure, or unit and the uppermost point of said building,
structure, or unit; provided, however, that where such foundation measured from
the natural finished grade of the crest or the natural finished grade of the
high side of the slope of a ridge exceeds three feet, then such measurement in
excess of three feet shall be included in the 40-foot limitation described
herein; provided, further, that no such building, structure, or unit shall
protrude at its uppermost point above the crest of the ridge by more than 35
feet. For the purposes of this section
7-12-3, "tall buildings or structures" do not include:
· Water, radio, telephone or television towers or any equipment for the
transmission of electricity or communications or both;
· Structures of a relatively slender nature and minor vertical projections of a
parent building, including chimneys, flagpoles, flues, spires, steeples,
belfries, cupolas, antennas, poles, wires, or windmills; or
· Buildings and structures designated as National Historic Sites on the
National Archives Registry.
(e)   Protected mountain ridges defined. The City of Asheville, North Carolina,
in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 113A-206(6) as amended, hereby
eliminates the 3,000-elevation requirement in defining a protected mountain
ridge for the purpose of applying the Mountain Ridge Protection Act in the City
of Asheville and its extraterritorial planning jurisdiction. "Protected
mountain ridges" are defined, therefore, in the City of Asheville and its
extraterritorial planning jurisdiction, as all mountain ridges whose elevation
is 500 or more feet above the elevation of an adjacent valley floor.
(f)   Protected Mountain Ridge Act compliance. The provisions of N.C. Gen.
Stat. sec. 113A-209 shall be applicable to protected mountain ridges as defined
hereinbefore.
(g)   Filing of maps. In accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 113A-212, a map
or maps tentatively identifying the protected mountain crests as defined by
this section has been filed by the North Carolina Secretary of Natural
Resources and Community Development with the Buncombe County Board of
Commissioners and the Asheville City Council. A map or maps identifying the
protected mountain ridges (and) crests in the City of Asheville, North
Carolina, has been filed with the Buncombe County Register of Deeds.
(Ord. No. 2369, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 7-12-4. Steep slope and ridgetop development.
(a)   Purpose. Asheville is in a unique geographic location where mountains,
valleys, and hills constitute significant natural topographic features. The
mountains and hillsides of Asheville are visible from many places in the city,
adding to the quality of life for residents, and improving tourism
opportunities for visitors. These areas are sensitive to development activities
and measures must be taken to maintain slope stability and to control erosion
and stormwater. In order to ensure the preservation of this character and the
appropriate use of the hillsides, the regulations of this section are
established to recognize that development of land in steep or mountainous areas
involves special considerations and unique development standards.
(b)   Goals and objectives. This section is intended to achieve the following
goals and objectives:
(1)   To promote public safety by ensuring that development on steep slope and
ridgetop areas addresses slope stability issues in an effective manner;
(2)   To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the location of
development and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce length and
width of roads, utility runs, and the amount of grading and paving;
(3)   To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing
vegetation, and the minimization of development on steep slopes and ridgetops;
(4)   To provide for the conservation and maintenance of steep slope and
ridgetop areas within city jurisdiction to achieve the above-mentioned goals;
(5)   To provide opportunities for developers to minimize impacts on steep
slope and ridgetop areas;
(6)   To provide standards reflecting the varying circumstances and interests
of individual landowners, and the individual characteristics of their
properties;
(7)   To preserve scenic views and vistas that are inherent to Asheville's
character and to minimize perceived density by minimizing views of new
development from within and outside of the development; and
(8)   To provide mechanisms to effectively enforce the requirements of this
section.
(c)   Steep slopes and ridgetops designated.
(1)   Steep slopes are designated as those areas at or above 2,220 feet in
elevation above mean sea level and having an existing grade of 15 percent or
more. For the purpose of applying specific development standards, steep slope
areas have been separated into different zones:
· Zone A - Areas between 2,220 and 2,349 feet in elevation and having an
existing grade of 15 percent or more;
· Zone B - Areas at or above 2,350 feet in elevation and having an existing
grade of 15 percent or more;
(2)   Ridgetops are designated on the official City of Asheville Ridgetops Map
(which is hereby made a part of this section by reference). Designated
ridgetops are:
· Protected mountain ridges as defined in subsection
7-12-3(e) of this Code regardless of whether such ridges have been otherwise
designated on maps filed in accordance with subsection
7-12-3(g) of this Code.
· All land within 100 vertical feet of any ridgeline or ridgeline segment that
is part of a designated watershed area containing a minimum of 100 acres and is
located 500 or more feet above the adjacent valley floor. If any part of a
ridgeline qualifies under this definition, any segments of the same ridgeline
that are of higher elevation than the qualifying ridgeline shall also be
considered ridgetops for the purposes of this section.
(3)   For the purpose of applying the geotechnical analysis of this section,
all areas having an existing grade of 36 percent or more, regardless of
elevation, or are located in areas designated as High Hazard or Moderate Hazard
on the Buncombe County Slope Stability Index Map prepared by the North Carolina
Geological Survey are subject to the standards set forth in subsection
7-12-4(l).
(d)   Application. The provisions of this section apply in the following
circumstances. Any portion of a lot, parcel, or tract of land which has been
approved for development or subdivision prior to the date of adoption of this
section {'{'}July 10, 2007{'}'} shall not be required to comply with the
provisions of this section if no further development or change to the approved
subdivision or development plan is proposed within that portion of the lot,
parcel, or tract of land. For the purpose of applying this provision, approval
of a subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of a development plan for
the individual lots in the subdivision.
(1)   Where new development is proposed for a one or two family dwelling, or
for a development requiring Level I, II or III site plan review pursuant to
section
7-5-9 of this chapter or subdivision review pursuant to section
7-5-8 of this chapter.
(2)   Additions to structures greater than 1,000 square feet or new site
disturbances encompassing more than 1,000 square feet of disturbed area. These
additions and site disturbances shall include smaller additions or disturbances
over a three-year period that accumulate to exceed the above limitations.
(3)   Substantive amendments to an approved subdivision or development plan
shall require full compliance with the requirements of this section. For the
purpose of this section, "substantive amendments" shall include increases in
the number of lots or density or intensity of development by more than ten
percent over that previously approved, location of a structure or structures in
areas of steeper slopes than originally approved, and similar amendments that
substantively increase the extent of development impact.
(4)   Regardless of the provisions of this section, lawfully-established lots
in existence on {'{'}July 10, 2007{'}'} may be developed with a single-family
home provided that the requirements of subsections (f), (g), (h) and (l) are
met, except that subsection (f) shall not apply to such lots where extent of
grading has been previously designated and approved on a preliminary plat or
approved development plan.
(5)   For areas located in zone A, the development standards set forth in
subsections (g), (h) and (k) shall not apply except that the front setback
reduction specified in subsection (h) is available to properties located in
zone A.
(e)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall
have the meaning as ascribed to them below:
Artificial slope  shall mean any land-disturbing activity that creates or
changes any slope or attempts to do so.
Cut slope shall mean the exposed ground surface resulting from excavation of
material.
Existing grade shall mean the vertical elevation of the land as it exists on {'
{'}July 10, 2007{'}'}.
Fill slope shall mean the exposed ground surface resulting from deposition of
material.
Slope shall mean the extent to which a land form deviates from the perfectly
horizontal as expressed in percent, degree or ratio. To ensure consistent
conversion between these separate methods of expressing the extent of slope,
the following explanatory table is provided as part of this definition.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/4317f255d3be89fb2864b8c9033ec06d02a5daf4/
IMAGES/0-0-0-270.png]
Trees and other specified vegetation shall mean all native trees of six or more
inches in diameter at breast height (dbh) and any mature grouping of
rhododendron or mountain laurel of 250 square feet or more in area. Invasive
non-native species shall not be included in this definition.
(f)   Grading. The following requirements regulate the extent and technique of
grading in steep slope and ridgetop areas based on the existing grade. Existing
grade is determined as follows.
Calculation of existing grade. The applicant may submit calculations of the
existing grade; these calculations shall be sealed by a licensed surveyor,
engineer, or landscape architect. If no calculations are provided, the City of
Asheville will calculate the existing grade of any property using the following
formula:
 
S = .0023(I)(L)
    A
 
Where:
S = Existing grade of parcel in percent
I = Contour interval of map in feet, with said contour intervals to be five
feet or less
L = Total length of the contour lines within the parcel in feet
A = Area of the parcel in acres
0.0023 = Product of two constants, one of which converts feet into acres and
one of which converts a decimal fraction into a percentage
Once "S" is calculated, it shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
If existing grade cannot be calculated using the above methods, it shall be
estimated using best available resources by the planning and development
director whose determination shall be final.
(1)   Grading extent. The extent of grading on a property located in a steep
slope or ridgetop area is governed by the following tables.
MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE OF SITE GRADING BY EXISTING GRADE
ZONE A FOR PROPERTIES AT ELEVATIONS 2220' - 2349'
Existing Grade Maximum Percent of Site Graded
MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE OF SITE GRADING BY EXISTING GRADE
ZONE A FOR PROPERTIES AT ELEVATIONS 2220' - 2349'
Existing Grade Maximum Percent of Site Graded

30% - 34%      30%
35% - 39%      25%
40% +          15%
 
Note: This table shall be interpreted in the following manner: "15%-19%" will
include all slopes of 15 percetnt up to any slope less than 20 percent, etc.
(2)   Road construction. Roads constructed on any lot, parcel, or tract of land
designated as a steep slope or ridgetop area shall be contained within a
corridor that shall not exceed 90 feet in width along 80 percent of its total
length; up to 20 percent of the length of the road corridor may be graded to a
maximum width of 135 feet to accommodate grading operations approved by the
city engineer. Road rights-of-way shall be a minimum of 32 feet and a maximum
of 40 feet and shall have a cross-section design as illustrated below. Cul-de-
sac circles, T-turnarounds and other road terminus features approved by the
city shall be exempt from these width requirements. Sidewalks are not required
to be constructed in steep slope or ridgetop areas but shall be subject to fee-
in-lieu requirements if not provided. Unless approved by the city engineer
based on an assessment of best engineering practices for the specific site,
retaining walls greater than four feet in height erected to comply with these
corridor requirements shall be located at least 10 feet outside of public
rights-of-way or edge of slope shoulder, whichever is greater, and shall be
privately maintained.

(3)   Artificial slopes. Artificial slopes shall be designed and landscaped to
create natural appearing slopes and hillsides. The replacement of trees and
other significant vegetation is imperative for maintaining the natural
appearance of artificial slopes. Artificial slopes shall not exceed the
steepness and height parameters listed in the following table except in
circumstances where stable exposed rock is the intended end result of the
artificial slope, in which circumstance the cut and/or fill slopes may be
increased at the discretion of the city engineer. Reforestation of artificial
slopes ten feet or greater in height, other than stable exposed rock, shall
consist of the placement of any of the tree or shrub species and size as
specified in a list prepared and maintained by the tree commission provided not
more than 20 percent of any one tree or shrub species is used except that
reforestation using entirely mountain laurel or rhododendron is acceptable. The
following table describes the planting design and amount of required plant
material for reforestation. A maintenance plan shall be required for reforested
areas and such plan shall include provisions for replacement of dead vegetation
when greater than a 50 percent mortality rate occurs.
 
ARTIFICIAL SLOPES
Slope Type Maximum Slope Maximum Height Required Reforestation
           1.5:1         30 feet
Cut Slope  2:1           40 feet        Reforestation shall consist of rows of
           <2.5:1        30 feet        plantings spaced 10 feet apart (on
Fill Slope 2:1           40 feet        center) in checkerboard pattern.
           <2.5:1        30 feet
 
Note: The maximum height of a combined cut and fill slope shall not exceed 60
feet.
(g)   Structure height and depth. The maximum height of principal structures in
steep slope and ridgetop areas shall be limited to two stories (maximum 30
feet) on the uphill side of the structure and three stories (maximum 40 feet)
on the downhill side of the structure, regardless of height allowances
elsewhere in this Code. For ridgetop development where structures are not
located so as to have a distinct uphill or a downhill side, the maximum height
of principal structures shall be limited to two maximum 30 feet). Accessory
structures shall not exceed 20 feet in height on any side. For the purpose of
this section, height shall be calculated as the vertical distance from existing
grade to the midpoint of the peak and eave for structures with pitched roofs
and from the top of the parapet or roof surface, whichever is greater, for
flat-roofed structures. An additional 12 feet in height may be allowed on the
uphill side and 20 feet in height on the downhill side of the principal
structure if any downhill-facing façade and the entire roof structure are
installed and maintained with materials or paint having an average light
reflectivity value (LRV) of 25 or less and a 50-foot deep area measured from
the rear property line is designated in a vegetation preservation easement and
existing vegetation in this area is maintained. This provision is not available
for ridgetop development. A LRV of 25 or less is strongly encouraged for all
structures built on steep slope and ridgetop areas regardless of their height.
The maximum depth through any one cross-section of a structure in steep slope
and ridgetop areas having a slope of 40 percent or more shall be 50 feet in
order to promote construction that is less intrusive on a slope (see
illustration below).

(h)   Tree and other specified vegetation preservation. All trees and other
specified vegetation shall be preserved in steep slope and ridgetop areas
except in areas approved for grading in subsection (f) above or within ten feet
of building footprints. Non-native invasive species may be removed. For new
development or additions, these preservation areas shall be designated on plans
submitted for development approval. For existing development, aerial
photographs or other methods of determining the extent of tree cover shall be
utilized to enforce this requirement.
During construction, these preservation areas shall be clearly designated using
tree protection fencing to protect them from disturbance.
Fines for removal of trees and other specified vegetation required to be
preserved, unless such trees and vegetation are determined to be dead, dying or
represent a threat to property by the city arborist or other person(s)
designated to enforce these requirements and said removal is thereby
authorized, shall be as established in article XVIII. In the event that a
violator chooses to remedy the violation through the planting of replacement
trees, such trees shall be selected from the city's list of large maturing
trees and shall be of a minimum of two inches diameter at breast height.
The planning and development director may approve reductions of front setbacks
from 35 feet to 20 feet in RS-2 zones and from 25 feet to 15 feet in RS-4 zones
such that the setback reduction results in reducing site grading and enhances
protection or existing trees and other vegetation.
(i)   Alternative landscape plan. In the event a property owner desires to
remove trees and other protected vegetation required to be preserved in
subsection (h) above, he or she may submit an alternative landscape plan for
consideration by the tree commission. This alternative landscape plan must
contain: a tree survey of the property showing which trees and other protected
vegetation will be removed and which will remain; the location of any
structures, driveways and other impervious surfaces; and an explanation of the
reason(s) for removal of required trees and other protected vegetation,
including a statement of how the removal of the required trees and other
protected vegetation supports the purposes of this section or how such removal
can be mitigated consistent with the purposes of this section. The tree
commission, in its sole discretion, may approve, approve with conditions, or
deny the alternative landscape plan. If conditions are established, they shall
be enforceable in accordance with the provisions of article XVIII. If the tree
commission denies the alternative landscape plan, it shall set out its reasons
in writing. Appeals of tree commission decisions shall follow the process for
appeals of decisions by the planning director as established in section
7-6-2.
(j)   Density. Densities of residential development shall be reduced in steep
slope and ridgetop areas to support the goals and objectives of this section.

achieve site preservation, screening or grading objectives. Such reductions
shall be indicated on the development plans submitted to obtain the density
bonus and the rationale behind the reductions shall be clearly demonstrated on
the plans or other application materials.
a.   Buildings, parking, and other improvements are clustered on less steep and
sensitive areas of the site to reduce the amount of grading and the steeper,
more sensitive areas are preserved through a conservation easement that
safeguards the property from future development; bonus of up to 60 percent
based on the following table. Less sensitive areas may not exceed a 40 percent
average natural slope and may include previously cleared areas, such as logging
roads and pastures, provided such clearing predates January 1, 2007. Clustering
in single-family residential districts and the RM-6 district may include multi-
family construction up to eight units per building if necessary to achieve site
preservation objectives. Conservation areas may not be located on individually

Sec. 7-12-5. Reserved.
Editor's note(s)—Ord. No. 3520, § 1, adopted Aug. 21, 2007, repealed § 7-12-
5 in its entirety. Former § 7-12-5 pertained to stormwater management and
derived from Ord. No. 2369, § 1, adopted May 29, 1997; and Ord. No. 3381, §§ 1
(d) and (e), adopted July 25, 2006.
Sec. 7-12-6. Stormwater services utility and enterprise fund.
(a)   Authority, purpose, jurisdiction, definitions.
(1)   Authority: Pursuant to N.C.G.S. Article 16 of Chapter 160A, the City of
Asheville is authorized to create a stormwater services utility and enterprise
fund and in so doing establish a schedule of rents, rates, fees, charges, and
penalties for the use of or the services furnished by such public enterprise.
(2)   Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to establish a stormwater
services utility as an identified fiscal and accounting fund for the purpose of
comprehensively addressing the stormwater management needs of the city through
programs designed to protect and manage water quality and quantity by
controlling the level of pollutants in, stormwater runoff, and the quantity and
rate of stormwater received and conveyed by structural and natural stormwater
and drainage systems of all types. It provides a schedule of rents, rates,
fees, charges and penalties necessary to assure that all aspects of the
stormwater program are managed in accordance with federal, state and local
laws, rules and regulations.
(3)   Jurisdiction: The boundaries and jurisdiction of the stormwater services
utility shall extend to the corporate limits of the city, including all areas
hereafter annexed thereto.
(4)   Definitions: For the purposes of this section, the words, terms and
phrases used herein shall have the meaning given to them in section
7-2-5 of chapter 7 of the UDO, except where the context clearly indicates a
different meaning. The stormwater administrator is authorized to interpret and
to apply these definitions. If a property could be interpreted to fall into
more than one category, the stormwater administrator shall, consistent with the
purpose and intent of this section, determine the applicable category.
(b)   Establishment of a stormwater services utility and enterprise fund.
(1)   Utility: There is hereby established a stormwater services utility for
the city. This utility shall provide for stormwater management programs
including the protection, regulation, quantity, quality, control, use and
enhancement of city owned and maintained stormwater and drainage systems.
(2)   Enterprise fund: There is hereby established a stormwater services
enterprise fund. The enterprise fund is established for the purpose of
dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and
responsibilities of the stormwater services utility including but not limited
to, rents, rates, fees, charges and penalties as may be established, after
notice and a public hearing by the city council and other funds that may be
transferred or allocated to the stormwater services utility. All revenues and
receipts of the stormwater services utility shall be placed in the stormwater
services enterprise fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the
stormwater services enterprise fund, except that other revenues, receipts, and
resources not accounted for in the stormwater services enterprise fund may be
applied to stormwater management programs, and stormwater and drainage systems
as deemed appropriate by city council.
(c)   Impervious coverage and rate unit.
(1)   Impervious surface area: Impervious surface area is a developed area of
land that prevents or significantly impedes the infiltration of stormwater into
the soil. Typical impervious surface areas include, but are not limited to:
roofs, sidewalks, walkways, patios, private driveways, parking lots, access
extensions, alleys and other paved, engineered, compacted or gravel surfaces
containing materials that prevent or significantly impede the natural
infiltration of stormwater into the soil (provided however, swimming pools and
wooden decks are not considered impervious surfaces for the purpose of this
ordinance).
(2)   Application of impervious surface area: The amount of imperious surface
area of real property is a key factor in the peak rate of stormwater runoff and
the pollutant loadings of stormwater runoff discharged to the structural and
natural drainage systems and facilities. Therefore, the amount of impervious
surface area shall be the primary parameter for establishing the rate structure
to distribute the cost of systems and facilities through a schedule or rates,
fees, charges and penalties related to the use and operation of the stormwater
services utility and public enterprise as established above.
(3)   Establishment and application of the equivalent rate unit (ERU): The ERU
shall be based upon an analysis of impervious surface throughout the city. The
ERU has been determined to be equivalent to 2,442 square feet of impervious
surface based on a statistically significant sampling of detached single-
family residential parcels in the City of Asheville.
(d)   Schedule of rents, rates, fees, charges and penalties.
(1)   Detached single-family residential: Each developed detached single-family
residential parcel shall pay a utility fee based on the amount of impervious
surface area on their property.
(2)   Tiering for detached single-family residential: Single-family residential
parcels will be charged a fee at the Tier I, Tier II and Tier III levels as set
forth in the City of Asheville Fees and Charges Manual, based upon square
footage of impervious area as more specifically set forth below:
 
Tier Impervious Area (Square Footage)
I    225—2000
II   2001—4000
III  4001+
 
(3)   Other properties: All other developed properties having impervious
surface area, including but not limited to multi-family residential properties
with two or more living units, commercial properties, industrial properties,
public, institutional and non-profit properties, church properties, public and
private school properties, and publicly owned properties shall be billed for
one ERU for each 2,442 square feet of impervious coverage on the subject
property, with any fraction thereof rounded up to the next ERU.
(4)   Common areas: Townhouse and condominium developments and other similar
properties containing impervious surface in common ownership shall be charged
for the total impervious surface of all commonly owned property within the
development.
(5)   Fees and charges manual: The schedule of rates, rents, charges, fees and
penalties shall be set forth in the City of Asheville Fees and Charges Manual.
(e)   Exemptions and credits:
(1)   Credits: Other properties as set forth above may apply for stormwater
utility fee credits. Credits are reductions in stormwater utility fees
applicable to the property in recognition of on-site or off-site systems,
facilities, measures, and actions taken by customers that go above and beyond
the minimum requirements of the prescribed ordinances. Credits shall be
conditioned on the continuing performance of the systems, facilities, measures,
or actions in reference to standards adopted by the utility upon which the
credits are granted, and may be revised or rescinded. Credits expire at the end
of one year from the date of award and may be renewed by the submittal of a
renewal application. In no case shall credits exceed 60 percent of the
stormwater utility fee.
(2)   Credit policy: The city manager shall prepare a credit policy which shall
set forth the appropriate process and documentation to obtain credits. The
credit policy shall be incorporated as an appendix to the City of Asheville's
Standards and Specifications Details Manual. The amount of credits will be set
forth in the city's fees and charges manual.
(3)   Equality of services: There shall be no exception, credit, offset, or
other reduction in stormwater service charges granted based upon age, race, tax
status, economic status, or religion of the customer, or other condition
unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and
facilities.
(f)   Billing.
(1)   Responsible party: As authorized by N.C.G.S., sec. 160A-314, stormwater
utility fees, charges and penalties shall remain the responsibility and
obligation of the property owner.
(2)   Method of billing: Bills for stormwater service shall be sent at regular,
periodic intervals. Billing and collection of stormwater service fees, rents,
rates, charges and penalties shall be administered by the city manager/
designee, who is hereby authorized to develop policies and procedures to
effectuate the purpose and intent of this section. Stormwater service charges
may be billed on a combined utility bill that also contains charges for water
and/or sewer service. Stormwater service charges that are shown on a combined
utility bill may be for a different service period than that used for water
and/or sewer service.
(3)   Billing options: The city shall have the following billing options for
stormwater service charges:
a.   Stormwater service charges for a property that receives combined sewer and
water service will be sent to the customer receiving such service. However,
where multiple water and sewer accounts exist for a single parcel, the bill for
stormwater service charges may for good cause shown at the discretion of the
city be sent to the property owner. Additional policies concerning billing will
be developed by the stormwater administrator.
b.   Owners of property may, with the consent of the city, designate each
occupant of the property as the party to receive the bill for stormwater
management service charge by completing and properly executing a form provided
by the city. Such designation shall fairly allocate the impervious surfaces
actually used by the billed party, and it shall be binding for the period of
time specified by the city. Such transfer does not relieve either the owner or
occupant from liability for stormwater service charges if they are not paid by
the party billed.
c.   The residents of townhouse, cluster unit, and condominium developments and
other similar properties containing impervious surface in common ownership with
a master water meter, the stormwater service bill shall be sent to the
homeowners' association.
d.   The residents of townhouse, cluster unit, and condominium developments and
other similar properties containing impervious surface in common ownership with
unit level meters, upon official request of the homeowners' association
reflecting a vote in accordance with the association's bylaws, the stormwater
service bill may be divided in equal shares among each unit within the
development and sent to the owner or occupant of each unit. A request for per
unit billing must contain all information required by the city and shall be
binding for the period of time specified by the city.
e.   The residents of townhouse, cluster unit, and condominium developments and
other similar properties containing impervious surface in common ownership
where there is no active homeowners' association, the stormwater service charge
will be equally divided among each property with no fee being less than one ERU
unless the property owners provide the city with an agreed upon division,
acceptable to the city.
(4)   No bill: Failure to receive a stormwater bill is not a basis for
nonpayment. The owner of each parcel of land containing impervious surface
shall be obligated to pay such fee.
(5)   Minimum stormwater service charge: In no event will any property owner
owning developed property pay less than the rate equivalent of one ERU except
for zoning lots or tracts with 225 square feet or less of impervious surface
area.
(g)   Delinquencies and charges.
(1)   Combined utility billing: Where stormwater service charges appear on a
combined utility bill, and a customer does not pay the service charges for all
the utilities on the bill, the partial payment will be prorated and applied to
the respective utilities in the following order: delinquent stormwater
management service charges, delinquent recycling service charges, delinquent
combined sewer and water charges, current stormwater charges, current recycling
service charges and current combined sewer and water charges.
(2)   Non-combined and/or separate stormwater utility billing: A stormwater
utility fee, charge or other billing for rents, rates, fees, charges and
penalties associated with the stormwater utility shall be declared delinquent
and subject to the delinquent fees and charges as set forth in the city's fees
and charges manual.
(3)   No criminal penalty: A violation of this section subjects the offender to
a civil penalty pursuant to the authority granted by N.C.G.S., sec. 160A-175
and does not subject the offender to the criminal penalty provisions of
N.C.G.S., sec. 14-4 and section
1-5 of chapter 1 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Asheville.
(4)   Back billing: If property is incorrectly billed, or not billed, or a bill
is sent to the wrong party, the city may back bill a property for up to a
three-year period.
(h)   Appeals.
(1)   Disputed bills: If a property owner disputes the stormwater utility
charges assessed to that owner's property, that owner must first attempt to
resolve the dispute with the city engineer's office. Using the information
provided, the appropriate staff of the city's engineer office shall conduct a
technical review pursuant to good engineering practices. Following such review,
the city's stormwater administrator may adjust the stormwater service charge so
long as the adjustment is in conformance with the general purpose and intent of
this section. At the conclusion of the review, the stormwater administrator
shall issue a written determination stating whether an adjustment to the
stormwater service charge is appropriate, and if so, the percentage of such
adjustment. Any approved adjustments must be communicated in writing to the
city's water resources department billing staff.
(2)   Filing of notice of appeal: If the owner is not satisfied with the
resolution of the dispute, the owner may file a notice of appeal to the city's
soil erosion review committee (herein "committee"), on a form provided by the
office of the stormwater administrator. The notice of appeal must be filed
within 30 days of the date of the service of the written decision of the
stormwater administrator upon the owner. The appeal shall include a written
statement setting forth the grounds for the appeal. The appeal shall be filed
in the office of the stormwater administrator. The stormwater administrator
shall transmit the written appeal along with all other documents constituting
the record upon which the stormwater administrator's decision was made to the
committee.
(3)   Documents: At the discretion of the stormwater administrator, the written
appeal may be required to include a survey prepared by a registered land
surveyor and such other information that show the total property area, the
impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions which influence
the hydrologic response of the property to the stormwater events.
(4)   Powers of the committee: The sole role of the committee is to review the
stormwater administrator's decision for clear error. In the absence of clear
error, the committee shall have no power to adjust, modify amend or reverse the
decision of the stormwater administrator.
(5)   Finality of committee's decision: The decision of the committee shall be
final. This shall not prevent the owner from pursing all other remedies as by
law provided, including appeal to the Asheville Board of Adjustment.
(6)   Service: All decisions of the stormwater administrator and committee
shall be served on the owner personally or by registered or certified mail.
(7)   No suspension of due date: No provision of this subsection allowing for
an appeal shall be deemed to suspend the due date of the service charge with
payment in full. Any adjustment in the service charge for the person pursuing
an appeal shall be made by refund of the amount due.
(i)   Disposition of service charges and fees. Revenues generated from
stormwater services utility fees, charges, rents, rates and penalties shall be
assigned and dedicated solely to the stormwater services enterprise fund in the
city's budget and accounting system, which shall be and remain separate from
other funds, and shall be used only to fund stormwater management programs and
structural and natural stormwater and drainage systems. The service charges and
fees paid to and collected by virtue of the provision of this section shall not
be used for general or other government or proprietary purposes of the city
except to pay for costs incurred by the city in rendering services to the
stormwater services utility.
(j)   Limitations of responsibility.
(1)   The city shall be responsible only for the portions of the drainage
system which are in city maintained street rights-of-way and permanent storm
drainage easements conveyed to and accepted by the city.
(2)   The city's acquisition of storm drainage easements and/or the
construction or repair by the city of drainage facilities does not constitute a
warranty against stormwater hazards, including but not limited to flooding,
erosion or standing water.

Sec. 7-13-1. Purpose and scope.
(a)   Purpose of sign regulations. The purpose of this article is to provide
sign standards and restrictions which allow for the legitimate needs for

activities while at the same time promoting signs which do not unduly detract
from the overall aesthetics of the community; which reduce intrusions and
protect property values; which provide for improved public safety by minimizing
undue distraction of the motoring public; which provide standards for the
erection and maintenance of signs; which provide for the protection and
enhancement of the tourist industry by promoting a more harmonious and pleasing
community image; which provide equitably for the nature and scale of the
activities to be identified; and which generally enhance and strengthen the
economic stability of the City of Asheville.
(b)   Scope. The provisions of this article shall apply to the erection and
maintenance of all signs and sign structures within the jurisdiction of the
City of Asheville as set forth in subsection
7-1-3(a), and it shall be unlawful following the effective date of this article
to erect, maintain, or alter any sign or sign structure except in conformance

rectangular figure which encompasses all lettering, wording, frame, design or
symbols, together with any background on which the sign is located and any
illuminated part of the sign, if such background or such illuminated part of
the sign is designed as an integral part of and related to the sign. Any
cutouts or extensions shall be included in the area of a sign, but supports and
bracing which are not intended as part of the sign shall be excluded. In the
case of a multi-faced sign, the area of the sign shall be considered to include
all faces visible from one direction.
b.   Where three-dimensional figures are used as or on signs, the area shall be
the total of all sides made an integral part of the projected figure used in
conveying the intended message.
(2)   Encroachment into the right-of-way. No part of any sign shall be located
on, or extended into, a public right-of-way unless it can meet the following
criteria:

rays of light will not shine directly into surrounding areas or on the public
roadway.
b.   Neither direct nor reflected light from any light source shall create a
traffic hazard or distraction to operators of motor vehicles on public
thoroughfares.
(4)   Visibility. No sign or structure shall be erected or maintained to impede
safe and adequate visibility from vehicles or for pedestrians.
(5)   Extensions. No extension(s) shall be allowed beyond those dimensions for
the sign area as initially permitted.
(b)   Off-premises signs by zoning districts. The following sign regulations
shall be applicable within the zoning districts wherein off-premises signs are
allowed. Any sign not specifically allowed is prohibited.
In the Community Business II, Highway Business, Regional Business, River,
Commercial Industrial, and Industrial District off-premises signs are allowed
subject to the restrictions set forth herein.
(1)   Size. No off-premises sign shall exceed six square feet per directional
flow of traffic 12 square feet total per sign structure). In no event shall the

in lieu of the second tier property's freestanding sign allowance, or may erect
a sign on that property (meeting second tier sign standards) with the
permission of the property owner if no other sign is used on that property.
This option limits allowances to those normally provided for under the

such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal
circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common
to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a
variance.
(3)   The hardship did not the result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.

ordinance, such that public safety is secured and substantial justices is
achieved.
No change in permitted uses may be authorized by the variance. Appropriate
conditions may be imposed on any variance provided that the conditions are
reasonably related to the variance.

shall make written findings that all of the above listed requirements have been
met. If a variance is granted it shall be the least possible deviation from the
requirements of this article. In granting any variance, the board of adjustment

article. Violations of the provisions of the variance granted, including any
conditions or safeguards, which are a part of the grant of the variance, shall

ARTICLE XV. SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Sec. 7-15-1. Subdivisions.
(a)   Purpose. The regulations for the subdivision of land set forth in this
article are established to promote orderly growth and development; provide for
suitable residential and nonresidential subdivisions with adequate streets,
utilities and appropriate building sites; provide for the coordination of
streets within subdivisions with existing or planned streets and with other
public facilities; provide for the dedication or reservation of rights-of-way
or easements for streets and utility purposes; and provide proper land records
for the convenience of the public and for better identification and permanent
location of real property boundaries.
(b)   Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or
more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose of sale or
building development (whether immediate or future) and shall include all
divisions of land involving the dedication of a new street or a change in
existing streets.
(1)   Divisions of land exempt. The following divisions of land are not
included within the definition of "subdivision", and are not subject to the
city's subdivision regulations.
a.   The combination or recombination of portions of previously subdivided and
recorded lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant
lots are equal to or exceed the standards of the city as shown in the city's
subdivision regulations;
b.   The division of land into parcels greater than ten acres where no street
right-of-way dedication is involved;
c.   The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for the widening or
opening of streets or for public transportation system corridors;
d.   The division of a tract in single ownership whose entire area is no
greater than two acres into not more than three lots, where no street right-of-
way dedication is involved and where the resultant lots are equal to or exceed
the standards of the city as shown in the city's subdivision regulations; and
e.   The subdivision or recombination of land by public utilities for utility
purposes or use.
(2)   Determination and certification of exemption. The determination of
whether a division of land is exempt from the definition of subdivision shall
be made by the designated staff upon application of the property owner or
agent, with supporting documentation (maps, plats, etc.), as needed. Upon a
determination by the designated staff that the proposed subdivision is exempt,
a certificate of exemption shall be issued, and the subdivision shall not be
subject to the city's subdivision regulations.
(3)   Effect of certification of exemption. Divisions of land found to be
exempt from the definition of subdivision are not required to meet the city's
subdivision regulations. However, a building or zoning permit may only be
issued with respect to a lot that has been created by an exempt division if
said lot meets the standards for development set forth elsewhere in this
chapter, including but not limited to historic overlay district or local
historic landmark guidelines and regulations. Where a regulation is contained
both in this article and elsewhere in this chapter, although the regulation
need not be met prior to property division and recordation, the lot in question
must comply with said regulation before a building or zoning permit may be
issued for the property.
(c)   Coordination with other requirements. When applications for other
approvals are required for the subdivision, applications for these approvals
may be submitted simultaneously with the initiation of the subdivision approval
process to reduce the time required to secure all necessary approvals.
Application forms as required for other approvals may be obtained from the
development services department.
(d)   Plan submittal. Applications for subdivision approval shall be submitted
to the Development Services department and must include plats with all
information as required by this Chapter and the designated city departments.
Applications for subdivision shall be filed in accordance with section
7-5-8 of this chapter.
(e)   Approval required.
(1)   Date of compliance. After the effective date of this chapter, no plat for
the subdivision of land within the City of Asheville shall be filed, accepted
for recording, or recorded, nor shall the County Register of Deeds or Clerk of
Superior Court order the recording of a plat until it has been submitted to the
city and approved as set forth herein. The signature of the designated staff on
the plat shall signify conformance with the requirements set forth in this
chapter.
(2)   No conveyance without approval. No real property lying within the City of
Asheville shall be subdivided until it conforms to all applicable sections of
this chapter and other applicable law. Violations of this article shall be
subject to the enforcement and penalties set forth in Article XVIII. Any sale
or transfer of land in a subdivision subject to these regulations by reference
to an unapproved plat or the use of a metes and bounds description shall be
considered a violation of this chapter.
(3)   Designation of approval agency. The City of Asheville Planning and Urban
Design Department is designated as a planning agency for the purposes of N.C.
Gen. Stat. § 160A-373. The Planning and Urban Design director or his/her
designee shall be authorized to sign the plat signifying final approval of
subdivisions.
(4)   Dedication and acceptance of public areas.
a.   Rights-of-way and easements. The approval of a final plat does not
constitute acceptance by the city of the dedication of any street or other
ground, public utility line or other public facility shown on the plat. When
located within the corporate limits of the City of Asheville, such dedications
may be accepted only by resolution of the Asheville City Council following
inspection and approval. Until the offer of dedication is accepted by the city
in either of these manners, the property owner shall be responsible for
maintenance of those areas.
b.   Open space. Land designated as public open space or a park on a plat shall
be considered to be offered for dedication, but not accepted until the
Asheville City Council has by express action done so. Until such dedication has
been accepted, such areas may be used for open space purposes by its owner or
by an association representing owners of lots within the subdivision. Land so
offered for dedication shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with the
proposed public use without the approval of the Asheville City Council.
(f)   Street and utility construction.
(1)   Plans. Construction plans for all street, water, sanitary sewer, and
stormwater facilities shall be submitted to the development services department
consistent with preliminary plat approval. The street and utility construction
plans for each subdivision, or portion thereof, shall include all improvements
lying within or adjacent to the subdivision as well as improvements to all
streets and water and sanitary sewer lines lying outside the subdivision which
provide service to the subdivision. No final plat shall be approved until all
improvements have been installed and approved or a guarantee accepted.
(2)   No construction without plan approval. No improvement to or new
construction of street, water, sanitary sewer, and stormwater facilities shall
be permitted until the street and utility construction plans for such
improvements/construction have been reviewed and approved by the designated
city departments and appropriate governmental agencies. These agencies may
include, but shall not be limited to, the Metropolitan Sewerage District, the
North Carolina Department of Transportation, and the Division of Environmental
Management of the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health and Natural
Resources, or their successors.
(3)   Inspection of construction. All construction undertaken pursuant to
approved street and utility construction plans shall be inspected and approved
by the City of Asheville and/or the appropriate governmental agencies.
(4)   Guarantee in lieu of construction of improvements. In lieu of completion
of construction of the required improvements and utilities prior to final plat
approval, the property owner may submit a performance guarantee approved by the
city, including but not limited to, a performance bond from a corporate surety,
licensed in North Carolina to execute such bonds, or an irrevocable letter of
credit payable to the City of Asheville, either of which shall be in an amount
equal to 125 percent of the estimated cost of the installation of the required
improvements, as determined by the city. The performance guarantee shall secure
the completion of construction of the improvements shown on the approved
preliminary plat. The performance guarantee shall remain in full force and
effect until such time as the construction of improvements and installation of
utilities are completed and accepted by the City of Asheville. Failure to
maintain the required performance guarantee shall result in the revocation of
the approval of the preliminary plat and any permits issued as a result of the
preliminary plat approval.
Failure to initiate construction of the improvements within one year of the
date the performance guarantee was accepted by the city shall result in the
city constructing the improvements, with the cost to be paid from the
performance guarantee. In the event that the amount of the performance
guarantee is insufficient to pay for the completion of the improvements, the
property owner shall remain responsible and shall pay to the city the total
amount of the insufficiency and if the city is not paid, the amount of the
insufficiency shall constitute a lien on the property in favor of the city.
(g)   Maintenance of common areas. Where subdivisions have common areas or
facilities serving more than one dwelling unit, the developer shall be
responsible for the maintenance of these common areas and facilities. This
responsibility may be transferred to another entity, provided the developer
prepares and records a document showing the transfer of the property and the
maintenance responsibilities to a successor. In such case, the successor shall
be responsible for the maintenance of the common access and facilities.
(h)   Recordation of final plat. A final plat must be recorded in the office of

homes, and the design of the development - its layout and landscaping are of
particular importance to ensure that it complements the surrounding existing
neighborhood. Further it is important that any proposal be designed to fit into
the context of the surrounding existing neighborhood, so the relationship of
the design to existing setbacks and prevailing lot sizes and housing
orientation should be taken into account.
c.   The property shall be lawfully established and conforming to the

apply and, in addition, there shall be a minimum of six feet separating cottage
homes from each other and adjacent structures on all sides.
h.   The maximum height for cottage homes shall be 28 feet. Accessory
structures shall not exceed 20 feet in height. For the purpose of this
subsection, height shall be calculated as the vertical distance from grade to
the midpoint of the peak and eave.
i.   The maximum gross floor area for individual cottage homes shall be 1,400
square feet, with a maximum gross floor area on the ground floor of 1,200
square feet. For the purpose of this subsection, gross floor area shall include
the floor area of any attached garages and shall not include the floor area of
any roofed porches, provided such porches are not enclosed.
Accessory structures shall be limited to detached garages and community
buildings and such uses shall not contain more than 800 square feet of gross
floor area. The maximum number of such accessory structures shall not exceed 60
percent of the total number of cottage homes in a cottage development.
j.   Parking requirements for cottage developments shall be as follows:
· The minimum and maximum parking requirement for cottage developments shall be
a minimum of one space per each cottage home and a maximum of two spaces per
each cottage home, respectively.
· Parking lots with six or more spaces shall not be provided within 25 feet of
an adjoining street right-of-way or property line unless screened by a Type A

b.   Purpose: The purpose of this use is to allow small infill development of
small single-family homes as a means to increase the stock of housing
affordable at the "workforce" and "affordable" housing levels. It is intended
that the allowed greater density will be offset by the smaller size of the
homes, and the design of the development - its layout and landscaping are of
particular importance to ensure that it complements the surrounding existing
neighborhood. Further it is important that any proposal be designed to fit into
the context of the surrounding existing neighborhood, so the relationship of
the design to existing setbacks and prevailing lot sizes and housing
orientation should be taken into account.
c.   The property shall be lawfully established and conforming to the
underlying zoning district(s).
d.   The minimum and maximum number of cottage homes in a cottage development
shall be two (2) and fifteen (15), respectively. Cottage developments shall not

limited to: common lawn; gazebos; patios; gardens; connected walking trails;
communal fire pit, etc. All communal features shall be available to all
residents.
•   Private open space - A minimum of 300 square feet shall be provided for
each cottage home. Private open space shall be designated by fencing,
landscaping, hardscaping or other means to create a separate private area for
the exclusive use of the person(s) residing in each individual cottage home. If

consideration the ability for the primary site user to maintain compliance with
minimum parking standards (if there is one) referencing the specific zoning
district standards as described in the UDO.

supplying power at the mobile food site. If this is pursued, then the

Sec. 7-16-2. Special uses.
(a)   Purpose. Special uses are uses which are generally compatible with other
land uses permitted in a zoning district but which, because of their unique
characteristics or potential impacts on the surrounding neighborhood and/or the
city as a whole, require individual consideration of their location, design,
configuration, and/or operation at the particular location proposed. Such
individual consideration may also call for the imposition of individualized
conditions in order to ensure that the use is appropriate at a particular
location and to ensure protection of the public health, safety, and welfare.
   All special uses shall, at a minimum, meet the conditions set forth in this
chapter. Any use identified as a special use in a zoning district shall not be
permitted without the approval of the planning and zoning commission.
   The approval procedure for special uses is set forth in section
7-5-5 of this chapter.
(b)   Special uses listed (by zoning district)
(1)   Historic landmark special use.
(2)   Reserved.
(3)   Telecommunications towers.
(4)   Telecommunication tower/support structure, concealed.
(5)   Reserved.
(6)   Reserved.
(7)   Reserved.
(8)   Adult establishments.
(9)   Those uses listed as uses by right subject to special requirements in the

inconsistent with the design and/or uses for which the structure(s) on the
property had been designed or used during the life of the structure(s).
e.   Prior to consideration of the request for the special use permit by the
planning and zoning commission, the historic resources commission of Asheville
and Buncombe County shall submit to the planning and zoning commission a
written recommendation relative to the appropriateness of the applications
being considered.
(2)   Reserved.
(3)   Telecommunication towers.
a.   Use districts: Office/Business, Community Business II, Resort,
Institutional, Highway Business, Regional Business Commercial Industrial,
River, Industrial, Light Industrial. In addition, where the planning and zoning
commission determines that a concealed telecommunication support structure is
not feasible or not an available alternative, a telecommunications tower shall
be allowed as a special use in residential districts at schools, fire stations,
publicly-owned housing complexes, recreation centers, community centers;
provided: (i) said use is not otherwise non-conforming, (ii) the property is
not subdivided for the purpose of accommodating a telecommunication tower and,
(iii) the application meets the standards set forth in subsections
7-16-2(c) and (d) of this chapter.
b.   The applicant for a special use permit for a telecommunication tower shall
bear the burden of demonstrating by substantial evidence in a written record
that a bona fide need exists for the proposed telecommunication tower and that
no reasonable combination of locations, techniques or technologies will obviate
the need for, or mitigate the height or visual impact of, the proposed
telecommunication tower.
c.   Application fees for a special use for a telecommunication tower shall be
in accordance with the City of Asheville's Fees and Charges Manual.
d.   The city may elect to retain outside consultants or professional services
to review a special use application for a telecommunication tower and to make
recommendations on relevant issues including, but not limited to, verification
of the applicant's due diligence, analysis of alternatives, conditions of
approval, and compliance with state and federal rules and regulations at the
applicant's expense. An application shall not be deemed complete until the
applicant has posted a $5,000.00 cash bond, or other security satisfactory to
the city, guaranteeing payment of such expenses. Private business users
operating a single wireless telecommunication facility at their principal place
of business and governmental users are exempt from the bond requirement.
e.   In addition to the notice requirements of section
7-5-20 of this chapter, the applicant for a special use permit for a
telecommunication tower shall be required to notify by regular mail all
property owners within a one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) radius of the proposed
location of any public hearing on the application at least ten days prior to
the hearing. The planning and development director or designee may require the
applicant to conduct a crane or balloon test to simulate the height of the
proposed tower. Notice of the dates and times of such tests shall be mailed by
the applicant to all property owners within a one-quarter mile (1,320 feet)
radius of the proposed location at least ten days prior to the primary test
date. The notice shall state primary and alternate test dates, as well as a
range of dates for testing in the event of extended periods of inclement
weather. The planning and development director or designee shall review and
approve the sufficiency of the notice prior to mailing and, as part of its
application, the applicant will be required to submit a certificate of mailing
and attach a copy of the notice and a list of the addresses to which it was
sent. In the event the applicant shall seek to increase the height of a
proposed tower, or move its location more than 50 feet laterally, from that
stated in the original notices, additional notice shall be required to be given
in accordance with the above provisions and all time periods shall run from the
date of supplemental notification.
f.   Applicants for telecommunication towers shall first be encouraged to
consider properties owned by the city or Buncombe County, or instrumentalities
thereof, before considering private properties. Public properties shall be
subject to the same restrictions and standards of appropriateness as private
properties. All such public agencies or instrumentalities shall retain
discretion as to whether to make a specific property available for wireless
telecommunication facilities and to make determinations with respect to site
capacity, aesthetics, or suitability of such facilities.
g.   Telecommunication towers proposed on properties under the ownership or
control of the North Carolina Department of Transportation shall simulate
typical highway lighting towers in height and appearance and shall be clustered
amongst or near such towers so as to be unobtrusive. If due to topography,
existing vegetative canopy, or other local conditions, the planning and zoning
commission determines that a tower disguised as a coniferous tree is a
preferable aesthetic alternative to a simulated lighting tower, it may require
such camouflage treatment as a condition of approval. If any portion of a
telecommunication tower located on such properties is used to mount cameras,
instruments, sensors or antennas for governmental use, and the same structure
supports or incorporates commercial wireless telecommunication facilities, the
governmental use shall be deemed incidental or accessory to the commercial use
and the entire facility shall be treated as a commercial use for purposes of
this section.
h.   It is the policy of the city to encourage co-location and the use of
existing structures where appropriate. In furtherance of that policy objective,
the following provisions shall apply to an application for a special use permit
for a telecommunication tower:
1.   A special use for a telecommunication tower shall not be approved unless
the tower is designed structurally, electrically, mechanically and in all
respects to accommodate at least two additional users. An application shall not
be deemed complete until the applicant submits:
a.   A letter of intent agreeing to make all of its wireless telecommunication
facilities (including existing facilities) within the city available to
providers of functionally equivalent services at commercially reasonable rates.
b.   A copy of an executed lease for the proposed tower site that allows co-
location or leasing or subleasing to other providers of functionally equivalent
services.
2.   Applicants are encouraged to meet co-location requirements by using dual-
band/multi-band antennas to allow sharing of antennas or antenna arrays by
wireless providers using different frequency bands or by using combiners to
allow antenna sharing by users of the same frequency band.
3.   A special use application for a telecommunication tower shall not be
approved if an electric transmission tower is located above, or no less than 25
feet below, the ground elevation of and within the search radius of a proposed
telecommunication tower, unless the applicant can demonstrate one or more of
the following:
a.   That sufficient easements or other interests in real property cannot be
obtained to accommodate the wireless telecommunication facility;
b.   That the electric utility owning the electric transmission tower is
unwilling to allow its use for wireless facilities;
c.   That the applicant is unable to gain sufficient ingress and egress to the
electric transmission tower;
d.   That the existing use of the electric transmission tower would interfere
with the operations of the applicant as documented by a qualified and licensed
North Carolina engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented;
e.   That the planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the
electric transmission tower as documented by a qualified and licensed North
Carolina professional engineer, and the electric transmission tower cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost.
   Electric transmission towers may be increased in height to that allowed for
telecommunication towers in the district in which the electric transmission
tower is located if the planning and zoning commission determines such height
extension is preferable to placement of a new telecommunication tower in that
area.
4.   A special use application for a telecommunication tower shall not be
approved unless the equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be
accommodated on existing or approved towers, buildings or alternative
structures more than 30 feet in height (after first considering electric
transmission towers) within a one-quarter mile (1,320 foot) radius of the
proposed telecommunication tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
a.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing
or approved tower, building or alternative structures, as documented by a
qualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer, and the existing
or approved tower, building or structure cannot be reinforced, modified or
replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.
b.   The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the
usability of other existing or planned equipment on the towers, buildings or
alternative structures, as documented by a qualified and licensed North
Carolina engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost.
c.   Existing or approved towers, buildings or other structures within the
search radius, or combinations thereof, cannot accommodate the planned
equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a
qualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer.
d.   Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the planned
telecommunication equipment upon existing or approved towers, buildings or
alternative structures.
5.   Antennas associated with a wireless telecommunication facility may not be
co-located on a tower or other support structure used by an amateur radio
operator.
i.   No wireless telecommunication facility shall interfere with usual and
customary radio and television reception with the exception of broadcast
facilities as provided for in the regulations of the FCC.
j.   All telecommunication towers must comply with FCC and FAA regulations.
k.   A copy of the applicant's FCC license must accompany its application. If
the applicant is not an FCC licensee, the applicant must demonstrate that it
has binding commitments from one or more FCC licensees to utilize the wireless
telecommunication facility and must submit a copy of each such wireless service
provider's FCC license. If FCC licenses have previously been filed with the
city in conjunction with other wireless telecommunication facilities, the
applicant may certify that such licenses remain in full force and effect.
l.   As part of its application, each applicant for a telecommunication tower
shall be required to execute a standard maintenance/removal agreement binding
the applicant and its successors and assigns to maintain properly the exterior
appearance of and ultimately remove the facility within 180 days of the
abandonment or cessation of operations of the facility. Such agreement shall
require the applicant to pay all costs for monitoring compliance with, and
enforcement of, the agreement and to reimburse the City of Asheville for all
costs it incurs to perform any work required of the applicant by the agreement
that it fails to perform. A $5,000.00 cash bond, or other security acceptable
to the City of Asheville, shall be required in conjunction with the
maintenance/removal agreement. The applicant and its successors and assigns
shall be required to continue such bond or other security until such time as
the facility has been removed and all other requirements of the maintenance/
removal agreement have been satisfied. Private business users operating a
single wireless telecommunication facility at their principal place of business
and governmental users are exempt from the bond requirement.
m.   Abandoned or unused wireless telecommunication facilities shall be removed
within 180 days of abandonment or cessation of operations. If not removed
within that period, such facilities may be removed as provided in the
permittee's maintenance/removal agreement and the costs of removal recovered
from the permittee's bond or other security. Prior to removing a wireless
telecommunication facility pursuant to this provision, the city shall give 30
days written notice of its intention to do so to the permittee at its last
known address.
n.   All telecommunication towers shall comply with FAA lighting requirements.
In addition, in a specific instance, the city may impose lighting requirements
for a tower that is not required by FAA regulations to be lit.
o.   Except as otherwise provided herein, minimum setbacks for
telecommunication towers shall be in accordance with the setback requirements
set forth in the development standards for the district in which the location
of the tower is proposed. In addition, for all properties other than city-owned
properties, telecommunication towers must be setback from any residentially
zoned or residentially used properties a distance equivalent to the full height
of the tower being erected. The planning and zoning commission may reduce the
setback requirement upon a showing by the applicant that there are special
physical circumstances or conditions affecting the proposed site such that the
strict application of the setback requirement would not allow the most
effective use of the proposed site to minimize the visual impact of the
wireless telecommunication facility.
o.1.   In residential districts, a minimum lot size of five acres is required
for all properties other than city-owned properties. This requirement may be
reduced by the planning and zoning commission if other site features are found
to mitigate the impact of the tower but, under no circumstances shall the lot
size be reduced to less than three acres.
p.   Telecommunication towers shall be buffered from adjacent properties with a
buffer which, at a minimum, meets the requirements of an "A" buffer as
described in section
7-11-3 of this chapter, regardless of adjacent zoning district classifications
or uses.
q.   No telecommunication tower shall be located:
1.   On top of buildings;
2.   In local historic districts, on the property on which a local historic
landmark is located, or within 1,000 feet of any local historic district or
local historic landmark.
3.   In areas determined by the planning and zoning commission to be "view
areas" (formerly "viewsheds of superior quality"), taking into consideration
the definitions by the United States Department of Interior, Blue Ridge Parkway
Office. A map indicating the location of the "view areas" which has been
reviewed and adopted by the city council shall be kept on file in the planning
and development department of the city.
4.   On a restricted mountain ridge.
r.   In cases where an applicant is required to perform an environmental
assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National
Environmental Policy Act or the National Historic Preservation Act, such EA or
EIS shall be submitted as part of its application for a special use permit. An
application for a special use permit will not be deemed complete until any
required EA or EIS has been submitted to the city.
s.   Telecommunication towers shall not be constructed unless the company
erecting the tower has general liability coverage of at least $1,000,000.00.
The owner of a telecommunication tower shall provide the city with a
certificate of insurance showing evidence of its coverage and the certificate
shall contain a requirement that the insurance company notify the city 30 days
prior to the cancellation, modification or failure to renew the insurance
coverage required.
t.   Telecommunication towers shall be designed to meet the following
standards:
1.   Towers and antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment.
The city council may condition approval on the use of specific concealment
techniques where it determines that doing so is necessary or desirable.
2.   Guyed towers are prohibited. Commercial wireless telecommunication towers
shall be of a monopole design unless the city council determines that an
alternative design would better blend into the surrounding environment.
3.   Use of dual-polarized antennas which electronically combine the functions
of transmit and receive antennas (rather than spatial diversity antenna arrays
which rely on antennas being physically separated), dual-band/multi-band
antennas (allowing two or more providers of different types of commercial
wireless services to share a common antenna), and use of combiners (allowing
antenna sharing by providers using the same frequency band) are encouraged.
4.   Antennas shall be mounted on telecommunication towers so as to present the
smallest possible silhouette, profile, or cross-section. Preferred antenna
mounting scenarios are, in order of descending preference:
a.   Compact dual-polarized antennas in a cylindrical unicell arrangement
extending no more than two feet from the sides of the supporting structure and
mounted atop the tower;
b.   Panel antennas flush-mounted against the tower;
c.   Antennas mounted at the end of straight or curved davit arms or brackets
extending from the sides of the tower.
5.   No telecommunication tower shall have constructed thereon, or attached
thereto in any way, any platform, catwalk, crow's nest, triangular framework,
or like structures or equipment, except during periods of construction or
repair. Curved or straight davit arms or brackets used for antenna mounting
shall be connected to the tower at the base of the arms or brackets only and
such arms or brackets (and any antennas or hardware mounted thereon) shall not
be physically interconnected with any similar arm or bracket.
6.   All equipment enclosures and other improvements accessory to a tower shall
be architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding environment and
shall be maintained in good appearance and repair. No equipment enclosure may
exceed 12 feet in height. Ground mounted equipment shall be screened from view
with a minimum "B" buffer as described in section
7-11-3 of this chapter, except where a design of non-vegetative screening
better reflects and complements the architectural character of the surrounding
neighborhood.
7.   Generators may not be used as a primary electrical power source. Backup
generators shall only be operated during power outages or for testing and
maintenance purposes. Testing and maintenance shall only take place on weekdays
between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
8.   Telecommunication towers, equipment enclosures and other improvements
shall be enclosed within a security fence consisting of chain link fencing at
least eight feet in height. The fence may be topped with barbed wire. The
planning and zoning commission may require as a condition of approval that the
fencing be screened by appropriate landscaping or other means. The planning and
zoning commission may waive or modify the fencing requirement if it determines
that doing so will enhance the overall appearance of the facility without any
compromise in safety or security.
9.   Telecommunication towers shall have a flat gray or galvanized finish
unless the planning and zoning commission determines another color scheme would
be a preferable aesthetic alternative.
10.   No two telecommunication towers shall be constructed within 1,320 feet of
each other unless documentation is provided to the planning and development
department to show that co-location on towers within the 1,320 feet is not
technically feasible.
11.   No telecommunication tower shall be permitted which exceeds 100 feet in
height.
12.   Signage at any telecommunication tower site shall conform to the
following provisions:
a.   A sign listing the name of the wireless telecommunication service provider
operating the site, the site name or number and an emergency telephone number
shall be posted at or near the entrance to the site so as to be readily visible
to persons outside the site's security fencing.
b.    Equipment hazard warning and informational signs are permitted.
c.   The posting of any other signs or advertising is prohibited at any
wireless telecommunication facility or upon any telecommunication tower.
13.   The planning and zoning commission may require any other conditions
deemed necessary or desirable to ameliorate the impact of the tower on the
adjacent properties and uses. Such conditions shall include, but are not
limited to: the height of the tower; the construction or type of tower;
lighting; and co-location of the antennas and facilities of different parties
on a single tower.
u.   An annual wireless telecommunication facility permit shall be required for
each wireless telecommunication facility located in the city. Before a permit
shall be issued or renewed an applicant or permittee must certify that:
1.   It currently holds an FCC license to provide commercial wireless services
and that such license is in good standing or, if the permittee is not an FCC
licensee, that the license of each of its FCC tenants is in good standing.
2.   The wireless telecommunication facility continues to be operated by the
permittee and that it has a continuing need for the facility to meet the
requirements of its FCC license.
3.   That the facility continues to comply with all FCC and FAA rules and
regulations and all conditions of its special use permit.
4.   That the permittee currently has general liability insurance of at least
$1,000,000.00 in force covering the wireless telecommunication facility as
evidenced by a certificate of insurance attached to its renewal application.
5.   That it is in compliance with its maintenance/removal agreement and that
any bond or other security given in conjunction therewith remains in full force
and effect.
6.   That it has not constructed, maintained, modified or operated any wireless
telecommunication facilities in the city without the city's approval or, if it
has done so, that it has ceased operating and has removed all such facilities.
   Failure to obtain or renew an annual wireless telecommunication facility
permit shall result in the wireless telecommunication facility being deemed
abandoned and subject to removal, as well as subjecting the facility's owner to
all other penalty and enforcement provisions of this Code. Prior to removing a
wireless telecommunication facility pursuant to this provision, the city shall
give 30 days' advance written notice to the permittee at its last known address
of the pending expiration of the permittee's annual wireless telecommunication
facility permit. Fees for annual wireless telecommunication facility permits
shall be in accordance with the City of Asheville Fees and Charges Manual.
v.   Special use permits for telecommunication towers shall be valid for an
initial period of five years. Upon application by the permittee within 60 days
prior to the expiration of the initial permit period, a review shall be
conducted to determine whether and under what conditions the special use may be
extended for successive five-year periods. Costs associated with the review
process shall be borne by the permittee. Fees for five-year permit renewal
shall be in accordance with the City of Asheville Fees and Charges Manual.
Grounds for nonrenewal or revocation include:
1.   The use involved is no longer allowed as a special use in the zoning
district or fails to comply with the relevant requirements of this chapter as
adopted on January 12, 1999, or any subsequently enacted land use regulations
in effect at the time of renewal and the permittee has failed to supply
reasonable assurances that the facility will be brought into compliance within
180 days of the initial permit's expiration;
2.   The permittee has failed to comply with the conditions of any special use
approval;
3.   The facility has not been properly maintained;
4.   The facility has not been upgraded to minimize its impact, including
community aesthetics, to the greatest extent permitted by the technology exists
at the time of renewal; or
5.   The permittee has failed to operate the facility for a continuous period
of 180 days or more.
   If a special use is not renewed prior to its expiration, it shall
automatically become null and void without notice and hearing five years after
it is issued or upon cessation of use for more than 180 days, whichever comes
first. Within 180 days after expiration or revocation of a special use approval
for a telecommunication tower, or the abandonment or cessation of operation of
the wireless facility, the tower and facility shall be removed from the
property. Prior to removing a wireless telecommunication facility pursuant to
this provision, the city shall give 30 days' written notice of its intent to do
so to the permittee at its last known address.
w.   A special use approval for a telecommunication tower shall become null and
void if the facility is not constructed and placed in service within one year
of the date of approval provided, however, that the special use approval may be
extended one time for six months if substantial construction has commenced
before the end of the initial year.
(4)   Concealed telecommunication support structures.
a.   Use districts: All zoning districts except the Central Business District.
In residential districts, concealed telecommunication support structures may
only be permitted as a special use at schools, places of worship, fire
stations, publicly-owned housing complexes, recreation centers, community
centers, or other properties not used for residential purposes; provided that
the existing or current use is not otherwise non-conforming, and that the
property is not subdivided for the purpose of accommodating a
telecommunications tower.
b.   Concealed telecommunication support structures are a narrowly limited
alternative means for providing wireless service to parts of the community,
such as residential areas, where conventional telecommunication towers would be
aesthetically unacceptable. In order to encourage design creativity and to
assure that such structures are in harmony with their setting, the planning and
zoning commission shall not approve the special use application for a concealed
telecommunication structure unless it finds that:
1.   The structure is a work of public art that enhances and is compatible with
its surroundings; or
2.   On developed parcels, that the structure appears integral to or
complements the design of any building or complex of buildings located on the
same parcel and is not readily discernible or distinguishable as a
telecommunication structure; and
3.   That the overall location, design, and configuration is appropriate to the
particular proposed location.
c.   The applicant for a special use permit for a concealed telecommunication
support structure shall bear the burden of demonstrating by substantial
evidence in a written record that a bona fide need exists for the proposed
structure and that no reasonable combination of locations, techniques or
technologies will obviate the need for, or mitigate the height or visual impact
of, the proposed structure.
d.   Application fees for a special use for a concealed telecommunication
support structure shall be in accordance with the City of Asheville's Fees and
Charges Manual.
e.   The city may elect to retain outside consultants or professional services
to review a special use application for a concealed telecommunication support
structure and to make recommendations on relevant issues including, but not
limited to, verification of the applicant's due diligence, analysis of
alternatives, conditions of approval, and compliance with state and federal
rules and regulations at the applicant's expense. An application shall not be
deemed complete until the applicant has posted a $5,000.00 cash bond, or other
security satisfactory to the city, guaranteeing payment of such expenses.
Private business users operating a single wireless telecommunication facility
at their principal place of business and governmental users are exempt from the
bond requirement.
f.   In addition to the notice requirements of section
7-5-20 of this chapter, the applicant for a special use for a concealed
telecommunication support structure shall be required to notify by regular mail
all property owners within a one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) radius of the
proposed location of any public hearing on the application at least ten days
prior to the hearing. The planning and development director or designee may
require the applicant to conduct a crane or balloon test to simulate the height
of the proposed structure. Notice of the dates and times of such tests shall be
sent by the applicant by regular mail to all property owners within a one-
quarter mile (1,320 feet) radius of the proposed location at least ten days
prior to the primary test date. The notice shall state primary and alternate
test dates, as well as a range of dates for testing in the event of extended
periods of inclement weather. The planning and development director or designee
shall review and approve the sufficiency of the notice prior to mailing and, as
part of its application, the applicant will be required to submit a certificate
of mailing and attach a copy of the notice and a list of the addresses to which
it was sent. In the event the applicant shall seek to increase the height of a
proposed structure, or move its location more than 50 feet laterally, from that
stated in the original notices, additional notice shall be required to be given
in accordance with the above provisions and all time periods shall run from the
date of supplemental notification.
g.   Applicants for a special use for a concealed telecommunication support
structure shall first be encouraged to consider properties owned by the city or
Buncombe County, or instrumentalities thereof, before considering private
properties. Public properties shall be subject to the same restrictions and
standards of appropriateness as private properties. All such public agencies or
instrumentalities shall retain discretion as to whether to make a specific
property available for wireless telecommunication facilities and to make
determinations with respect to site capacity, aesthetics, or suitability of
such facilities.
h.   It is the policy of the city to encourage co-location and the use of
existing structures where appropriate. In furtherance of that policy objective,
the following provisions shall apply to an application for a special use permit
for a concealed telecommunication support structure:
1.   A special use for a concealed telecommunication support structure shall
not be approved unless the tower is designed structurally, electrically,
mechanically and in all respects to accommodate at least one additional user.
An application shall not be deemed complete until the applicant submits:
a.   A letter of intent agreeing to make all of its wireless telecommunication
facilities (including existing facilities) within the city available to
providers of functionally equivalent services at commercially reasonable rates.
b.   A copy of an executed lease for the proposed tower site that allows co-
location or leasing or subleasing to other providers of functionally equivalent
services.
2.   Applicants are encouraged to meet co-location requirements by using dual-
band/multi-band antennas to allow sharing of antennas or antenna arrays by
wireless providers using different frequency bands or by using combiners to
allow antenna sharing by users of the same frequency band.
i.   A special use application for a concealed telecommunication support
structure shall not be approved if an electric transmission tower is located
above, or no less than 25 feet below, the ground elevation of and within a one-
quarter mile (1,320 feet) radius laterally of a proposed structure, unless the
applicant can demonstrate that sufficient easements or other interests in real
property cannot be obtained to accommodate the wireless telecommunication
facility, or that the electric utility owning the electric transmission tower
is unwilling to allow its use for wireless facilities. Such electric
transmission towers may be increased in height to that allowed for concealed
telecommunication support structures in the district in which the transmission
tower is located (other than in residential districts) if the planning and
zoning commission determines such height extension is preferable to placement
of a new concealed telecommunication support structure.
j.   A special use application for a concealed telecommunication support
structure shall not be approved unless the equipment planned for the proposed
tower cannot be accommodated on existing or approved towers, buildings or
alternative structures more than 30 feet in height (after first considering
electric transmission towers) within a one-quarter mile (1,320 foot) radius of
the proposed structure due to one or more of the following reasons:
1.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing
or approved tower, building or alternative structures, as documented by a
qualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer, and the existing
or approved tower, building or structure cannot be reinforced, modified or
replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.
2.   The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the
usability of other existing or planned equipment on the towers, buildings or
alternative structures, as documented by a qualified and licensed North
Carolina engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost.
3.   Existing or approved towers, buildings or other structures within the
search radius, or combinations thereof, cannot accommodate the planned
equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a
qualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer.
4.   Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the planned
telecommunication equipment upon existing or approved towers, buildings or
alternative structures.
k.   Antennas associated with a wireless telecommunication facility may not be
co-located on a tower or other support structure used by an amateur radio
operator.
l.   Before approving a concealed telecommunication support structure, the
planning and zoning commission may consider the desirability of relocating
wireless facilities located on other structures to the proposed new structure
in order to facilitate reductions in visual impacts or the decommissioning of
other structures.
m.   No wireless telecommunication facility shall interfere with usual and
customary radio and television reception with the exception of broadcast
facilities as provided for in the regulations of the FCC.
n.   All telecommunication towers must comply with FCC and FAA regulations.
o.   A copy of the applicant's FCC license must accompany its application. If
the applicant is not an FCC licensee, the applicant must demonstrate that it
has binding commitments from one or more FCC licensees to utilize the wireless
telecommunication facility and must submit a copy of each such wireless service
provider's FCC license. If FCC licenses have previously been filed with the
city in conjunction with other wireless telecommunication facilities, the
applicant may certify that such licenses remain in full force and effect.
p.   As part of its application, each applicant for a concealed
telecommunication support structure shall be required to execute a standard
maintenance/removal agreement binding the applicant and its successors and
assigns to maintain properly the exterior appearance of and ultimately remove
the facility within 180 days of the abandonment or cessation of operations of
the facility. Such agreement shall require the applicant to pay all costs for
monitoring compliance with, and enforcement of, the agreement and to reimburse
the City of Asheville for all costs it incurs to perform any work required of
the applicant by the agreement that it fails to perform. A $5,000.00 cash bond,
or other security acceptable to the City of Asheville, shall be required in
conjunction with the maintenance/removal agreement. The applicant and its
successors and assigns shall be required to continue such bond or other
security unit until such time as the facility has been removed and all other
requirements of the maintenance/removal agreement have been satisfied. Private
business users operating a single wireless telecommunication facility at their
principal place of business and governmental users are exempt from the bond
requirement.
q.   Abandoned or unused wireless telecommunication facilities shall be removed
within 180 days of abandonment or cessation of operations. If not removed
within that period, such facilities may be removed as provided in the
permittee's maintenance/removal agreement and the costs of removal recovered
from the permittee's bond or other security. Prior to removing a wireless
telecommunication facility pursuant to this provision, the city shall give 30
days' written notice of its intent to do so to the permittee at its last known
address.
r.   Concealed telecommunication support structures shall not have aircraft
obstruction lighting unless, in a particular instance, the planning and zoning
commission may require such lighting. The exterior of the structure may be
illuminated if such lighting is approved by the planning and zoning commission
as part of the concealed structure's overall design.
s.   Except as otherwise provided herein, minimum setbacks for concealed
telecommunication support structures shall be in accordance with the setback
requirements set forth in the development standards for the district in which
the location of the tower is proposed. In addition, telecommunication towers
must be set back from any residentially zoned or residentially used properties
a distance equivalent to one-half the height of the tower being erected. The
planning and zoning commission may reduce the setback requirement upon a
showing by the applicant that there are special physical circumstances or
conditions affecting the proposed site such that the strict application of the
setback requirement would not allow the most effective use of the proposed site
to minimize the visual impact of the wireless telecommunication facility.
t.   Concealed telecommunication support structures shall be buffered from
adjacent properties with a row of evergreen trees and/or shrubs planted in a
landscape strip with a minimum width of five feet, except where a design of
non-vegetative screening better reflects and complements the architectural
character of the surrounding neighborhood.
u.   No concealed telecommunication support structure shall be located:
1.   In local historic districts, on the property on which a local historic
landmark is located, or within 1,000 feet of any local historic district unless
the historic resources commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness
indicating its approval of the proposed structure;
2.   In areas determined by the planning and zoning commission to be "view
areas" (formerly "viewsheds of superior quality"), taking into consideration
the definitions by the United States Department of Interior, Blue Ridge Parkway
Office, unless the applicant demonstrates that the structure will not result in
derogation of resources, values or purposes for which the Blue Ridge Parkway
was established. A map indicating the location of the "view areas" which has
been reviewed and adopted by the city council shall be kept on file in the
planning and development department of the city.
3.   On a restricted mountain ridge.
v.   In cases where an applicant is required to perform an environmental
assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National
Environmental Policy Act or the National Historic Preservation Act, such EA or
EIS shall be submitted as part of its application for a special use permit. An
application for a special use permit will not be deemed complete until any
required EA or EIS has been submitted to the city.
w.   Concealed telecommunication support structures shall not be constructed
unless the company erecting the structure has general liability coverage of at
least $1,000,000.00. The owner of such a structure shall provide the city with
a certificate of insurance showing evidence of its coverage and the certificate
shall contain a requirement that the insurance company notify the city 30 days
prior to the cancellation, modification or failure to renew the insurance
coverage required.
x.   Concealed telecommunication support structures shall be designed to meet
the following standards:
1.   Structures and antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment.
The planning and zoning commission may specify a particular concealment
technique or architectural treatment as a condition of approval.
2.   All antennas shall be mounted behind an RF-transparent façade and shall be
arranged so as to make efficient use of space inside the support structure in
order to maximize co-location opportunities. Use of dual-polarized antennas
which electronically combine the functions of transmit and receive antennas
(rather than spatial diversity antenna arrays which rely on antennas being
physically separated), dual-band/multi-band antennas (allowing two or more
providers of different types of commercial wireless services to share a common
antenna), and use of combiners (allowing antenna sharing by providers using the
same frequency band) are encouraged in order to make efficient use of space
within a concealed structure.
3.   All equipment enclosures and other improvements accessory to a concealed
telecommunication support structure shall be architecturally designed to blend
in with the surrounding environment and shall be maintained in good appearance
and repair. No equipment enclosure may exceed 12 feet in height. Ground mounted
equipment shall be screened from view with a minimum "B" buffer as described in
subsection
7-11-3(d)(15) of this chapter, except where a design of non-vegetative
screening better reflects and complements the architectural character of the
surrounding neighborhood and land uses.
4.   Generators may not be used as a primary electrical power source. Backup
generators shall only be operated during power outages or for testing and
maintenance purposes. Testing and maintenance shall only take place on weekdays
between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
5.   Equipment enclosures and other improvements associated with a concealed
telecommunication support structure shall be enclosed within a security fence
consisting of chain link fencing at least eight feet in height. The fence may
be topped with barbed wire. The planning and zoning commission may require as a
condition of approval that the fencing be screened by appropriate landscaping
or other means. The planning and zoning commission may waive or modify the
fencing requirement if it determines that doing so will enhance the overall
appearance of the facility without any compromise in safety or security.
6.   The height of any concealed telecommunication support structure shall be
limited to the minimum height necessary to achieve effective signal propagation
above the surrounding vegetative canopy, and to maintain an appropriate sense
of scale with the surrounding buildings, land uses and landscape. No concealed
telecommunication support structure shall be permitted which exceeds 100 feet
in height.
7.   Signage at any concealed telecommunication support structure site shall
conform to the following provisions:
a.   A sign listing the name of the wireless telecommunication service provider
operating the site, the site name or number and an emergency telephone number
shall be posted at or near the entrance to the site so as to be readily visible
to persons outside the site's security fencing or entrance.
b.   Equipment hazard warning and informational signs are permitted.
c.   The posting of any other signs or advertising is prohibited at any
wireless telecommunication facility or upon any concealed telecommunication
support structure provided, however, that the planning and zoning commission
may approve signage on the exterior of a concealed telecommunication support
structure identifying the property on which the facility is located if such
signage is integral to the overall concealment scheme.
8.   The planning and zoning commission may require any other conditions deemed
necessary or desirable to ameliorate the impact of the support structure on
adjacent properties and uses. Such conditions shall include, but are not
limited to: the height of the structure; the design, construction or type of
structure; lighting; and co-location of the antennas and facilities of
different parties on a single structure.
y.   An annual wireless telecommunication facility permit shall be required for
each wireless telecommunication facility located in the city. Before a permit
shall be issued or renewed an applicant or permittee must certify that:
1.   It currently holds an FCC license to provide commercial wireless services
and that such license is in good standing or, if the permittee is not an FCC
licensee, that the license of each of its FCC tenants is in good standing.
2.   The wireless telecommunication facility continues to be operated by the
permittee and that it has a continuing need for the facility to meet the
requirements of its FCC license.
3.   That the facility continues to comply with all FCC and FAA rules and
regulations and all conditions of its special use permit.
4.   That the permittee currently has general liability insurance of at least
$1,000,000.00 in force covering the wireless telecommunication facility as
evidenced by a certificate of insurance attached to its renewal application.
5.   That it is in compliance with its maintenance/removal agreement and that
any bond or other security given in conjunction therewith remains in full force
and effect.
6.   That it has not constructed, maintained, modified or operated any wireless
telecommunication facilities in the city without the city's approval or, if it
has done so, that it has ceased operating and has removed all such facilities.
   Failure to obtain or renew an annual wireless telecommunication facility
permit shall result in the wireless telecommunication facility being deemed
abandoned and subject to removal, as well as subjecting the facility's owner to
all other penalty and enforcement provisions of this Code. Prior to removing a
wireless telecommunication facility pursuant to this provision, the city shall
give 30 days' advance written notice of its intent to the permittee at its last
known address of the pending expiration of the permittee's annual wireless
telecommunication facility permit. Fees for annual wireless telecommunication
facility permits shall be in accordance with the City of Asheville Fees and
Charges Manual.
z.   Special use permits for concealed telecommunication support structures
shall be valid for an initial period of five years. Upon application by the
permittee within 60 days prior to the expiration of the initial permit period,
a review shall be conducted to determine whether and under what conditions the
special use may be extended for successive five-year periods. Costs associated
with the review process shall be borne by the permittee. Fees for five-year
permit renewals shall be in accordance with the City of Asheville Fees and
Charges Manual. Grounds for nonrenewal or revocation include:
1.   The use involved is no longer allowed as a special use in the zoning
district or fails to comply with the relevant requirements of this chapter as
adopted on January 12, 1999, or any subsequently enacted land use regulations
in effect at the time of renewal and the permittee has failed to supply
reasonable assurances that the facility will be brought into compliance within
180 days of the initial permit's expiration;
2.   The permittee has failed to comply with the conditions of any special use
approval;
3.   The facility has not been properly maintained;
4.   The facility has not been upgraded to minimize its impact, including
community aesthetics, to the greatest extent permitted by the technology
existing at the time of renewal; or
5.   The permittee has failed to operate the facility for a continuous period
of 180 days or more.
   If a special use is not renewed prior to its expiration, it shall
automatically become null and void without notice and hearing five years after
it is issued or upon cessation of use for more than 180 days, whichever comes
first. Within 180 days after expiration or revocation of a special use approval
for a concealed telecommunication support structure, or the abandonment or
cessation of operation of the wireless facility, the structure and facility
shall be removed from the property. Prior to removing a wireless
telecommunication facility pursuant to this provision, the city shall give 30
days' written notice of its intention to do so to the permittee at its last
known address.
aa.   A special use approval for a concealed telecommunication support
structure shall become null and void if the facility is not constructed and
placed in service within one year of the date of approval provided, however,
that the special use approval may be extended one time for six months if
substantial construction has commenced before the end of the initial year.
(5)   Reserved.
(6)   Reserved.
(7)   Reserved.
(8)   Adult establishments.
a.   Use districts: Regional Business, Commercial Industrial, Highway Business.
b.   The purpose of this section shall be to set forth the appropriate special
requirements by which adult establishments may be established within the City
of Asheville's zoning jurisdiction. Adult establishments, because of their very
nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when they are located near a residential zoning
district or certain other districts which permit residential, educational,
religious, or recreational uses. Studies have shown that lower property values
and increased crime rates tend to accompany and are brought about by the
concentration of adult establishments. The city council finds that regulation
of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects do not
contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and to protect the
integrity of the city's residential areas, schools, places of worship,
libraries, child care centers, and public parks and playgrounds which are
typical areas in which juveniles congregate.
To address the purposes set forth above, the following restrictions are
established:
1.   No lot containing an adult establishment shall be located within a 1,000
foot radius of any lot containing another adult establishment.
2.   No lot containing an adult establishment shall be located within a 1,000
foot radius of any residential zoning district. Provided, however, the
establishment of a residential zone subsequent to the lawful commencement of an
adult establishment will not render the adult establishment non-conforming.
3.   No lot containing an adult establishment shall be located within a 1,000
foot radius of any church, school, library, licensed child care center, public
recreation center, or public park or playground. Provided, however, the
establishment of any place of worship, school, library, licensed child care
center, public recreation center, or public park or playground subsequent to
the lawful commencement of an adult establishment will not render the adult
establishment non-conforming.
4.   The required distance shall be measured from the closest edge of the
property occupied by an adult establishment to the closest edge of the property
occupied by a protected use, zone, or by another adult establishment. Provided,
however, that an adult establishment is located in a multi-tenant facility, the
distance shall be measured from the closest edge of the portion of the facility
occupied by such establishment.
5.   Except for permitted business identification signage, no printed material,
slide, video, photograph, written text, live show, or other visual presentation
shall be visible, nor shall any live or recorded voices, music, or sounds be
heard from outside the walls of the establishment.
6.   Any external lighting shall be arranged so as not to be directed toward
any residential area.
(9)   Those uses listed as a use by right, subject to special requirements
which exceed a total floor area of 5,000 square feet.
a.   Use district: Head of Montford Transition Overlay District.
(10)   Reserved.
(11)   Ancillary non-residential uses:
a.   Use districts: All residential districts including Urban Residential.
b.   Ancillary non-residential uses shall be limited to landscaping, and
stormwater detention and related facilities in support of the principal use.
c.   Ancillary uses shall be located on lots adjacent to, or immediately across
the street from the principal use.
d.   The principal use must be located in a non-residential zoning district,
and must be a permitted use in that district.
e.   Ancillary uses under this section may not be located on lots that, within
18 months prior to the date of application, had more than one residential
structure that was demolished, except pursuant to a determination by the city
building inspector that said structures were dilapidated.
f.   Ancillary uses under this section may not extend into the adjacent
residential zone by more than one lot, and the maximum lot size shall be one
acre unless the planning and zoning commission determines that a larger lot
size will be compatible with the residential character of the area.
g.   Once a special use permit is granted for an ancillary non-residential use,
no other special use permits for ancillary non-residential uses shall be
granted for the same principal use.
h.   Ancillary uses under this section must be buffered from adjacent
residential property and meet all other landscaping requirements set forth in
section
7-11-3 of this chapter.
i.   All activities associated with non-residential uses conducted in the
residential district, including deliveries and refuse collection, shall be
conducted between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. unless the planning and
zoning commission determines that other operating hours are appropriate.
j.   Outdoor storage, storage containers, and display of goods shall be
prohibited.
(12)   Detention centers, jails, and related correctional facilities
a.   Use districts: Central Business District, Regional Business District,
Commercial Industrial District.
b.   Design standards: The structure must comply with the downtown design
review guidelines for new construction in the areas covered by the design
review guidelines. Compliance with the design guidelines for structures located
in this area shall be mandatory. As part of the preliminary Staff/TRC review
process, the Design Review Committee shall have responsibility for determining
compliance with the downtown design review standards for these uses. In other
locations, the structure must comply with the design standards set forth in the
supplemental developmental standards for large retail structures. For the
purpose of this condition, the structure shall be treated as a general retail
structure.
c.   Fencing: No chain link, barbed wire, razor wire, or similar fence
materials shall be used in areas that are visible from adjacent properties or
from the public way unless specifically permitted by the planning and zoning
commission approving the special use permit.
d.   Fenced areas: Fenced areas shall not abut any principal street unless
specifically permitted by the planning and zoning commission approving the
special use permit.
e.   Lighting: Lights in pedestrian areas and parking lots shall not exceed 16
feet in height. All lights other than those in public pedestrian areas,
including security lights, shall be full cut-off type fixtures, and shall not
produce direct glare or light trespass on adjacent properties.
f.   Signage: All signage must be reviewed and approved as part of the special
use permit application. The Planning and Zoning Commission may attach
conditions addressing the location, size, number, and illumination of signs
based upon circumstances related to the location and impact of the sign(s).
g.   Operational standards: No outdoor speaker systems shall be permitted.
Vehicles entering and/or leaving the facility shall not use sirens or emergency
lights unless responding to an emergency.
h.   Loading/unloading: All loading and unloading areas shall be located
internally on the site and screened from view from adjacent properties and
public ways. All loading and unloading activities shall take place between the
hours of 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., unless specifically waived by the planning
and zoning commission approving the special use permit or in conflict with a
judicial order. This condition includes prisoner pick up and drop off of more
than two prisoners.
i.   Exercise yard exercise yards and other outdoor activity areas shall be
located internally on the site and screened from view from adjacent properties
and public ways.
j.   Vehicle storage: All vehicles associated with the use shall be stored in
an enclosed or screened area. The vehicle storage area may be screened with
vegetation, fences, a combination of fences and landscape material, or other
means designed to effectively screen the stored vehicles from adjacent
properties and the public way.
(13)   Government buildings and uses.
a.   Use districts: Central Business District.
b.   The proposed location for the use or building will not unduly or
unreasonably restrict the availability of key land for private development.
c.   No alternative location for the building or use exists within areas
previously developed for government buildings and/or uses.
d.   If a new structure is proposed in the areas covered by the design review
guidelines, the ability of the structure's design to comply with the downtown
design review guidelines for new construction shall be a factor in the review
of the request. New structures in these areas must substantially comply with
the design guidelines as determined by the Design Review Committee as part of
the Staff/TRC preliminary review.
(14)   Motor vehicle and boat sales, new and used.
a.   Use district: Central Business
b.   Minimum lot size: 1 acre
c.   In order to maintain an urban streetscape, storage of automobiles outside
an enclosed building shall be limited to not more than 25 percent of the total
number of automobiles offered for sale, or, alternately, the outdoor storage of
automobiles for sale shall be screened by buildings occupying at least 75
percent of the street frontage of the subject property.
d.   Automobiles needing repair shall be stored within an enclosed building or,
alternately, screened from all public rights-of-way.
e.   Lighting shall comply with the standards of the City of Asheville.
f.   If a new structure is proposed in the areas covered by the design review
guidelines, the ability of the structure's design to comply with the downtown
design review guidelines for new construction shall be a factor in the review
of the request. New structures in these areas must substantially comply with
the design guidelines as determined by the Design Review Committee as part of
Staff/TRC preliminary review.
(15)   Drive through facilities and uses.
a.   Use districts: Neighborhood Corridor.
b.   The purpose of this section is to ensure the pedestrian character and
safety along the corridor are protected but allow drive through facilities at
locations that will not detract from the rest of the district.
c.   Drive through facilities will generally operate with a single window and
will be located to the side or rear of the structure. Planning and Zoning
Commission may consider other proposals with more than a single window for
locations that are appropriate for this use.
d.   Drive through facilities shall not be placed on the street side of a
building on a corner lot but shall be located to the side or rear of the
structure.
e.   Outdoor speakers and lighting must be designed and used in such a way to
eliminate both noise and light trespass to neighboring properties.
f.   Hours of operation may also be limited by the Planning and Zoning
Commission to ensure compatibility with neighboring uses in the vicinity of the
drive through.
g.   For new structures in the Neighborhood Corridor district, compliance with
items in the Design and Operation Standards in article 12 of the Neighborhood
Corridor District shall be a requirement of this special use review as
determined by Planning and Zoning Commission.
(16)   Group homes.
a.   Use districts: RS-8, RM-6, RM-8.
b.   Separation requirement: Group homes shall be spaced a minimum of 600 feet
from all other group homes and family care homes as measured from the closest
property line of each property containing a family care home or group home.
c.   Parking shall be located in the rear and shall be screened with vegetation
from adjacent single-family uses as set forth in subsection
7-11-3(d)(4)k. The vegetative screening shall consist of the planting required
for a Type A buffer or its equivalent as determined through the alternative
landscape compliance process. Parking in the front or side of the lot may be
approved by the planning and development director provided that the parking
area can be adequately screened from adjacent residential uses and:
   • The topography of the site makes it difficult to access the rear of the
property; or
   • The property on the opposite side of the street is developed with non-
residential uses; or
   • The majority of the residential properties on both sides of the street on
the block on which the proposed use is to be constructed have parking located
in the front or side; no more than two parking spaces shall be provided in
front using this option for a group home located in an RS-8 zoning district.
d.   It is the intent of these standards to ensure that group home structures
resemble other residential structures in the neighborhoods where they are to be
located. Pursuant to this intent, a group home structure shall be
architecturally compatible with residential structures in the area in which it
is to be constructed. Architectural compatibility shall be determined based
upon compliance with the following standards:
   • The structure shall be oriented on the lot in a manner similar to the
residential structures on both sides of the street on the block on which it is
to be constructed.
   • In the RS-8 district, the structure shall have a single front entrance and
any other entrances as required under various codes shall be located on the
side(s) or rear of the structure. A corner side of the structure may have a
single entrance provided the intent of this section is met.
   • The height of the structure shall be no more than four feet taller than
the height of the tallest residential structure located on the side of the
street on the block on which the proposed use is to be constructed.
   • The roof design, pitch and materials proposed for the structure shall be
similar to the roof design, pitch and materials of the residential structures
on both sides of the street on the block on which it is to be constructed.
   • A front porch shall be provided on the proposed structure if a majority of
the residential structures on both sides of the street on the block on which
the new structure is proposed have front porches.
   • Unless precluded by topography, the front yard depth for the proposed
structure shall be not less than the average front yard depth for the
residential structures on the same side of the street on the block on which the
new construction is proposed.
   • In RS-8 districts, the floor area of the group home structure shall not be
more than 150 percent larger than the average floor area of single-family
residential structures in the same block of the group home structure unless
this floor area is provided below the grade of the principal façade of the
group home structure or is otherwise designed to minimize its difference in
size with said residences.
e.   It is the intent of this section that group home uses will be located in
areas where employment, goods, and services can readily be reached by a variety
of means of transportation. Transit, a sidewalk network, and/or close proximity
to employment, goods, and services shall be required for approval of a special
use permit for a group home unless the intended residents of the group home do
not require this service.
f.   The group home structure(s) and the site on which it is located shall be
maintained in accordance with standards established by applicable local and
state regulations, including, but not limited to, the City of Asheville Minimum
Housing Code. The Planning and Zoning Commission may require the submittal and
implementation of a specific maintenance plan in order to ensure proper
maintenance of the property in accordance with this provision."
g.   That the definition of group home in section
7-2-5 be amended to read: Group home means a residential home provided by an
agency, organization or individual for persons who need sheltered living
conditions for rehabilitation, but not including mentally ill persons who are
dangerous to others as defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 122C-3(11)b (or its
successor). This definition does not include family care home as defined
herein.
(17)   Electrified security fences.
a.   Use districts: Commercial Industrial.
b.   Must meet standards for such fences in subsection
7-16-1(c).
(e)   Conditions attached to approval. In approving the special use, the
Asheville Planning and Zoning Commision may attach such conditions to the
approval as it deems necessary to have the proposed use meet the standards set
forth in subsection
7-16-2.(c) above and elsewhere in this chapter, and to protect the public
health, safety, and general welfare. All such conditions shall be stated in the
resolution approving the application. Such conditions may be stricter than any
requirement or limitation stated elsewhere in this chapter for the proposed
use. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to the following:
limitations on the size, bulk and location of structures; requirements for
landscaping, signage, and outdoor lighting; the provision of adequate ingress
and egress; dedication of rights-of-way for streets or utilities; provision of
recreational space and facilities; limitations on the duration of the approval
and the time period within which the use will be developed; limitations on
hours of operation; limitations on the transfer of such approval to a
successor-in-interest or lessee of the property; provision of special fire
protection features; and the mitigation of environmental impacts.

Notes
  Editor's note(s)—
  Ord. No. 3478, § 1, adopted May 22, 2007, deleted Art. XVII, §§ 7-17-1—7-17-9, in
1 their entirety. Former Art. XVII, §§ 7-17-1—7-17-9, pertained to similar subject
  matter and derived from Ord. No. 2428, §§ 23—25 adopted Nov. 11, 1997; Ord. No.
  2369, § 1, adopted May 27, 1997; Ord. No. 3156, § 1, adopted Aug. 24, 2004; and
  Ord. No. 3417, §§ 1(f), (g), adopted Nov. 28, 2006.
Sec. 7-17-1. Nonconformities—Purpose, application and definitions.
(a)   Purpose. It is recognized that, over time, lawful nonconformities may
develop as a result of amendments to the zoning map or unified development
ordinance which change the application of city development regulations to
particular properties. It is important that such properties, while
nonconforming, be adequately maintained and permitted to continue, but not
expanded or enlarged in any fashion that increases the extent of nonconformity.
Where possible, such nonconformities should be made, wholly or incrementally,
conforming.
(b)   Application. The provisions of this section apply only to lawful
nonconformities, except as noted below. Nonconformities other than lawful
nonconformities shall be considered violations of the unified development
ordinance. This article shall not apply, however, to any feature which is the
subject of a variance from particular regulations that has been granted by an
authorized reviewing board or commission or to applications of flexible
development standards to such features. Where a variance or flexible
development determination has been granted for a feature which does not
otherwise conform to the requirements of this chapter, that feature shall be
deemed conforming. Nonconformities associated with signs are addressed in
section
7-13-8 of this chapter.
(c)   Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the
meaning ascribed to them below:
(1)   Appraised value means the value assigned to a structure by the Buncombe
County Tax Assessor or by an MAI-certified real estate appraiser.
(2)   Dimensional nonconformity means any lawful nonconformity involving a
dimensional or numerical development requirement except those involving signs
or landscaping and buffering which are addressed in article XIII and section
7-11-3, respectively. Dimensional nonconformities may include, without
limitation, nonconformities associated with lot size, lot width, lot depth, lot
coverage setbacks, impervious surface standards, open space, number of parking
spaces, or separation requirements between particular uses or zoning districts,
and structure size and placement standards including height, gross floor area,
footprint area, number of stories, build-to zone, fenestration, step-back and
building frontage.
(3)   Impact means the effect of one land use upon another as measured by
traffic or noise generation, site activity, hours of operation, site lighting,
vibration, smoke or odor emissions, or similar factors.
(4)   Lawful nonconformity means any nonconformity involving a dimensional or
numerical requirement or use of property that affects a structure erected or a
lot created in conformity with the then-applicable development requirements of
the city, but subsequently made nonconforming by action of the city through a
zoning map or unified development code amendment. For non-construction related
purposes such as but not limited to, financing, appraisals, or zoning
verification, a lawful nonconformity shall be regarded as conforming.
(5)   Nonconforming use means a nonconformity involving the use of the property
when that use was lawfully established. This may include, without limitation,
nonconformities associated with a use not permitted in the zoning district in
which it is located, a use specially allowed in the zoning district in which it
is located but for which no special use permit has been obtained, or
residential density that exceeds the maximum permitted in the zoning district
in which it is located.
(6)   Renovation means the repairing or remodeling of a structure in which the
exterior walls, foundation and roof are maintained structurally intact.
(d)   Expansions. A lawful nonconformity shall not be extended, expanded,
enlarged or increased in any manner that would increase either the degree of
the dimensional nonconformity, or the extent or intensity of the lawfully
established nonconforming use. Such prohibited activity shall include, without
being limited to:
(1)   A physical addition to, or expansion of, a structure that creates a new,
or increases the extent of an existing, dimensional nonconformity;
(2)   An extension or transference of a nonconforming use into new construction
including separate buildings, building additions, or expansions;
(3)   An extension of the use within an existing structure to any floor area
not occupied by the use at the time that it became nonconforming;
(4)   An expansion to any outdoor areas used in direct support of a
nonconforming use beyond the limits existing at the time that the use became
nonconforming.
(Ord. No. 3478, § 1, 5-22-07; Ord. No. 4855, §§ 1(i), (j), 2-23-21; Ord. No.
4404, § 1g, 9-28-21; Ord. No. 5057, § 1n, 1-23-24)
Sec. 7-17-2. Dimensional nonconformities.
(a)   Lawfully established nonconforming lots. Lawfully established
nonconforming lots having one or more dimensional nonconformities may be used
for any permitted or special use allowed in the zoning district in which the
lot is located provided that any structure or expansion/addition to an existing
structure proposed for the use meets all applicable dimensional and numerical
requirements and all applicable procedures are followed. Such lots may be
recombined with adjoining lots to increase the extent of their conformity
provided new nonconformities are not created. A lot that that is only
nonconforming due to the fact that it does not comply with access standards can
be developed with one single-family residence and typical residential accessory
structures if some form of legal access is provided the property.
   (b)   Structures. Structures having one or more dimensional nonconformities
may be used for any permitted or special use allowed in the zoning district in
which the structure is located, and, upon any change in use, shall comply with
the requirements of article XI of this chapter. Such structures may be expanded
or enlarged provided the extent of the applicable nonconformity is not
increased or new nonconformities are not created. Expansions, enlargements, or
reconstruction of such structures exceeding 50 percent of the pre- expansion
floor area, shall require such structures to meet all applicable dimensional
and numerical requirements, except density, which may be retained at the prior
nonconforming level but not increased. For the purpose of this section, the
value of any expansion, enlargement, or reconstruction of such structures over
a three-year period shall be used when calculating the 75 percent threshold. A
structure undergoing renovation, as defined in section
7-17-1 above, shall not be subject to the above provisions and shall only be
required to meet the provisions of article XI if the renovation cost exceeds 75
percent of the structure's appraised value as determined by Buncombe County Tax
Assessor or by an MAI- certified real estate appraiser.
   (c)   Overcoming presumption of discontinuation of use. A presumption that a
nonconforming use of structure has ceased, based solely on the length of time
the structure has remained vacant or inactive, may be rebutted if the structure
has not been vacant for more than two years. Such a presumption may be
overcome, upon demonstrating that substantial good faith efforts have been made
to re-establish the use during this period. Obtaining permits to maintain the
existing use or providing documentation that shows continuous marketing of the
property for sale or lease for the existing use (e.g. MLS listing, realtor
contract, etc.) shall be regarded as substantial good faith efforts.
(Ord. No. 3478, § 1, 5-22-07; Ord. No. 3791, §§ 1h, i, 9-22-09; Ord. No. 5057,
§ 1o, 1-23-24)
Sec. 7-17-3. Nonconforming uses.
(a)   Discontinuation of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use is allowed to
continue unless the use is discontinued for a period of 180 or more consecutive
days, and there are no substantial good faith efforts to re-establish the use
during this period. Obtaining permits to maintain the existing use or
significant continuous efforts to market the property for sale or lease for the
existing use (e.g., MLS listing, realtor contract, etc.) shall be regarded as
substantial good faith efforts. A nonconforming use shall be deemed
discontinued after a period of 365 consecutive days regardless of any
substantial good faith efforts to re-establish the use. Thereafter, the
structure or property associated with the use may be used only for conforming
use. Special uses discontinued for a period of 365 or more consecutive days
shall be regarded as nonconforming uses and shall not be re- established
without new special use permit approval.
(b)   Replacement of one nonconforming use with another nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use may be allowed to be replaced by another nonconforming use of
equal or lesser impact as provided in subsection (c) below. For uses not listed
below, a nonconforming use may be allowed to be replaced by another
nonconforming use upon a finding by the planning and zoning commission that the
proposed use is more nearly compatible with the surrounding properties than the
nonconforming use which it replaces, as measured by traffic or noise
generation, site activity, hours of operation, and other factors that the
commission finds relevant to compare or differentiate between the existing use
(s) and the proposed replacement use(s). The planning and development director
or commission, as applicable, may establish conditions to ensure that the
compatibility factors are maintained as approved.
(c)   Land use impact table. See Table_of_Permitted_Uses under columns labeled
“Land Use Impact” at section
7-8-1(d) for a list of land uses and their associated impacts.
(d)   Overcoming presumption of discontinuation of use. A presumption that a
nonconforming use of the land has ceased, based solely on the length of time
the use of the land has remained vacant or inactive, may be rebutted if the use
of the land has not ceased for more than two years. Such a presumption may be
overcome, upon demonstrating that substantial good faith efforts have been made
to re-establish the use during this period. Obtaining permits to maintain the
existing use or providing documentation that shows continuous marketing of the
property for sale or lease for the existing use (e.g. MLS listing, realtor
contract, etc.) shall be regarded as substantial good faith efforts.
(e)   Conforming uses becoming nonconforming. No use may be established if it
renders another conforming use to become nonconforming.
(f)   Nonconforming short-term vacation rentals. All lawfully existing
nonconforming lodging facilities which would now be classified as a "short-term
vacation rental" may continue in operation until such time that the lodging use
is discontinued for a period greater than 180 consecutive days. In addition,
the short-term vacation rental annual permit will be required for all
nonconforming short-term vacation rentals and failure to renew said permit
before its expiration will also constitute a conclusory presumption that the
lawful nonconformity has ceased for more than 180 consecutive days, and will
result in the voluntary forfeiture of all rights and claims to operate a short-
term vacation rental at the address noted on the permit under this provision.
(Ord. No. 3478, § 1, 5-22-07; Ord. No. 3700, § 1o, 2-10-09; Ord. No. 3791, §
1j, 9-22-09; Ord. No. 3793, § 1f, 9-22-09; Ord. No. 4448, § 1c, 9-8-15; Ord.
No. 4560, § 1q, 2-14-17; Ord. No. 4637, § 1v, 1-9-18; Ord. No. 5028, § 1m, 7-
25-23; Ord. No. 5057, § 1p, 1-23-24)
Sec. 7-17-4. Maintenance, repair and replacement.
(a)   Public safety. In the interest of the public safety and health,
structural alterations or renovations of lawfully nonconforming structures,
conforming structures on lawfully nonconforming lots, or conforming structures
devoted in whole or in part to a lawfully established nonconforming use, which
are required by any public law, and so ordered by a public officer in
authority, shall be permitted.
(b)   Ordinary repair and maintenance. Routine maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement shall be permitted for lawfully nonconforming structures
provided that the repair or maintenance shall neither create a new
nonconformity, nor increase the degree of the existing nonconformity. The
addition of facilities to improve handicapped accessibility or energy
conservation may also be permitted provided all applicable development
standards can be met.
(c)   Replacement/reconstruction. The reconstruction of a lawfully
nonconforming structure and/or a structure that is occupied by a nonconforming
use, which has a valid certificate of occupancy and which is destroyed or
damaged by an event resulting from natural causes or an accident, without
intent to damage or destroy on the part of the property owner, may be restored
to its original dimensions and conditions, provided:
(1)   The reconstruction does not increase the degree, extent or limits of the
nonconformity;
(2)   A valid building permit is issued within 12 months of the date of the
event; and,
(3)   That the use occupying the structure after repair does not result in a
change of use.
Nothing herein shall prevent a reconstruction that removes or reduces the
nonconformity.
(Ord. No. 3478, § 1, 5-22-07; Ord. No. 4855, § 1(j), 2-23-21; Ord. No. 4404, §
1h, 9-28-21)
Sec. 7-17-5. Replacement of manufactured homes.
Dimensional or use nonconformities associated with manufactured homes shall be
addressed in the following manner.
   (a)   Replacement of one manufactured home with another manufactured home in
a lawfully established manufactured housing park.  An existing manufactured
home located in a lawfully established manufactured housing park in operation
at the time of adoption of these regulations may be replaced with another
manufactured home provided the number of manufactured home units within the
park may not be increased beyond the number available before replacement and
the replacement manufactured home must not create nonconforming yards,
separation distances, or increase existing nonconforming yards, separation
distances or setbacks. Manufactured home parks existing at the time of the
adoption of this ordinance shall not be allowed to expand or increase in any
manner unless such expansion meets fully the requirements set forth in this
ordinance.
   (b)   Replacement of one manufactured home with another manufactured home in
areas covered by a manufactured housing zoning overlay. Such replacement shall
be permitted provided that new dimensional nonconformities are not created, the
replacement manufactured home is no smaller than the existing manufactured
home, the replacement home is placed in the same location as the original home,
and such replacement occurs within 365 days of the last day of occupancy of the
original manufactured home. In all other situations, replacement shall be
prohibited.
   (c)   Replacement of one manufactured home with another manufactured home in
areas other than a lawfully established manufactured housing park or area
covered by a manufactured housing zoning overlay. Such replacement shall be
permitted provided that new dimensional nonconformities are not created, the
replacement manufactured home is no smaller than the existing manufactured
home, the replacement home is placed in the same location as the original home,
and such replacement occurs within 180 days of the last day of occupancy of the
original manufactured home. In all other situations, replacement shall be
prohibited.

d.   Guidelines for penalty assessment: In determining the amount of the
penalty to assess, the stormwater administrator shall be guided by the
following:
1.   Soil erosion and sedimentation regulation: The stormwater administrator
shall be guided by the degree and harm caused by the violation; the cost of
rectifying damage, the amount of money the violator saved by noncompliance,
whether the violation was committed willfully and the prior record of the
violator in complying or failing to comply with referenced subsection.
2.   Stormwater control, illicit discharge and connection regulations: The
stormwater administrator shall be guided by the degree and extent of harm to
the natural resources of the city, to the public health, or to private property
resulting from the violation; the duration and gravity of the violation; the
effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or on air quality; the
cost of rectifying the damage; the amount of money the violator saved by
noncompliance, whether the violation was committed willfully and the prior
record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with referenced
subsection.
e.   Notice of civil penalty assessment: The stormwater administrator shall
provide notice of the civil penalty amount and basis for assessment to the
person assessed. The notice of assessment shall be served by any means
authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4, and shall direct the violator to either pay
the assessment or contest the assessment in writing, within 30 days after
receipt of the notice of assessment.
f.   Appeal to erosion control plan review committee: Any aggrieved party may
file an appeal of the penalty assessment made by the stormwater administrator
to the erosion control plan review committee (committee) within 30 days of
receipt of the penalty assessment. The appeal must be submitted in writing to
the stormwater administrator and shall specify the grounds for appeal. The
stormwater administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Committee all
documents constituting the record on which the decision appeal was taken. A
hearing for the appeal shall be held within 30 working days after the receipt
of the written appeal. The hearing shall be quasi- judicial with the right of
the aggrieved party to have counsel present, to confront and examine witnesses
and to review all documents. In the absence of an appeal to the committee, the
penalty assessment of the stormwater administrator shall be final. The
committee may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the penalty
appealed from along with the associated findings made therein to support the
penalty. To this end, the committee shall have all the powers of the stormwater
administrator from whom the appeal is taken.
g.   Appeal to superior court: Every decision of the committee shall be subject
to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any
petition for review by the superior court shall be filed with the clerk of
superior court within 30 days after the decision of the committee is filed in
the office of the stormwater administrator or after a written copy thereof is
delivered to every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such
copy with the committee at the time of its hearing of the case, whichever is
later. The decision of the committee may be delivered to the aggrieved party
either by personal service, by registered mail or certified mail returned
receipt requested or by any means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4. The
appeal shall be limited to the record before the committee.
h.   Failure to appeal and/or pay: Any civil penalty assessed a person who
violates the provisions of section
7-12-2 of this chapter shall be recovered by the city in a civil action in the
nature of debt, to be brought in the Buncombe County Superior Court if the
offender fails to give notice of timely appeal and fails to pay the penalty
within the prescribed period of time after he or she has been cited for the
violation.
(C)   Each day a separate violation. Except as indicated in subsection
7-18-2(b)(1) and 7-18(b)(2)(c) above, each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate and distinct violation or offense.

Sec. 7-18-3. Notice of violation and citation procedure.
(a)   Notice required before penalty. No penalty shall be assessed pursuant to
section
7-18-2 above unless and until the person alleged to be in violation has been
notified of the violation in accordance with this section. Provided however,
for purposes of section
7-12-2 of this chapter, notice shall be deemed sufficient to comply with this
paragraph if the notice of violation is issued simultaneously with the penalty
assessment.
(b)   Notice of violation; opportunity to cure.
(1)   Recipient of notice of violation. Whenever any city official charged with
the duty of enforcing regulations in this chapter has reasonable cause to
believe that a person is violating any of the provisions of this chapter or any
permit, plan, order, or condition issued pursuant to this chapter, that
official shall notify, the holder of the development approval and to the
landowner of the property involved, if the landowner is not the holder of the
development approval, and may be provided by similar means to the occupant of
the property or the person undertaking the work or activity.
(2)   Service requirements. Notices of violation shall be in writing and shall
be served by personal delivery, electronic delivery, or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. In addition, the notice of violation
may be posted on the property involved, in accordance with N.C.G.S. § 160D-404
(a), and service hereunder may be made in accordance with Rule 4 of the North
Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. The notice of violation may include, but not
be limited to, an order to discontinue the illegal use of land, buildings or
structures; require removal of illegal buildings, structures, or uses or
removal of illegal additions, alterations or structural changes; discontinue
the illegal work being done; or require any other action to insure compliance
with or prevent violation of this chapter. The notice of violation shall
include an opportunity to cure the violation within a prescribed period of
time.
(3)   Notification of owner upon violator noncompliance. Where the person
violating a provision of this article is not the owner of the property, the
city shall send a notice of violation to both the tenant and the owner of the
property.
(c)   Extension of time to cure. Upon receipt of a written request from the
alleged violator or the property owner for an extension of time to cure or
correct the violation, the city official charged with the duty of enforcing the
regulations(s) being violated may grant a single extension of time, not to
exceed a period of 30 days, in which the alleged violator may cure or correct
the violation before the city issues a citation pursuant to subsection
7-18-3(d) below.
(d)   Citation for violation. Any person who, after being given a notice of
violation pursuant to subsection
7-18-3(b) above, does not comply with this chapter within the time period set
forth in the notice of violation or within any extension of time granted
pursuant to subsection
7-18-3(c) above, and who continues such violation, shall be subject to the
enforcement remedies set forth in this article. The city shall serve a written
fine citation on the alleged violator and/or property owner by personal
delivery or by first class U.S. mail with delivery conformation or similar
service offered by the U.S. Postal Service. The citation shall specify the
amount of any civil penalty which shall be levied against the alleged violator
or the type of criminal penalty applicable.

Sec. 7-18-4. Action for recovery of civil penalty; action for institution of
criminal process.
(a)   If payment of a civil penalty is not made, or violations are not cured or
corrected, within the time specified in the citation, then the matter may be
referred to the city attorney for institution of a civil action in the name of
the city in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. No. 2618, § 1(c), 9-28-99; Ord. No. 4910, § 2, 11-9-21)
Sec. 7-18-5. Summary removal of signs/sign structure; remove orders for signs/
sign structure.
(a)   Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 160A-193, the city shall have the authority
to summarily remove, abate, or remedy a sign or sign structure which the city
determines to be dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or safety. The
expense of the action shall be paid by the sign owner, or if the sign owner
cannot be ascertained, by the property owner, and if not paid, there shall be a
lien placed upon the land or premises where the nuisance arose, and it shall be
collected as unpaid taxes.
(b)   Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 160A-193 and 160A-296, any signs or sign
structures prohibited under subsections
7-13-3(1) and (2) are hereby declared to be a public health nuisance in that
they are dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or public safety and the
sign administrator shall have the authority to remove summarily the sign and/or
sign structure.
(c)   The sign administrator shall have the authority to issue a remove order
for any sign not repaired or brought into compliance within the time prescribed
by a notice of violation. Remove orders shall be issued to and served upon the
sign/sign structure owner, or if the sign/sign structure owner cannot be
ascertained, to and upon the property owner by the means set forth in
subsection
7-18-3(b). The sign or sign structure shall be removed 30 days after the
service of the remove order at the expense of the offender. The remove order
shall describe with particularity the location of the sign or sign structure to
be removed and the reason(s) for issuance of the remove order, including
specific reference to the provisions of article XII of this chapter which have
been violated.
(d)   In the event of failure to comply with the requirements of a remove
order, the sign administrator may cause such sign or sign structure to be
removed. The sign owner and property owner may be jointly and separately liable
for the expense of removal. Notice of the cost of removal shall be served as
set forth in subsection
7-18-3(b). If said sum is not paid within 30 days thereafter, said sum may be
collected by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt, which shall not
subject the offender to the penalty provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-4.
(Ord. No. 2618, § 1(d), 9-28-99)
Sec. 7-18-6. Injunctive relief and other remedies.
(a)   Injunctive or other relief. In addition to, or in lieu of, the other
remedies set forth in this article, the planning and development director or
other city official charged with the duty of enforcing the regulations of this
chapter, in the event of a violation of this chapter, may request that the city
attorney institute in a court of competent jurisdiction an injunctive action,
mandamus action, or other appropriate proceeding to prevent the completion or
occupation of such building or structure, or use of land. Upon determining that
an alleged violation is occurring or is threatened, a court hearing an appeal
for relief, shall enter such orders and/or judgments as are necessary to abate
or prevent the violation. The institution of an action for injunctive or other
relief under this section shall not relieve any party to such proceeding from
any civil or criminal penalty prescribed by this article for violations of this
chapter.
(b)   Stop work orders. Stop work orders may be issued pursuant to N.C.G.S. §
160D-404(b), whenever any work or activity subject to regulations pursuant to
this chapter or other applicable local development regulation or any state law
delegated to the local government for enforcement purposes in lieu of the state
undertaken in substantial violation of any state or local law, or in a manner
that endangers life or property, staff may order the specific part of the work
or activity to be stopped, the reasons thereof, and the conditions under which
the work or activity may be resumed. The city shall send the stop work order in
writing pursuant to section
7-18-3(b)(2) above. Violation of a stop work order shall constitute a Class 1
misdemeanor pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 160D-404(b).
(c)   Revocation of permits. In the event of a violation of any regulation of
this chapter, the planning and development director, or any other city official
charged with the duty of enforcing the regulations of this chapter, may stop
any development of, use of or activity on property by the revocation of
applicable permits. Prior to revocation of permits the development approval
holder must be notified in writing stating the reason for the revocation and
the revocation shall follow the same development approval and review process
required for issuance of the development approval, including the notice
requirements. Any action under this section must not be inconsistent with
N.C.G.S. § 160D-403(f).

Sec. 7-19-3. Calculation of tree canopy area.
(a)   Any development site greater than two acres in size shall be permitted to
determine the area of existing tree canopy coverage to be preserved by ground
checking or aerial analysis according to the most recent data provided by the
city. Tree canopy calculated by aerial analysis shall be limited to that within
the boundary of the subject property. If ground checking is utilized, credit
for existing trees intended to be retained may be calculated by the following
methods:
(1)   Measurement of the trunk of each individual tree (i.e. a tree not grouped
with other trees or a part of a forested condition) to determine its diameter
at breast height (herein “DBH”) and the credit given for that tree shall be in
accordance with
Table 7-19.4, below. Heritage trees utilized for credit shall be allowed to
count for 200% of the listed canopy value in
Table 7-19.4 or measured canopy value; or
(2)   The dripline may be plotted on the site plan and tree canopy credit given
for the square footage of the area within the dripline as measured using
geographic information systems software; or
(3)   Measurement of the canopy of each individual tree (i.e. a tree not
grouped with other trees or part of forested condition) as illustrated in
Figure 7-19.1, “Calculating Tree Canopy Cover.”
(b)   For any development site two acres or less in size the area of tree
canopy coverage for any group of trees to be retained in order to meet the tree
canopy requirements of this Part shall be determined by ground checking. Credit
for existing trees intended to be retained may be calculated in either of two
ways:
(1)   Measurement of the trunk to determine its DBH and the credit given for
that tree shall be in accordance with
Table 7-19.4, below; or
(2)   Measurement of the canopy of each individual tree (i.e. a tree not
grouped with other trees or part of forested condition) as illustrated in
Figure 7-19.1, “Calculating Tree Canopy Cover.”
(c)   Trees planted within one calendar year of the date of development
application shall not be included in the calculation of existing tree canopy.
(d)   The calculation must be conducted and certified by a forester, land
surveyor, civil engineer, landscape architect licensed by the State of North
Carolina or Arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture.

(Ord. No. 4836, § 1(e), 10-27-20)
Sec. 8-3. Historic preservation commission.
(a)   Creation of commission. Before it may designate one or more landmarks or
historic districts, a local government shall establish or designate a historic
preservation commission. The Historic Resources Commission of Asheville
Buncombe County has been established by the City of Asheville in Ordinance No.
1109, and by the County of Buncombe in Ordinance No. 1644. The Historic
Resources Commission operates in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7,
article III, section
7-3-4 of the Asheville City Code.
(b)   Appropriations to commission. The city council and county commission may
make appropriations to the Historic Resources Commission in any amount that it
may determine necessary for the expenses of the operation of the historic
resources commission and may make available any additional amounts necessary
for the acquisition, restoration, preservation, operation and management of
historic buildings, structures, sites, areas or objects designated as historic
landmarks or of land on which historic buildings or structures are located or
to which they may be removed.
(c)   Designation of ownership. All historic landmarks acquired by funds
appropriated by the city or county shall be acquired in the name of the city or
county, unless otherwise provided by the governing body. So long as such
property is owned by the city or county, historic landmarks may be maintained
by or under the supervision and control of the city or county. However, all
historic landmarks acquired by the commission from funds other than those
appropriated by the city or county may be acquired and held in the name of the
commission, the city or county or both.
(Ord. No. 4836, § 1(e), 10-27-20)
Sec. 8-4. Designation of historic districts; role of governing body and
preservation commission.
(a)   The City of Asheville has, as part of its zoning regulations, designated
one or more historic districts within its jurisdiction pursuant the
requirements of N.C.G.S. § 160D-944. The Historic Preservation District
provisions can be found in chapter 7, article IX, § 7-9-2 of the Asheville City
Code. Until and unless the Buncombe County Board of Commissioners adopts a
zoning regulation, or development regulation, the provisions of the
aforementioned section shall apply only to the City of Asheville and its zoning
jurisdiction.
(b)   Historic district designation procedure in general.
(1)   Role of the governing body.
a.   The city council may designate by regulation, and from time to time amend
by regulation, one or more historic districts. Such regulation may treat
historic districts either as a separate use district classification or as use
districts which overlap other zoning districts. Where historic districts are
designated as separate use districts, the ordinance may include among permitted
uses those uses found by the historic resources commission to have existed
during the period sought to be restored or preserved or to be compatible with
the authentic restoration or preservation of the district.
b.   No historic district or districts shall be designated until:
1.   An investigation and report on the historic significance of the buildings,
structures, features, sites or surroundings, evidence of which is above or
below the surface of the ground or water, included in any such proposed
district, and shall have prepared a description of the boundaries of such
district.
2.   The department of cultural resources, acting through the state historic
preservation officer or his or her designee, shall have made an analysis of and
recommendations concerning such report and description of proposed boundaries.
Failure of the department to submit its analysis and recommendations to the
city within 30 days after a written request for such analysis has been mailed
to it shall relieve the city of any responsibility for awaiting such analysis,
and the city may at any time, thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or
amend its regulation.
3.   The city council may also in its discretion refer the report and proposed
boundaries to any local preservation commission or other interested body for
its recommendations prior to taking action to amend the zoning regulation.
4.   On receipt of these reports and recommendations, the city council may
proceed in the same manner as would otherwise be required for the adoption or
amendment of any appropriate zoning regulation.
5.   A historic district zoning or development regulation may regulate the
location or screening of solar collectors and may encompass requiring the use
of plantings or other measures to ensure that the use of solar collectors is
not incongruous with the special character of the district.
(2)   Role of preservation commission.
a.   The commission may recommend to the governing board areas to be designated
by ordinance as "Historic Districts".
(Ord. No. 4836, § 1(e), 10-27-20)
Sec. 8-5. Designation of historic landmarks; role of governing body and
preservation commission.
(a)   Generally. The designation of a historic landmark shall be effected
through an ordinance adopted by the city council or by the board of
commissioners for Buncombe County.
(b)   Adoption of ordinance; criteria for designation. Upon complying with
N.C.G.S. part 4 of article 9 of chapter 160D, the city council or county
commission may adopt and from time to time amend or repeal an ordinance
designating one or more historic landmarks. No property shall be recommended
for designation as a historic landmark unless it is deemed and found by the
preservation commission to be of special significance in terms of its
historical, prehistoric, architectural, or cultural importance, and to possess
integrity of design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling and/or
association.
(c)   Ordinance requirements. The ordinance shall describe such landmark
designated in the ordinance, the name or names of the owner or owners of the
property, those elements of the property that are integral to its historical,
architectural, or prehistoric value, including the land area of the property so
designated, and any other information the governing body deems necessary. For
each building, structure, site, area or object designated as a historic
landmark, the ordinance shall require that a 365-day waiting period be observed
prior to its demolition. If the preservation commission has voted to recommend
designation of a property as a landmark, and final designation has not been
made by the governing board, the demolition or destruction of any building,
site, or structure located on the property of the proposed landmark may be
delayed by the preservation commission for a period of up to 180 days or until
the governing board takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs
first. For each designated historic landmark, the ordinance shall also provide
for a suitable sign on the landmark stating that the landmark has been so
designated. If the owner consents, the sign shall be placed upon the landmark.
If the owner objects, the sign shall be placed on a nearby public right-of-way.
(Ord. No. 4836, § 1(e), 10-27-20)
Sec. 8-6. Historic landmarks designation procedures.
(a)   Required procedures. No ordinance designating a historic building,
structure, site, area or object as a historic landmark, nor any amendment
thereto, may be adopted nor may any property be accepted or, acquired by the
commission or the governing body of the city or county, until the following
procedural steps have been taken:
(1)   The commission shall make or cause to be made an investigation and report
on the historical, architectural, prehistorical, educational or cultural
significance of each historic landmark proposed for designation. Such
investigation shall be forwarded to the Office of Archives and History, North
Carolina Department of Cultural Resources.
(2)   The department of cultural resources, acting through the state historic
preservation officer shall, upon request of the department or at the initiative
or the preservation commission, be given an opportunity to review and comment
upon the substance and effect of the designation of any landmark. Any comments
shall be provided in writing. If the Department does not submit its comments or
recommendations in connection with any designation within 30 days following
receipt by the department of the investigation and report of the preservation
commission, the commission and any governing board shall be relieved of any
responsibility to consider such comments.
(3)   The preservation commission and the governing body shall hold public
hearings, jointly or separately, on the proposed ordinance. Pursuant to
N.C.G.S. § 160D-601, notice of each hearing shall be given once a week for two
successive calendar weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the
area. All such notices shall be published or mailed not less than ten nor more
than 25 days prior to the date set for the public hearing.
(4)   Following the required public hearing, the governing body may adopt the
ordinance as proposed, adopt the ordinance with amendments it deems necessary
or reject the proposal.
(5)   Upon adoption of the ordinance, the owner(s) and occupant(s) of each
designated historic landmark shall be given written notice of such designation
within a reasonable time. One copy of the ordinance and each amendment thereto
shall be filed by the commission in the office of the register of deeds of the
county in which the landmark or landmarks are located. For any property lying
within the zoning jurisdiction of the city, a second copy of the ordinance and
each amendment thereto shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk
and be made available for public inspection at any reasonable time. A third
copy of the ordinance and each amendment thereto shall be given to the city or
county building inspector. The fact that a building, structure, site, area or
object has been designated a historic landmark shall be clearly indicated on
all tax maps maintained by the county or city for such period as the
designation remains in effect.
(6)   Upon the adoption of the historic landmarks ordinance or any amendment
thereto, it shall be the duty of the commission to give notice thereof to the
tax supervisor of the county in which the property is located. The designation
and any recorded restrictions upon the property limiting its use for
preservation purposes shall be considered by the tax supervisor in appraising
it for tax purposes.
(Ord. No. 4836, § 1(e), 10-27-20)
Sec. 8-7. Certificate of appropriateness required.
(a)   From and after designation, no local historic landmark shall be
materially altered, restored, moved or demolished without issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness indicating approval of such action or change in
accordance with the provisions of chapter 7, article V, section
7-5-11 of the Asheville City Code. This subsection applies to stone walls,
fences, exterior light fixtures, steps, pavement, doors and windows and any
other appurtenant features of the property specifically designated as
significant to its historic or architectural character. The governing body
shall require such a certificate to be issued by the commission prior to the
issuance of a building permit or any other permit granted for purposes of
construction or altering structures. A certificate of appropriateness shall be
required whether or not a building permit is required. The fee for a
certificate of appropriateness shall be as set forth in the city's fees and
charges manual.
(b)   The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and
Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, published by the
U.S. Department of the Interior, shall be the standard for reviewing
applications for certificates of appropriateness for historic landmarks.
(Ord. No. 4836, § 1(e), 10-27-20)
Sec. 8-8. Delay in demolition of historic landmarks and buildings within
historic districts.
(a)   An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the
relocation, demolition or destruction of a designated historic landmark or a
building, structure or site within a historic district may not be denied except
as provided in subsection (c) hereinafter. However, the effective date of such
a certificate of appropriateness may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days
from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this
subsection shall be reduced by the preservation commission where it finds that
the property owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of
all beneficial use of or return from such historic property by virtue of the
delay. During such period the commission shall negotiate with the owner and any
other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the historic building
or site.
If the commission has voted to recommend designation of a property as a
historic landmark or designation of an area as a district, and final
designation has not been made by the local governing board, the demolition or
destruction of any historic landmark may be delayed by the commission for a
period of up to 180 days or until the local governing board takes final action
on the designation, whichever occurs first.
(b)   An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the
demolition or destruction of a building, site or structure which has been
determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer as having statewide
significance as defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic
Places may be denied except where the preservation commission finds that the
owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all
beneficial use or return by virtue of the denial.
(Ord. No. 4836, § 1(e), 10-27-20)
Sec. 8-9. Certain changes to structures in a historic district or on a landmark
not prohibited.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance
or repair of any exterior architectural feature in a historic district or of a
landmark that does not involve a change in design, material or- appearance
thereof nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration,
restoration, moving or demolition of any such feature that a building inspector
or similar official shall certify is required by the public safety because of
an unsafe or dangerous condition. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
prevent a property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by

maintenance, or b) in the event of an emergency the immediate restoration of
any existing above-ground utility structure without approval by the
preservation commission.

All of the provisions of this chapter are applicable to construction,
alteration, moving and demolition by the State of North Carolina, its political
subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities, provided however, they shall not

Carolina. The state and its agencies shall have a right of appeal to the North
Carolina Historical Commission or any successor agency assuming its
responsibilities under N.C.G.S. § 121-12(a) from any decision of a local
preservation commission. The North Carolina Historical Commission shall render
its decision within 30 days from the date that the notice of appeal by the
State is received by it. The current edition of the Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic
Buildings shall be the sole principles and guidelines used in reviewing
application of the State for certificates of appropriateness. The decision of
the North Carolina Historical Commission shall be final and binding upon both
the State and the preservation commission.
(Ord. No. 4836, § 1(e), 10-27-20)

authority of this chapter and chapter 7 of the City Code as it relates to
historic preservation, the city may institute any appropriate action or
proceedings to prevent such unlawful demolition, material alteration,

The pledgor thereby forfeits all right, title and interest of, in and to such
pawned property to the pawnbroker who thereby acquires absolute title to the
property, whereupon the debt is satisfied and the pawnbroker may sell or
dispose of the unredeemed pledges as his own property. Any sale or disposal of
property under this section terminates all liability of the pawnbroker and
vests in the purchaser the right, title, and interest of the borrower and the
pawnbroker;

right to redeem, but may, before the lapse of the redemption period, make an
affidavit with indemnification for such loss. The affidavit shall describe the

pawned property has already been redeemed with the original pawn ticket; and

a pawn transaction.

damage;
(5)   Fail to return pledged goods to a pledgor upon payment of the full amount
due the pawnbroker on the pawn transaction. If such pledged goods are lost or
damaged while in the possession of the pawnbroker, it shall be the
responsibility of the pawnbroker to replace the lost or damaged goods with
merchandise of like kind and equivalent value. If the pledgor and pawnbroker
cannot agree as to replacement, the pawnbroker shall reimburse the pledgor in
the amount of the value agreed upon pursuant to section 9-9;
(6)   Take any article in pawn, pledge or as security from any person, which
article is known to such pawnbroker to be stolen, unless there is a written

section, violation of any of the provisions of this article shall also result

ARTICLE V. REGULATION OF SNIPE SIGNS
Sec. 10-101. Purpose.
This article is intended to provide a method to promote the public health,
safety and welfare by providing an effective means for the regulation of snipe
signs, as defined herein, thereby reducing visual clutter along roadway
corridors and reducing the potential for driver distraction. This article is
intended to supplement City Code section
7-18-5, but does not replace it.
(Ord. No. 3342, § 1, 3-14-06)
Sec. 10-102. Definition of snipe sign.
For the purpose of this artcile, the term "snipe sign" shall have the following
meaning:
A temporary sign which is not permitted or authorized under any provision of
this code, and which is tacked, nailed, posted, pasted, glazed, or otherwise
affixed to a tree, pole, stake, fence, traffic control device, or any other
object, or the ground.
This definition does not include signs within occupied buildings, located in
residentially-zoned areas (including single-family and multi-family
designations), or signs affixed to kiosks, bulletin boards or other structures
permitted or constructed by the city, and intended for general community use.
(Ord. No. 3342, § 1, 3-14-06)
Sec. 10-103. Legislative findings.
The city council expressly makes the following legislative findings in support
of this article.
(1)   While signage along roadways, if properly regulated, provides a public
benefit in advising motorists, cyclists and pedestrians of road conditions,
traffic safety information, the identification and location of businesses and
other destinations, among other things, a proliferation of unregulated signage
near or within the traveled right-of-way can result in visual clutter leading
to driver confusion and distraction.
(2)   This public safety concern necessitates a careful balancing of competing
interests, including business identification, driver awareness of traffic
choices, and the avoidance of visual clutter.
(3)   The City of Asheville has addressed this balancing of interests and the
preservation of public safety by enacting the sign regulations contained in
article 7 of the City Code.
(4)   Snipe signs, as defined herein, are temporary in nature, inexpensive, and
easily and quickly placed in the public view. In recent years, the city has
experienced a proliferation of snipe signs within or near the right-of-way of
public streets and roads, especially in commercial areas, which has greatly
increased visual clutter along roadways and threatened traffic safety.
(5)   Snipe signs are also detrimental to the public health and safety in that
they result in litter, obstructions and hazards within and adjacent to the
traveled portion of the right-of-way, especially in windy conditions. The
problems are especially acute in commercial areas.
(6)   There is considerable evidence that driver distraction is a major
contributory factor in road accidents. Snipe signs contribute to driver
distraction and, therefore, threaten the public safety and welfare.
(7)   Existing enforcement options available under the Unified Development
Ordinance have proven ineffective in ensuring compliance with the sign
regulations contained in article 7 of this Code as they relate to snipe signs.
By the time a violation is observed, a notice of violation drafted, mailed and
received, and the violation is corrected, the illegal sign could be in place
for seven to ten days, which is often the effective life span of a snipe sign.
(8)   The enforcement provisions set forth in this article are deemed
reasonable and necessary to curtail this illegal activity and protect the
public safety while guaranteeing the rights of property owners to the due
process of law.
(9)   Accordingly, snipe signs, as defined herein, are hereby declared to be a
nuisance within the City of Asheville.
(Ord. No. 3342, § 1, 3-14-06)
Sec. 10-104. Prohibition against snipe signs.
The placing or posting of a snipe sign, as defined herein, shall constitute a
violation of this article and subject the responsible party or parties to the
penalties stated herein.
(Ord. No. 3342, § 1, 3-14-06)
Sec. 10-105. Identification of responsible parties.
For purposes of this article:
(1)   The record owner of the property on which a snipe sign is located;
(2)   The entity or person identified in the sign, if different from the
property owner or if the sign is not on private property; and
(3)   The person placing or affixing the sign, shall all have joint and several
responsibility for compliance with this article as follows:
Each is presumed to be the owner of the sign and to have directed or permitted
its placement, and shall be a responsible party;
Each responsible party shall individually be subject to the enforcement
provisions set forth herein, regardless of whether another party is also a
responsible party.
The presumptions in this section may be rebutted.
(Ord. No. 3342, § 1, 3-14-06)
Sec. 10-106. Enforcement.
The code enforcement official shall have the option to enforce the provisions
of this article in the manner set out in this section. Alternatively, such
official may elect to enforce the provisions of the Unified Development
Ordinance (City Code chapter 7) in accordance with procedures and penalties set
forth therein.
(1)   Any duly authorized code enforcement officer or agent is hereby
authorized to remove and confiscate any snipe sign visible from a public
roadway, and located within the required zoning setback for the adjacent
property or 30 feet of the edge of the traveled portion of a road or street,
whichever is less, whether such sign is situated within the right-of-way or
beyond it.
(2)   Any snipe sign confiscated in such manner shall be stored in a secure
facility for a period of not less than seven days, after which said confiscated
sign may be disposed of.
(3)   If any responsible party believes that a sign has been erroneously
confiscated and/or disposed of, that party may request a hearing before the
director of the planning and development department or designee, who shall
schedule such hearing as soon as practicable (in any event within 30 days) and
render a decision within ten days thereafter.
(4)   Violations of the provisions of this article shall also be enforceable
against responsible parties by civil penalties set forth in [subsection (3)],
above. This article shall not be enforceable by criminal proceedings, including
proceedings pursuant to G.S. 14-4.
(Ord. No. 3342, § 1, 3-14-06)
Sec. 10-107. Return/disposal of confiscated signs.
Any sign confiscated hereunder shall be returned to the responsible party upon
(1) payment of any fine imposed or (2) entry of a final order finding that the
sign was confiscated in error. Confiscated signs that are not returned or with
respect to which no request for hearing is filed may be disposed of by the code
enforcement officer.
(Ord. No. 3342, § 1, 3-14-06)
Sec. 10-108. Other regulations remain in effect.
The enactment of this article, including any repealer clause, shall in no way
impair the authority of the city to enforce its sign regulations pursuant to
the provisions of any other city ordinance, including ordinances contained in
chapter 7 of the City Code.
(Ord. No. 3342, § 1, 3-14-06)
Sec. 10-109. Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. REGULATION OF GRAFFITI
Sec. 10-110. General.
(a)   Purpose. Graffiti is destructive of the rights and values of public and
private property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city
council acts to enforce removal of graffiti from public and private property,
the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of
graffiti, entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in
which to live, work and visit, all to the detriment of the city; and is hereby
declared a public nuisance. The city council intends through the adoption of
this article to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and
private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement.
The city does not intend this article to conflict with existing anti-graffiti
state laws, including but not limited to malicious injury to property.
(b)   Definitions.
Graffiti:  Writings, drawings, inscriptions, figures or marks of paint, ink,
chalk, dye or other similar substances on public or private buildings,
sidewalks, streets, structures, or places which are not authorized or permitted
by the property owner or possessor. For the purposes of this chapter, graffiti
shall include drawings, writings, markings or inscriptions regardless of the
content or nature of materials used in the commission of the act. Provided
however, this definition shall not be construed to prohibit temporary, easily
removable chalk or other water soluble markings which are used in connection
with traditional children's activities such as drawings of bases for ball
games, hopscotch and similar activities, nor does it include temporary, easily
removable markings used in connection with any lawful business or public
purpose or activity and markings used to denote the location of underground
utility infrastructure and those used in conjunction with establishing survey
control data and location points by survey crews.
Perpetrator: The person who engages in graffiti.
Person: Any individual, partnership, cooperative association, private
corporation, personal representative, receiver, trustee, assignee, or any other
legal entity.
Property owner: The owner of the property, such property owner's agent or any
person in lawful control or possession of the property.
(c)   Use of public funds. Whenever the city becomes aware of or is notified
and determines that graffiti is located on publicly or privately owned property
viewable from a public or quasi-public place, the city shall be authorized to
use public funds to assist in the removal, painting, obscuring or repairing of
the graffiti.
(Ord. No. 4306, § 1, 4-22-14)
Sec. 10-111. Graffiti prohibited.
(a)   It shall be unlawful for any person to place graffiti upon the surface of
any public or private property.
(b)   Any person who applies graffiti upon the surface of any public or private
property is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to prosecution in
accordance with G.S. § 14-127 and G.S. § 14-160. In addition to criminal
prosecution, such person shall be subject to the additional enforcement
provisions set forth herein.
(c)   It shall be unlawful for any property owner to permit property that is
defaced with graffiti to remain defaced; such property owner shall be subject
to the civil enforcement provisions herein.
(d)   It is the specific intent of this article to regulate the placement of
graffiti and the failure to remove graffiti as a civil violation only and not
as a criminal violation. Provided however, nothing herein is intended to
prevent, restrain or prohibit the criminal prosecution of graffiti perpetrators
under the laws of the State of North Carolina.
(Ord. No. 4306, § 1, 4-22-14)
Sec. 10-112. Removal required.
(a)   Immediate removal. It is the responsibility of the property owner to
immediately remove graffiti from the property owner's property. The property
owner should not wait for the city to send a violation notice but shall take
immediate and prompt action to remove the graffiti when applied.
(b)   Removal by property owner. It shall be unlawful for any property owner to
fail to remove or effectively obscure any graffiti upon property they own
within seven business days after receiving written notice from the city to
remove such graffiti ("notice to remove"). Notice to remove shall be served by
personal delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested
in conjunction with regular mail. If the regular mail is not returned within
ten days, service shall be deemed sufficient. Additionally, service hereunder
may be made in accordance with Rule 4 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil
Procedure. The notice to remove shall provide:
(1)   The street address or other description of the property sufficient for
property identification;
(2)   A description and general location of the graffiti;
(3)   A statement that the property is a public nuisance due to the existence
of the graffiti;
(4)   Statement that the graffiti must be removed or effectively obscured
within seven business days after receiving notice to remove and that if the
nuisance is not so abated within that time, the city will abate the public
nuisance at the cost of the property owner as set forth herein;
(5)   Information identifying any graffiti removal assistance available through
the city; and
(6)   Information concerning the procedure for appeal of the notice to remove.
(c)   Removal by city. If the city has provided notice to remove under
subsection (b) above, and property owner fails and/or refuses to take advantage
of any graffiti removal resources available through the city, as well as fails
or refuses to remove or effectively obscure graffiti upon the property owner's
property, the city may, after compliance with the requirements contained herein
below, go upon the private property and remove the graffiti at the expense of
the property owner. The city shall not clean, paint or obscure or repair any
property containing graffiti more extensively than where the graffiti itself is
located. The city shall not be required to restore the area that contained
graffiti, or any obscured area, to its original condition including conditions
of color, texture, and finish. The cost of obtaining compliance with the
requirements of this article shall be a lien in accordance with G.S. § 160A-
193. Provided however nothing herein shall require the city to remove graffiti
from private property or from property designated as historic property under
federal or state laws.
(Ord. No. 4306, § 1, 4-22-14)
Sec. 10-113. Right of entry to private property.
Prior to entering upon private property or property owned by a public entity
other than the city for the purpose of graffiti removal, the city shall attempt
to secure the consent of the property owner and a release of the city from any
and all claims arising out of the removal. If the property owner fails to
remove the graffiti within the time specified in the notice to remove, or if
the city has requested consent to remove or paint over the graffiti and the

other public right-of-way for any purpose, including but not limited to
installation of and repair to utility systems, or disturb the right-of-way by
removing any dirt, sod, sand or paving material therefrom or otherwise disturb
the right-of-way, without first obtaining a cut permit from the city engineer/
designee. If trees in the right-of-way are to be removed or if work is to be

a penalty as set forth herein, shall be assessed in addition to the regular
permit fee. A permit may be extended without penalty if extenuating
circumstances are encountered. Extenuating circumstances may consist of but not
be limited to circumstances that could not be planned for nor reasonably
anticipated and beyond the control of the permittee. Provided, however,
extenuating circumstance shall not consist of failure of a subcontractor to
perform. The city engineer/designee may grant extensions provided the extension
is requested in writing at least 48 hours prior to the permit deadline. All
extensions must be approved in writing. A weather day shall include the
following: (i) when the temperature drops below 32 degrees fahrenheit between

obtaining a cut permit.
(d)   Any person who cuts into a public right-of-way without first obtaining
the cut permit required by this article, shall be charged a penalty as
described below. Provided, however, emergency repair cuts to an existing
utility may be made without a permit in hand provided the permit is obtained by
the close of the next business day after the cut is made. In the event the
emergency work cut permit is not obtained within the time period set forth

square in shape. L- or T-shaped cuts are prohibited. Cuts into city streets
shall have a full width overlay for any cuts that extend beyond one travel lane
or for those streets that have been resurfaced within three years prior to the
date of the permit. The total length of the overlay must be a minimum of 35
feet in length. Projects shall be designed to the extent possible, so as not to
locate utility poles, hydrants, valves and manholes on sidewalks.
(b)   The engineering department shall be responsible for conducting periodic
inspections of the project during the progress of the work. The permittee shall
notify the city engineer/designee when work has been completed and request a
final inspection. The city engineer/designee shall make the final inspection to
determine that streets, sidewalks, alleys, squares or other public rights-of-
way are restored to city standards, and that all debris, materials, tools and
equipment are removed therefrom. All cuts shall be warranted by the person,
corporation or company making the cut for a period of two years from the date
of final approval which warranty shall include an indemnification clause,
agreeing to indemnify and hold harmless the city from any such claims during
the two-year warranty period.

for any and all costs incurred in restoring the street, sidewalk or public
right-of-way to city standards.

street, sidewalk, alley, square or other public right-of-way to city standards,
the city will:
(1)   Provide written notice that the cut is not acceptable.
(2)   Allow ten days for the person to repair the cut; and

from the permittee in addition to permit fees and penalties already incurred
and/or take such other legal action as is necessary to correct the violation.

maintained infrastructure, departments are exempted from payment of the
applicable permit fees and the penalties associated with the program during the

project. The permits will be issued for record purposes only with no fee
charged. Permit closeout will also be the responsibility of the project
manager.

possible, in the review of plans related to work in the right of way. Public
works will also be involved in the close out of contracts, including final walk

waiver of fees is necessary to avoid an infringement of constitutional rights.

Asheville's unique character and culture.

can cause adverse impacts to the community in the form of gathering crowds

room for crowds; blocked sidewalks; blocked ingress and egress of buildings;

quiet enjoyment of residents and businesses.
(d)   Such adverse impacts can be mitigated or alleviated through minimally
intrusive regulation of the time, place, and/or manner in which such
performances may occur. Such regulation ensures the ability of street
performers to perform in public spaces and promotes harmony among street
performers, local businesses, permitted event sponsors, and residents and
visitors by balancing the interests of performing artists with the public's
safety.

Sec. 16-146. Outdoor dining areas.
(a)   Permit required. Except as may be provided elsewhere within City Code, no

legally established business or organization that is adjacent to a city-
maintained sidewalk or street may apply to the city for temporary use of a

submitted to the city, along with any supporting documentation, which will then
be reviewed by the city manager or designee for compliance with this section
and the Guide.
(c)   Agreement; permit. 
(1)   An outdoor dining area permit is a revocable license issued to an
eligible permittee to use a portion of a public sidewalk or street for
temporary purposes as set out herein and does not convey an interest in
property, public sidewalks, streets or related infrastructure. Consistent with
N.C.G.S. sec. 1-45, the issuance of a permit does not assign ownership or
property rights to the permittee. The city manager or designee is authorized to
execute an agreement approving a permit for an outdoor dining area, and issue,
suspend or revoke such permit for the same based upon any or all of the
following factors:
(a)   The accuracy and completeness of the application and supporting
materials, and the extent to which they comply with the requirements of this
section and the Guide.
(b)   A violation of this section, or failure to comply with requirements of
the Guide, any outdoor dining area agreements, applicable laws and regulations.
(c)   Safety and logistical issues relating to hours of operation, traffic
flow, parking, and other aspects of operation.

may or may not be in the public interest, public safety, and general welfare.
(2)   Once approved, the permit shall be made available for inspection upon
request, and shall state on its face, at minimum, the following:
(a)   The legal name, address, phone number, and email address of the permittee
and its authorized representative.
(b)   The approved outdoor dining area location, approved hours of operation,
and permit commencement and expiration dates.
(c)   Any additional information the city manager or designee deems necessary.
(d)   Denial of application; reconsideration. If an application is denied, the
city shall notify the applicant electronically using the e-mail address
provided by the applicant stating the reasons for denial. Within 30 days of
such notice, the applicant may submit a revised application with supplemental
information for reconsideration. The payment of a new application fee is not
required if the revised application and material are submitted within 30 days
from receipt of the notice of denial.
(e)   Operation and use. A permittee of an outdoor dining area shall:
(1)   Comply with this section, the Guide, all rules, regulations, and laws,

outside the permitted outdoor dining area except as otherwise allowed by law.
(2)   Not place any items within the outdoor dining area unless they comply
with this section and the Guide.
(3)   Use the outdoor dining area only for the seating of its patrons and/or
the general public in accordance with the restrictions of the permit and Guide.
(4)   Ensure that no items are permanently affixed to the street, sidewalk,

outdoor dining area permit; an encroachment agreement must be obtained in order
to permanently affix items to public property.
(5)   Not operate outside the area designated in the permit.
(6)   Remove snow, ice, litter and other debris from the outdoor dining area
and adjacent sidewalk in a timely manner.

compliance with the American Disabilities Act, with adequate access determined
at the city’s sole discretion.
(9)   Ensure that any and all permittee patrons using the outdoor dining area
act in an orderly, safe, and non-disruptive manner so as to not pose a safety
risk to traffic or pedestrians; and if such conduct occurs, permittee shall
have an affirmative duty to immediately address such conduct and notify
applicable authorities.
(10)   The applicant shall provide and maintain a certificate of insurance for
comprehensive general liability and products and completed operations coverage
in a minimum amount of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and in the aggregate,
provided that those certificates may be furnished as evidence of such coverage
purchased for the applicant's principal place of business for serving food,
food products and/or beverages, so long as such certificates meet the minimum
acceptable requirements established in this section and shall further agree to
indemnify the city against any damages related to the use.
(f)   Design standards exception. 
1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and the Guide, the city
manager or designee may waive compliance with the design standards stated

designee finds that:

(b)   The applicant has submitted a completed outdoor dining area application
with supporting materials but is unable to comply with the design standards due
to conditions that are peculiar to the sidewalk, street, or property, and not
from those that are common to the neighborhood or the general public; the
permittee can substantially comply with the design standards in this section
and the Guide and the issuance of a permit is consistent with the spirit,
purpose and intent of this section and the Guide, such that public safety is
adequately protected; and such waiver does not violate State or federal laws or
regulations or any other provisions of the City Code.

after the mailing. Refusal to accept the notice shall not relieve the violator
of the obligation to pay the penalty.
(2)   The notice of violation shall contain a time period by which the

each subsequent day that the violation continues in existence shall constitute
a separate and distinct offense subject to additional civil penalties.

driven upon the right half of the highway except as follows:
(1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction under the rules governing such movement;
(2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left of
the center of the highway, provided any person so doing shall yield the right-
of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the unobstructed
portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an immediate
hazard;
(3)   Upon a highway divided into three marked lanes for traffic under the
rules applicable thereon; or
(4)   Upon a highway designated and signposted for one-way traffic.
(b)   Upon all streets and highways any vehicle proceeding at less than the

the same direction or when preparing for a left turn.
(c)   Upon any street or highway having four or more lanes for moving traffic
and providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to
the left of the centerline of the highway, except when authorized by official

lanes or except as permitted under subsection (a)(2) of this section.
(d)   Whenever any street has been divided into two or more clearly marked
lanes for traffic, the following rules in addition to all others consistent
with this section shall apply:
(1)   A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a

(2)   Upon a street which is divided into three or more lanes and provides for
the two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center
lane except when overtaking and passing another vehicle traveling in the same
direction when such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance or

time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the same direction that the
vehicle is proceeding and such allocation is designated by an official traffic
control device.
(3)   Official traffic control devices may be erected directing specified
traffic to use a designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by
traffic moving in a particular direction, regardless of the center of the

direction, unless such left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming
traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing
to be made in safety.

thereto and yield the right-of-way to vehicles operating on the designated
main-traveled or through highway. When stop signs have been erected at three or
more entrances to an intersection, the driver, after stopping in obedience
thereto, may proceed with caution.
(2)   Vehicles facing a red light controlling traffic passing straight through
an intersection from a steady or strobe beam stoplight shall not enter the
intersection while the steady or strobe beam stoplight is emitting a red light
controlling traffic passing straight through an intersection. Except where
prohibited by an appropriate sign, vehicular traffic facing a red light
controlling traffic passing straight through an intersection, after coming to a
complete stop at the intersection, may enter the intersection to make a right
turn, but such vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and to other
traffic using the intersection. When the stoplight is emitting a steady yellow
circular light on a traffic signal controlling traffic passing straight through

(Ord. No. 2378, § 1, 6-1-97)
Sec. 20-53. Enforcement.
(a)   Notice and appeal.
(1)   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be notified
by the public works director of the specific violation by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery. The notice
shall set forth the nature of the violation, the measures required to comply
with this chapter, if compliance is at all practicable, and a reasonable time
period within which compliance must be had.
(2)   If any aggrieved person disagrees with a decision of the public works
director, such person may request a hearing within ten working days of receipt
of the violation. The request must be in writing and directed to the tree
commission's secretary. The secretary shall immediately assemble an appeals
board from among the membership of the tree commission. The chairperson of the
Asheville Tree Commission shall always serve on the appeals board as the
chairperson and shall not vote except to cast the deciding vote in case of a
tie. The members to sit on the board shall be selected on a rotating basis. The
owner shall have the right to be represented by counsel, examine and cross
examine witnesses at said hearing. The city attorney shall serve as the appeals
board's legal advisor during said hearing. The appeals board shall render its
written decision within 30 days after the hearing.

board, an appeal may be taken to the Buncombe County Superior Court. Notice of
the appeal must be filed within ten working days of receipt of the appeals
board's decision. The parties may stipulate that the appeal to the Buncombe
County Superior Court shall be a review of the record only. In the absence of a
mutual stipulation, the review shall be de novo.
(5)   Any aggrieved party may request an injunction to preserve the status quo
during the pendency of any appeal in accordance with applicable North Carolina
law.
(b)   Civil penalty. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty
shall be $100.00 except as hereinafter provided. Each day of a continuing
violation shall constitute a separate violation. The appeals board shall
determine and assess the civil penalty, if any, at the time of the appeals
hearing, if one is requested. In the absence of an appeal, the public works
director shall submit a request to the chairperson of the appeals board who
shall assemble the appeals board and assess the civil penalty with supporting
documentation upon prior notice to the violating party of the date and time of
the appeals board hearing. At least ten days notice shall be given to the
violating party of the date, time and location whereby the appeals board will
consider the request to assess a civil penalty. In determining the amount of
the civil penalty, the appeals board shall take into consideration the amount
of money that the violator would be required to spend in order to be in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the amount of money saved by
the violator in violating the ordinance, the cost of replacement of any removed
tree, shrubbery or regulated tree. In determining the specific amount of the
civil penalty for damage or destruction to regulated trees, the appeals board
shall use the standard tree evaluation formula provided by the International
Society of Arboriculture, as it may be amended from time to time. The standard
tree evaluation formula is made a part of this chapter and adopted herein by
reference. The appeals board shall have no discretion to vary the cost figures
set forth in the formula. The appeals board may however, recommend that the
amount of the civil penalty be modified as part of a negotiated settlement with
the city. Upon failure of the violator to pay the assessed penalty or reach an
equitable settlement within 30 days, an action in the nature of debt in the
name of the city in the appropriate division of the general courts of j stice
may be instituted by the city attorney for recovery of a debt.
(c)   Criminal penalty. A violation of this Chapter subjects the offender to a
civil penalty, pursuant to the authority granted by N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 160A-
175, and does not subject the offender to the criminal penalty provisions of
N.C. Gen. Stat. sec. 14-4.
(d)   Injunctive relief. Whenever there exists reasonable cause to believe that
any person is violating this chapter or any standards adopted pursuant to this
chapter or any term, condition or provision of an approved permit, the city
may, either before or after the institution of any other action or proceeding
authorized by this chapter, institute a civil action in the name of the city
for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and an order of abatement demanding
the violator to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use
of the property.

applicable law.
(4)   The director may appoint a hearing officer to conduct any hearing
authorized by this chapter. A hearing officer shall have the same authority to
conduct a hearing and reach a decision as is provided to the director;
provided, that the decision of the hearing officer shall not be final but shall
be a recommended decision for consideration by the director. The director may
approve such decision without change, reject the decision and require a new or

by evidence presented at the hearing. The director may refer a recommended
decision of a hearing officer to the city manager.
In the event of a referral, the city manager shall have the same authority to
act upon a recommended decision of a hearing officer as is provided to the
director. The decision of the director or, in the event of a referral, of the

as the director may specify.
(f)   Appeal to superior court. Any person aggrieved by the final order or
decision of the director made pursuant to the hearing conducted under this
chapter, may seek judicial review of the order or decision by filing a written
petition in the nature of certiorari within 30 days after receipt of notice of
the order or decision, but not thereafter, with the Superior Court of Buncombe
County. If not previously requested, said person may request in writing that a
transcript be prepared for every part of the hearing which was recorded. Said
request shall be made at or before the time that the petition is filed. A copy
of the petition shall be served on the city in the manner required by law.
Within 30 days after service of a copy of the petition upon the city or such
other time as may be ordered by the court, the city shall prepare and transmit
to the court the original or a certified copy of the official record of the
hearing as hereinafter set forth. The official record of the hearing shall
include:

the civil penalty was assessed. The petition shall include: a waiver of any and
all rights of the petitioner to a hearing and judicial review of the
assessment; and a stipulation that the facts are correct as set forth in the
documents(s) assessing the civil penalty. The decision of the director on the
petition shall be final and shall not be subject to further administrative or
judicial review. In determining whether a petition for remission will be
approved, the director shall consider the following factors:
(1)   Whether one or more of the factors concerning the assessment of a civil
penalty in section
21-3-6 were wrongly applied to the detriment of the petitioner;
(2)   Whether the petitioner promptly abated continuing environmental damage
resulting from the violation giving rise to the assessment;
(3)   Whether the violation giving rise to the assessment was inadvertent or
the result of an accident;
(4)   Whether the petitioner has been assessed civil penalties for any prior
violations pursuant to this chapter or by any state or federal authority
enforcing substantially similar provisions;
(5)   Whether payment of the civil penalty by the petitioner will prevent
payment for any remaining, necessary remedial action.
(h)   After submitting a petition for remission, the petitioner shall provide
such additional information and records as may be reasonably necessary or
convenient to the director's consideration of the petition. The director may
remit the entire amount of a civil penalty only when the petitioner has not
been assessed civil penalties for any prior violation of this chapter or by
state or federal authorities enforcing substantially similar provisions and the
payment of the civil penalty will prevent payment of any remaining, necessary
remedial action.

3.   Fees.
(a)   Generally. A sign permit fee shall be paid to the City of Asheville for
each sign permit applied for in accordance with this article in an amount
determined by the City of Asheville through the adoption of its fees and
charges manual and based on the size of the sign. This permit fee does not
include electrical permit fees, which shall be additional. A sign permit fee
shall not be charged for replacing a nonconforming sign with a conforming sign
or for bringing a nonconforming sign into conformance with this article if such
action is undertaken voluntarily within three years of the effective date of
this article.
(b)   When fees payable. Sign permit fees shall be paid upon the application
for a sign permit and prior to commencement of any sign construction on the lot
where the sign will be located.

is not commenced within 60 days from the date of such sign permit or if
substantial work for the permitted sign is suspended for a period of 60
consecutive days after issuance of the sign permit, the permit shall
automatically become null and void. Provided, however, for new construction,
the sign permit shall not become null and void until 60 days after the
certificate of compliance has been issued.
(b)   Extensions of time. The provisions of subsection (a) above shall not
apply when delays are not a result of willful acts or neglect of the persons
obtaining the permit. In that event, the sign administrator may grant an
extension of time within which operations must be started or resumed. All
requests for such extensions and approval thereof shall be in writing.
5.   Forfeiture of fees. When any permit has been revoked under the terms of

article.

appendix] of the Code of Ordinances the board of adjustment shall have the
power to hear and act upon applications for a variance which meet the following
requirements:
1.   If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of this article,
the applicant can make no reasonable use of the sign allowed; and
2.   If the hardship of which the applicant complains is unique, or nearly so,
and is suffered by the applicant rather than by owners of surrounding
properties or the general public; and

the site) rather than to personal circumstances; and
4.   If the hardship is not a result of the applicant's own actions; and
5.   If the variance will neither result in the extension of a nonconforming
use nor authorize the initiation of a nonconforming use; and
6.   If the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
article and preserves its spirit and if the variance secures the public safety
and welfare and does substantial justice.
B.   In granting a variance, the board of adjustment shall make written
findings that all of the above listed requirements have been met. If a variance
is granted it shall be the least possible deviation from the requirements of
this article. In granting any variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this article.
Violations of the provisions of the variance granted, including any conditions
or safeguards, which are a part of the grant of the variance, shall be deemed a
violation of this article.

SECTION 1 - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND PROVISIONS
1A   General Requirements
1A.01   Intent and Scope
The Standards and Specifications Manual establishes development requirements
that protect the public health, safety, and welfare through the provision and
maintenance of public or private infrastructure improvements related to
developing, redeveloping, and subdividing land, as well as providing necessary
rights-of-way, transportation, and utility services. The Manual’s requirements
apply to all properties within the City of Asheville.
1A.02   Authority
The City will review, approve, and inspect the design and construction of
infrastructure improvements within the public or private right-of-way or
easements and site developments to ensure compliance with this Manual in
addition to standards contained in the City of Asheville Unified Development
Ordinance (UDO). The City has the authority for approving, accepting, or
denying the design and construction of any improvement.
1A.03   Complete Streets Policy
The City has an adopted Complete Streets policy, which states that the City of
Asheville will plan for, design, construct, operate and maintain appropriate
facilities for travel, and as appropriate, for resting or parking, for all
users in all new construction and retrofit or reconstructions projects. The
term “all users” includes pedestrians, bicyclists, transit vehicles and riders,
children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Complete Street principles
are to be applied on all City projects, as well privately funded development.
(rev. 06/2025)
1A.04   Minimum Standards
The design and construction of all public or private infrastructure
improvements described in this Manual shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements established herein. Where inconsistencies arise between the

technical society, organization, or association, or to any law or regulation of
any governmental authority, whether such reference be specific or by
implication, shall mean the most recently adopted or current law, code,
regulation, standard, criterion, or manual in effect at the time of City review
of any project. The design professional shall be responsible for verifying the
current versions of all referenced documents.
In the event of ambiguity or conflict in determining the most restrictive
requirement, the City Engineer or their designee shall make the final
determination, prioritizing accessibility and safety. (rev. 06/2025)
1A.05   Terminology
Terms, words, and abbreviations used in this Manual are defined in Appendix A.
1A.06   Using this Manual
This Manual is to be used when designing and constructing all public
improvements and infrastructure within the City. For the purposes of this
document, public improvements and infrastructure include but are not limited
to: streets, sidewalks, trails, curb and gutter, curb cuts, streetscaping,
landscaping, fire hydrants, manholes, storm water mains, inlets, drainage
swales and channels, and other infrastructure improvements intended for public
purposes or for the benefit of the community or as required by ordinance.
This Manual also provides design and construction requirements to be used when
developing private infrastructure improvements that are used by and affect the
public. The required private improvements associated with property development
include but are not limited to: traffic mitigation, site access and driveway
design, storm water site drainage and detention pond improvements, water
quality and erosion control measures, streets, sidewalks, trails, curb and
gutter, curb cuts, streetscaping, landscaping, fire hydrants, manholes, storm
water mains, inlets, drainage swales and channels, and other infrastructure
improvements.
1A.07   Updating this Manual
The City Engineer will approve all revisions and updates of this Manual. The
City Manager or his/her designee will review this Manual periodically, or as
needed, and will recommend revisions and/or updates of this Manual to the City
Engineer, so that the Manual continues to reflect generally accepted
professional technical standards and specifications and City policy. (rev. 11/
2022)
1A.08   Inspections
All work must be inspected and approved by the City Engineer or his/her
designee to insure that the work is complete in accordance with the approved
plans. The most recent set of approved plans must remain on the site at all
times while construction activity is occurring for use by the City Engineer or
his/her designee. The designee will typically be a City Inspector.
The City Engineer’s office shall be given sufficient time to schedule and
coordinate various inspections. It is the responsibility of the contractor to
have the project site prepared for inspection at the time the City Engineer or
his/her designee arrives. The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel
and equipment required as a part of the inspection process.
The presence of the City Engineer or his/her designee at the work site shall in
no way reduce the contractor's responsibility for conformity with the plans and
specifications. Should the City Engineer or his/her designee accept materials
or work that does not conform with plans and specifications, whether from lack
of discovery or for any other reason, it shall in no way prevent later
rejection or corrections to the unsatisfactory materials or work when
discovered. The contractor shall have no claim for losses suffered due to any
necessary removals or repairs resulting from the unsatisfactory work.
Any work which cannot be visually observed by the City Engineer or his/her
designee at the time of inspection, shall, at the City Engineer’s or his/her
designee request, be exposed and be made available for inspection at the
contractor's expense. Work performed before or after normal work hours or
during the weekend or on City holidays shall comply with the requirements of
this Manual and shall include only such tasks that do not require observation
by the City Engineer or his/her designee.
1A.09   Other Standards and Requirements
This Manual describes the minimum requirements and specifications for designing
adequate and functional improvements. However, the design of the improvements
also depends on the land use, zoning and comprehensive planning requirements,
and other adopted plans for the city, as well as the specific site geography of
the land to be improved or developed.
The City's review for approval of public and private improvements occurs as
part of the development review process that distributes design applications to
staff in multiple departments, divisions, and agencies as described in “Section
2 - Development Review and Approval”. (rev. 06/2025)
1A.10   Alternative Materials and Methods of Construction and Installation
The provisions of this Manual are not intended to prevent the use of any
materials or methods of construction and installation not specifically
prescribed in the Manual, provided that the alternative materials or methods of
construction and installation have been approved and their use authorized by
the City Engineer or his/her designee.
The City Engineer or his/her designee may approve an alternate material or
method of construction or installation, provided the proposed design is
satisfactory and complies with the provisions of this Manual and that the
material, method, or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the
equivalent of applicable requirements described in this Manual in suitability,
strength, effectiveness, durability, safety, and sanitation.
The City Engineer or his/her designee will require that sufficient evidence be
submitted to substantiate any claims that may be made regarding an alternate
material or method of construction. The details of any action granting approval
of an alternate material or method will be recorded and entered in the files of
the City.

day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation.
Any civil penalty assessed shall be recovered by the City in a civil action in
the nature of debt, to be brought in the Buncombe County Superior Court if the
offender fails to give notice of timely appeal or fails to pay the penalty
within the prescribed period of time after being cited for the violation.
1B   General Provisions
1B.01   Clearing and Grubbing
The work of clearing and grubbing shall consist of the cutting, removal, and
satisfactory disposal of all vegetation and all surface debris. Clearing and
grubbing shall be conducted in a manner to prevent damage to vegetation that is
intended to remain growing and also to prevent damage to adjacent property.
1B.02   Earthwork
Earthwork shall be defined as removal of earth or soft rock from its natural
location or as the depositing of such material into the proper fill areas as
designated on the approved plans.
Rock excavation shall be defined, in the opinion of the City Engineer, as all
ledge rock or boulders over 0.5 cubic yard that cannot be excavated without
blasting.
A written permit for blasting must be obtained from the Asheville Fire
Department a minimum of 24 hours before any explosive material or blasting
agents are used or stored within the Corporate Limits of the City of Asheville.
Blasting should be conducted by a certified professional in the State of North
Carolina.
Trenches deeper than 10 feet located within the public right-of-way may require
positive shoring. Trenches deeper than 4 feet located adjacent to a roadway may
require positive shoring.
Fill material shall be free from construction material, debris, frozen
material, organic matter, unstable material, or contaminated soils. For the top
two (2) feet below finished sub-grade, no fill material shall be used weighing
less than 100 pounds per cubic foot. The top two (2) feet of backfill material
shall be free from stones greater than two (2) inches.
For all areas under a proposed roadway, the top 12 inches of sub-base, and the
entire base course shall be compacted to a density of 100 percent maximum
Standard Proctor dry density as determined by the American Association of State
and Highway Transportation Official (AASHTO) method T99. For that portion of
fill under roadways and extending at a slope of 1 : 1 beyond the back of curb,
compact to a density of no less than 95 percent of the maximum Standard Proctor
dry density as determined by AASHTO method T99. Fill material shall be placed
in lifts of six (6) inches or less of uncompacted soil.
Other fill material shall be compacted to a density of no less than 95 percent
of the maximum Standard Proctor dry density as determined by AASHTO method T99.
Backfill material shall be placed in lifts of eight (8) inches or less of
uncompacted soil.
1B.03   Maintenance of Traffic
1B.03a General. When construction occurs in a public right-of-way, traffic
control devices must be erected, maintained, relocated, and removed in
accordance with the plans, specifications, and the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices (MUTCD). This requirement shall apply for all construction
occurring on streets and rights-of-way, including construction or repairs by
utility companies. The MUTCD referred to in this provision shall be the current
edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and
Highways, as prepared and published by the Federal Highway Administration. The
current edition shall be the edition current at the time of construction.
Traffic control devices shall include but not be limited to signs, drums,
barricades, cones, delineators, flashing arrow panels, temporary guardrail,
temporary concrete median barrier, vehicle-mounted temporary impact
attenuators, pavement markings, raised reflective pavement markers, flaggers
and pilot vehicles as specified in the current edition of the MUTCD.
It should be noted that the MUTCD has specific requirements to provide
accessible alternate routes for pedestrians when sidewalks are closed and a
contractor shall provide accessible alternate routes when applicable.
Notification of all applicable emergency service agencies must occur prior to
closing a street. These agencies may include Asheville Fire Department, 911
dispatchers, Asheville Police Department’s Communications Division, Buncombe
County Sheriffs Department, and Buncombe County Emergency Services Division.
1B.03b Materials. Materials used in the fabrication and installation of
construction traffic control devices shall be in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the MUTCD. All enclosed lens sheeting required for use on traffic
control devices shall have an identification mark on the surface. This mark
signifies that the sheeting meets the requirements of Federal Specification L-
S-300C for Minimum Reflectivity 1 Sheeting and Tape. The identification mark
shall not interfere with the function of the device, but shall be visible both
day and under illumination at night without the use of special devices.
1B.03c Installation and Maintenance. Existing public streets, sidewalks, bike
lanes, greenways, and shared-use paths shall be kept open to traffic at all
times by the contractor unless an approved permit to close the street, or
portions thereof, is granted by the City Engineer or his/her designee, and
NCDOT’s District Engineer or a designated representative (for NCDOT roads
within City Limits), a minimum of 5 days prior to any closing or partial
closing. The City of Asheville Public Works Department is exempt from this
approval process for City-maintained streets. The City of Asheville
Communications Division of the Police Department and emergency 911 dispatchers
must be contacted by the contractor a minimum of 24 hours before any streets
are totally or partially closed. The permit applicant shall be responsible for
notifying adjacent businesses, residents, and other applicable parties at least
7 days prior to the closure, and receipt of the notification template and
recipients may be requested by City staff. This notification process is
necessary for public and private entities to coordinate activities that take
place in the right-of-way, and provide transit, emergency services, and the
public sufficient time to adjust their travel plans.
Work on any project shall not start until all required agreements and permits
from the City are in place, and traffic control devices required for the
particular work activity are properly installed. Traffic control devices shall
be properly maintained, clearly visible, clean and operational during the time
they are in use. During periods when use of the devices is not warranted, they
shall be removed from the work area, covered and/or otherwise positioned so
that they do not convey their message to the traveling public. The location,
legends, sheeting, dimension, number of supports, and horizontal and vertical
placement of warning signs, barricades, and other traffic control devices shall
be as required by the approved plans and the MUTCD. Weeds, brush, trees,
construction materials, equipment, and the like shall not be allowed to obscure
any operational traffic control device.
Competent and properly trained, attired and equipped flaggers, using "stop" and
"slow" paddles, shall be provided when two-way traffic cannot be maintained or
as determined by the City Engineer or his/her designee.
The contractor shall assume full responsibility for the continuous and
expeditious maintenance or replacement of all construction warning signs,
barricades, and other traffic control devices. The contractor shall
continuously review and maintain all traffic control measures to assure that
adequate provisions have been made for the safety of the public and workers.
Failure to maintain all traffic control devices in a satisfactory condition
shall be cause for suspension of construction operations until proper traffic
control is re-established. (rev. 06/2025)
1B.04   Concrete
Concrete shall be plant or transit-mixed concrete conforming to ASTM C33 for
aggregates and ASTM C94 for ready-mixed concrete. Any concrete poured that has
a slump over four (4) inches as per ASTM C143, or has a batched time of more
than 90 minutes, will be considered unacceptable. The City Engineer or his/her
designee may allow a minimum plant mix of 4,000 psi with a slump over four (4)
inches provided that it is a certified pump mix. Concrete shall not be
deposited on frozen sub-grade. Concrete shall not be poured when the air
temperature is 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below, and the predicted low
temperature for the succeeding 24 hour period is less than 32 degrees
Fahrenheit. Also, concrete shall not be poured when the air temperature is over
95 degrees Fahrenheit.
All concrete when placed in the forms shall have a temperature of between 50
and 90 degrees Fahrenheit and shall be maintained at a temperature of not less
than 50 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 72 hours for normal concrete and 24
hours for high early strength concrete, or for as much time as is necessary to
secure the proper rate of curing and designed compressive strength. Concrete
shall be air entrained with 5-7% air. Retarders and accelerators shall be used
only within the manufactures specification and clearly documented on the
loading tickets.
Placed concrete should not be allowed to free fall more than 48 inches. Forms
should be pre-wetted prior to the placement of concrete.
Placement of pervious concrete shall be approved by the City Engineer prior to
installation. A pervious pavement design will require a maintenance plan if
utilized as part of the stormwater management plan.
1B.05    Planting Within City Utilities Easements
A utility easement shall mean any area to which the City has unlimited access
for servicing utility lines but outside of the sight distance triangle. Any
plantings installed within a utility easement may be damaged or destroyed
during the course of servicing. The City is not liable for damage to any
improvements or plantings within a utility easement. The City will reseed any
bare or disturbed soil for erosion control purposes as necessary.
Small and medium shrubs, groundcovers, or grasses may be planted within a
utility easement. Small trees (defined as being under 40 feet in height at
maturity) may be planted a minimum of 10 feet from the centerline of the
closest pipeline within the easement or 10 feet from the center of the
easement, whichever is greater. Small trees as defined above may include:
Redbud, Fringe Tree, Serviceberry, Golden Raintree, Hawthorne, Hornbeam, Saucer
or Star Magnolia, Sassafras, Smoke Tree, Sourwood, or Sumac. Large tree species
shall not be placed within any City utility easement. A complete list of
preferred small tree species are shown in the “Small Deciduous Trees: 15’ - 40’
” category of Appendix B. Any other small tree species to be approved by the
City Arborist.
Plantings on any easement under or over the rights of another utility
(Metropolitan Sewerage District, Progress Energy, AT & T, Public Service North
Carolina, City of Asheville Water Department, Charter Communications, etc.)
must be approved in advance by the utility company and shall comply with their
standards.
SECTION 2 - DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND APPROVAL
2A   Development Project Review
Development review involves many different disciplines of the City including,
but not limited to, Planning & Urban Design, Development Services Department,
Transportation, Fire, and Public Works. The development review process and type
of plans required with an application submittal vary and depend upon the type
of project that is proposed.
Projects of a smaller size and scale are generally reviewed and approved by
City staff. Larger projects and projects requiring zoning map amendments
undergo a more rigorous process that begins with a review by the Asheville
Technical Review Committee (TRC) and in most cases, also includes review during
a public hearing by the Asheville Planning and Zoning Commission (PZC) and/or
the Asheville City Council (CC). Project sites located in certain districts
(e.g. Downtown, River, Historic Districts, etc.) may also be subject to review
by other public bodies. Applicants should also refer to the City’s Unified
Development Ordinance (UDO) or contact the Planning & Urban Design and
Development Services Department for additional and more specific information.
SECTION 3 - TRANSPORTATION DESIGN STANDARDS
3A   General
3A.01   Purpose
These Transportation Design Standards are intended to provide for an integrated
transportation system for all transportation modes, including pedestrian,
bicycle, transit, and motor vehicle. The purpose of these standards is to
regulate new development and redevelopment of previously developed sites within
the corporate limits of the City of Asheville.
3A.02   Standards Addressed
These Transportation Design Standards are intended to address the design of the
following components of the City of Asheville transportation system:
∙    Streets
   ∙    Street Types Defined
   ∙    Street Width and Curbing Design
   ∙    Street Geometric Design
   ∙    Sight Distance Requirements
∙    Driveways
∙    Sidewalks
∙    Bicycle Facilities
∙    Off-Street Path Systems
∙    Transit Facilities
3B   Streets
Streets are the most important part of Asheville’s transportation system. Ideal
street design must accommodate all modes of transportation (motor vehicle,
bicycle, pedestrian, and transit), although there are certain street classes,
such as alleys, that have specialized purposes. Residential streets should
provide connectivity while discouraging high-speed cut-through traffic.
The standards in this section are required for new public and private streets
constructed within the corporate limits of the City of Asheville.
3B.01   Street Types Defined
Low impact – A public or private street providing primary access in steep slope
and/or ridge top areas. In addition, a low impact street may be identified as a
street that is designed and constructed to minimize stormwater runoff through
surface treatment and infiltration (using swales and other type of filtering
and retention) or designed and constructed as access for minor subdivisions of
less than 15 single family homes.
Alley - A public or private way providing secondary or service access to
abutting property. All new alleys are to be privately-maintained with measures
to ensure the travelway is not obstructed in any manner, including by parking.
Alternate Access - A private way providing primary access to four or fewer
single family residential lots.
Local - A public or private street providing primary access to a limited number
of abutting properties.
Collector- A public or private street “collecting” traffic from local streets
and carrying it to arterial streets while providing primary access to abutting
properties.
Arterial - A public street carrying large volumes of through traffic while
providing primary access to abutting properties, which are typically developed
with commercial, industrial, or multifamily residential uses.

property lines across the property to be developed, unless the street to be
constructed has been approved by the City as a cul-de-sac or other street with
no outlet. Where existing rights-of-way abut property to be developed, streets
shall be built to connect to rights-of-way as feasible. Future connections
terminating at property line shall be signed according to the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). In locations where these extensions are to be
constructed in the future, a cul-de-sac must be provided in accordance with the
“Cul-de-Sac Street” portion in this chapter of this section. Other types of
turn around may be approved by the City Engineer or his/her designee, provided
they comply with current International Fire Code.

3C.04c Design Controls for Vertical Curves. Design control for crest and sag
vertical curves should conform to the standards established in the most current
edition of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets published by
the AASHTO. The subject standards are based on the formula L = KA where L =
length of vertical curve in feet, K = rate of vertical curvature in feet per
percent of A, and A = algebraic difference in grades in percent. The City of
Asheville will accept the K values used by the North Carolina Department of

3C.07   Sight Visibility Triangles at Intersections
In order to ensure adequate sight visibility at intersections, sight visibility
triangles shall be provided and maintained at all intersections with public
streets, private streets, and driveway access points. Sight visibility
triangles include the following dimensions:
∙    Generally, a sight triangle is defined as that triangle that is formed by
a 10-foot side measured along the right-of-way of the minor approach beginning
at its intersection with the right-of-way of the major approach and a 50-foot
side measured along the right-of-way of the major approach beginning at its
intersection with the right-of-way of the minor approach (
Figure 3-4: Sight Visibility Triangles at Intersections). There are times when
the right-of-ways are large enough to adversely affect the intent of a sight
triangle making it difficult for a driver to enter the major street. The City
Engineer or his/her designee will review these situations on a case-by-case
basis and make any appropriate adjustments that are needed.
∙    For intersections formed by two public streets with a traffic sign or
other traffic control device, the minor approach is defined as the street that
must stop or yield.
∙    For intersections formed by a public street and a private street or
driveway, the public street is defined as the major approach and the private
street or driveway is defined as the minor approach.
∙    For a private street or driveway, the short side of the sight visibility
triangle shall be measured along the edge of the private street or driveway.
∙    For a public street, private street, or driveway where the building
displays a 0-foot setback, the long side of the triangle shall be measured
along the face of curb (“
Figure 3-5: Sight Visibility Triangles for 0-Foot Setback Conditions”), with
additional measures to be applied if deemed necessary by the City Engineer or
his/her designee in accordance with sound engineering principles.
On streets maintained by the NCDOT, additional sight visibility triangle
requirements may be applied by that authority.
Within the sight visibility triangles identified above, and except as provided
below, no structure, sign, plant, shrub, tree, berm, fence, wall, or other
object of any kind or parking or storage of automobiles shall be installed,
constructed, set out, or maintained so as to obstruct cross-visibility at a
level between three (3) and 10 feet above the level of the center of the street
intersection. These restrictions shall not apply to:
∙    Existing natural grades which, by reason of natural topography, rise three
feet above the level of the center of the intersection;
∙    Trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in such manner that no limbs or
foliage extend into the area between three and ten feet above the level of the
intersection;
∙    Fire hydrants, public utility poles, street markers, governmental signs,
and traffic control devices;
∙    Any structure, sign, plant, shrub, tree, berm, wall, or fence located in
the Central Business District;
∙    Trees which are planted in order to meet the street tree requirement as
set forth in subsection 7-11-3(f).

3C.08   Cul-de-sac Streets
Cul-de-sac streets are strongly discouraged on local and residential streets
because they disrupt connectivity of streets for safety and access. Cul-de-sacs
are prohibited on collector and arterial streets. The City Engineer or his/her
designee and Fire Marshall may approve cul-de-sacs where there is no other
possible street or driveway access to a property from a public right-of-way, or
if a cul-de-sac would avoid direct access to an arterial street. Where a cul-
de-sac is approved, a pedestrian/bicycle connection to adjacent development
will be required, if feasible.
The length of a cul-de-sac will be measured from the last point of alternative
connected access. Where approved, cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum pavement
diameter (curb face to curb face) and a minimum right-of-way diameter as
follows:
∙   Short Cul-De-Sac. When the total length of the cul-de-sac is 500 feet or
less (measured from centerline of the intersecting street), the minimum
pavement diameter is 70 feet, and the minimum right-of-way diameter is 90 feet.
The small hammerhead design (“
Figure 3-6: Small Hammerhead Design”) may be used as an alternative.
∙   Long Cul-De-Sac. When the total length of the cul-de-sac is between 501 and
1,000 feet (measured from centerline of the intersecting street), the minimum
pavement diameter is 90 feet, and the minimum right-of- way diameter is 110
feet. The large hammerhead design (“
Figure 3-7: Large Hammerhead Design”) may be used as an alternative. Cul-de-
sacs longer than 1,000 feet must be approved by City Engineer or his/her
designee and Fire Marshall.

3C.09   Curb and Gutter
Curb and gutter is required for all new privately maintained and publicly
maintained streets that are constructed within the city limits of Asheville.
The standard curb and gutter width is 24-inch (minimum) or 30-inch (desirable).
18-inch curb and gutter is not  acceptable (18-inch curb and gutter may be used
within parking lots). Rolled or valley type curb may be used when the following
conditions are satisfied:
∙    Residential streets that serve less than 20 homes.
∙    Catch basins must be installed every 150 feet unless stormwater
calculations indicate a greater spacing to a maximum spacing of 250 feet.
∙    Water meter boxes must be located behind the sidewalk, if a sidewalk is
required as part of the development, or at the property line.
∙    Street grade must be less than or equal to 5 percent.
3C.10   Granite Curb
Granite Curb is required at anytime granite curb exists prior to the work being
performed in the Central Business District. Granite curb shall be installed in
accordance “Standard Detail 3.11D - Granite Curb Installation”.
3C.11   Curb extensions
Curb extensions or bulb outs reduce the crossing width of streets for
pedestrians, make pedestrians more visible in a crosswalk, and add space to
sidewalks that can be used for pedestrian amenities and activities. Forcing
drivers to slow down when they turn the corner makes it safer and more
comfortable for pedestrians. Also, when appropriately placed, they can improve
safety and expedite the boarding of alighting of transit patrons.
Curb extensions may be required by the City Engineer or his/her designee on new
local and collector streets. Curb extensions should only be used when there is
a parking lane, and where transit and bicyclist will be travelling outside the
curb edge for the length of the road. Curb extension design must facilitate
adequate drainage.
3C.11a Curb Extension Design. Refer to the most current AASHTO guidelines for
curb extension design.
3C.12   Medians
Medians are highly recommended on new streets wider than two travel lanes.
Medians may be permitted on all streets subject to review and approval by the
City Engineer or his/her designee. Landscaped medians shall be reviewed for
appropriate vegetation types and to determine any necessary maintenance
agreements. Vegetation types must be approved by City Engineer or his/her
designee.
3C.12a Median Widths. In order to provide accessible pedestrian refuge
locations, medians should be at least six (6) feet wide. If left turn lanes are
installed in the median, the median width adjacent to the left turn storage
lanes shall be four (4) feet and the median width at the start of the left turn
lane bay taper shall be at least 14 feet wide. Median design widths shall
conform to “
Table 3-9: Median Width Design Standards”.
3C.12b Design Vehicle. Streets with medians shall be designed to accommodate
proper turning movements for a single unit (SU) design vehicle. AASHTO
guidelines should be followed for the median design.
Table 3-9: Median Width Design Standards
 
Function                       Minimum Width (feet) Recommended Width (feet)

3C.13   Vertical Clearance of Structures
At least 17 feet of vertical clearance shall be provided for all overhead
structures. Vertical clearance is measured from the crown of the street to the
lowest portion of the structure above all streets and alleys.
3D   Streets - Sight Distance
3D.01   General
Streets shall be designed to provide adequate visibility to ensure safe
operation at the appropriate design speed. Intersection sight distance and
stopping sight distance must conform to the standards established in the most
current edition of A Policy On Geometric Design of Highways and Streets

3D.03   Exceptions
Some objects located within street sight distance areas may not significantly
obstruct the required visibility of the driver. The driver may be able to see
over, under or around some objects within street sight distance areas. Objects
that may exist within street sight distance areas include fire hydrants,
utility poles, bus shelters and traffic control devices that are located to
minimize visual obstruction. Other objects 12 inches in diameter and smaller,
such as tree trunks, may be allowed within street sight distance areas if
located individually or in combination so as to not substantially restrict the
driver's view. The determination of what objects, if any, may be located within
street sight distance areas shall be made by the City Engineer or his/her
designee. Trees greater than 12 inches in diameter and located in the street
right of way shall be evaluated in accordance with other applicable City
policies and requirements.
3E   Streets - Pavement Design and Materials
3D.01   General

3G   Driveways - Vehicular Site Access Management
3G.01   General
Management of vehicular site access is important for a number of reasons,
including reducing conflicts between points of access and between different
modes of transportation such as pedestrian and vehicular. New vehicular site
access shall be designed and constructed in compliance with these standards.
Redevelopment or additions to existing developed properties as outlined in
Article 11 of the UDO shall also require compliance with these standards (as
amended.)
All driveways constructed or replaced on City streets and alleys require a City
Driveway Permit. All driveways constructed on NCDOT streets within the City
corporate jurisdiction may also require a NCDOT Driveway Permit.
3G.02   Definition of a Driveway
A driveway is a vehicular site access point intended to serve a limited number
of properties. Driveways have different purposes than streets and have
different design standards, including the number of driveways allowed to access
an adjoining street, spacing requirements to separate driveways from other
driveways and intersecting streets, sight distance, and other design
requirements.

3H   Multimodal Design Standards - Sidewalks
3H.01   General
Sidewalks are the most critical component of an urban area’s pedestrian
transportation network. While this network can be augmented by greenways and
multipurpose trails, most pedestrian traffic in a city will occur on sidewalks,
particularly those along streets and within developments. The City of Asheville
requires sidewalks to be installed along existing or new roadways when property
is developed or redeveloped as defined in the UDO (Chapter 7, Article 11).
The City of Asheville is committed to providing infrastructure within the
public right-of-way that is accessible for all users. The City recognizes that
this goal might be difficult to achieve in all cases because of existing
terrain conditions, restricted right-of-way, and even existing City ordinances;
however, the City will constantly strive to meet the goal.
3H.02   Sidewalk Requirements on New Streets
3H.02a Sidewalks on Both Sides of a New Street. Sidewalks are required to be
installed on both sides of a new street under any of the following conditions:
∙    The new street’s width from face of curb to face of curb exceeds 30 feet.
∙    The new street’s projected average daily traffic exceeds 1,000 vehicles
per day.
∙    The street is within one-half mile, measured along the centerline of
public right-of-way, of a school, public park, library, community center,
transit route, or any other pedestrian generation point as identified by the
City Engineer or his/her designee.
∙    Either side of the street is zoned Central Business District, Urban Place
District, Neighborhood Corridor District, Urban Village District, Urban
Residential District, or their successors.
3H.02b Sidewalks on One Side of a New Street. Sidewalks are required to be
installed on at least one side of all new streets with daily traffic volumes of
300 vehicles per day or more. The daily traffic volumes will be the current or
projected volumes within a five year time period and will include traffic
generated from an applicable project. When a sidewalk is only required on one
side of the street, grading for a future sidewalk on the other side of the
street will be provided. Utility poles shall not be located in the sidewalk or
future sidewalk location on new streets.
3H.03   Sidewalk Requirements on Existing Streets
Sidewalks shall be constructed to current standards along adjacent existing
public or private streets for all new developments, redevelopment, and
expansions of existing developments. Projects that generate less than 100
vehicles per day are exempt from this requirement (unless a new street is
constructed).
3H.03a New sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be constructed in conformance with the
design standards for sidewalks, If the sidewalk cannot be contained within the
existing right-of-way, a recorded easement or right-of- way must be dedicated
to the City of Asheville.
3H.03b Renovated sidewalks. Existing sidewalks adjacent to the development
shall be brought into compliance with current standards, including ADA
requirements, crossing ramps, driveway apron crossings and for obstructions.
This compliance does not include upkeep or maintenance of existing sidewalks.
3H.04   Sidewalk Fee-in-Lieu of Construction
Information regarding sidewalk fee-in-lieu-of construction is located in
Section 7-11-8 (Sidewalk Requirements) of the City of Asheville 's Unified
Development Ordinance (UDO).
3H.05   Sidewalk Design Standards
Sidewalks shall be designed to meet the following standards:

** CBD, Neighborhood Corridor, Urban Place, Urban Residential, Urban Village
*** where topography makes providing a planting strip infeasible, a sidewalk
constructed at back-of-curb may be approved by the City Engineer or his/her
designee; such sidewalks shall be a minimum of 6 feet in width with a desirable
minimum of 8 feet in width along collector and arterial streets.
3H.05a Obstacles in Sidewalk. Obstacles, such as utility poles or cabinets,
sign posts, planters, trees, water meters, water valves, fire hydrants, or
grates with openings larger than 1/2 inch, shall not be placed within the
pedestrian access route (PAR) in newly constructed sidewalks or existing,
unless approved by the City Engineer or his/her designee. The PAR must be
constructed free of all obstacles.
3H.05b Meander. A sidewalk may be constructed so as to provide a gradual
meander and to facilitate the installation of landscape material or to avoid
obstacles such as fire hydrants or utility poles. The design of the sidewalk
shall be such that the safety and usability of the sidewalk is not affected. In
no case shall the taper of the sidewalk with respect to the street exceed 5:1,
nor shall the distance of the sidewalk from the street exceed 20 feet.
3H.05c Vertical Grade. The vertical grade of a sidewalk shall not exceed five
(5) percent, a ratio of 20 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical (20:1), unless
the grade of the adjoining street exceeds this amount. In this case, at no
point will the grade of the sidewalk be permitted to exceed the grade of the
adjacent street.
3H.05d Cross Slope. The cross slope of the walkway of a pedestrian access route
shall be 2 percent maximum.
3H.05e Accommodation of Transit. Refer to the “Multimodal Design Standards -
Transit Facilities” subsection in this section of this manual for sidewalk
locations adjacent to transit stops or transfer points.
3H.05f ADA Ramps. Where sidewalks or greenways intersect any section of curb or
street section, an ADA ramp will be installed. ADA ramps can be perpendicular
as shown in “
Figure 3-13: ADA Sidewalk Ramps” and in accordance with “Standard Detail 3.17:
Standard Wheel Chair Ramps”. Also, parallel and blended transitions can be
used. If a matching ADA ramp does not already exist, one must be installed to
avoid “trapping” the wheelchair operator in the street.

3H.05h Materials, Thickness, Joints, and Finish. All sidewalks and curbing
shall be constructed of 4,000 psi concrete in accordance with “Standard Detail
3.16: Standard Concrete Sidewalk”. In certain districts other materials may be
required in accordance with City codes. Materials not meeting ADA requirements
are not allowed. The minimum concrete thickness of a sidewalk shall be four (4)
inches. At locations where a driveway crosses a sidewalk, a six (6) inch
concrete thickness is required. A 1/2 inch expansion joint filled with joint
filler and sealer shall be placed between all rigid objects and placed no
farther than 50 feet apart for sidewalks extending the full depth of the
concrete with the top of the filler 1/2 inch below the finished surface. Joint
filler shall be a material conforming to the most current NCDOT Standard
Specifications for Road Structures manual. Tool joints shall be spaced to match
the width of the sidewalk but be no less than five (5) feet apart. Tool joints
shall be 3/4 inch deep and must not be sealed. The sidewalk surface shall have
a broom finish in a transverse direction to pedestrian traffic.
3H.05i Running Bond Pattern. Sidewalks within the central business district
shall be constructed with a running bond pattern in accordance sidewalk detail
“Standard Detail 3.16B: Standard Concrete Sidewalk with Running Bond Pattern”.
3H.05j Drainage. Sidewalks shall have a uniform slope toward the roadway of a
maximum of 2 percent unless otherwise specified. The planting strip between the
sidewalk and the back of curb shall not be less than 1/4 inch per foot nor
greater than 1/2 inch per foot toward the roadway unless approved by the City
Engineer. Pipes, drains, flumes, or other concentrated stormwater devices shall
not discharge across a sidewalk, but shall be piped or flumed under the
sidewalk.
3H.05k Sidewalk Drop-off. An adjacent slope steeper than 12:1 (8.33 percent)
with a drop-off greater than 30 inches between the top of slope and bottom of
slope other than curb and gutter, shall be equipped with a Public Safety
Railing in accordance with “Standard Detail 3.35: Pedestrian Safety Railing”.
3H.05l Curbing. Where no curb exists on a street that requires sidewalks, curb
or curb and gutter installation may be required in addition to construction of
the sidewalk.
3H.05m Tree Planting. When tree or tree replacement planting is required in new
or existing sidewalks that are located within certain urban zoning districts,
trees shall be planted in accordance with tree pit details “Standard Detail
3.22: Reinforced Concrete Sidewalk, 3.22A: Structural Soil, 3.22B: Silva Cell,
3.22C: Large Tree Grate with Washed Stone Border, or 3.22D Standard Tree Grate
with Washed Stone Border”. Tree planting shall be covered with a frame and
grate as per “Standard Detail 3.22E: Sidewalk Tree Grate & Frame” that is flush
the sidewalk’s elevation and slope. The center of the tree planting shall not
be located within the PAR of the sidewalk.
3I   Traffic Signals.
3I.01    General
The City of Asheville follows the criteria set forth in the current MUTCD to
determine if a traffic signal is warranted, and, if warranted, the City of
Asheville makes the final determination regarding the installation of a traffic
signal at a specific intersection along city-maintained streets. The City of
Asheville reserves the right to install warranted traffic signals as a part of
approved development projects when they are completed and open for business. A
developer might want the installation and full operation of a traffic signal to
and from promote easier and safer ingress and egress to the approved
development project both on-site and off-site at an earlier date than the City
would normally schedule and be willing to fund. The developer may purchase and
install the traffic control signal hardware, meeting the specifications of the
City of Asheville. The developer shall release, give or donate the traffic
signal to the City of Asheville and shall retain no rights or ownership of
personal property therein. All traffic signal installations along city-
maintained streets must be approved by the City Engineer or his/her designee
prior to installation. The NCDOT might require require developer funding of any
warranted traffic signal modifications and/or installations on state-maintained
streets within the corporate limits of Asheville. The Developer/Owner must
donate easements for traffic signal installations as required by the City of
Asheville or NCDOT.
Pedestrian signals and/or emergency vehicle pre-emption will be considered on a
case-by-case basis and will generally be included provided the appropriate
infrastructure is in place or will be provided with the proposed traffic signal
installation. Typically, emergency vehicle pre-emption will be provided along
primary emergency routes.
Generally, signalized intersections along arterial or collector streets should
not be spaced more closely than quarter-mile intervals. Where the signal
warrants justify installation at closer spacing, access management (i.e.,
channelization or frontage streets) should be considered.
3J   Multimodal Design Standards - Bicycle Facilities
3J.01    On-Street Bicycle Facilities
On street bicycle facilities may include a range of design treatments, such as
bicycle lanes, striped shoulders, shared lane markings (sharrows), and shared
road markings. Bicycle facilities will be provided in accordance with “
Table 3-20: Design Standards for On-Street Bicycle Facilities” when an existing
street is widened or a new public or private street is proposed and is expected
to have more than 1,500 vehicles per day or is identified for a bicycle
facility in the currently adopted Asheville Bicycle Plan.
Table 3-20: Design Standards for On-Street Bicycle Facilities
 
Street Type             Bicycle Facility
Alley, Alternate Access Not Required
Local                   Shared Roadway Marking
Collector               Bicycle lanes or striped paved shoulders*
Arterial                Bicycle lanes or striped paved shoulders with
                        intersection treatments*
Designated Gateway      Bicycle lanes or striped paved shoulders with
                        intersection treatments*
*Striped paved shoulders should not be marked as bicycle lanes in areas with
heavy traffic, high speeds, and many driveways. Marking a bicycle lane is at
the discretion of the City Engineer or his/her designee or in accordance with
the adopted bicycle plan.
 
3J.01a Bicycle Lanes. A bicycle lane is a portion of the roadway that has been
designated by pavement markings and signs for the preferential or exclusive use
of bicyclists. Bicycle lanes should be located on both sides of the street
(except on one way streets), and carry bicyclists in the same direction as
adjacent motor vehicle traffic. On new or widened local streets, the minimum
width for bicycle lanes is four (4) feet, excluding two (2) feet gutter. On
collector and arterial streets, seven (7) feet is the preferred width,
excluding gutter width. On roadways with posted speed limits of 35 MPH or under
with adjacent on-street parking, the minimum width for the bicycle lane is five
(5) feet. On roadways with posted speed limits of more than 35 MPH with
adjacent on-street parking, the minimum width for the bicycle lane is six (6)
feet. When there is on-street parking adjacent to bicycle lanes, parallel
parking is preferred and should be at least eight (8) feet wide. Bicycle lanes
will include marking and signage as in the current version of the MUTCD and as
approved by the City Engineer or his/her designee .
Figure 3-15: Typical Bicycle Lanes

IMAGES/0-0-0-457.png]
 
3J.01b Shared Roadways. Shared roadways are streets and roads where bicyclists
can be served by sharing the travel lanes with motor vehicles. Usually, these
are streets with low traffic volumes and/or low motor vehicle speeds, which do
not need additional width in order to be bicycle-friendly. Shared roadways with
speeds of greater than 20 mph or over 1,500 vehicles per day may require “Share
the Road” signage, at the discretion of the City Engineer or his/her designee.
Motor vehicle/bicycle sharing of the travel space can be emphasized by using
special shared roadway pavement markings called shared lane markings
(sharrows). Shared lane markings can be helpful on multi-lane streets where
there is insufficient space to add bicycle lanes. Shared lane markings are
encouraged on local and collector streets but are not permitted on arterial
roadways. Any use of sharrows must be approved by the City Engineer or his/her
designee prior to installation.

IMAGES/0-0-0-473.png]
 
3J.01c Climbing Lanes. A bicycle lane on one side of the road (climbing lane)
can provide additional space for riders climbing a hill. This type of marking
can be used at the discretion of the City Engineer or his/her designee where
topography limits road width and supports the usefulness of the facility. The
width of the climbing lane will be the same as a bicycle lane and will normally
require sharrows on the downhill side street.
Figure 3-19: Examples of Climbing Lanes
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/5934c0da97b8f3153466f754620b2990295c12a3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-471.png]
 
3J.01d Paved Striped Shoulders. Paved striped shoulders can provide bicyclists
with extra riding space to increase their comfort when traveling adjacent to
motor vehicle traffic.
3J.01e Complex Intersections. Designated movement lanes will be routed in
accordance with the guidance in the current MUTCD, or other design guidelines
acceptable to the City Engineer or his/her designee.
Figure 3-20: Complex Intersection
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/5934c0da97b8f3153466f754620b2990295c12a3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-469.png]
 
3J.02    Off Street Bicycle Facilities
Off-street bicycle facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the
design guidelines established in the “Guide for the Development of Bicycle
Facilities” prepared by AASHTO. Off-street bicycle facilities will be located
in a dedicated right-of-way or easement having a minimum width of 20 feet and
consist of an asphalt or concrete paved path at least 10 feet in width. All
curves shall be designed with a minimum inside radius of 15 feet.
3J.02a Bicycle Parking.  Bicycle parking can be provided in the form of bike
racks and bike lockers. On-site bicycle parking should generally be provided
within 50 feet of the main building and employee entrances in visible and
prominent locations that are lit and physically separated from automobile
parking to prevent vehicles from intruding into the bike parking area. On-site
bicycle parking may be provided using the “A,” inverted “U,” or post and loop
rack elements installed on no less than 30 inch centers, or with other style
racks or lockers of a design that meets the recommendations of the Association
of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals current Bicycle Parking Guidelines.
•   Bike racks should have the following features:
•   Securely support the bicycle upright by its frame in at least two places.
•   Prevent the wheel of the bicycle from tipping over.
•   Allow head-in or back-in parking.
•   Allow the frame and one wheel to be locked to the rack with a standard high
security, U-shaped shackle lock.
•   Support bicycles without a diamond-shaped frame and horizontal top tube.
•   Resist rust or other surface changes that could damage bicycles.
•   Resist being cut or detached using common hand tools, such as bolt cutters,
pipe cutters, wrenches, and pry bars.
•   Be anchored in a way so that it cannot be stolen with bikes attached.
•   Provide at least a 2 foot by 6 foot parking space for each bike without the
need to lift the handlebars of one bike over those of another to park.
•   Provide easy, independent bike access.
•   Be uncomplicated and intuitively simple for the bicyclist to use.
•   Not present a tripping hazard for visually impaired individuals.
Comb, toast, schoolyard, and other racks that provide no support for the
bicycle frame do not meet these standards. Wave style racks, unless installed
to serve only two bicycles per rack element, do not provide support in at least
two places, and do not meet the standard.
Figure 3-21: Examples of Acceptable Bicycle Rack Design

IMAGES/0-0-0-485.png]
 
3J.02b Bridges. Bridges must provide for bicycle facilities in the same way as
the adjacent streets. Bridge surfaces shall not be of a material or design that
presents a danger to bicyclists. Railings on bridges will be at least 54 inches
high. See “NCDOT Bicycle Facilities Planning and Design Guidelines” for
details.
3J.02c Railroad Crossings. Railroad tracks crossing the road can present a
dangerous condition for bicyclists. At diagonal at-grade crossings, the bicycle
lane or shoulder should be designed to enable the bicyclist to approach the
track at an angle closer to 90 degrees (but not less than 60 degrees) without
having to swerve into motor vehicle travel lanes.
The width and the dimensions of the widened area will be dependent upon the
skew of the railroad tracks relative to the bicyclist crossing point. It is
important that the bicyclist is given sufficient space on the approach and the
departure of the crossing to safely transition back to the travel way. An
example of this widening treatment is shown in “
Figure 3-24: Railroad Crossing”.
Figure 3-24: Railroad Crossing

IMAGES/0-0-0-501.png]
 
3J.02d Bicycle Safe Storm Drainage Grates. Storm drainage grates pose a hazard
for bicyclists when the openings are parallel to the bicyclists’ direction of
travel. Bicycle tires can get caught between the bars of these grates and cause
bicyclists to crash. Unsafe storm drainage grates should be replaced with
grates shall that are consistent with NCDOT’s standard grate design. “
Figure 3-25: Bicycle Safe Drainage Grates” includes additional detail about
bicycle-safe drainage grates.
Storm drainage grates and other features, such as manhole covers, must be flush
with the roadway surface. Depressed features are a hazard for bicyclists and
pedestrians when they are within the crosswalk and/or bicycle lanes.
Figure 3-25: Bicycle Safe Drainage Grates

IMAGES/0-0-0-499.png]
 
3J.02e Bicycle Detection and Signal Timing at Intersections. At signalized
intersections consideration will be given to bicyclists in the timing of the
traffic signal, and in the method of detecting the presence of bicyclists.
Signals should be designed to provide an adequate clearance interval for
bicyclists who enter the intersection at the end of the green phase as well as
designed to provide a total crossing time long enough to accommodate bicyclists
starting up on a new green phase. When an intersection approach receives a
green signal, the bicyclist needs enough time to react, accelerate, and cross
the intersection. The current “AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle
Facilities” provides guidance on how to determine the green phase timing and
clearance interval needed to accommodate bicyclists.
Signal faces should be positioned so that bicyclists can see the signal
indication.
3K   Multimodal Design Standards - Transit Facilities
Transit facilities consist of either: 1) a transit stops with ADA pad, 2) a
transit stops with a bench and ADA pad,
3) a transit stops with shelters and ADA pad or 4) a transit transfer stations.
Transit stop locations must take into account four (4) factors:
•   Passengers. Stops must be near places where there is an expectation of
riders.
•   Access. If a stop can not be located where riders are, they must be able to
get to the stop conveniently and safely on a pedestrian network (sidewalks and
crosswalks).
•   Traffic Characteristics. Buses can not always stop where riders want them
to because of complex traffic patterns.
•   Location. In order to satisfy ADA requirements, developments may need to
acquire additional easement on neighboring property if right-of-way is not
available.
The final location of transit stops will be approved by the Transportation
Planning Manager in consultation with the City Engineer or his/her designee.
A transit stop should have a combination of the following elements: transit
sign, a map holder, a trash can, a bike rack, a bench, and/or a shelter.
Shelter dimensions are shown in “
Table 3-21: Transit Shelter Dimensions”.
A transit stop should have a combination of the following elements: concrete
ADA pad 5’ wide (measured parallel to the roadway) by 8’ deep (measured from
the curb or roadway edge), transit sign, a map holder, and a trash can. A
transit stop may also have a bike rack, a bench, a shelter or/and a power
outlet for either a LED/ LCD signs for automated vehicle location information
or for additional lighting.
Figure 3-26: Dimensions of Bus Boarding and Alighting Areas

IMAGES/0-0-0-505.png]
 
3K.01   Street-Side Factors
Transit stops and transit transfer stations should be placed either forty (40)
feet after an intersection (with a minimum of 90’ clearance) or ten (10) ft
before an intersection (with a minimum of 100’ clearance). Dimensions are shown
in “
Figure 3-27: Typical Dimensions for On-street Bus-stops”. In general, the
transit-stop “zone” shall be clear of parking or other roadway obstacles. Mid
block transit stops are discouraged.
Figure 3-27: Typical Dimensions for On-street Bus-stops
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/5934c0da97b8f3153466f754620b2990295c12a3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-509.png]
 
The distance from a businesses front door to a transit stop should be as short
as possible and should be identified as the “pedestrian connection” in the
project site plan.
To effectively use transit services a passenger requires an inbound and
outbound transit-stop, for this reason projects may be required to improve
Transit-stops outside of the project area.
3K.02   Curb-Side Factors
All shelters and benches should have a seat with backrest for at least two
passengers. The seating should be oriented to view oncoming traffic,
pedestrians and adjacent buildings. A bench should have a seat that is 14-24”
in depth, 42” minimum length, and 17-19” height above the floor or ground.
Additionally, the back support should equal the seat length and extend from a
point 2” maximum above the seat to a point 18” minimum above the seat. Finally,
the seat structure should support both vertically and horizontally a force of
250 pounds applied at any point on the seat. Further guidance is shown in “
Figure 3-28. Conceptual Bench and Waiting Pad Design”.
Figure 3-28: Conceptual Bench and Waiting Pad Design

IMAGES/0-0-0-513.png]
 
Transit stops generally accommodate a single transit vehicle, typically on a
street but occasionally in an on-site location. Transit transfer stations must
be designed to accommodate simultaneously an equal number of routes that use or
are expected to use the particular location as a transfer point. All transit
stop facilities must be installed on a non-slip, properly draining (maximum
slope of 1:50 or 2%), concrete pad (the concrete pad should extend 12” beyond
the edge of the bench, shelter or trash can. Shelter dimensions are shown in “
Table 3-21: Transit Shelter Dimensions”. Transit shelters and transfer station
will provide a 3’ tall by 4’ long map holder protected from the elements and
mounted at a height 60” above the finish floor to the centerline of the sign.
Table 3-21: Transit Shelter Dimensions
 
Length, Width & Depth Transit stops Transit Stations
Shelter Depth (feet)  6             7-8
Shelter Width (feet)  6-12          20+
Shelter Height (feet) Approx. 7     Approx. 7
 
The transit stop must provide accommodation for individuals with disabilities.
The location should be parallel and facing curb, be connected via a concrete
path (a maximum slope of 2%) to the sidewalk to provide access to the bus and
allow landing and pedestrian movements. It is recommended that transit stop
amenities (benches, shelters, trash cans, and bike rack) be placed behind the
sidewalk as can be seen in “
Figure 3-29: Typical Shelter Design”.
Figure 3-29: Typical Shelter Design

IMAGES/0-0-0-525.png]
 
If amenities are placed between the curb and sidewalk they must be set at least
2’ back from the curb, increasing with higher traffic speeds. Transit stop
signs must be placed at least 2’ back from the curb. The connected concrete
path width shall allow for two (2) wheel chairs in the sidewalk at the same
time. Details of these elements are shown in “
Figure 3-29: Typical Shelter Design”, “
Figure 3-30: Transit Stop Area Design Elements” and “
Figure 3-31: ADA Requirements Within Shelter”.
Figure 3-30: Transit Stop Area Design Elements

IMAGES/0-0-0-523.png]
 
A shelter shall have back and side panels that are transparent or glazed with
distinctive patterns to indicate presence of the panels with 6” clearance
between the ground and the bottom of the panels. A shelter roof must be leak
proof and runoff shall be diverted to rear corners of shelter. Shelter frame
shall be designed to be stable with or without the walls and roof. All shelter
and bench fasteners shall be concealed or if exposed should be tamper
resistant. Within the roof line of the shelter and protected from the weather,
a minimum of a 30” x 48” clear floor area must be provided to ensure ADA
compliance, as shown in “
Figure 3-31: ADA requirements within Shelter”.
Figure 3-31: ADA Requirements Within Shelter

IMAGES/0-0-0-521.png]
 
The shelter should be visible to motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians during
daylight hours and at night. It is not required but is recommended to have
between 2 to 5 footcandles of light. A shelter may also have an electrical
source for LED/LCD signs for automated vehicle location information. The
electricity can be provided via a power outlet or an alternative source of
electricity, such as solar cells. Solar cells are preferred. A transit transfer
station should have appropriate lighting and an electrical source for LED/LCD
signs for automated vehicle location information.
Landscaping near or around a transit stop or transfer station should be limited
in order to ensure visibility between the driver and passengers and in order to
limit ADA conflicts. Locating a bus-stop near or under a large tree can provide
beneficial protection from the weather as long as visibility from the roadway
and passenger safety is not negatively impacted.
A shelter must be maintenance-free thus aluminum or anodized frames are
preferred. The City’s Transportation Planning Division and Development Services
Department will consider other materials on a case-by-case basis.
3K.03   Permit Requirements
Shelters are treated as structures and require the appropriate permits,
following building, zoning, and engineering standards.
Development Services Department must approve structures prior to construction
and grant a permit. Additional permit(s) for the site plan shall be received
from the Development Services Department. If the site is on a North Carolina
Department of Transportation (NCDOT) corridor a right-of-way encroachment
agreement will be needed from NCDOT. Shelters shall be designed to comply with
the North Carolina State Building Code for Accessibility, the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations and the North Carolina State Building Code
for Buncombe County.
With the completion of a project the easement for the transit-stop, shelter
and/or transfer shall be provided to the City of Asheville. An easement
agreement is available from the Transportation Department. Permit requirements
may vary according to jurisdiction.
SECTION 4 - STREET LIGHTING STANDARDS
4A   Street Lighting
4A.01   General
Lighting of publicly accessible streets, bike lanes, sidewalks and other
pedestrian areas is important for public safety. To ensure the installation of
street lighting that is adequate to achieve this purpose, the following
requirements are established. Please refer to “Article XI” of the Unified
Development Ordinance for standards regulating all other outdoor lighting.
4A.01a Easement Required. Adequate rights-of-way or utility easements shall be
dedicated to the City to allow the electric utility company to install street
lights. Ideally, facilities with detached bike paths or sidewalks may use a
combined signage, utility, and pedestrian easement for placement of the street
lights between the curb and bikeway. Ideally two (2) feet of horizontal
clearance from the sidewalk or bike path should be met. Where a bike path or
sidewalk is attached to the street curb and gutter, street lights should be
placed behind the sidewalk or path within a minimum three (3) foot wide utility
easement. Utility easements for street lights are not exclusive and may be
landscaped or used for parking subject to City approval. If there is an
exclusive easement behind an attached walk or path, the street lights shall be
located beyond that easement in an additional three (3) foot wide easement.
4A.01b New Development. The installation costs of street light fixtures
associated with new development shall be paid by the developer. The City shall
assume continued maintenance and energy costs associated with new installations
after the associated streets are accepted for maintenance by the City. Upon
street acceptance, the owner/developer must transfer the street lighting
electric bill into the City’s name. All other fixtures must be approved by the
City. All underground facilities shall be a pedestal mount design.
4A.01c Other New Installation. The City will authorize the installation of
additional street lighting on existing City maintained rights-of-way upon the
determination that there is a demonstrated public safety need. The City will
not assume costs for the installation, maintenance, or energy costs of street
lights on streets not maintained by the City.
4A.01d Annexed Areas. The City shall assume costs of existing street lights in
newly annexed areas provided the lights comply with City standards and their
associated streets have been accepted for maintenance by the City. The City
will take responsibility for the utility costs associated with the streets,
effective the first full billing cycle following the acceptance of the street.
4A.01c Priorities for Installation. Street lights may be installed by the City
within the City maintained right- of-ways in new locations based the following
reasons:
•   Reduction of an identified night-time traffic accident problem correctable
through street light installation.
•   Major traffic corridors with significant turning movement conflicts and
night-time pedestrian activity.
•   Major traffic corridors with significant night-time turning movement
conflicts.
•   Arterial and collector intersections and/or horizontal or vertical
alignment changes.
•   Residential street lighting.
•   Commercial alleys with significant night-time pedestrian activity.
•   Other public safety needs.
4A.02   Illumination, Height, and Spacing Requirements
The following standards will be observed for the illumination, height, and
spacing requirements for street lights.
Table 4-1: Illumination Requirements for Street Lights
 
Districts                   Approved Lighting Type     Rated Brightness
Luminance - Residential     High Pressure Sodium Vapor 5,800 to 9,500 lumens
Districts                   or Metal Halide

5B   Fiber Optic System
5B.01   General
The City plans to develop a fiber optic network over time as part of the
implementation of its economic development plan. The City of Asheville’s
economic development future depends on an expansion of the use of technology by
its businesses and residents. As a consequence, it is important to provide for
the ability to access this technology in the most effective fashion possible.
Fiber optic cable provides the best method to allow the highest speed of data
transfer and technology access. New development will be required to help lay
the foundation for this fiber optic network through the placement of ducting to
support future extension of fiber optic lines to serve businesses and
residents. This section provides the standards for the placement and
installation of this ducting.
5B.02   Fiber Optic Duct System
The fiber optic duct system will consist of rigid pipe, sweeps, handholes (for
sidewalks), and manholes (for streets). It will be primarily constructed
following the traditional standards of underground construction.
The pipe will be placed first to establish the routing. A single copper
conductor will be run through a duct for locating purposes. Grounding can occur
as actual fiber/copper/etc lines are installed. Placement of lines within the
conduit will be done to maximize usage of duct as illustrated in the example
below.
Figure 5-4: Fiber Optic Duct System

5B.03   Installation of Fiber Optic Duct System Required
New installed streets and or sidewalks shall provide the fiber optic ducting in
accordance with these standards as part of the general utility plan for the
development.
5B.04   Fiber Optic Duct System Installation Standards
5B.04a Depth. The duct system should be placed between 24” and 36” deep for its
protection.
5B.04b Locator Wire. A single insulated copper wire should be buried with the
duct system for a method of locating while the pipe is unoccupied or might
happen to contain non-metallic cables.
5B.04c Urban Locations. In downtown and urban areas, ducts should be placed
under sidewalks where possible, rather than streets to allow greater ease of
access to the duct system for adding spurs, loops, pullboxes, etc.
5B.04d Pullboxes/Handholes. Pullboxes/handholes should be placed at every other
lot line in new street installations and at every lot line in incremental
installations such as the development of a single lot. Placement shall take
future service to lots on the opposite side of the street into consideration.
Typical pullbox size is 24” x 36”. A “City of Asheville Use Only” label shall
be provided on the inside of the pull boxes.
5B.04e Under-Street Installation: Ducts installed under streets will require
traffic-rated manholes for access.

5D   Pipe Trenches
5D.01   Excavation and Preparation of Trenches
Trenches for sanitary sewer lines, force mains, and stormwater lines shall be
excavated to the required depth to permit the installation of the pipe along
the lines and grades shown on the construction drawings. Where excavation is in
rock, the rock shall be removed to a depth of at least six (6) inches below
grade and shall be backfilled with materials in accordance with the following
pipe laying and backfilling specifications. Wet trenches shall be stabilized
with #78 M stone or with a base layer of #57 stone. Trench standards and
specifications for water distribution lines are separately provided by the
City’s Water Resources Department.
5D.02   Pipe Laying and Backfilling
All pipe shall be laid in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Pipe laying and backfilling shall be accomplished in a manner to prevent damage
and misalignment of the pipe. The subgrade at the bottom of the trench shall be
shaped to secure uniform support throughout the length of the pipe. A space
shall be excavated under the bell of each pipe to provide space to relieve
bearing pressure on the bell and to provide room to adequately make the joint.
Open ends of the pipe shall be plugged with a standard plug or cap at all times
when pipe laying is not in progress. Trench water shall not enter the pipe.
Backfill material shall be free from construction materials, debris, and
frozen, organic, or unstable material. The top two (2) feet of backfill
material shall be free from stones greater than 2 inches in diameter. Under
roadways and extending at a slope of 1 to 1 beyond the back of the curb,
measured perpendicular from the centerline, backfill shall be compacted to a
density of no less than 100% standard Proctor maximum dry density as measured
by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
method T99.
Backfill shall be placed in lifts of eight (8) inches or less of uncompacted
soil. Other fill material shall be compacted to a density of no less than 95%
of the maximum dry density as measured by AASHTO method T99. Backfill material
shall be placed in lifts of six (6) inches or less of uncompacted soil.
Suitable backfill material shall be utilized and compacted in accordance with
the City compaction requirements and the pavement repair shall be in accordance
with the applicable “Section 5 - Utilities” repair and replacement details.
All trenches shall be properly backfilled at the end of each working day. All
curb cuts shall be repaired within a maximum of three (3) days from the date
the cut is made. If conditions do not permit a permanent repair within the
given time limit, permission to make a temporary repair must be obtained from
the Street Services Division of the Public Works Department.
In locations where backfill material is temporarily stockpiled on the roadway
surface, a layer of 1½ inches of screenings shall be used between the pavement
surface and the backfill material.
5D.03   Boring and Jacking
In locations where open pipe trenches are not allowed, dry bore and jack
operations may be allowed. Boring and jacking shall be accomplished in a manner
to prevent damage or misalignment of the pipe. Smooth wall or spiral welded
steel pipe may be jacked through dry bores slightly larger than the pipe bored
progressively ahead of the leading edge of the advancing pipe. The spoil
material shall be mucked by the auger back through the pipe during the boring
operation. As dry boring progresses, each new section of the encasement pipe
shall be butt- welded to the section previously jacked into place.
The steel pipe shall be manufactured of grade ‘B’ steel with a minimum yield
strength of 35,000 psi in accordance with American Society of Testing and
Materials (ASTM). When used along or under a roadway maintained by North
Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), the encasement pipe shall be
coated to meet NCDOT requirements.
If voids are encountered while installing encasement pipe 30 inches or larger,
grout holes shall be installed at 10 foot centers and filled with 1:3 Portland
cement grout at sufficient pressure to prevent settlement of the roadway,
unless NCDOT approval stipulates otherwise. Other grout mixtures may be
submitted for approval.
In the event that an obstruction is encountered during the boring and jacking
operation, the auger is to be withdrawn and the excess pipe is to be cut off,
capped, and filled with 1:3 Portland cement grout at a sufficient pressure to
fill all voids before moving to another site.

6F   Fire Flow Requirements for Building
6F.01   General.
An approved water supply capable of supplying the required fire flow for fire
protection shall be provided to premises upon which buildings or portions of
buildings are hereafter constructed or moved into or within the jurisdiction of
the City of Asheville. The procedure for determining fire flow shall be in
accordance with this section. This section only applies to buildings. These
requirements were derived from the International Fire and Building Code.
Modifications were made to the model code requirements for practical
application of water availability needs within the City of Asheville.
6F.02   Specific Terminology
For the purpose of this section, certain terms are defined as follows:
Fire Area - The fire area shall be the single largest floor area of all floor
levels within the exterior walls, and under the horizontal projections of the
roof of a building used to protect storage or use areas, except as modified.
This area is used to determine the required fire flow.
Fire Flow - The flow rate of a water supply, measured at 20 pounds per square
inch (psi) residual pressure, that is available for fire suppression.
6F.03   Types of Water Supply
Water supply shall consist of water mains, reservoirs, pressure tanks, elevated
tanks, or other fixed systems capable of providing the required fire flow and
duration. Other City of Asheville sections of this manual may also apply to
these systems.
6F.03a Water Storage Tanks. Water storage tanks used for meeting the required
fire flow and duration must comply with NFPA 22 and be designed and sealed by a
licensed North Carolina Professional Engineer.
6F.03b Private Water Systems. Private water systems shall comply with the
requirements of NFPA 24.
6F.04   Area Separation and Decreases
6F.04a Area Separation. Portions of buildings which are separated by fire walls
rated as two hours or greater and with protected openings constructed in
accordance with the Building Code are allowed to be considered as separate fire
areas.
6F.04b Decreases. A reduction in required fire flow is allowed where the
building is equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system.
When the sprinkler system water demand and any required outside hose demand is
satisfied by using either a municipal or a private water system or a
combination of the two, the fire-flow requirement is considered to have been
satisfied.
6F.05   Fire Flow Requirements for Buildings
6F.05a One-and Two-family Dwellings. The fire flow requirements for one-and
two-family dwellings shall be 500 gallons per minute, except as modified. Flow
duration for one and two-family dwellings shall not be less than 30 minutes.
6F.05b Buildings Other Than One and Two-family Dwellings. The minimum fire flow
and flow duration for buildings other than one and two-family dwellings shall
be as specified in
Table 6-3: Minimum Required Fire Flow and Flow Duration for Non-Sprinklered
Buildings, except as modified. The maximum required water supply is 3500 gpm.

6G   Knox Box Key Control Program
6G.01   General
The Knox Box, a proprietary system used by the Asheville Fire-Rescue
Department, is a program designed to expedite entry and eliminate property
damage caused by the forcible entry required for evaluation of an emergency
situation, and allows the Fire Department to re-secure the building when
leaving.
6G.02   Knox Box Defined
A Knox Box is a highly secure, UL listed steel vault used for the storage of
entry keys and alarm panel or mechanical system keys for use only by the Fire
Department. The keys to access the Knox Boxes are located in locked boxes
inside the emergency response apparatus and cannot be duplicated.
6G.03   Scope
•   The enforcement of use of the Knox Boxes is through the City of Asheville
Fire Code, which adopted the NC Fire Code. Section 506.1 reads:
“Where access to or within a structure or an area is restricted because of
secured openings or where immediate access is necessary for life-saving or
fire-fighting purposes, the code official is authorized to require a key box to
be installed in an accessible location. The key box shall be of an approved
type and shall contain keys to gain access as required by the code official.”
All buildings which contain automatic fire alarm systems or fire suppression
sprinkler systems shall provide a key box and the required keys for access to
the building. An important reason for this is the real possibility of an alarm
occurring when the business is locked and vacant. The availability of a key
allows firefighters to safely enter the building, without causing any damage,
evaluate the conditions present and secure the premises.
•   Your Knox Box shall be installed as designated on your fire department
approved plans. If the location of the Knox Box is not indicated on the
approved plans, have the fire inspector approve the location prior to
installation.
•   Boxes may be ordered on line at “www.knoxbox.com”. Enter “28801” as the Zip
Code for the Asheville Fire Department.
•   The Knox Box shall be installed between 4’ - 6’ from the ground unless
otherwise approved by the Fire Marshal.
•   The Knox Box shall not be blocked from plain view by any obstructions
(landscaping, etc.).
•   If you are unsure or have questions, call your fire inspector prior to
installing this Knox Box.
•   The box will arrive unlocked from the factory so it can be installed.
•   Once the Knox Box is mounted and you are ready to lock the keys in, call
(828) 259-5441 to request a fire inspector to come out to lock the box.
6H   Traffic Calming
6H.01   Purpose
The City of Asheville continually strives to strengthen and protect its
neighborhoods by improving the quality of life in residential areas. Traffic
conditions on residential streets can greatly affect neighborhood livability.
Speeding traffic and unnecessary through traffic in neighborhoods create safety
hazards on residential streets. When traffic problems become a daily
occurrence, our sense of community and personal well-being are threatened.
Consequently, the city has a Traffic Calming Policy that addresses how cut-
through traffic in neighborhoods can be managed.
6H.02   Traffic Calming Types
The type of traffic calming measures that are used in a particular neighborhood
or situation is determined through a public process as established in the
policy. There are a variety of measures to be considered, including chicanes,
diverters, speed tables, speed humps, and traffic circles. Specific measures
will be designed for the circumstances in which they are used so there are no
standards for these measures other than sound engineering practice except for
the most common measure used in the City of Asheville, speed humps. “Standard
Details 3.28: 22’ Collector Street Speed Table” and “3.29: 14’ Collector Street
Speed Hump” illustrate speed table and hump design standards for two common
collector street widths.
6I   Retaining Wall Barriers
Barrier guards shall be located on any retaining wall that is more than 30
inches above grade. Guards for pedestrian protection shall be designed to
resist a load of 50 psi applied in any direction at the top and to transfer
this load through the supports to the structure. Guards for pedestrians shall
form a protective barrier not less than 42 inches high. Horizontal intermediate
rails or other construction shall not permit a sphere with a diameter of 21
inches to pass through any opening. This may be an integrated chain link fence
or other fence or cabling type application. Vehicle barriers in addition to the
pedestrian guards for parking lots shall be located on any retaining wall that
is more than 30 inches above the floor or grade below. Vehicle barrier systems
for passenger cars shall be designed to resist a single load of 6,000 pounds
applied horizontally as per the latest North Carolina State Building Code. This
may be a guard rail system or a combination of wheel stops, 18 – 24 inch
barriers, or bollards. Vehicle barrier systems are not required when the
parking spaces are 20 feet from the retaining wall or the spaces are parallel
to the retaining wall. Pedestrian guards are required for any retaining wall
meeting this section.
6J   Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) Strategies
6J.01   Purpose
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, or CPTED (pronounced sep-ted),
is a crime prevention philosophy based on the theory that proper design and
effective use of the built environment can lead to a reduction in the fear and
incidence of crime, as well as an improvement in the quality of life. The best
time to apply this philosophy is in the design phase, before a building or
neighborhood is built. It can also be successfully applied later, but
retrofitting an existing environment can sometimes be costly. The use of CPTED
will reduce crime and fear by reducing criminal opportunity and fostering
positive social interaction among legitimate users of space. The emphasis is on
crime prevention rather than apprehension and punishment.
6J.02   The Four Strategies of CPTED from the National Crime Prevention Council
6J.02a Natural Surveillance. A design concept directed primarily at keeping
intruders easily observable. Promoted by features that maximize visibility of
people, parking areas and building entrances: doors and windows that look out
on to streets and parking areas; pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and streets;
front porches; and adequate nighttime lighting.
6J.02b Territorial Reinforcement. Physical design can create or extend a sphere
of influence. Users then develop a sense of territorial control while potential
offenders, perceiving this control, are discouraged. Promoted by features that
define property lines and distinguish private spaces from public spaces using
landscape plantings, pavement designs, gateway treatments, and CPTED fences.
6J.02c Natural Access Control. A design concept directed primarily at
decreasing crime opportunity by denying access to crime targets and creating in
offenders a perception of risk. Natural access control is Gained by designing
streets, sidewalks, building entrances, and neighborhood gateways to clearly
indicate public routes and discouraging access to private areas with structural
elements.
6J.02d Target Hardening. Accomplished by features that prohibit entry or
access: window locks,
6J.03   Application
The CPTED information presented in this Manual is not intended to be
regulatory, but awareness-raising. During site and building design, a conscious
effort to apply the four strategies listed above will create opportunities for
safer design and crime reduction.
The Asheville Police Department is available to discuss CPTED design strategies
for any project.
6J.04   Examples of CPTED in Action
The illustration in “
Figure 6-3: Examples of CPTED” shows how limbing up trees in parking lots and
keeping shrubs to a certain height creates a “window” of visibility, allowing
natural surveillance to occur .
Also in “
Figure 6-1: Examples of CPTED”, the photographs present how parking garages can
be designed to provide natural surveillance, territorial reinforcement and
natural access control.

SECTION 7 - SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
7A   General
The City of Asheville is a delegated agency of the State to approve and
regulate best management practices for soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures within the City Limits in order to manage the adverse effects of
sedimentation and pollutants to adjacent properties and the area’s waterways by
a development’s stormwater run off.
Temporary and permanent erosion control measures shall be provided for all land
disturbing work in accordance with an erosion control plan approved by the City
of Asheville. A grading permit shall be obtained from the Development Services
Department prior to construction. Temporary measures shall be installed and
inspected by the City of Asheville for compliance prior to any land disturbing
activity. All permanent erosion control measures shall be incorporated into the
work at the earliest practical time. All temporary measures shall be maintained
until the permanent measures have taken effect. Temporary and permanent
measures shall be coordinated to provide effective and continuous erosion
control throughout the construction and post- construction period to prevent
offsite sedimentation. These measures shall remain in effect until final
approval is given by the City of Asheville.
7B   Temporary Erosion Control Measures
Examples of temporary erosion control measures include but are not limited to
the following:
7B.01a Silt Fence. Prior to construction beginning, silt fence must be
installed down slope of all disturbed areas and any other necessary locations
as directed by the Public Works Department. Silt fence shall be erected in
accordance with “Standard Detail 7.01: Standard Temporary Silt Fence”.
7B.01b Silt Fence Reinforced Stabilized Outlet. In locations where sediment
laden runoff may overtop a Standard Temporary Silt Fence and create further
erosion, incorporate a reinforced stabilized outlet into the silt fence in
accordance with "Standard Detail 7.01A: Silt Fence Reinforced Stabilized
Outlet".
7B.01c Construction Entrance. A construction entrance shall be installed at all
points of access to construction sites. Any access point which does not have a
construction entrance shall be barricaded to prevent its use. Construction
entrances shall be installed in accordance with “Standard Detail 7.02:
Residential Construction Entrance” or “7.03: Commercial Construction Entrance”.
The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of existing
sidewalks and streets impacted by construction activities.
7B.1d Sediment Basins. A sediment basin is an earthen embankment suitably
located to capture sediment. Unless the basin is designed to be converted to a
stormwater pond it shall have a lifespan of three years or less. Sediment
basins can be used for drainage areas up to 100 acres in size. Dewatering of
sediment basins shall be accomplished by either a skimmer, flashboard riser, or
other methods approved by the City of Asheville or NCDENR. Perforated
corrugated metal pipe risers shall not be accepted. The volume of a sediment
basin shall be determined on the basis of 1,800 cubic feet of basin volume per
acre of disturbed area. Do not locate sediment basins in intermittent or
perennial streams. Sediment basins shall be installed in accordance with
“Standard Detail 7.09: Skimmer Sediment Basin”.
7B.01e Sediment Traps. A sediment trap is a small temporary ponding basin
formed by an embankment or excavation to capture sediment. A sediment trap
shall be used two years or less and can be used for drainage areas up to five
(5) acres in size. Dewatering of sediment traps shall be accomplished by a
stone spillway. The volume of a sediment trap shall be determined on the basis
of 3,600 cubic feet of trap volume per acre of disturbed area or in accordance
with the most current version of the Erosion and Sediment Control Manual. Do
not locate sediment basins in intermittent or perennial streams. Sediment traps
shall be installed in accordance with “Standard Detail 7.08: Temporary Sediment
Trap”.
7B.01f Check Dam and Wattle. Check dams are small stone dams and wattles are
tubular shaped straw or coir (coconut fiber) filled fabric dams constructed
across a drainage way. Both practices may be used as a temporary measure to
limit erosion by reducing velocity in small open channels. When needed, they
can be used in channels, roadside ditches and temporary diversions. The
drainage area is limited to one half acre. Do not use check dams in
intermittent or perennial streams. Check dams and wattles shall be installed in
accordance with “Standard Details 7.06: Check Dam” and “7.05: Wattle Detail”.
7B.01g Inlet Protection. Inlet protection must be placed in accordance with the
“Standard Detail 7.11: Standard Catch Basin Inlet Protection” or “7.11A: Block
and Gravel Inlet Protection” at all structures.
7B.01h Temporary Seeding. Temporary seeding is the use of rapid growing annual
grasses, small grains, or legumes to provide initial, temporary ground cover
for erosion control on disturbed areas for less than 12 months. Seed bed
preparations and soil amendments shall be in accordance with the method
described under "Seeding and Mulching".
7B.01i Seeding and Mulching. Seeding and mulching shall be applied immediately
following the completion of any phase of grading. All disturbed areas shall be
dressed to a depth of five (5) inches. The top two (2) inches shall be
pulverized to provide a uniform seedbed. Agricultural lime shall be applied at
the rate of 95 lbs./1000 sq. ft. immediately before seed bed preparation. Grass
seed shall be applied at the rates outlined in “
Table 7-1: Seeding and Mulching”. 5-10-10 fertilizer shall be applied to all
disturbed areas at a rate of 21 lbs./1000 sq. ft. Mulching shall consist of
small grain straw applied at a rate of 70 lbs./1000 sq. ft. Mulched areas shall
be tacked with an approved method sufficient to hold the straw in place. Refer
to Chapter 3 of the North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural
Resources (NCDENR) Erosion and Sedimentation Control Planning and Design Manual
for more details concerning seeding and mulching procedures. If active
construction ceases in any area for more than 14 days, ground cover is required
to all disturbed as described in “Appendix C: Ground Cover”.

property owner and must be so noted on the final plat and the deed for the
affected lots. Open channels must be designed according to the latest version
of the NCDENR Erosion Manual.
8B.09a Manning Equation. Open channels must be designed to meet or exceeds its
hydraulic capacity by using the Manning Equation as follows:
A = Waterway cross sectional area of channel in square feet.   Q = Discharge in
cubic feet per second (cfs).
Q = AV = A  1.486  R2/3 S1/2
n
R = Hydraulic radius.   S = Slope.   n = Roughness coefficient. V = Velocity.
8B.09b Channel Cross Section and Grade. The channel grade shall be such that
the velocity in the channel is high enough to prevent siltation but low enough
to prevent erosion. Velocities less than 1.5 feet per second should be avoided
since siltation will take place and ultimately reduce the channel cross
section. The maximum permissible velocities in vegetation lined channels are
shown in “
Table 8-2: Maximum Allowable Design Velocities for Vegetative Channels”.
Developments through which the channel is to be constructed must be considered
in design of the channel section. Refer to “Table 8.05 in the NCDENR Erosion
Manual”.

* Permissible Velocity based on 10 year peak runoff
** Soil erodibility based on resistance to soil movement from concentrated
flowing water.
*** Before grass is established, permissible velocity is determined by the
type of temporary liner used.
 
8B.09c Side Slopes. Earthen channel side slopes must not exceed 2:1. Flatter
slopes may be required to prevent erosion and for ease of maintenance. Any side
slopes steeper than 2:1 The slope liner material must be engineered and
approved by the City Engineer or his/her designee.
8B.09d Disposition of Spoil. Disposition of spoil material resulting from
clearing, grubbing and channel excavation shall be disposed of in a properly
approved manner meeting the requirements of the NCDENR Erosion Manual.
8B.09e Construction and Materials. Construction Specifications shall be in
keeping with the following standard and shall describe the requirements for
proper installation. Materials acceptable for use as channel lining are:
•   Grass
•   Concrete
•   Rolled erosion control products
•   Other materials as approved by the City Engineer or his/her designee
8B.09f Easements. Where open improved drainage channels are used, adequate
widths for maintenance access is required. The minimum width of the easement
shall include the following:
•   Three feet measured from the top of the slope of the channel on one side.
•   Ten feet measured from the top of the slope of the channel on the opposite
side.
8C   Stormwater Management
8C.01   Stormwater Control Measures
Stormwater Control Measures (SCM) also referred to as stormwater Best
Management Practices (BMP) are stormwater management devices specifically
intended to reduce the peak runoff rate (“quantity control”) and remove
pollutants (“quality control”). They shall be designed and constructed as
described in this manual and in accordance with the latest design standards
established by the NCDENR Stormwater BMP Manual or, upon approval (currently
pending), by the Stormwater Minimum Design Criteria (MDC), or by other
superseding design Manuals.
8C.02   Design for Stormwater Quantity Control
8C.02a Design Storm. The system shall be designed to limit the two-year and
ten-year developed peak discharge rates to pre-developed peak discharge rates
using a duration of 24-hours with an NRCS Type II design storm. The system
shall be designed to pass the 50-year, 24-hour event (except in flood fringe
areas where the system must pass the 100-year, 24-hour event).
8C.02b Stage Discharge. For appropriate equations for outflow structures and
when each equation is the limiting factor see the North Carolina Erosion and
Sediment Control Planning and Design Manual.
8C.02c Storm Routing. Use NRCS TR-20 method of routing. The TR-55 routing
method may be used for preliminary design of smaller basins.
8C.03   Design for Stormwater Quality Control
The design of Stormwater quality control devices is based on retaining the
first (1)-inch of runoff from a storm for a sufficient period of time to settle
out suspended solids and attached pollutants (such as metals, organics, and
nutrients). Biological treatment also occurs. The first one (1) inch of
rainfall shall be detained in accordance with the design criteria of the storm
water control measure to be used. The first 1-inch of rainfall must be
calculated by the Simple Method or as allowed by the most current BMP manual.
In addition to this requirement the City requires 85% total suspended solids
(TSS) removal.
In addition to proper design, the BMPs must be routinely maintained to satisfy
long-term water quality goals. A key to any maintenance program is the
allocation of adequate funding and the designation of the responsible party. An
Operation and Maintenance agreement must be executed by the owner and the City
of Asheville and must be recorded with the Buncombe County Register of Deeds.
All associated fees are the responsibility of the property owner(s).
8C.04   Retention and Detention Basin Design
All stormwater devices shall be designed, sealed, and certified that they are
built as designed by a N.C. registered professional engineer or landscape
architect. Retention and detention facilities shall be designed in accordance
with the latest BMP manual. In addition, the following guidelines shall be
followed:
•   The City shall receive, for all stormwater impoundments, design
calculations including, but not limited to, hydrographs, routing and outlet
sizing.
•   Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3:1 and no flatter than 10:1.
•   Outlet control structure shall be concrete, and the riser shall be located
in or near the embankment.
•   The outlet control structure shall be covered with a trash rack to prevent
clogging.
•   Where applicable, a maintenance access shall be provided via a minimum 10
foot wide road in a minimum 20 foot wide maintenance access easement or public
right of way and shall be free of trees. The road shall be adequate to
withstand heavy equipment. The access road shall not cross the emergency
spillway, and shall have a maximum slope of 5:1.
•   Where applicable, the design shall include a minimum 20 foot maintenance
easement around the perimeter of the basin and dam structure.
•   Sediment from clean out shall be disposed of at an approved location.
•   The outlet channel shall be protected by an appropriately designed velocity
dissipater. Outlet channels between the basin outlet and the discharge stream
shall be designed to prevent erosion, siltation and standing water.
•   The embankment shall allow for a minimum one (1) foot freeboard.
•   Anti-seep collars may be required around the barrel and a core trench shall
be installed under the embankment to key it to the substrate.
•   Retention facilities may be used as erosion control devices during
construction upon approval by the City Engineer or his/her designee.
•   Access to the basin can be prevented by a six foot high chain link fence
with a locked entrance gate. Gate is to be wide enough to allow mowing and
maintenance equipment to enter the site. A minimum distance of 25 feet between
the pond edge and fence is needed to permit future de-silting operations.
However, one objective of detention basin design could be to eliminate the need
to fence the final facility. Fencing limits any multiple use and aesthetic
value the detention basin may have had. The key to not fencing detention
facilities is the design of specific safety measures to make basins reasonably
safe under the full range of storm water conditions it is likely to encounter.
A safety ledge and a flat shore line (4:1) are recommended as a minimum in
addition to a maximum depth in the basin of 4 feet in order to not provide a
fence around the detention basin.
•   Vegetation and stabilization of Stormwater management facilities shall be
in accordance with the NCDENR BMP Manual.
•   The outlet control must be capable of handling the 50-year discharge.
•   The control structure release rate shall be based upon the pre-development
peak runoff rates for the two (2) year and 10 year storms.
•   If the basin is used as a sediment trap during construction, make sure all
sediment deposited during construction is removed before normal operation
begins.
•   Facilities that use or produce oil or grease may be required to install an
oil and grease separator and connect to the sanitary sewer system.
•   For wet basins, an emergency drain (with a pipe sized to drain the pond in
less than 24 hours) shall be installed in all ponds to allow access for riser
repairs and sediment removal.
8C.06   Dry Detention Basin Design
•   A grassed or concrete lined low flow channel is to be constructed across
the basin from the inlet to the outlet structure so that the basin contains no
standing water five days after the end of a storm.
•   Each inlet must be protected to prevent soil erosion from forming a pocket.
•   The entire basin is to be sloped towards the outlet and towards the low
flow channel. On a grassed floor a 1.5 to 2.0 percent slope is needed.
•   A grassed floor must be on soil firm enough to support the weight of mowing
equipment.
•   The outlet control must be capable of handling the 50-year discharge.
•   Stormwater shall be routed via grassed waterways or pipes to the upper part
of the basin to reduce short circuiting and obtain maximum detention time and
settling.
•   An emergency spillway shall be provided to route storms at or above the 50
year storm event.
8C.06a Dam Safety Act. Any dam or impoundments that meets or exceeds the
requirements of DENR shall contact or as described by NCDENR, Dam Safety
Section of Land Resources (828-296-4500) who will review and approve any
impoundments. Please provide the City of Asheville with a copy of the necessary
permits.
8C.07   Underground Storage
If surface basins are not feasible, underground storage may be necessary.
Underground storage can be accomplished by installation of a storage facility
under a parking or vegetated area. The underground storage facility shall be
required to have appropriate access to allow for its maintenance. The storage
facility shall also be required to have all joints properly sealed to prevent
undermining of the structures.
When storage is used within a pipe system all pipes shall have sealed joints.
The use of o-rings on reinforced concrete pipe or neoprene gaskets for coupling
on fully coated corrugated metal pipe is necessary. The minimum slope on any
underground storage structure is 0.5%. Slopes less than 0.5% will only be
allowed on a case by case basis with supporting documentation.
8C.08   Proprietary Quality Control Devices
Proprietary Devices will be reviewed on an individual basis for compliance with
the quality control standards and approved by the City Engineer or his/her
designee.
8C.09   Pervious Pavements
All persons building within the jurisdiction of the City of Asheville are
encouraged to use pervious pavements in areas that either provide sufficient
percolation of surface water or have an approved detailed design to account for
drainage from the site. The use of pervious pavements allows a lower curve
number in the design for stormwater calculations. Pervious pavements in
conjunction with underground storage may be used to meet part of the
requirements for stormwater quantity. Consideration for stormwater quality
improvements may be given. Detailed engineering analysis must be provided and
approved to obtain this credit for stormwater management.
These will be reviewed on a case by case basis and approved by the City
Engineer or his/her designee. A pervious pavement design will require a
maintenance plan if utilized as part of the stormwater management plan.
8C.10   Environmental Systems and Low Impact Devices
Bio-retention basins, wetlands, other environmental systems and devices
incorporating low impact design (LID) principles are encouraged to be used and
shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the latest BMP manual or
MDCs.
8C.11   Cisterns
Cisterns may be used as part of a detailed stormwater quantity design provided
that the cisterns are designed to meet the City of Asheville standards for
stormwater quantity including draw down time.
8B.11a Annual Inspections. Annual inspections of the operation and maintenance
of stormwater BMPs shall be performed as outlined in the City of Asheville
Ordinance Sections pertaining to Operation and Maintenance.
8D   Formal Plan Submittal Requirements
See “Appendix D: Requirements for Formal Grading, Erosion Control, and
Stormwater Plans.
8E   Final Project Closeout Submittals and As-built Record Drawing

9C.01   Temporary Ground Cover
Temporary ground cover* consist of vegetation, seeding with straw, mulches**,
stone rocking or rip-rap, and erosion control nettings and matting (highly
recommended for slopes 2:1 and greater)
9C.02   Permanent Ground Cover
Permanent ground cover* consist of vegetation (Must Cover 80% of disturbed area
with no contiguous bare areas greater than 1 sq. yd), Trees, shrubs and vines
(allowed in landscape areas or wooded settings), mulches or rocking (allowed
only in permanent landscape areas).
* Please note that ground cover, especially temporary ground cover, requires
maintenance. If ground cover is not properly maintained, your site will be in
violation of the City of Asheville Erosion Control Ordinance.
** Mulch is a temporary ground cover intended to provide temporary erosion
prevention and promote growth of vegetation. Mulch may only be used as a
permanent ground cover in the beds of installed landscaping with an
accompanying landscaping plan and for land disturbance activities that are
exempt from provisions of the erosion prevention and sediment control
regulations as specified in the Unified Development Ordinance.
9C.03   Ground Cover in Stream Buffers
All areas disturbed within the vegetated buffer of intermittent and perineal
streams shall receive permanent ground cover as specified herein.
9C.04   Soil Stabilization
Soil stabilization shall be achieved on any area of a site where land-
disturbing activities have temporarily or permanently ceased according to the
following schedule:
•   All perimeter dikes, swales, ditches, perimeter slopes and all slopes
steeper than 3:1 shall be provided temporary or permanent stabilization with
ground cover as soon as practicable but in any event within 7 calendar days
from the last land-disturbing activity.
•   All other disturbed areas shall be provided temporary or permanent
stabilization with ground cover as soon as practicable but in any event within
14 calendar days from the last land-disturbing activity.
9C.05   Conditions
In meeting the stabilization requirements above, the following conditions or
exemptions shall apply:
•   Extensions of time may be approved by the permitting authority based on
weather or other site-specific conditions that make compliance impracticable.
•   All slopes 50’ in length or greater shall apply the ground cover within 7
days except when the slope is flatter than 4:1.
•   Slopes less than 50’ shall apply ground cover within 14 days except when
slopes are steeper than 3:1, the 7 day requirement applies.
•   Any sloped area flatter than 4:1 shall be exempt from the 7 day ground
cover requirement.
•   Although stabilization is usually specified as ground cover, other methods,
such as chemical stabilization, may be allowed on a case by case basis.
•   For portions of projects within the Sediment Control Commission-defined
“High Quality Water Zone” (15A NCAC 04A. 0105), stabilization with ground cover
shall be achieved as soon as practicable but in any event on all areas of the
site within 7 calendar days from the last land-disturbing act.
•   Portions of a site that are lower in elevation than adjacent discharge
locations are not expected to discharge during construction may be exempt from
the temporary ground cover requirements if identified on the approved Erosion &
Sediment Control Plan or added by the permitting authority.

24-hour SCS Type II design storm and pass the 50-year, 24-hr event storm.
Stormwater quality control systems shall control and treat the runoff leaving
the site from the first inch of rain (determined using Simple Method). The
volume of runoff from retention and detention systems shall be detained between
48 and 120 hours. The volume
of runoff from bio-retention basins shall drain into the soil and result in no
water ponding within 24 hours. All structural stormwater treatment systems
shall be designed to have a minimum of 85% average annual removal for Total
Suspended Solids.
For basins and control structures: pre and post development runoff, storage
volume, inflow and out flow calculations shall be submitted.
Also, provide a maintenance schedule with the calculations. Calculations shall
bare design professional seal and signature.
Development or redevelopment required to comply with the provisions for post-
construction stormwater control, a contract is required
between the person financially responsible and a licensed professional for post
construction stormwater control compliance checks.
Note: A pre-construction meeting will be required for all projects with storm
drainage systems or stormwater management systems.
Cut sheets for all structures must be submitted prior to the pre-construction
meeting.

drainage structures, stormwater BMPs, facilities, and related improvements
shall be clearly labeled on the drawing, adjacent to the feature to which they
correspond OR the labels may be configured using a cross- referenced table
system that utilizes unique identifiers.
•   All pipes and like conveyances shall be represented on the drawing and
associated with text or labels indicating slope, distance, diameter (or
dimensions), material type, inverts (in & out), and dissipation pad sizes. Text
and labels should be clearly legible and placed next to the features to which
they correspond OR they may be configured using a cross-referenced labeling and
table system that utilizes unique identifiers.
•   All above-ground detention or retention facilities, BMPs, or similar
facilities shall be represented on the drawing using 1’ contours enclosed by
outer breakline(s). Labels or text indicating the maximum storage volume (for a
50-year storm event) and associated elevation should be placed inside the
feature or adjacent to the feature with which it corresponds. Perimeter fencing
associated with storage facilities must be represented on the drawing per as-
built conditions. A field surveyed as-built detail of any outlet control
structures or associated features must be included.
•   All accessible structures and conveyances associated with underground
storage systems shall be represented within the drawing. Labels or text
indicating the maximum storage volume (for a 50- year storm event) and
associated elevation should be placed inside the feature or adjacent to the
feature with which it corresponds. A field surveyed as-built detail of any
outlet control structures or associated features must be included.
•   The outline of the 100-Year (1% annual chance) floodplain boundary and any
associated floodway or non-encroachment areas shall be represented on the
drawing per the approved site plans.

SECTION 11 - SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES
11A   Background and Purpose
11A.01   Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish guidelines for installing small
cell equipment and poles in the City of Asheville’s (COA) right of way.
These Small Cell Design Guidelines provide aesthetic requirements and
specifications that all small cell towers installed within public rights-of-way
(ROW) must meet prior to installation in the City of Asheville (COA). Small
cells not installed within the public ROW are not bound to the requirements of
this guide; although, the public ROW small cell guidelines may inform these
installations.
Network Providers shall consider the aesthetics of the existing streetlights
and neighborhoods adjacent to proposed small cell locations prior to submitting
an application to COA. New small cells shall match the existing streetlight
aesthetics when installed in a Historic District or neighborhood with unique
streetlight assemblies. Unique assemblies may include mast arms, decorative
pole bases, architectural luminaires, mounting heights, pole colors, etc. that
deviate from these guidelines. An example of a unique streetlight can be found
in
Figure 11-1. Per sections
1A.10 and
1A.11 of this manual, the COA must approve all small cell installations that
deviate from these guidelines prior to installation.

11A.02   Permitted Installations
Four different types of small cell installations are permitted within COA.
These types include attachments to utility poles and utility lines, attachments
to wooden utility poles, removal and replacement of existing streetlights, and
new freestanding installations. An overview of each type is shown in Sections
11A.02a through 11A.02d.
11A.02a Type 1 - Attachments to Utility Poles
The Attachments to Utility Poles section establishes the specification
requirements and design guidelines for small cell equipment that will be

11A.02c Type 3 - Combination Small Cell and Streetlight
The Combination Small Cell and Streetlight Assembly section establishes
requirements when removing existing metal streetlight poles in the public ROW
and replacing with combination small cell and streetlight poles. Three
variations of the combination pole are shown in
Figure 11-5 through
Figure 11-7. Only one carrier may be installed per pole.
Small Cell Type 3A, shown in
Figure 11-5, in intended for a single carrier installation. This pole type
includes a cantenna and no externally mounted equipment.

IMAGES/0-0-0-903.png]
 
A Type 3B combination pole with a single external shroud mounted to the pole
will be allowed in place of a cantenna. The shroud shall be strapped to the
pole in such a way that the wiring, cables, and equipment is be hidden from
view. The shroud shall be colored to match the pole.

A Type 3C combination pole with both a cantenna and a single shroud mounted to
the pole is allowed when various small cell technologies (ie: LTE and 5G)
provided by a single carrier are installed on the same pole. The shroud shall
be strapped to the pole in such a way that the wiring, cables, and equipment is
be hidden from view. The cantenna and shroud shall be colored to match the
pole.

11B   Attachments to Utility Poles and Utility Lines
11B.01   Purpose
This section of the Guide is to be used when locating small cell attachments on
existing utility poles or utility lines. Refer to
section 3 for projects involving existing wooden streetlight small cell
attachments.
11B.02   General Guidance
All attachments to utility poles shall be approved by COA and the property
owner prior to installation. All equipment shall meet applicable utility
requirements and the COA’s permitting.
All small cell carrier equipment shall be shrouded. Only two enclosures
including the disconnect and antenna shall be installed at each utility pole
location. No ground mounted enclosures, including backup power supply, shall be
allowed. All equipment located within the public ROW shall be located such that
it meets applicable accessibility requirements and does not obstruct, impede,
or hinder usual pedestrian or vehicular travel. In addition, all installations
that include a disturbance within the right-of-way, shall be required a “Right-
of-way disturbance permit”. This permit may be applied for through the city’s
Department of Public Works in conjunction with the small cell wireless permit.
All carrier equipment shall be removed and relocated at no cost to COA if COA
or the utility owner decides to underground the utility lines in the future.
The equipment must be removed within a reasonable time frame determined by the
utility. A reasonable time frame refers to a period of time that does not delay
the removal of the utility poles and lines.
No strand-mounted small cell devices shall be installed on poles with mounted
streetlights. Deviations from this guide shall be approved on a case-by-case
basis by COA prior to installation

11D   Combination Small Cell and Streetlight
11D.01   Purpose
This section of the Guide is to be used when replacing an existing streetlight
pole with a combination small cell and streetlight pole. Combination small cell
and streetlight poles are often referred to as “combination poles”, “Type 3
poles, or “removed and replaced poles” in this Guide. Refer to
section 5 for projects involving freestanding small cell installations.
A Type 3 combination small cell and streetlight pole should only be located
where an existing streetlight pole can be removed and replaced, or at a new
location where it has been identified that a streetlight is necessary. Existing
streetlights are typically owned by Duke Energy; Duke Energy owned Type 3
combination poles that replace existing streetlights shall meet Duke Energy
standards. Privately-owned Type 3 combination poles shall be approved via COA’s
encroachment permit.
11D.02   General Guidance
Combination small cell and streetlight permitting applications and aesthetics
shall be approved by COA prior to installation. All equipment shall meet Duke
Energy’s utility requirements and COA’s design aesthetics. The same small cell
pole aesthetic is to be used in the same area to maintain a cohesive
appearance. Combination small cell aesthetics and proposed locations shall meet
the City of Asheville’s Standards and Specifications Manual. The lighting
design shall follow the luminaire specifications and design requirements set
forth in the City of Asheville Street Lighting Standards.
The City of Asheville’s Street Lighting Standards provide guidance on luminaire
design aesthetics, lighting level criteria, typical streetlight spacing,
streetlight specifications, and electrical and streetlight details. The network
provider shall provide all documentation required by the Street Lighting
Standards to the City during the permitting process.
All small cell carrier equipment shall be housed internal to the pole or hidden
behind an exterior shroud. No network provider equipment shall be mounted to
the exterior of the pole unless it meets the Type 3B and Type 3C requirements
in Section 4.3. Deviations from this guide shall be approved on a case-by-case
basis by COA prior to installation.
11D.03   Basis of Design
The following pages describe the small cell requirements for installation in
the City of Asheville’s public right of way.
The combination pole design shall match the aesthetics of existing streetlights
installed adjacent to the pole. The Carrier shall perform a visual inspection
(Online street images are considered sufficient unless the pole standards were
updated after the images were published) prior to submitting a permitting
application to determine existing aesthetics.
The combination pole components include the foundation, equipment cabinet,
upper pole, luminaire, mast arm, luminaire control node if applicable, cantenna
or antenna enclosure, and all hardware and electrical equipment necessary for a
complete assembly.
The small cell components shall also be sized to be visually pleasing. For a
combination pole to be considered visually pleasing, the transition between the
equipment cabinet and upper pole should be considered. A decorative transition
shall be installed over the equipment cabinet upper bolts, or decorative base
cover shall be installed to match the equipment cabinet size. The upper pole
shall be scaled to 0.5 to 0.75 the size of the equipment cabinet, with a 10-
inch minimum outer diameter. All hardware connections shall be hidden from
view. No horizontal flat spaces greater than 1.5 inches shall exist on the
equipment cabinet to prevent cups, trash, and other objects from being placed
on the equipment cabinet. Each pole component shall be architecturally
compatible to create a cohesive aesthetic. An example of an unacceptable small
cell installation, and acceptable installation can be found in Figures
11-15 and
11-16.
Three variations of combination small cell equipment attachments will be
considered for installation in the City of Asheville. These equipment
attachments include a single cantenna, a single equipment shroud, or cantenna a
single exterior equipment shroud when multiple cellular technologies provided
by a single carrier are installed on a single pole (ie: LTE and 5G). Each type
can be found in Figures
11-17 through
11-19.

11D.03b Type 3B Combination Pole
The Type 3B combination pole is composed of an equipment cabinet, upper pole,
streetlight, and externally mounted equipment shroud. All equipment shall be
located internal, shrouded, or recessed per Duke Energy’s requirements, to the
appropriate housing. The antenna, radio head, mounting brackets, and all
hardware necessary for a complete installation shall be located inside an
aesthetically pleasing equipment shroud, securely strapped to the pole.
Wires and cabling shall be hidden from view. Cables and wires shall internal to
the pole until it reaches a cable grommet. Weatherproof grommets shall be
installed at all cable entry points. All pole openings shall be weatherproofed
to prevent interior rusting of the pole.

11D.03c Type 3C Combination Pole
The Type 3C combination pole will be allowed when multiple technologies (e.g
LTE & 5G) offered by the same carrier are installed on a single pole. To
qualify for this permit, the Network Provider must demonstrate that the
additional technology cannot be integrated into the equipment cabinet or the
cantenna. This Type 3C pole is composed of a single equipment cabinet, upper
pole, streetlight, cantenna, and a single externally mounted equipment shroud.
The additional equipment shroud shall match the combination pole aesthetics.
Care should be taken to integrate the mounting attachments into the enclosure
design. The enclosure shall be securely strapped to the pole.
A combination small cell and streetlight specification overview is found in
Section 4.4.

section 4 for projects involving combination small cell installations.
11E.02   General Guidance
The specifications provided in this section are for single carrier with single
technology installations within the public ROW only. Dual carrier, dual
technology installations, or small cell locations not in the public ROW may
vary from these guidelines with COA approval.
All freestanding small cell permitting applications shall be approved by COA
prior to installation. All equipment shall meet the utility’s requirements and
the City of Asheville’s design aesthetics.
The same small cell pole aesthetic is to be used along adjacent blocks to
maintain a cohesive appearance. Freestanding small cell aesthetics and proposed
locations shall meet the City of Asheville’s Standards and Specifications
Manual.
All small cell carrier equipment shall be housed internal to the equipment
cabinet or hidden behind the cantenna. No network provider equipment shall be
strapped to the outside of the pole. If a dual-carrier pole is approved by the
COA, all the network provider equipment shall be located internal to the pole

11E.03   Basis for Design
The following pages describe the small cell requirements for installation in
the City of Asheville’s public right of way.
The pole design shall match the aesthetics of existing streetlights installed
adjacent to the pole. The Carrier shall perform a visual inspection (Online
street images are considered sufficient unless the pole standards were updated
after the images were published) prior to submitting a permitting application
to determine existing aesthetics.
The small cell components shall be sized to be visually pleasing. For a pole to
be considered visually pleasing, the transition between the equipment cabinet
and upper pole should be considered. A decorative transition shall be installed
over the equipment cabinet upper bolts, or decorative base cover shall be
installed to match the equipment cabinet size. The upper pole shall be scaled
to 0.5 to
0.75 the size of the equipment cabinet, with a 10-inch minimum outer diameter.
All hardware connections shall be hidden from view. No horizontal flat spaces
greater than 1.5 inches shall exist on the equipment cabinet to prevent cups,
trash, and other objects from being placed on the equipment cabinet. Each pole
component shall be architecturally compatible to create a cohesive aesthetic.
An example of an unacceptable small cell installation, and acceptable
installation can be found in Figures
11-25 and
11-26.
