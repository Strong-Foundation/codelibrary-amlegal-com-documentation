CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL
§ 50.02 CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL.
   (A) The purpose of this cross connection control subchapter is to define the
authority of the South Camden Water and Sewer District as the water purveyor in
the elimination of all cross connections within its public potable water
supply.
   (B)   This subchapter shall apply to all users connected to the South Camden
Water and Sewer District's public potable water supply regardless of whether
the user is located within the county limits or outside of the county limits.
   (C)   This subchapter will comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act
(PL 93-523), the North Carolina State Administrative Code (15A NCAC 08C), and
the North Carolina State Building Code (Volume II) as they pertain to cross
connections with the public water supply.
(Ord. 2011-03-02, passed 4-4-11)
§ 50.03 OBJECTIVES.
   The specific objectives of this cross connection control subchapter for the
South Camden Water and Sewer District are as follows:
   (A)   To protect the public potable water supply of the county against
actual or potential contamination by isolating within the consumer's water
system contaminants or pollutants which could, under adverse conditions,
backflow through uncontrolled cross connections into the public water system.
   (B)   To eliminate or control existing cross connections, actual or
potential, between the consumer's potable water system and nonpotable or
industrial piping system.
   (C)   To provide a continuing inspection program of cross connection control
which will systematically and effectively control all actual or potential cross
connections which may now exist or be installed in the future.
(Ord. 2011-03-02, passed 4-4-11)
§ 50.04 RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   Health agency. The State Department of Environment and Natural
Resources has the responsibility for promulgating and enforcing laws, rules,
regulations, and policies to be followed in carrying out an effective cross
connection control program. The State Department of Environment and Natural
Resources also has the primary responsibility of insuring that the water
purveyor operates the public potable water system free of actual or potential
sanitary hazards, including unprotected cross connections. The State Department
of Environment and Natural Resources has the further responsibility of insuring
that the water purveyor provides an approved water supply at the service
connection to the consumer's water system and, further, that he requires the
installation, testing, and maintenance of an approved backflow prevention
assembly on the service connection when required.
   (B)   Water purveyor. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, the
water purveyor's (South Camden Water and Sewer District's) responsibility to
ensure a safe water supply begins at the source and includes all of the public
water distribution system, including the service connection, and ends at the
point of delivery to the consumer's water system. In addition, the water
purveyor shall exercise reasonable vigilance to insure that the consumer has
taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water system. To insure
that the proper precautions are taken, the South Camden Water and Sewer
District is required to determine the degree of hazard or potential hazard to
the public potable water system; to determine the degree of protection
required; and to ensure proper containment protection through an on-going
inspection program. When it is determined that a backflow prevention assembly
is required for the protection of the public system, the South Camden Water and
Sewer District shall require the consumer, at the consumer's expense, to
install an approved backflow prevention assembly at each service connection, to
test immediately upon installation and thereafter annually, to properly repair
and maintain such assembly or assemblies, and to keep adequate records of each
test and subsequent maintenance and repair, including materials and/or
replacement parts.
   (C)   Plumbing inspection. The Inspection Department of the county has the
responsibility to not only review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is
installed; but, they have the explicit responsibility of preventing cross
connections from being designed and built into the plumbing system within its
jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests or detects the
potential for cross connections being made an integral part of the plumbing
system, the Plumbing Inspector has the responsibility, under the State Building
Code, for requiring that such cross connections be either eliminated or
provided with backflow prevention equipment approved by the State Building
Code. The Plumbing Inspector's responsibility begins at the point of delivery,
downstream of the first installed backflow prevention assembly, and continues
throughout the entire length of the consumer's water system. The Plan Inspector
should inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is
suspected that a cross connection might be made or where one is actually called
for by the plans. When such is discovered it shall be mandatory that a
suitable, approved backflow prevention assembly approved by the State Building
Code be required by the plans and be properly installed. The primary protection
assembly for containment purposes only shall have approval from the South
Camden Water and Sewer District, the State Building Code, and the State
Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
   (D)   Consumer. The consumer has the primary responsibility of preventing
pollutants and contaminants from entering his or her potable water system or
the public potable water system. The consumer's responsibility starts at the
point of delivery from the public potable water system and includes all of his
or her water system. The consumer, at his or her own expense, shall install,
operate, test, and maintain approved backflow prevention assemblies as directed
by the South Camden Water and Sewer District. The consumer shall maintain
accurate records of tests and repairs made to backflow prevention assemblies
and shall maintain such records for a minimum period of three years. The
records shall be on forms approved by the South Camden Water and Sewer District
and shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used. Following
any repair, overhaul, repiping or relocation of an assembly, the consumer shall
have it tested to insure that it is in good operating condition and will
prevent backflow. Tests, maintenance and repairs of backflow prevention
assemblies shall be made by personnel certified as backflow prevention assembly
testers.
   (E)   Certified backflow prevention assembly testers. When employed by the
consumer to test, repair, overhaul, or maintain backflow prevention assemblies,
a backflow prevention assembly tester will have the following responsibilities.
The tester will be responsible for making competent inspections and for
repairing or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies and making reports of
such repair to the consumer and responsible authorities on forms approved by
the South Camden Water and Sewer District. The tester shall include the list of
materials or replacement parts used. The tester shall be equipped with and be
competent to use all the necessary tools, gauges, manometers and other
equipment necessary to properly test, repair, and maintain backflow prevention
assemblies. It will be the tester's responsibility to insure that original
manufactured parts are used in the repair of or replacement of parts in a
backflow prevention assembly. It will be the tester's further responsibility
not to change the design, material or operational characteristics of an
assembly during repair or maintenance without prior approval of the South
Camden Water and Sewer District. A certified tester shall perform the work and
be responsible for the competency and accuracy of all tests and reports. A
certified tester shall provide a copy of all test and repair reports to the
consumer and to the South Camden Water and Sewer District's Cross Connection
Control Section within ten business days of any completed test or repair work.
A certified tester shall maintain such records for a minimum period of three
years. All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must obtain and
employ backflow prevention assembly test equipment which has been evaluated
and/or approved by the South Camden Water and Sewer District. All test
equipment shall be registered with the South Camden Water and Sewer District
cross connection control section. All test equipment shall be checked for
accuracy annually, at a minimum, calibrated, if necessary, and certified to the
South Camden Water and Sewer District as to such calibration, employing an
accuracy/calibration method acceptable to the South Camden Water and Sewer
District. All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must become re-
certified every two years through an approved backflow prevention certification
program.

   ISOLATION. The act of confining a localized hazard within a consumer's water
system by installing approved backflow prevention assemblies. Disclaimer: South
Camden Water and Sewer District may make recommendations, upon facility
inspection, as to the usages of isolation devices/assemblies, but does not
assume or have responsibility whatsoever for such installations.
   POINT OF DELIVERY. The property line of the customer, adjacent to the public
street where the South Camden Water and Sewer District's mains are located, or
at a point on the customer's property where the meter is located. The customer
shall be responsible for all water piping and control devices located on the
customer's side of the point of delivery.
   POLLUTION. An impairment of the quality of the water to a degree which does
not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and
unreasonably affect the aesthetic qualities of such waters for domestic use.
   POTABLE WATER. Water from any source which has been investigated by the
State Department of Environment and Natural Resources and which has been
approved for human consumption.
   PUBLIC POTABLE WATER SYSTEM.  Any publicly or privately owned water system
operated as a public utility, under a current State Department of Environment
and Natural Resources permit, to  supply water for public consumption or use.
This system will include all sources, facilities, and appurtenances between the
source and the point of delivery such as valves, pumps, pipes, conduits, tanks,
receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey,
treat, or store a potable water for public consumption or use.
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An assembly
containing within its structure a minimum of two independently acting, approved
check valves, together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically
independent, pressure differential relief valve located between the check
valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The first check valve
reduces the supply pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal flow
and at cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the checks is less than
the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the pressure
differential relief valve, by discharge to atmosphere, shall operate to
maintain the pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure. The
unit shall include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the
assembly and each assembly shall be fitted with properly located test cocks.
The assembly is designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e.,
contaminant).
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE DETECTOR ASSEMBLY. A specially designed assembly
composed of a line-size approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly with a specific bypass water meter and a meter-sized approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. The meter shall register, in
U.S. gallons, accurately for only very low rates of flow and shall show a
registration for all rates of flow. This assembly shall be used to protect
against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant).
   SERVICE CONNECTIONS. The terminal end of a service connection from the
public potable water system, i.e., where the South Camden Water and Sewer
District loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of
delivery to the consumer's water system.
   VACUUM BREAKER - ATMOSPHERIC TYPE. The term ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER, also
known as the NONPRESSURE TYPE VACUUM BREAKER, means a device containing a
float-check, a check seat, and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the
body causes the float to close the air inlet port. When the flow of water
stops, the float falls and forms a check valve against back-siphonage and at
the same time opens the air inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy the
vacuum. A shutoff valve immediately upstream may be an integral part of the
device. An ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER is designed to protect against a
nonhealth hazard, isolation protection only, under a backsiphonage condition
only.
   VACUUM BREAKER - PRESSURE TYPE. The term PRESSURE VACUUM BREAKER means an
assembly containing an independently operating internally loaded check valve
and an independently operating loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge
side of the check valve. The assembly is to be equipped with properly located
test cocks and tightly closing shutoff valves attached at each end of the
assembly. This assembly is designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e.,
contaminant) under a back-siphonage condition only.
   WATER PURVEYOR. The owner or operator of a public potable water system,
providing an approved water supply to the public.
   WATER SUPPLY - APPROVED. Any public potable water supply which has been
investigated and approved by the State Department of Environment and Natural
Resources. The system must be operating under a valid health permit. In
determining what constitutes an approved water supply, the state department of
environment and natural resources has reserved the final judgment as to its
safety and potability.
   WATER SUPPLY - AUXILIARY. Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary
waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or
any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream, etc., used water, or
industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted, contaminated, or objectionable
and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does
not have sanitary control.
   WATER SUPPLY - UNAPPROVED. A water supply which has not been approved for
human consumption by the State Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
   WATER - USED. Any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public water
system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of
delivery and is no longer under the control of the water purveyor.

GENERAL
§ 52.001 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system(s) for a water
and sewer district established by or for the County of Camden, pursuant to G.S.
Chapter 162A, Article 6, and upon adoption of such ordinance as defined herein,
shall henceforth be mutually referred to as the District in this chapter, and
enables the District to comply with all applicable state and federal laws,
including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code § 1251 et seq.) and the
General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR, Part 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   The United States Government has established goals for clean public
waters in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, through
congressional adoption of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972, and the Clean Water Act of 1977;
      (2)   These acts are being implemented and enforced by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the North Carolina Division of Water
Quality (DWQ) and Division of Environmental Health (DEH), or equivalents,
through various means;
      (3)   The Board of the South Camden Water and Sewer District (SCWSD)
desires to promote and enforce applicable standards established by the EPA and/
or DWQ related to wastewater collection, and the Board desires to comply fully
with conditions of the Water Pollution Control Act, and all revisions and
amendments thereof;
      (4)   The Board desires to protect from damage the public water supply
and the wastewater collection system and facilities and desires to maintain the
safety of the public and the safety of district employees assigned to operate
and maintain the system;
      (5)   It is known to the Board through experience in the District
operation of its system, and/or from publicly available conclusions from
scientific research, that wastewater is generated from some non-domestic
processes that can be discharged into the District’s wastewater system, and if
discharged in sufficient quantity or concentration could create a fire or
explosion hazard in the wastewater system; inhibit or interfere with biological
or chemical processes of the treatment, or cause damage, corrosion or
destruction in the collection system; or be incompatible and untreatable at the
treatment plant; and it is known that any of these conditions may possibly
result in the endangerment of public health and safety and/or a violation by
the district of one or more conditions of the NPDES permit.
      (6)   Pursuant to authority granted by G.S. 153A-121 et seq. and 153A-274
et seq., the Board desires to protect and regulate the operation of its sewage
collection and disposal system and achieve the objectives of this chapter by
adopting adequate and reasonable rules and regulations;
      (7)   The Board or its agent shall control the sewer system of the
District and shall prescribe and enforce full compliance with all rules and
regulations governing connections with the system. The District shall own,
construct, provide for financing, operate and maintain the system;
      (8)   This section shall apply to all unincorporated areas of the
district and within municipalities, by contract or agreement with the District,
are users of the District sewer system;
      (9)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the District
wastewater collection and/or treatment system which will interfere with the
operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (10)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the District
wastewater system that will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into
any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (11)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludges from the District system;
      (12)   To protect both District personnel who may be affected by sewage,
sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting
the general public;
      (13)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance and improvement of the District wastewater system; and
      (14)   To ensure that the District complies with its NPDES and/or non-
discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other
state or federal laws to which the District wastewater system is subject to for
compliance.
      (15)   To prevent sanitary sewer blockages and overflow from contribution
and accumulation of fats, oils, and grease into the District’s wastewater
system from industrial or commercial establishments, particularly food
preparation and serving facilities.
      (16)   To provide specific standards for oil and grease interceptor's
location, type, size, installation, construction and maintenance.
      (17)   To abide by all the conditions set forth in the Department of
Environmental and Natural Resources (Division of Water Quality) permit for the
collection system.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the District wastewater system, through the issuance of permits
to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements
for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires
user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the District wastewater
system, as so authorized by G.S. § 153A-275 and/or § 160A-312. Except as
otherwise provided herein, the Board, shall administer, implement, and enforce
the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted to or imposed upon the Board
may be delegated by the Board to other District personnel. By discharging
wastewater into the District wastewater system, users located outside the
District’s jurisdiction agree to comply with the terms and conditions
established in this chapter, as well as any permits, enforcement actions, or
orders issued hereunder.

§ 52.003 ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY.
   The Board is assigned the responsibility of administering all provisions of
this chapter as related to construction of new utility infrastructure and shall
exercise these responsibilities in accordance with the purpose and intent of
this chapter in a fair and objective manner. The Board is assigned the
responsibility of administering all provisions of this chapter as related to
the operation and maintenance of the District’s utility systems and shall
exercise these responsibilities in accordance with the purpose and intent of
this chapter in a fair and objective manner. Both may exercise discretion when
necessary to administer the provisions of this chapter fairly and responsibly.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.004 INTENT OF REGULATION OF SEWER USE.
   (A)   It is intended that this chapter include provisions for prohibiting
the discharge by any wastewater customer into a public sanitary sewer of
substances that may endanger the public health and safety or of unpolluted
waters that do not require treatment and therefore reduce the effectiveness of
the biological operations of the treatment facilities.
   (B)   It is further understood that the biological and chemical operations
that can be designed for wastewater treatment do, by their scientific nature,
limit the types of constituents in wastewater treatment that may be treated by
facilities constructed and maintained within a reasonable cost to the public.
Consequently, the District’s treatment facilities into which the District
system discharges are designed for the primary purpose of treating domestic
wastewater in sufficient manner to protect public health. Certain industrial
wastewater constituents and portable toilet waste can be treated without
interference at the wastewater facilities, but only in a limited quantity or
concentration. To ensure that discharges of industrial wastewater and portable
toilet wastes into the public sanitary sewer are within such quantity and
concentration limits, reasonable and adequate regulations are provided in this
chapter.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.005 APPLICABILITY OF SEWER USE PROVISIONS.

local laws, ordinances and regulations, including EPA/DWQ pretreatment
standards, which are at that time in effect. In the event of a conflict, the
more stringent requirement or higher standard shall apply. Violations of this
chapter shall be subject to penalties as provided throughout this chapter.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.006 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing
special agreement or special arrangement between the District and any customer
or potential customer whereby an industrial waste of strength or character in
excess of that defined as standard strength may be accepted by the District for
treatment, subject to payment by the customer pursuant to the industrial waste
treatment surcharge provisions of this chapter. However, no special agreement
may be established except by authority of the SCWSD Board; and in no event
shall any such agreement be entered into that would be in direct violation of
any EPA/DWQ pretreatment standard.

§ 52.031 PRELIMINARY TREATMENT DEVICES.
   Where preliminary treatment, pretreatment, flow-equalizing facilities, or
grease, oil, grit and sand traps or other interceptors are provided for any
wastewater, they shall be continuously maintained in satisfactory condition and
effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (A)   Grease removal. Grease and oil traps or other interceptors shall be
provided at the user’s expense when such user operates an establishment
preparing, processing or serving food and/or food products. Grease interceptors
may also be required in other industrial or commercial establishments when they
are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing oil and/or
grease in amounts of excess of 50 mg/l, or for any flammable wastes. All such
traps, tanks, chambers or other interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the District and shall be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. All such interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of
the waste content as required, as frequently as 30 days or as long as 90 days,
at the discretion of the District, in order to maintain their minimum design
capability to intercept oils and greases from the wastewater discharged to the
public sanitary sewer. The operation, maintenance and repair of such equipment
shall be at the sole expense of the owner. Failure to comply may result in the
implementation of enforcement procedures.
      (1)   Waste removed from grease interceptors shall not be discharged into
the public sanitary sewer. The owner shall be responsible for the sanitary
disposal of such wastes.

maintain a sewer meter, at their own expense, to measure sewage flow.
   (B)   Commercial and industrial users are required to connect to the public
water service, at the users expense, and shall be subject to all connection
fees associated with connection to the District’s water and sewer systems
accordingly prior to initiation of said services.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
CONNECTION PROCEDURE
§ 52.045 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Notification by District. When a public sanitary sewer becomes
available to a property served by a private wastewater disposal system, or when
a public sanitary sewer becomes available to a non-district wastewater
collection system, the District shall provide notification to the owner of such
property.
   (B)   Application procedures for new connections. Upon notification by the
District that the public sanitary sewer is available to a residential or non-
residential property, the owner can obtain a permit for connection to the
public sanitary sewer. To obtain a permit for connection, the owner of such
property shall make application for connection to the public sanitary sewer as
follows:
      (1)   If the owner of a residential or non-residential property is a
resident of the District:
         (a)   The owner must apply to SCWSD in Camden, N.C.
         (b)   The owner must complete and sign all required documents and all
required fees, as specified in §§
52.105 through
52.112, must be paid at the time application is made.
         (c)   All required fees must be paid prior to the issuance of any
permits by the District.
         (d)   The Building Inspector requires a clean-out inspection of the
sewer system for the residential or non-residential property, in order to issue
a certificate of occupancy (CO), the inspection will not be approved nor the
certificate of occupancy (CO) issued until such time as the owner submits all
documents and payment for all applicable fees and charges to the district.
         (e)   The owner shall be responsible for all fees until such time as
notification of change in ownership of the property is made to the District.
Upon notification of a change in ownership, a new application for service shall
be made by the new owner in accordance with divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section.
      (2)   If the owner of a residential or non-residential parcel resides
outside the District, and/or a contractor, developer or other party will be
obtaining a permit on behalf of the owner, the following application procedures
shall be required:
         (a)   Upon payment of all required fees, the contractor, developer or
other party may obtain a permit on behalf of the owner.
         (b)   The contractor, developer or other party shall provide the
mailing address of the owner so that all required documents may be mailed
directly to the owner for completion. A service fee set from time to time may
be charged to cover the cost of mailing the documents.
         (c)   The owner must complete, sign and have notarized all required
documents and return the documents to the District in Camden, NC, within 30
days from the date of notification by the District.
         (d)   The Building Inspector requires a clean-out inspection of the
sewer system for the residential or non-residential property, in order to issue
a certificate of occupancy (CO), the inspection will not be approved nor the
certificate of occupancy (CO) issued until such time as the owner submits all
documents and payment for all applicable fees and charges to the district.
         (e)   The owner shall be responsible for all fees until such time as
notification of change in ownership of the property is made to the District.
Upon notification of a change in ownership, a new application for service shall
be made by the new owner in accordance with divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section.
   (C)   Application procedures for changes in service.
      (1)   The owner must notify the District of the following:
         (a)   Change in ownership;
         (b)   Request for change in billing methods;
         (c)   Transfer of ownership between properties within the District;
and
         (d)   Request for termination of service.
      (2)   The owner may notify the District in person or by telephone of any
changes in service. If notification is made by telephone, the District will
mail all required documents to the owner for completion and required
signatures. If applicable, an administrative fee set from time to time will be
applied to the owner’s account. If fees, other than the administrative fee, are
required in accordance with §§
52.105 through
52.112, the owner must complete and sign all required documents and all
required fees paid as specified in division (B) of this section.
   (D)   Installation of the connection.  Most connections to the public
sanitary sewer will require the construction and addition of a service line, a
connection (tap) and a cleanout. The responsibilities for provision of these
elements are separately discussed below and further requirements are stated in
§§
52.025 through
52.033.
      (1)   Service line.  The owner is solely responsible for constructing the
service line that connects each building to the public sanitary sewer.
      (2)    Connection (tap). 
         (a)   Upon a single-family residential owner’s payment of a sewer
service connection fee pursuant to the fee schedule, the District will provide
a tap that will provide the owner’s service line access to the sewer lateral.
         (b)   Connection fees for users other than single-family residential
shall be borne by the owner and shall follow the District’s specifications. The
District shall be made aware 48 hours prior to construction of the tap to the
sewer main so that a representative of the District may be present to inspect
the connection.
      (3)   Sewage meter. In certain cases the District may require the owner
to install and pay for a sewage meter in lieu of a water meter; such
installation shall be in accordance with plans and specifications approved by
the District.
      (4)   Metal cleanout boxes required. All sewer cleanouts on public and/or
private property shall be protected with a cast iron cleanout box for
commercial and industrial sewer customers, when applicable. The cleanout stack
shall include threaded cleanout cap, or other approved device, under the cast
iron cleanout box.
   (E)   (1)   Voluntary requests for connections to the District’s sewer
system may arise in several situations: request for District acceptance of a
previously constructed sewer system in the District; request for District
approval and acceptance of a newly created sewer system in the District; or a
developer’s construction in the District’s sewer jurisdiction of an extension
connecting his system to the District’s system. The first two cases involve
situations in which the private system is presumably adjacent to the District’s
existing system; the last case anticipates an applicant’s desire to extend
sewer service to an area covered by the District’s master plan in advance of
the District’s construction time frame. In all cases, however, the application
procedures for District acceptance of a private sewer system remain the same.
Consequently, acceptance procedures for all sewer systems are described in §
52.047, while specific additional requirements for extensions are described in
§
52.048.
      (2)   Development located outside the proximity of the District’s sewer
system may desire to connect to the District’s sewer transmission/collection
system. Such extensions can be approved by the District on a voluntary basis
and shall be installed in accordance with the NCDENR standards and
specifications.
   (F)   (1)   Tracts of land adjacent to or spanning the limits of the active
construction phase of the District sewer plan may receive service through the
District provided adequate capacity in the District system and treatment
facility is available. Such connection required to provide the service will be
temporary. The proposed collection system will be designed to permanently tie
into the District system at a future date. All costs of the proposed collection
systems and connections to the District systems will be at the expense of the
developer. “Adjacent” is defined as a parcel or tract of land within the
distance described in Appendix A and shall be within the distance described to
a right-of-way containing sewer collection/transmission system owned and
operated, or operated on behalf of, the District.
      (2)   If the proposed development is within the proximity of the
District’s sewer transmission/collection system, as described in Appendix A,
and a District owned and operated sewer transmission and/or collection main is
scheduled to be constructed within a three-year period, the Developer may post
a performance bond with the District in an amount necessary to engineer and
construct the system required to connect the development with the District’s
sewer system in accordance with the NCDENR sewer construction standard
specifications and details, in lieu of constructing said connection prior to
the District’s sewer system being available.
   (G)   Reimbursement agreement for developers requesting to extend sewer
transmission mains to be connected to the District’s sewer system can be
approved by the Board. A developer of land within the prescribed distance of a
District sewer/wastewater collection system outlined in Appendix A shall be
responsible for all engineering and construction costs associated with the
transmission line installation from the development site to the closest point
of connection to the District’s system. The closest connection point to the
District’s system shall be linearly determined and disputed distances shall be
resolved by the Board. Upon completion of construction of the line, said line
shall be dedicated to the District for operation and maintenance. The developer
that incurs the costs for the construction of the transmission lines shall be
eligible for reimbursement up to but not exceeding 100% of the costs associated
with construction of the line for a period of 20 years in the following manner:
      (1)   The District’s minimum standard pipe size for gravity sewer
transmission mains shall be eight inches and force main sewer transmission
mains shall be four inches (nominal diameter).
      (2)   When sound engineering demonstrates the proposed development or
project requires a sewer transmission greater than described in division (G)(1)
then that size becomes the minimum pipe size by which this agreement is based
upon;
      (3)   Once the minimum pipe size is determined, the cost difference shall
be determined between the pipe size required to provide sewer service to the
proposed development or project and the pipe size required by the District to
serve the development or project and others, either existing and/or future. the
developer shall be eligible for reimbursement for no more than 100% this cost
difference.
      (4)   The cost difference established in division (G)(3) above shall then
be used in determining the reimbursement for which the developer shall be
eligible for as related to the betterment, defined as the up-sizing or over-
sizing of lines, wet wells, pump stations to a size greater than what is
required to serve the individual development or project, as may be required by
the District. The developer shall be eligible for no more than 100% of the cost
of the betterment;
      (5)   Each developer that develops a tract of land that is adjacent and
accessible to a sewer transmission line constructed by another developer shall
pay a pro rata portion equal to one-half of the documented construction cost of
the betterment based on the location and distance from the subsequent
development site to the original connection point to the District’s system. The
distance/length of line upon which the subsequent developers pro rata charges
will be based shall be determined by the Board. Pro rata payments collected by
the District shall be reimbursed to the initial developer during the 20-year
period following completion of construction of the line. In no case shall any
developer be reimbursed more than the actual documented construction cost for
the original line betterment. Pro rata payments collected by the District that
exceed the documented initial construction cost of a particular transmission
line shall be retained by the District and used for system upgrades, expansions
and payment of debt service. Pro rata transmission line payments shall be
submitted to the District by the affected developer(s) prior to connecting to
the District’s system.
      (6)   The term of a reimbursement agreement shall not exceed 20 years
from the time of approval by the Board. Reimbursement payments shall be made to
the Developer that constructs the initial transmission line, on an annual basis
on or before the 31st day of January from capital recovery fees as paid and
available.

of §
52.065 and §
52.066 and EPA/DWQ requirements.
      (2)   (a)   Extensions to District’s sewer system. All extensions to
connect to the District’s sewer system shall be designed with maximum use of
gravity flow pipeline facilities wherever feasible. In any case where sewer
service is required and a choice exists for pumped service verses gravity
service, then gravity service shall be constructed unless proven otherwise
infeasible by the developer/owner or the developer/owner’s engineer to the
satisfaction of the District.
         (b)   All pump stations installed to serve one individual, single-
family unit shall be constructed, operated and maintained by the District.
      (3)   Dry sewer installation.  All proposed development and/or projects
proposed in areas where District sewer is not currently available but is
scheduled to be installed within three years of completion of the development
and/or project may install “dry” sewer infrastructure. The sewer
infrastructure, including, but not limited to, mains, service taps, clean-outs,
pumping stations, manholes, etc., shall be constructed in accordance with the
DWQ construction standard specifications and shall be approved by the District
and the state prior to construction.
      (4)   Re-use requirement. All new golf course developments requiring the
use of water to maintain their property or existing golf course developments
constructing a wastewater collection system to be connected to the District’s
wastewater collection/transmission system shall be required to install a reuse
system (also referred to as “purple pipe” or “gray water lines”) for disposal
of treated wastewater effluent on the golf course(s) meeting or exceeding state
and federal requirements for such use. The requirement shall be subject to the
following criteria:
         (a)   The availability of District re-use water distribution/
transmission lines in the area of the development and/or project.
         (b)   Availability of sufficient open space for disposal of treated
effluent on the golf course or other allowable uses within the development.
         (c)   The use of groundwater shall be prohibited for golf courses if
the District’s re-use system is available.
      (5)   Calculation of sewer usage.  The District shall use and require
others to use the “Wastewater Flow Rate” table found in 15A NCAC 2H .0200 —
Waste Not Discharged to Surface Waters, or an equivalent document approved for
use by the State of North Carolina, for calculating and estimating the sewer
requirement for all applicable facilities and/or developments.
   (B)   Non-district sewers; interim arrangements. If the private sewer system
operator uses a package treatment plant to provide interim treatment, the plant
will be operated and maintained by the District. The developer/owner shall
provide a five year performance bond or such security as the board requires set
from time to time to ensure proper operation and maintenance. The District
shall have the right to use the bond funds to operate, repair and/or maintain
the system if the District determines that the plant requires additional repair
and maintenance as a result of poor plant performance or incorrect plant
design.
   (C)   Use of septic systems; interim arrangements. If District sewer is not
available to the development or project, but is scheduled to be available
according to the District’s master plan, the developer may choose to use septic
tanks or some approved variation thereof. These systems shall be approved and
constructed in accordance with the District’s Health Department and all other
applicable regulatory agencies. The owner/developer may connect all septic tank
systems to the public sewer system, at his or her expense, once the District
makes public sewer available.

§ 52.049 OBTAINING BUILDING PERMIT PRIOR TO CERTIFICATION.
   (A)   If a developer or builder desires to obtain a building permit prior to
certification of the sewer system by the engineer, he or she must furnish a
surety bond set from time to time, cash deposit or letter of credit for each
unit as determined by the Board. Upon furnishing bond, application for sewer
service may be obtained not more than 60 days prior to certification of sewer
system.
   (B)   If multiple units are being constructed, however, the total bond may
be reduced by either of the following means:
      (1)   If a developer or builder desires to obtain building permits for
more than five units prior to certification of the sewer, the developer or
builder need submit no more than a surety bond, cash deposit, or letter of
credit as determined by the Board.
      (2)   If the developer or builder has already posted a bond for
construction of the sewer system with a new subdivision, and if that bond also
includes language satisfactory to the District to cover the sewer certification
bonding requirement for all developers or builders seeking building permits
within that subdivision as allowed by this section, separate sewer
certification bonds shall not be required by the District for that subdivision.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
QUALITY AND QUANTITY DETERMINATIONS
§ 52.065 QUALITY.
   (A)   The District shall, from time to time, have tests made to determine
the quality of waste being discharged into the public sewer from individual
users of the wastewater system or from connections of service lines carrying
composite waste from domestic users and/or industrial users and from
connections including the premises of industrial waste discharge permit holders
under the provisions of this chapter. If at any time such waste becomes of such
a quality and/or quantity that requires pretreatment, the District shall have
the authority to require that proper permits be obtained and the permit holder
at his expense install proper pretreatment facilities.
   (B)   In the event of a significant change in a wastewater system user’s
wastes being discharged to the public sanitary sewer, the user shall promptly
notify the District of the nature of the change in quality or strength and in
volume. These changes shall be subject to verification by the District. The
District may require appropriate remedies for the adequate treatment of such
wastes thus tested. “Significant” means a change of 10% or more in strength
and/or volume of wastes.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.066 STANDARDS OF WASTE DISCHARGE AND DELIVERY.
   (A)   The delivery of all effluent from a user to the public sanitary sewer
shall be at a reasonable and uniform discharge rate, as produced without
storage except that which is necessary in the pretreatment or equalization
facilities of the waste producer.
   (B)   Wastes will be accepted which have satisfactory conditions or quality
after pretreatment by the industrial user in a pretreatment facility and/or by
a process which has been approved by the Board and which is continuously
maintained and operated by the producer at no cost to the district and which is
continuously subject to inspection by the district’s designated representative.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.067 PORTABLE TOILET WASTES.
   (A)   Portable toilet wastes that contain exclusively domestic wastes and
are not acceptable for disposal by land application under septage regulations
of North Carolina may be discharged to the public sanitary sewer provided such
discharge shall conform to all conditions of this section and applicable
conditions of this chapter. No septic tank wastes or industrial wastes shall be
discharged along with portable toilet wastes.
   (B)   All persons desiring to discharge portable toilet wastes in the manner
prescribed in this chapter shall apply to the District, and if the District
determines that such wastes must be discharged under controlled conditions to
protect public sewer collection and treatment facilities, shall obtain a waste
discharge permit from the District. This permit, if required by the District,
shall include provisions for the approved location of discharge, acceptable
times, rate and quantity of discharge, acceptable quality of discharge,
procedure for approving chemical additive types and methods of odor control,
requirements for periodic sampling and chemical analysis of wastes, and record
keeping required.
   (C)   All persons authorized by permit to discharge portable toilet wastes
shall pay a special fee in advance of each discharge of portable toilet wastes
as set forth in the fee schedule.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.068 QUALITY DETERMINATION/EFFLUENT SAMPLING.
   (A)   Periodic measurements of flow, suspended solids, BOD5, ammonia
nitrogen and other appropriate waste characteristics for surcharge
determination and other purposes shall be made by those permittees specifically
designated by the District. The District shall determine the number of 24 hour
flow measurements and samples required. Continuous monitoring may be required
by the District in cases involving large fluctuations in quantity or quality of
wastes, or if the wastewater appears to have characteristics which may damage
the receiving system. All expenses associated with such monitoring and sampling
shall be borne by the permittee(s).
   (B)   All public sanitary sewer users whose total average discharge is
greater than 25,000 gallons per day, or whose total average discharge has a
flow or pollutant loading requiring utilization of greater than 5% of the
design capacity of the District’s treatment works, shall, unless exempted by
the District, install and maintain, at the user’s expense, facilities for
continuously measuring and sampling the total waste discharge. This requirement
may be waived for a particular user only when the quantity, flow rate and
characteristics of the wastewater can be adequately determined without such
structures; when the physical arrangement of industrial plant facilities with
respect to sewer facilities make such an arrangement unusually costly and other
means of ascertaining the quantity, flow rate and characteristics can be
devised; or when previous sampling facilities have been built by either the
District or a prior owner. When the District shall determine for such
facilities discharging less than 25,000 gallons per day that the nature of the
discharge and/or conditions of the permit warrant continuous monitoring and
sampling, the District may require such user to install and maintain sampling
facilities as stated in this section.
   (C)   All flow measurements, sampling and analysis shall be performed by
qualified personnel; all laboratory analyses of industrial wastewater samples
shall be performed by an EPA/DWQ certified laboratory in accordance with
current standard chemical analysis methods for wastewater established by EPA/
DWQ. All samples shall represent the normal wastewater flow from the premises
over a 24 hour period. The samples shall be composited according to the flow
either manually with at least one sample collected hourly, or by automatic
integrated equipment. Sampling for all monitoring parameters shall be in
accordance with current standard analysis methods for wastewater approved by
the EPA/DWQ.
   (D)   Unless otherwise prescribed by the Board, self-monitoring reports of
the sampling shall be submitted to the District quarterly in accordance with
the following schedule:
 
Monitoring Period       Report Due Date
January 1 - March 31    April 15
April 1 - June 30       July 15
July 1 - September 30   October 15
October 1 - December 31 January 15
 
   (E)   Where a permittee operates as an integrated complex involving varying
processes and having separate industrial waste sewer connections within the
same contributory area, such permittee may be considered as one unit with
multiple connections. An analysis for each connection may be combined in
proportion to the flow from the connection, and the weighted average of the
results thus obtained may be used as the measure of the total flow and
concentration of the wastewater discharged into the public sanitary sewer.
   (F)   The handling, storage and analysis of all samples taken for the
determination of the characteristics of waste discharged shall be performed in
accordance with standard methods.
   (G)   The District may test for quality, to include sampling, any of the
waste being discharged to the public sanitary sewers at any time. A duly
authorized representative of the District may enter an industrial user’s
facility at any time, during business or operational hours, for this purpose or
for reviewing operations in the user’s facility to estimate the quality and
quantity of wastes being discharged.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.069 QUANTITY DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Unless otherwise provided, the quantity of wastewater delivered to the
public sanitary sewers shall be the same as the water metered by meter on the
water supply system. The quantity of wastewater for residential users with a
private water source shall be the average monthly quantity of all residential
users. The delivery capacity of a private water source may be metered at the
sewer user’s expense, using an accurate and dependable metering device approved
by the District. The wastewater system user shall pay to the District the cost
of service incurred by periodic water meter maintenance, water meter reading
and wastewater service billing. Such water metering devices shall be available
to District personnel at all reasonable times.
   (B)   Should the user evaporate or otherwise dispose of water produced from
its water supply, it shall be the obligation of the user to install at his
expense such meters or other flow measurement devices to accurately determine
the portion or quantity of the metered water delivered to the wastewater
system.
   (C)   The District may establish a constant ratio, factor or percentage to
be applied to the metered water quantity produced from the wastewater system
user’s sources in order to estimate the quantity of wastewater delivered by the
user. Determination of this factor shall be the responsibility of the user as
will the demonstration of the accuracy and generality of the factor to obtain
the District approval. The value of this factor will be periodically reviewed
for accuracy and may be revised.
   (D)   All domestic and industrial users served by the District wastewater
system shall pay a sewer user charge to the District in accordance with this
section.
   (E)   Where no payment procedure is established, it shall be the obligation
of the owner in all instances to immediately submit to the District a statement
concerning water consumption and disposal upon which wastewater service fees
can be determined. If changes in the consumption and disposal conditions so
stated take place after billing rates and charges have been initially
established, a further statement is required to be submitted on forms supplied
by the District.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.070 POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.
   (A)   The duly authorized agents or employees of the District bearing proper
credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all properties,
privately and publicly owned, for the purposes of meter reading, inspection,
observation, measurement, gauging, sampling and testing in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The District or its representatives shall have no
authority to inquire into any processing, including those of the metallurgical,
chemical, oil refining, ceramic, paper or other industries, beyond that point
having a direct bearing on the volume, nature and source of discharges to the
District’s wastewater collection system and/or storm sewers or other natural
outlets.
   (B)   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in division (A) of this section, the duly authorized employees and agents of
the District shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the owner.
   (C)   The property owner shall not be released from liability to any extent
if a District agent or employee is injured while making inspections which are
pursuant to this section on privately owned property as a result of negligence
on the part of the private property owner or any of his or her agents or
employees.

(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.086 PROCEDURE FOR DISCONTINUATION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The District shall serve a written notice to the owner allegedly
violating any provision of this chapter. This notice shall state the specific
nature of the violation and provide the owner not more than five working days
to inquire regarding the notice or correct the violation. If the owner feels he
or she is not in violation, or that compliance requires greater than five
working days, he or she may request a hearing before the Board. If the owner
does not respond within the time prescribed in the notice, the Board may
immediately discontinue service to the owner upon the expiration of the
prescribed time. If service is discontinued due to violation of one or more of
the provisions under § 52.085, discontinuation of service shall result by the
removal of the water meter, the owner must correct the violation within 30
calendar days of discontinuance or vacate the premises for failure to properly
maintain service with the public sanitary sewer system.
   (B)   If the owner allegedly in violation of a provision of this chapter
requests a hearing before the Board, the Board shall, within five days of such
owner’s claims, establish the time and place for such hearing. If, as a result
of the hearing, the Board determines that the owner is in violation of the
provision as alleged in the notice, he or she shall order the owner to correct
the conditions giving rise to the violation and establish a reasonable time for
compliance. If the Board cannot, at the hearing, determine the existence or
extent of the alleged violation, he or she may order the suspension of service
pursuant to §
52.087 pending further investigation. In the case of suspension of service the
owner is entitled to request a second hearing; and if he or she does so, the
Board may take no further action until the conclusion of the second hearing.
   (C)   At the owner’s request, billing for sewer service can be placed in an
inactive status if one of the following situations have occurred:
      (1)   If the owner’s water source is a private well and electrical
service to the property has been discontinued.
      (2)   If the owner’s water source is other than a private well and the
company or municipality providing water service has discontinued service.
   (D)   It is the owner’s responsibility to notify the District when electric
or water service has been restored. If the district becomes aware of the
restoration of electric or water service prior to notification by the owner,
the owner shall be responsible for all charges incurred from the date of
restoration of electric or water service.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.087 SUSPENSION OF SERVICE.
   If a user is suspected of discharging wastewater into a public sanitary
sewer that is causing operational problems at the public wastewater treatment
facility, pump station or public sanitary sewer, and such discharge would be in
violation of this chapter, and, further, such user has been issued a written
notice pursuant to §
52.086 but has denied the alleged violation, the District may require that the
user cease to discharge into a public sanitary sewer, upon a hearing by the
Board, for up to 30 calendar days. This suspension shall be only for the
purpose of clearly determining the operational effect of the user’s discharge;
and such suspension shall not be made if it will likely endanger the public
health, safety or welfare or otherwise create a public health or safety
nuisance. Depending upon the results of the suspension on the operation of the
wastewater treatment facilities, the District may take appropriate action to
either restore service or discontinue further service pursuant to §
52.086.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.088 DISCONTINUATION IN PROTECTION OF HEALTH AND WELFARE.
   When any public sanitary sewer user discharges or threatens to discharge any
wastewater which is prohibited by this chapter and may cause a present or
imminent and substantial endangerment to the health and welfare of persons, or
is likely to cause the disruption or inhibition of the operation of the
District’s wastewater treatment facilities, the District may immediately, upon
written or verbal notification to the user, discontinue service to the user. In
such event, the District shall serve a written notice to the user after
discontinuation of service and shall, where feasible, follow the procedural
requirements of §
52.086. If upon fulfillment of such requirements it is determined that no
violation has occurred, service to the user shall be restored at no cost to the
user.

nuisance. Any and all costs incurred by the District in the abatement shall
constitute a lien upon that property on which the easement exists, collectible
in the same manner as ad valorem taxes.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.093 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation (NOV). Whenever the Board finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, wastewater permit,
or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other
pretreatment requirement the Board may serve upon such a person a written
notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the date of
this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction thereof shall be submitted to the District by the user. Submission
of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders.  The Board is hereby empowered to enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the non-compliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the non-compliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to division (D), below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.  
      (1)   The Board may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this chapter or is in
noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the Board determines that
a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any
agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The Board shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and
determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §
52.094 nor is any action or inaction taken by the Board under this section
subject to an administrative appeal under §
52.145(H).
   (D)   Administrative orders. When the Board finds that an industrial user
has violated or continues to violate this chapter, permits or orders issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the Board may issue an order
to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in
noncompliance to do any of the following:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
the order;
      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation;
      (4)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions. 
      (1)   The Board may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or
wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Board shall take such steps as deemed necessary including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The Board shall reinstate
the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the
elimination of the non-compliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a
detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution
and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Board prior to
the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit.  Any user who violates the following conditions
of this chapter, or applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to
having its permit terminated:
      (1)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his or her discharge;
      (2)   Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater
constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring; or

§ 52.095 OTHER AVAILABLE REMEDIES.
   Remedies, in addition to those previously mentioned in this chapter, are
available to the Board who may use any single one or combination against a non-
compliant user. Additional available remedies include, but are not limited to:
   (A)   Criminal violations. The District Attorney for the First Judicial
District (or its successor) may, at the request of the District, prosecute non-
compliant users who violate the provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B.
[Note: Under North Carolina law, it is a crime to negligently violate any term,
condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or negligently fail to
apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B
(f)), to knowingly and willfully violate any term, condition, or requirement of
a pretreatment permit, or knowingly and willfully fail to apply for a
pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. § 143-215.6B(g)), to
knowingly violate any term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit
issued by local governments, or knowingly fail to apply for a pretreatment
permit, knowing at the time that a person is placed in imminent danger of death
or serious bodily injury, (G.S. 143-215.6B(h)), and to falsify information
required under G.S. Chapter 143, Article 21 (G.S. 143-215.6B(i)).]
   (B)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user is in violation of the provisions
of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, the Board, through the
District’s Attorney, may petition the Superior Court of Justice for the
issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and permanent injunction that
restrains or compels the activities in question.
   (C)   Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user is in violation of
the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, water
service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence,
at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated ability to
comply.

operation.
   (B)   Grease interceptors maintenance, record keeping, and grease removal.
      (1)   Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by the
public works manager or his or her designee. Grease interceptors shall be
installed at the user's expense, when such user operates a cooking
establishment. Grease interceptors may also be required in non-cooking or cold
dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments and other establishments when deemed
necessary by the public works manager for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease. No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from
subject grease interceptor to exceed 325 milligrams per liter, as identified by
EPA method 1664 or 275 milligrams per liter, as identified by EPA method 413.
All grease interceptors shall be of type, design and capacity approved by the
public works manager or his or her designee and shall be readily and easily
accessible for user cleaning and District inspection. All such grease traps
shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order
to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease
interceptor, but not less often than every 90 days. Users who are required to
pass water through a grease interceptor shall:
         (a)   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at
actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as
predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent
and effluent baffles with 20% of the total volume of the grease interceptor
being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified hereafter as a
“sludge pocket.”
         (b)   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required,
but at intervals of not longer than 90 days at the user's expense. Grease
interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit,
rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc.,
which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of
the grease interceptor.
         (c)   All facilities with grease interceptors shall annually send a
sample of the effluent off to be tested to meet the requirements set forth in
division (B)(1) of this section. The list of acceptable testing facilities will
be maintained by the Public Works Manager and be provided to each facility
covered under this section.
         (d)   Accept the following conditions: if any skimmed or pumped wastes
or other materials removed from a grease interceptor are treated in any fashion
on-site and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and
after said onsite treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment
of established grease numerical limit consistent with and contained in division
(B)(1) of this section, on all discharges of wastewater from said grease
interceptor into the District’s sanitary sewer collection and treatment system.
         (e)   Understand and agree that: the use of biological additives such
as a grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon prior written
approval by the Public Works Manager. Any establishment using this method of
grease abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner that
attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the
trap's outlet, is consistently achieved.
         (f)   Understand and agree that: the Public Works Manager reserves the
right to make determinations of Grease Interceptor adequacy and need, based on
review of all relevant information regarding Grease Interceptor performance,
facility site and building plan review and to require repairs to, or
modification or replacement of such traps.
      (2)   The user shall maintain a written record of trap maintenance and
annual effluent tests for three years. All such records will be available for
inspection by the District during normal business hours.
      (3)   No non-grease-laden sources are allowed to be connected to sewer
lines intended for grease interceptor service.
      (4)   Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following
adoption of this section, although installation of grease interceptors will be
required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
section for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease
interceptors. If during this one-year period an obstruction of the District’s
sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact
on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the

CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharge during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under §
52.159. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
52.155,
52.157 and
52.158.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-
acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a
one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulation under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the District,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued there
under, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 52.164 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.165 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B), below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Board may authorize the
use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the
user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the
effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.166 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.167 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or District, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Board.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 52.175 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The District requires the user to provide and operate at the user’s
own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
District may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship
on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the District’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the District.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.176 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The District will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the District approval authority and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The District, approval
authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user’s property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the
District approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay,
for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
   (B)   Denial of the District’s, approval authority’s, or EPA’s access to the
user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may
constitute denial of access.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.177 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the District, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of District designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the District, approval
authority, or EPA may seek issuance of an administrative search warrant from
the Camden County Magistrates or the Camden County District Court.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
§ 52.185 GENERAL.
   (A)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall
be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Board that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the user. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data.
   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, Non-discharge
permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions
of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information. All records relating to compliance with Pretreatment
Standards shall be made available to officials of the approval authority and
EPA upon request.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE
§ 52.195 GENERAL.
   At least annually, the District shall publish in the largest daily newspaper
circulated in the service area, a list of those industrial users that were
found to be in significant non-compliance, also referred to as reportable non-
compliance in 15A NCAC 2H .0903(b)(10), with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements, during the previous 12 months.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 52.205 UPSET.
   (A)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (B), below, are met.
   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the District
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-
compliance;
         (b)   The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.
   (C)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (D)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 2005-01-01, passed 2-21-05)
§ 52.206 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARD DEFENSE.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for non- compliance with the general prohibitions in §
52.125(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
52.125(B)(2), (3) and (5) - (7) if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when a municipal
customer was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.

§ 53.01 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Stormwater runoff is a critical concern for the county due to the
potential for flood damage to residential and commercial structures and
productive agricultural land as well as its potential pollutant damage to the
surrounding creeks, rivers, and sound.
   (B)   Water quality standards by state and federal law requiring that local
governments develop more detailed, advanced, and costly stormwater programs are
being mandated in an ever increasing number of cities and counties in the
state.
   (C)   Heretofore maintenance of conveyances has been the sole responsibility
of private property owners, with the exception of road side ditches maintained
by the NCDOT, with no concern for the overall performance of the natural water
courses and manmade ditches and canals that make up the stormwater system.
   (D)   Effective stormwater management should be provided to protect, to the
extent practicable, the citizens of the county from the loss of life and
property damage from flooding.
   (E)   G.S. Chapter 153A, Article 15 authorizes the county to acquire,
construct, establish, enlarge, improve, extend, maintain, own, operate, and
contract for the operation of stormwater management programs designed to
protect water quality by controlling the level of pollutants in, and the
quantity and flow of, stormwater and structural and natural stormwater and
drainage systems of all types.
   (F)   The establishment of a stormwater management utility that would be
accounted for as a separate enterprise fund and would facilitate the provision
of a stormwater management programs is reasonable and in the public interest.
   (G)   G.S. § 153A-277 authorizes the county to establish and revise from
time to time, a schedule of rates and charges to fund the stormwater management
program activities including both structural and natural stormwater conveyance
and drainage system services provided by the stormwater management utility.
(Ord. 2013-05-02, passed 6-17-13)
§ 53.02 PURPOSE.
   A stormwater management utility is hereby created as an identified fiscal
and accounting fund for the purpose of comprehensively addressing the
stormwater management needs of the county. The county’s stormwater management
needs are met herein:
   (A)   Through programs designed to protect and manage water quality and
quantity by controlling the level of pollutants in stormwater runoff, and the
quantity and rate of stormwater received and conveyed by structural and natural
stormwater and drainage systems of all types;
   (B)   By establishing a schedule of charges;
   (C)   By defining the control, collection, and disbursal of funds; and
   (D)   By setting forth penalties, methods of appeals and exemptions.
(Ord. 2013-05-02, passed 6-17-13)
§ 53.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPED LAND. A land parcel altered from its natural state.
   DRAINAGE SYSTEM. Natural and structural channels, swales, ditches, swamps,
rivers, streams, creeks, wetlands, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways,
inlets, catch basins, gutters, pipes, culverts, bridges, head walls, storm
sewers, lakes, and other physical works, properties, and improvements that
transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater
runoff.
   EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT (ERU). A unit of measure of impervious surface
(in square feet) that represents the impervious surface area on the average
single family residential parcel in the underlying jurisdiction as a unit of
comparison. ERU shall mean for the purposes of this chapter 4,500 square feet
of impervious surface.
   GROSS PARCEL AREA. The property area contained within the legally described
boundaries of a property or the total lot size of a property, in acres.
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. Developed areas of land that prevent or significantly
impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil. Typical impervious
surfaces include, but are not limited to: roofs, sidewalks, patios, private
driveways, parking lots, access extensions, alleys and other paved, engineered,
compacted or gravel surfaces containing materials that prevent or significantly
impede the natural infiltration of stormwater into the soil. Impervious surface
area is synonymous with built upon area (BUA) as defined by the North Carolina
Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
   NATURAL STATE. Existing undeveloped land where the soil and vegetation
characteristics have not been substantially modified or disturbed by human
activities and the hydrologic function is in an unaltered or natural condition.
   SERVICE AREA. All land within the county and will be divided based on the
topography and outfalls, into four watershed subareas as shown in Exhibit A to
Ord. 2013-05-02 as South Mills Sawyers Creek, Shiloh, and North River
Watersheds.
   SERVICE CHARGE. A stormwater management service charge, applicable to a land
parcel, which generally reflects the impact on or demand for stormwater
management services provided by the county to properly control and manage
stormwater runoff quantity and/or quality associated with the land parcel. The
SERVICE CHARGE will vary from one land parcel to another based on the
impervious surface and gross parcel areas. The SERVICE CHARGE may vary for the
same class of service in different areas of the service area and may vary
according to classes of service.
   SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL PARCEL. A parcel with a single family residential
structure used as a single family dwelling and whose primary use is as a single
family residence.

§ 53.06 RATE STRUCTURE.
   Every parcel within the service area shall be subject to a stormwater
management utility service charge derived from the rate schedule described
below. The rate structure to distribute the cost of services associated with
the operation, repair, improvement and maintenance of public drainage systems
and facilities through a schedule of rates, fees, charges, and penalties
related to the operation of a stormwater management utility and Stormwater
Management Enterprise Fund as established in §
53.04 shall be based on the following three rate components:
   (A)   Fixed charge per account (FCPA) based on account existence which
directly relates to certain administrative, billing, collections, public
outreach, and other charges as may be allocated on a per parcel basis. The FCPA
shall be the same for each account throughout the county. Expenses for
Stormwater Technician, GIS Mapping, and Floodplain Program Officer shall not be
included in the FCPA.
   (B)   Gross parcel component on a given land parcel, which is related to
quantity of runoff and total pollutant loading of stormwater runoff discharged
from that land parcel. The gross acreage component shall equal the total number
of acres per parcel multiplied by watershed rate per acre.
   (C)   Impervious surface component on a given land parcel, which directly
relates to the volume, rate, and pollutant loading of a stormwater runoff
discharged from that land parcel to the county’s structural and natural
drainage systems and facilities. An impervious area units charge for stormwater
costs shall be allocated to impervious area on an equivalent residential unit
(ERU) basis. Impervious surface area rates will apply to each unit or part
thereof of imperious area.
      (1)   Based on an analysis by the county of impervious surface area on
properties throughout the county, an impervious surface area of 4,500 square
feet is hereby designated as one equivalent residential unit (ERU).
      (2)   Each single family residential parcel shall be charged for one ERU
of impervious area.
      (3)   Each residential unit in a townhome, condominium, or other
multifamily structure with individual unit ownership and duplexes shall be
billed for one ERU of impervious area.
      (4)   There will be no impervious area units charge for land parcels with
fewer than 450 square feet of impervious surface area.
      (5)   All public and private parcels shall be billed for impervious
surface by the number of ERUs multiplied by 40 times the watershed rate.
      (6)   The watershed rate per acre used to determine the gross acre
component and impervious surface component shall be set by the Board of
Commissioners, upon recommendation by each of the watershed advisory committees
and may vary for each watershed based on the level of service and annual budget
for the respective watershed.

fees, charges, or penalties adopted pursuant to this chapter, that citizen must
submit a written appeal within 60 days from the date of billing, stating the
reasons for the appeal, and providing information pertinent to the calculation
of the billed charge. A timely appeal shall stay the penalty deadlines. An
appeal of disputed bill shall be filed with the Stormwater Manager for review
and disposition. The appeal will follow a three step process as follows:
      (1)   Over the shoulder appeals. Property owners are welcome to visit the
Planning Department and view their own individual properties to see what was
drawn and measured as impervious surface. Obvious errors will be corrected
administratively.
      (2)   Formal appeal. Contested areas will be identified and the owner may
complete a petition form and pay a fee to initiate a formal appeal. Upon a
formal appeal Stormwater Manager will visit the property and physically measure
impervious surfaces. The staff measurement will be used to correct the
calculation whether there is a decrease or increase.
      (3)   Final appeal. If the owner still contests the measurement, the
owner may submit a survey performed and sealed by a North Carolina licensed
professional a surveyor or engineer, or landscape architect. The surveyor shall
use the definition of impervious surface from the state Division of Water
Quality.

§ 70.01 PURPOSE, INTENT AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health, safety and
welfare of persons operating golf cart(s) within Camden County residential
subdivisions and side streets with posted speed limits of 35 miles per hour or
less and to protect the safety of their passengers and other users of roads.
   (B)   Pursuant to G.S. § 153A-245, Camden County may by ordinance regulate
the operation of golf carts as defined in G.S. § 20-4.01(12a) on any public
street, road or highway where the speed limit is 35 miles per hour or less
within the county that is located in any unincorporated areas of the county or
on any property owned or leased by the county.
   (C)   Further pursuant to G.S, § 153A-245, Camden County may by ordinance
require the registration of golf carts, charge a fee for the registration,
specify who is authorized to operate golf carts, and specify the required
equipment, load limits, and the hours and methods of operation of golf carts.
   (D)   The Camden County Board of Commissioners desires to allow the use of
golf carts within the county in accordance with state law and local law while
at the same time preserve and address the interest of public safety associated
with such use.
   (E)   Camden County finds that unregulated use of golf carts on public
streets and roads is detrimental to the safety of the citizens of Camden
County. This chapter has been expanded to include the entire county.
(Ord. 2021-01-02, passed 1-4-21)
§ 70.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DRIVER’S LICENSE. A valid license issued to operate a motor vehicle issued
by North Carolina or any other state.
   FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. Liability insurance coverage on a golf cart in an
amount not less than required by North Carolina law for motor vehicles operated
on public highways in the State of North Carolina.
   GOLF CART. A vehicle designed and manufactured for operation on a golf
course for sporting or recreational purposes and that is not capable of
exceeding speeds of 20 miles per hour.
   OPERATOR. Only persons over 16 years of age and holding a valid driver’s
license may operate a golf cart on roads.
(Ord. 2021-01-02, passed 1-4-21)
§ 70.03 POLICY STATEMENT AND LIABILITY DISCLAIMER.
   This chapter is adopted to address the interest of public safety under which
the provisions of G.S. § 153A-245 which provides counties with the authority to
regulate the use of golf carts that have not been outfitted and registered as
required by state law. Generally, golf carts (hereinafter “carts”) that have
not been outfitted and registered are not designated or manufactured to be used
anywhere other than golf courses, and Camden County in no way advocates or
endorses their operation elsewhere within the county. The county, by regulating
such operation, is merely trying to address obvious safety issues, and adoption
of this chapter is not to be relied upon as a determination that operation is
safe or advisable if done in accordance with this chapter. All persons who
operate or ride upon carts do so at their own risk and peril, and must be
observant of and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including
their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Camden County
has no liability under any theory of liability for permitting carts to operate
in the county. The owner and operator of the cart is responsible for any
liability involved in using the cart. The county does not encourage cart
operation and does not represent that the operation of carts under these rules
will render cart operation safe and without risk to the driver and passenger(s)
of a cart.
(Ord. 2021-01-02, passed 1-4-21)
§ 70.04 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Carts may not be operated on or alongside a public road or street with
a posted speed limit greater than 35 miles per hour.
   (B)   Carts may cross a road with a posted speed limit greater than 35 miles
per hour. However, once this segment of road has been traversed, the golf cart
is still required to travel only on or along a roadway with a speed limit of 35
miles per hour or less. Golf carts must cross in a manner that is the most
direct route in order to decrease crossing distance, i.e. no riding along a
road or crossing at an angle. Under no circumstance is a golf cart allowed to
cross a control access facility other than at bridges which cross over or under
a control access facility.
   (C)   Carts that are not equipped and registered as required by the State
Motor Vehicle Law may only operate on public streets and roads within the
County of Camden as set forth herein and in accordance with these rules and
regulations. Operation of carts in violation of these rules and regulations
shall be subject to the penalty provisions of § 70.99 or, in egregious cases,
may constitute reckless driving as defined in the North Carolina General
Statutes.
   (D)   All carts operated on the streets must have a valid and visible permit
sticker from the Camden County Tax Office. A yearly fee as established by the
Camden County Fee Schedule on a per cart basis will be charged by the Camden
County Tax Office for a permit sticker. There will be no prorated registrations
nor will there be any refunds issued. A 31-day re-registration period for all
previously registered golf carts will be permitted during the month of January
each year for an annual registration charge per the Camden Fee Schedule. Owners
re-registering after January 31 of each year will be considered expired until
re-registered and not permitted to use the golf carts in the associated areas.
Driving a golf cart without a current registration will result in a fine as
determined by the Camden County Fee Schedule. A list of all registrations will
be maintained by the Camden County Tax Office and the Camden County Sheriff’s
Office. The golf cart owner is responsible for maintaining their registration,
no notices will be mailed. If a golf cart is purchased during the calendar
year, the fee will not be prorated and would be the amount established as per
the Camden Fee Schedule.
   (E)   Any person who operates a golf cart on public streets and roads must
adhere to all applicable state and local laws, regulations and ordinances,
including but not limited to:
      (1)   All traffic rules and regulations adopted by the State of North
Carolina and the Camden County which governs the operation of motor vehicles;
      (2)   Those banning the possession and use of alcoholic beverages, and
all other illegal drugs. In addition, no golf cart containing any open
container of alcohol shall be operated on public roads.
   (F)   Any person who operates a golf cart must be responsible for all
liability associated with operation of the golf cart and must have liability
insurance coverage which will cover the use of a golf cart in an amount not
less than required by North Carolina law for motor vehicles operated on public
highways in the State of North Carolina.
   (G)   Drivers of carts shall stay to the far right of the traveled portion
of the road and yield to the right-of-way to overtaking motor vehicles and
pedestrians.

including a vehicle identification or serial number. Such equipment must
include all safety devices as installed by said manufacturer, including rear
view mirror and a rear triangle reflector of the same type required by North
Carolina law. Persons are prohibited from standing on a cart while the cart is
in operation.
   (J)   The maximum occupancy of a cart traveling on the street is one person
per bucket seat or two people per bench seat. The operator shall not allow
passengers to ride on any part of a golf cart not designed to carry passengers,
such as the part of the golf cart designed to carry golf bags.
   (K)   Children must be properly seated while a cart is in motion and may not
be transported in a negligent manner.
   (L)   If the cart is equipped with seat belts, all passengers are to wear
the seat belts at all times the cart is in motion.
   (M)   A driver must be at least 16 years old and possess a valid state-
issued driver’s license. Cart operators must carry their driver’s license on
their person at all times while operating a cart on public streets and roads in
the county.
   (N)   No cart may be operated at a speed greater than reasonable and prudent
for the existing conditions, and in no instance at a speed greater than 20
miles per hour.

   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Abandoned and Junked
Motor Vehicle Chapter of Camden County, North Carolina.”
(Ord. passed 7-1-87)
§ 90.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to ensure the public health, safety and
general welfare by providing controls on the removal and disposal of abandoned
and junked motor vehicles. Among other reasons, this chapter is deemed
necessary to prohibit abandoned or junked vehicles from being disposed of by
leaving them on public or private property. Abandoned and junked vehicles
constitute a hazard to the health and welfare of the people of the county in
that the vehicles can harbor diseases, furnish shelter and breeding places for
mosquitoes and other insects, and are a breeding ground and harbor for rats and
other pests. Abandoned and junked motor vehicles constitute a hazard to the
safety of the people of the county in that the vehicles can have areas of
confinement which cannot be opened from the inside such as trunk compartments
and engine compartments and present physical dangers to the safety and well-
being of children and other citizens.
   (B)   It is therefore in the public interest that the present accumulation
of abandoned and junked motor vehicles be eliminated and that the future
abandonment of the vehicles be prevented.
(Ord. passed 7-1-87)
§ 90.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLE. A motor vehicle that is left:
      (1)   On public grounds or county-owned property in violation of a law or
ordinance prohibiting parking;
      (2)   For longer than 24 hours on property owned or operated by the
county;
      (3)   For longer than two hours on private property without the consent
of the owner, occupant or lessee of the property; or
      (4)   For longer than seven days on public grounds.
   DECLARATION OF HEALTH OR SAFETY HAZARD.
      (1)   A motor vehicle that has been declared to be a health hazard or a
safety hazard shall, for purposes of disposal by the county, be deemed to be
either a junked motor vehicle or an abandoned motor vehicle, according to its
apparent value, notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   A motor vehicle shall be declared to be a health hazard when its
condition is such that the motor vehicle can or does harbor diseases, furnish
shelter and breeding places for mosquitoes and other insects, or become a
breeding ground and harbor for rats and other pests.
      (3)   A motor vehicle shall be declared to be a safety hazard when its

cause to be operated any source of sound in a manner as to create a sound level
which at its peak exceeds the limits set forth for the use occupancy categories
in Table I when measured at or beyond the property line of the property from
which the sound originates. For purposes of measurement, the back of the curb,
the outside edges of driveways, fences, hedges or other physical features
commonly associated with property boundaries are presumed to be at a point
which is at or beyond the property line. In all cases, the maximum sound level
permitted by use occupancy shall be determined on the basis of the use

subsequent amendments, to provide for and specify the means to advance and
protect the public interest in these matters and any franchise issued pursuant
to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part
thereof.

capacity to provide entertainment and information services to the county's

interactive communications services to institutions and individuals.

contained herein.
      (1)   Cable television services should be provided to all county
residents at the most reasonable cost.

GRANT OF FRANCHISE; GENERAL TERMS AND RULES
§ 110.015 GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   In the event that the county shall grant to the grantee a non-
exclusive, revocable for cause franchise to construct, operate and maintain a
system within the county, the franchise shall constitute both a right and an
obligation to provide the services of a system as regulated by the provisions
of this chapter and the franchise.
   (B)   (1)   The franchise shall be granted under the terms and conditions
contained herein, consistent with and subject to all applicable statutory
requirements.
      (2)   In the event of conflict between the terms and conditions of this
chapter, the franchise or the terms and conditions on which the county can
grant a franchise, statutory requirements shall control.
   (C)   (1)   Any franchise granted by the county is hereby made subject to
the general ordinance provisions now in effect and hereafter made effective.
      (2)   Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements
of the various codes and ordinances of the county or other applicable law
regarding permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction.
(Ord. passed 10-19-98)
§ 110.016 USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   Insofar as permitted by law and for the purpose of operating and maintaining
a system in the county, the grantee may erect, install, construct, repair,

public ways within the county wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits,
vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments and other

and performance provisions contained in this chapter, the franchise agreement
and other applicable local ordinances.
(Ord. passed 10-19-98)
§ 110.017 USE OF GRANTEE FACILITIES.
   No poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the
county which shall not be unreasonably withheld, with regard to location,
height, type and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole
of the grantee shall be a vested right and the poles shall be removed or
modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the county reasonably
determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby, the grantee
shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible. The county shall
have the right, during the life of the franchise, to install and maintain free
of charge upon the poles owned by the grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that
do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of the grantee;
provided the county shall, at all times, indemnify and hold the grantee
harmless against any and all claims which might arise as a result of the
county's use.
(Ord. passed 10-19-98)
§ 110.018 FRANCHISE REQUIRED.
   No system shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets of the county or be

in the franchise.
(Ord. passed 10-19-98)
§ 110.020 FRANCHISE NON-EXCLUSIVE.
   The franchise discussed herein is non-exclusive. The county specifically
reserves the right to grant, at any time, additional franchises for a system it
deems appropriate.
(Ord. passed 10-19-98)
§ 110.021 TIME; ESSENCE.
   Whenever this chapter or an agreement shall set forth any time for an act to
be performed by or on behalf of the grantee, the time shall be deemed of the
essence and any failure of the grantee to perform within the time allotted

penalty.

without the prior consent of the county, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
   (B)   The grantee shall promptly notify the county of any actual or proposed
change in or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the
grantee. The word CONTROL as used herein, is not limited to major stockholders,
but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable
presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the
disposal by the grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary
sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of 25% or more, at one time, of the
ownership or controlling interest in the system or 50% cumulatively over the
term of the franchise of the interest to a corporation, partnership, limited
partnership, trust or association or person or group of persons acting in
concert. The county shall exercise its power to approve a transfer of ownership
or control in a manner consistent with Section 617 of the Communications Act,
47 USC 537.
   (C)   Every transfer, sale, lease, assignment or disposition of, including,
but not limited to by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation,
receivership or other means or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make
the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the county shall have
consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the
purpose of determining whether it shall consent to the transfer, sale, lease,
assignment or disposition of, including, but not limited to by force or
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or other means or
acquisition of control of the grantee the county may inquire into the legal,
financial and technical qualifications of the prospective controlling party,
and the grantee shall assist the county in any inquiry. Failure to provide all
information reasonably requested by the county as part of the inquiry may be
grounds for denial of the proposed transfer, sale, lease, assignment or
disposition of, including, but not limited to by force or voluntary sale,
merger, consolidation, receivership or other means or acquisition of control of
the grantee. If the county finds that the transfer, after considering the
legal, financial and technical, qualifications of the applicant, is
satisfactory, the county will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of
the franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the county to the
transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   (D)   The county agrees that any financial institution or other secured
creditor having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of
money for the construction and/or operation of the system shall have the right
to notify the county that it or its designee satisfactory to the county will
take control and operate the system. Further, the financial institution shall
also submit a plan for the operation that will insure continued service and
compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial
institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall
not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless
extended by the county at its discretion and during the period of time it shall
have the right to petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee.
   (E)   The consent or approval of the county to any transfer of the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the county in and to
the streets, rights-of-way or areas appurtenant thereto, and any transfer
shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this
chapter and the franchise.
   (F)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the county will not
approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of
construction of the proposed initial system.
   (G)   Any approval by the county of transfer shall be contingent upon the
prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to the franchise.
   (H)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary no such consent shall be
required for any transfer to any person controlling, controlled by or under the
same common control of the grantee so long as the grantee continues to
guarantee the performance, under the terms of the chapter and the franchise
agreement of the transferee.
(Ord. passed 10-19-98)
§ 110.024 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND CONFLICTS.
   (A)   In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights
hereunder are subject to the police power of the county to adopt and enforce
general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and it
agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the
county pursuant to the power.
   (B)   Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter or the franchise
and any other present or future lawful exercise of the county's general police
powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any exercise that
is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to
grantee or systems which contains provisions inconsistent with this chapter
shall prevail only if, upon the exercise, the county finds an emergency exists
constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare and the
exercise is mandated by law.

§ 110.025 FRANCHISE RENEWAL.

the Communications Act, 47 USC 546, or other applicable law.
(Ord. passed 10-19-98)
§ 110.026 FRANCHISE FEES.
   (A)   (1)   The county finds that:
         (a)   The public ways of the county and state to be used by the
grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise
area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained at great expense to
its taxpayers;
         (b)   The grant to the grantee to the public ways is a valuable
property right without which the grantee would be required to invest
substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and
         (c)   The administration of this chapter or the franchise imposes upon
the county additional regulatory responsibility and expense, a grantee of any
franchise hereunder shall pay to the county a franchise fee in an amount as
designated in the franchise agreement.
      (2)   The county reserves the right to change the franchise fee as stated
in the franchise agreement, by adopting an ordinance establishing the new
franchise fee rate and allowing reasonable notice to the grantee for
administration of the change. This franchise fee payment shall be in addition
to any other fee and commence as of the effective date of the franchise. The
county shall be furnished a statement of the payment by the Vice-President for
Finance of the grantee or the person as the grantee may designate, reflecting
the total amounts of gross annual revenues and computations for the period
covered by the payment.
   (B)   This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment of
general applicability owed by the grantee to the governments or other taxing
jurisdiction. Payment of the franchise fee made by grantee to the county shall
be in addition to any and all taxes of general applicability which are now or
may be required hereafter to be paid by any federal, state or local law.
   (C)   No acceptance of any payment by the county shall be construed as a
release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the county may have for
further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for
the performance of any other obligation of the grantee.
   (D)   In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not
made on or before the dates specified herein, the grantee shall pay as
additional compensation an interest charge, computed from the due date, at the
annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the county's primary
depository bank, plus 3%, during the period that the unpaid amount is owed.
   (E)   The franchise fee and any other costs, charges or damages assessed
shall be payable quarterly to the county. The grantee shall file a complete and
accurate verified statement of all gross annual revenue within the franchise
area during the period for which the quarterly payment is made and the payment
shall be made to the county not later than 45 days after the expiration of each
calendar quarter. Quarterly computation dates are the last day in the months of
March, June, September and December.
   (F)   The county shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income
records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be
payable under this chapter. Audits shall be at the expense of the grantee if
the additional amount due is greater than 2% of the amount paid. Any additional
amount due to the county as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days
following written notice to the grantee by the county which notice shall
include a copy of the audit report.

material obligations under this chapter or under documents, contracts and other
terms and provisions entered into by and between the county and the grantee,

effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond, as

deceptive act or practice with regard to the county or subscribers under the
laws of the state;
      (5)   The grantee's construction schedule is delayed later than the
schedule contained in the franchise or beyond any extended date set by the
county;
      (6)   The grantee becomes insolvent or is adjudged bankrupt;
      (7)   The grantee fails to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
interrupted service, except when written approval of the interruption is
obtained from the county;

negotiation of the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof; and/or
      (9)   The grantee ceases to provide cable services, as required under the
terms of the franchise agreement and this chapter, for any reason that is
within the control of the grantee over the system.
   (B)   The grantee shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any
sanction under any provision of this chapter in any case, in which performance
of any provision is prevented or delayed due to an act of God for reasons
beyond the grantee's control. A fault shall not be deemed to be beyond the
grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other business entity in
which the grantee holds a controlling interest, whether held directly or
indirectly.
   (C)   The grantor and grantee will abide by the terms of any stay order
issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   (1)   The county shall make written demand that the grantee comply

or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or
neglect of the grantee continues for a period of 30 days following the written
demand, the county shall place its request for termination of the franchise
upon a regular Board meeting agenda. The county shall cause to be mailed by
certified mail to such grantee at least ten days prior to the date of the Board
meeting, a written notice of this intent to request the termination and the
reason therefor, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall
be published by the Clerk to the Board of Commissioners at least once, ten days
before the meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the county.
      (2)   The Board shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall
determine in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by
the grantee was with just cause.

cause, as reasonably defined by the county, the Board shall direct the grantee
to comply within the time and manner and upon the terms and conditions as are
reasonable.
      (4)   If the Board shall determine the failure, refusal or neglect by the
grantee was without just cause, then the Board shall, by resolution, declare
that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated and bond forfeited either
conditionally or unconditionally.
      (5)   If the revocation of the franchise depends upon a finding of fact,
the finding of fact shall be made by the county only after an administrative
hearing, providing the grantee with a full and fair opportunity to be heard,
including without limitations the right to introduce evidence, the right to
production of evidence and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of
the hearings. The grantee shall have the right to appeal any administrative
decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (E)   In the event a franchise is revoked or otherwise terminated, the
county may, in its sole discretion, do any of the following:
      (1)   Purchase the system under the procedures set forth in this chapter,
at a fair market price to include going concern, goodwill and franchise value;
      (2)   Effect a transfer of the system to another person if the transfer
would not result in a profit directly or indirectly to the grantor; and/or
      (3)   Order the removal of the system facilities required by public
necessity from the county within a reasonable period of time as determined by
the county or require the original grantee to maintain and operate its system
for a period of six months or until the further time as is mutually agreed
upon.
   (F)   In removing its system, or part thereof, the grantee shall refill, at
its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all
public ways and places in as good a condition or better as that existing prior
to the grantee's removal of its system without affecting the electrical or
telephone cable, wires or attachments. The county may inspect and approve the
condition of the public ways and cables, wires, attachments and poles after
removal. The liability, indemnity, insurance and performance bond, as provided
herein, shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal
and until the grantee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this
chapter and the franchise.
   (G)   In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any restoration
work required by the county within the time as may be established by the county
and to the satisfaction of the county, the county may, following reasonable
notice to the grantee, cause the work to be done and the grantee shall
reimburse the county the cost thereof within 30 days after receipt of an
itemized list of the cost or the county may, at its option, recover the costs
through the performance bond provided by grantee. The county shall be permitted
to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section.
   (H)   (1)   Upon either the denial of renewal or revocation of a franchise,
the county may require the grantee to continue to operate the system for a
period of six months from the date of the denial or revocation or until the
time beyond six months as is mutually agreed upon. The grantee shall, as
trustee for its successor in interest, continue to operate the system under the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise.
      (2)   The county shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to
enforce the provisions of this section.
   (I)   Notwithstanding any provision of the contrary contained herein,
neither the grantor nor the grantee shall be held liable for or suffer any
penalty or detriment for, any failure to comply with any provision of this
chapter or a franchise agreement if the failure to comply accrues from any act
of God or any other condition not within the reasonable control of the non-

HOUSING CODE
§ 150.01 FINDINGS; PURPOSE.
   (A)   Pursuant to G.S. § 160A-441, it is hereby found and declared that
there exist in the county dwellings unfit for human habitation due to
dilapidation, defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents and other
calamities, lack of ventilation, light and sanitary facilities and due to other
conditions rendering the dwellings unsafe or unsanitary and dangerous and
detrimental to the health, safety and morals and otherwise inimical to the
welfare of the residents of the county. It is further found by the County Board
of Commissioners that there exist in the county abandoned structures that
constitute a health and safety hazard as a result of the attraction of insects
and rodents, or that result in a condition creating a fire hazard, or that
bring about dangerous conditions constituting a threat to children, or that
bring about frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the absence of
sanitary facilities. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the county, as authorized by G.S. §§ 160A-360 et seq., it is the
purpose of this chapter to establish minimum standards of fitness for the
initial and continued occupancy of all dwellings used for habitation, and for
the continued existence of abandoned structures as expressly authorized by G.S.
§ 160A-444.
   (B)   The county shall abide by and enforce construction and renovation
codes and standards, in accordance with the current North Carolina Building
Codes with amendments, and North Carolina-adopted National Electric Code with
North Carolina Amendments, as scheduled and identified by the North Carolina
Department of Insurance. Permits shall be issued pursuant to G.S. § 153A-357.
The county shall also abide by and enforce the current North Carolina General
Statutes with amendments.

In exercising this power, members of the Department shall have the right to
enter on any premises within the jurisdiction of the Department at all
reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action,
upon presentation of proper credentials. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prohibit periodic inspections in accordance with State Fire
Prevention Code or as otherwise required by state law.

   (A)   The North Carolina Constitution has established, and the North
Carolina Supreme Court has reaffirmed, that “every child has a fundamental
right to sound basic education,” reflected in the North Carolina state
constitutional requirement “that every child in the state have equal access to
sound basic education.” Moreover, it is North Carolina State Government's
responsibility to provide this opportunity to every child by operating a
“general and uniform system of schools in which equal opportunities shall be
provided for all students.” Leandro v. State of North Carolina, 346 N.C. 336,
347, 488 S.E.2d 249, 255 (1997).
   (B)   Public schools are the responsibility of both state and local
government. The state has delegated in part to counties this responsibility.
The County of Camden (the “County”) is such a geographic subdivision of the
state, and is mandated by law to operate school facilities. Specifically, the
Camden County Board of Education is authorized and obligated for the provision
of such facilities.
   (C)   Although the public school system is primarily financed by the state,
the average county allocates nearly a third of its funds for the operation of
the public schools. Currently, Camden allocates approximately $1,106,158 for
the school’s expenses; $744,764 for existing debt; $200,000 for other capital
outlay; and $754,345 for the new school. Camden’s current total annual school
contribution for operations and debt service is $3,108,315.
   (D)   The public costs associated with the rapid pace of residential
development and the related burden on the county’s school system jeopardize the
county’s ability to provide the constitutionally mandated education.
      (1)   The annual growth rate of the county, in spite of the existing
moratorium is currently 7%. The estimated growth rate between the 2000 and 2005
census was 30%.
      (2)   During the school year 2003-2004, total enrollment at the county’s
three schools (Camden County High School, Camden County Middle School, and
Grandy Primary School) was 1,582. The county’s school enrollment is currently:
Grandy: 844 with capacity of 723/783; Middle: 434 with a capacity of 504/564;
and High: 528 with a capacity of 510/585.
      (3)   Based on estimated student generation rates developed by Tischler &
Associates, Fiscal, Economic, and Planning Consultants, hired by Camden County
in the report titled School Voluntary Mitigation Payments, the average student
generation for elementary school for detached units is .20; for middle school
.12; and for high school: .12. The total for all detached units and all other
housing types for the whole school system is .44 students per housing unit.
   (E)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of all county residents, but particularly the county’s children by
ensuring that adequate, constitutional, school facilities are available to all
children in Camden County, and that such facilities are available concurrent,
or roughly concurrent, with the demand for school facilities created by new
development.
   (F)   (1)   Pursuant to G.S. Ch.153A, the county is empowered to implement
land use and associated regulations that protect the health, safety, and
welfare of its citizens. Camden County adopts this chapter pursuant to its
police power, zoning authority, and its authority to regulate subdivisions.
      (2)   Specifically, the county’s authority to regulate based on its
police powers is found in G.S. § 153A-121, General Ordinance-Making Power,
where it is stated in section (a): “A county may by ordinance define, regulate,
prohibit, or abate acts, omissions, or conditions detrimental to the health,
safety, or welfare of its citizens and the peace and dignity of the county.”
      (3)   The county’s authority to regulate through zoning powers is found
in G.S. § 153A-340, Grant of Power, where it is stated in section (a): "For the
purpose of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare, a county
may adopt zoning and development regulations ordinances." The County's power to
regulate through zoning is also found in G.S. § 153A-341, Purposes in View,
where it is stated: “Zoning regulations shall be designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare. To that end, the regulations may address,
among other things, the following public purposes: to provide adequate light
and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of
population; to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire,
panic, and dangers; and to facilitate the efficient and adequate provision of
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public
requirements.”
      (4)   The county’s power to regulate subdivisions is found in G.S. §
153A-331, Contents and Requirements of Ordinance, where it is stated in section
(a): “A subdivision control ordinance may provide for the orderly growth and
development of the county; for the coordination of transportation networks and
utilities within proposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and
highways and with other public facilities; ... and for the distribution of
population and traffic in a manner that will avoid congestion and overcrowding
and will create conditions that substantially promote public health, safety,
and the general welfare.”
   (G)   In order to provide for the orderly growth of Camden County and to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, the county adopted an
Advanced Core CAMA Land Use Plan for Camden County on April 4, 2005. Camden
County’s Community vision, which is set forth in this plan, designates Camden
as an “area of controlled growth designed to maintain its rural and cultural
heritage.” The vision statement further provides: “The County will provide
improved infrastructure, quality subdivisions, and expanded recreational
opportunities.” Finally, “Future development will have as its foundation the
preservation of Camden County’s quality of life, including its natural
resources. Camden County will maintain a quality school system with no
overcrowding of schools.”
   (H)   Specifically, in regards to the county’s ability to provide adequate
public facilities, the county adopted, under its Code of Ordinances, Title XV:
Land Usage, §
151.346. This statute provides the County Commissioners with the discretion to
deny a conditional or special use permit even if the proposed development
complies with the county’s permit requirements if the Commissioners find that
the development:
      (1)   Will materially endanger the public health or safety;
      (2)   Will substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting
property;
      (3)   Will not be in harmony with the particular neighborhood or area in
which it is to be located (even though the proposed use and surrounding uses
are generally permissible in the same district and therefore usually
compatible);
      (4)   Will not be in general conformity with the land use plan,
thoroughfare plan, or other plan officially adopted by the Board; or
      (5)   Will exceed the county’s ability to provide adequate public
facilities, including, but not limited to schools, fire and rescue, law
enforcement, and other county facilities.
   (I)   Pursuant to G.S. § 153A-341, prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning
amendment, a county’s governing board shall adopt a statement describing
whether its action is consistent with an adopted Comprehensive Plan and
explaining why the Board considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the
public interest. The county finds that the provisions of G.S. § 153A-341 comply
with the North Carolina General Assembly’s recognition of the importance of the
Comprehensive Plan in guiding land development in North Carolina Counties.
   (J)   Other North Carolina local governments which have adopted adequate
public facilities ordinances specifically in regards to schools are: Cabarrus
County, Currituck County, Davidson County, Franklin County, Orange Counties,
and the Towns of Davidson and Harrisburg.
   (K)   The county adopted a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) in March 20,
2006, addressing four main categories: public school projects, county
facilities, water and sewer projects, and economic development projects. The
county intends to assure property owners and developers of property for
residential use, through the implementation of this plan for schools associated
with this chapter, that adequate school facilities will be put in place based
on a schedule of capital improvements reasonably related to projected
facilities need.
   (L)   In Camden County’s Advanced Core CAMA Land Use Plan (LUP), it is set
forth as a policy: “Camden County supports regulating growth to coincide with
the provision of public facilities and services.”
   (M)   It is further set forth in Camden County’s LUP in regards to
implementing actions: “Camden County will permit residential development to
occur in response to market needs provided that the following criteria are met:
      (1)   Due respect is offered to all aspects of the environment.
      (2)   If deficient community facilities and services are identified, the
county should attempt to improve such to the point of adequately meeting
demands.
      (3)   Additional residential development should concurrently involve
planning for improvements to community facilities and services if excess
capacity does not exist within those facilities and services.
      (4)   Residential development is consistent with other Camden County
policies and the land use map as contained in this plan update.”
   (N)   Currently, Camden County only has one school district. As such, each
student who becomes enrolled in the school system affects the entire school
system. However, since each school (elementary, middle, and high) has different
capacity numbers and different costs necessary to reach capacity, it is
necessary to view each school individually in order to properly arrive at
accurate numbers for determining capacity. In addition to school sites and
facilities, the Camden County Public Schools also have capital facilities and
equipment that serve all school levels and, therefore, respond to a system-wide
demand. These facilities and equipment include administrative and support
buildings (and associated sites), school buses, and portable classrooms as
presented in the School Voluntary Mitigation Payment report by Tischler &
Associates. Due to all of the foregoing reasons, advance of capacity cost is
determined by the Administrator as to the entire Camden County Public School
System, rather than based on each individual school. The only time each school
is considered individually, is for calculation purposes in the determination of
adequate capacity and needs.
   (O)   Camden County’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) represents the
community’s commitment to fund public facilities that are or may become
inadequate. The county, through the use of its CIP, addresses existing
infrastructure deficiencies, and hereby adopts this program in good faith,
intending to use its best efforts to ensure that the APFO is followed in
accordance with the CIP.
   (P)   The county hereby identifies Camden Schools Capital Needs Study
(CSCNS) and adopts same into Camden County CIP.

§ 153.02 IDENTIFICATION OF TYPES OF FACILITIES CONSIDERED.
   At this time, this chapter is considered and directed only at school
facilities. Camden County reserves the right to later add other facilities to
this chapter if it is determined by the Camden County Board of Commissioners
(BOC) that further protection is needed to prevent growth from outstripping the
provision of certain other facilities.
(Ord. 2007-01-01, passed 2-19-07)

§ 153.04 CERTIFICATE OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES AND EXEMPT
FACILITIES.
   (A)    The Camden County Board of Commissioners hereby establishes that,
except as provided otherwise herein, each application for a building permit for
the development of property for a residential use must be accompanied by a
Certificate of Adequate Public School Facilities (CAPS). Prior to the issuance
of a CAPS, the county must make a finding that adequate public school
facilities exist to support the expected student load generated by the subject
parcel.
   (B)   The Board of Commissioners, concurrent with the adoption of this
chapter, has established the methodology through which the county will
determine adequate school capacity, known as the Camden County Adequate Public
Facilities Ordinance Level of Services Standard and Advancement of Capacity
Formula (LSSACF).
   (C)   Recognizing the need for administrative ease and technical expertise
in the issuance of a CAPS, the BOC hereby delegates to the County Manager, or
his or her designee (the “Administrator”) the responsibility for the issuance
of CAPS pursuant to the terms and provisions of this chapter, and in keeping
with the standards established by the Board of Commissioners as set forth in
the LSSACF.
   (D)    Exceptions. It is the policy of the county that only such residential
development as will reasonably require school facilities will be subject to the
terms of this chapter. Thus, certain residential uses which have been
previously approved or which have been deemed by the BOC to be of minimal
impact on school facilities shall be exempt from the requirements of this
chapter. This chapter does not apply to any use, development, project,
structure, fence, sign or activity that does not create an impact on public
school facilities. At this time, the BOC has specifically found that the BOC
has been summoned by the Camden County tax-payers to retain the rural
atmosphere. Many landowners in Camden County operate businesses and it has
proven difficult for their children to come home to keep those businesses
running due to the high cost of living in Camden County. As such, the BOC feels
that due to the aid an exemption for parent to child and grandparent to
grandchild transfers would provide to the economic structure of Camden County,
coupled with the fact that the occurrence of these transfers are infrequent,
resulting in a minimal impact on the school system, this exemption achieves a
compelling governmental interest. The following is a list of exemptions the BOC
has determined to be of minimal impact on school facilities:
      (1)   Residential housing units located within a subdivision, as defined
by the UDO, that received preliminary plat and/or final development approval
prior to the time of adoption of this chapter; provided, however, that 365 days
from the date of adoption of this chapter, such exemption shall expire if no
application for final plat or building permit has been submitted to the county
for review; and
      (2)   Redevelopment of existing residential units and additions to
existing residential units; and
      (3)   Residential development permanently restricted to dormitory housing
for university students or age restricted units that cannot be permanently
occupied by residents under 55 years of age.
      (4)   The gift by a property owner of a single lot to each of the
property owner’s children, parents, grandparents or grandchildren provided
that:
         (a)   Lots created under this section shall be titled in the name of
the family member for whom the subdivision is made, for a period of no less
than five years or until their 18th birthday (whichever is greater), unless
lots are subject to an involuntary transfer, such as by foreclosure, death,
judicial sale, condemnation or bankruptcy.
         (b)   Lots created under the grandparents or grandchildren exemption
grantor shall have owned the property for previous ten years unless inherited
through testate or intestate succession
         (c)   If the original lot or parcel does not front on a publicly
dedicated, recorded and maintained street, or an easement recorded prior to
January 1, 2006, it shall have reasonable right-of-way, not less than 45 feet
in width, providing ingress and egress to a dedicated, recorded public street.
         (d)   The plat shall be signed by all persons having any real property
interest in any land included within the subdivision, including required
rights-of-way.

§ 153.05 LEVEL OF SERVICE AND CRITERIA FOR CAPS DETERMINATION.
   (A)   The Level of Service (LOS) Standard applied by this chapter is 100% of
facility capacity.
   (B)   The Board of Commissioners shall set a student generation rate for the
methodology set forth in the capacity formula, which is in turn set forth in
LSSACF and such rate shall be applied to each new residential unit to which
this chapter applies.
   (C)   If facility capacity for any school facility type (such as elementary,
middle, or high) is exceeded or will be exceeded by the calculated impact of
the proposed development, a CAPS shall not be issued and development and/or
recordation of final plat shall not proceed, except in accordance with the
provisions set forth in this chapter.
   (D)    All building permit approval requests subject to this chapter will be
submitted to the Administrator for a CAPS determination. The Administrator
shall use the following formulas in establishing CAPS eligibility:
      Current committed capacity + projected number of students generated
associated with development proposal = projected student capacity
      (1)   Projected student capacity must be less than, or equal to, facility
capacity for each facility type (such as: elementary, middle, and high) in
order for CAPS to be issued, unless advancement of capacity is provided as
specified in this chapter.
      (2)   Reserve capacity will be calculated on a monthly basis in a report
to the County Manager by the Planning Director or designee. Student enrollment
will be revised on a monthly basis (on the 30th day of each month) based on
information received from Camden County Schools and reported to the County
Manager or designee.
      (3)   Facility capacity will be updated yearly upon receipt by the county
of the Superintendent’s report, using total membership data provided by each
school.
   (E)   The applicant for a CAPS shall submit to the Administrator all
information reasonably deemed necessary by the Administrator to determine
whether a CAPS should be issued.
   (F)   An administrative fee of $25 per housing unit will be applied at the
time of CAPS application. No CAPS application will be processed until this
administrative fee is satisfied by cash or check.
   (G)   A CAPS certificate shall vest in the property owner to which it
applies the right to build in accordance with this chapter; and shall insure to
the benefit of such owner’s successors and assigns, and shall run with the
land; provided, however, that a CAPS shall expire upon expiration of the
preliminary plat approval or building permit for which it was issued in
accordance with the provisions of G.S. § 153A-358.
(Ord. 2007-01-01, passed 2-19-07 ; Am. Ord. 2007-10-03, passed 10-15-07 )
§ 153.06 DENIAL OF CAPS AND ADVANCEMENT OF CAPACITY.
   (A)   A CAPS application shall be issued only upon the finding that adequate
school facilities exist at the time of application. In the event that such
finding cannot be made, a CAPS cannot be issued. In such event, the applicant
may, at its option:
      (1)   Provide an Advancement of Capacity (AOC) to the county as
specified; or
      (2)   Appeal the denial of a CAPS certificate as described below; or
      (3)   Reapply for a CAPS at the earlier of such time as adequate capacity
exists, as determined by the county according to the criteria set forth in
LSSACF, or ten years.
   (B)   In the event that a finding of adequate facilities cannot be made such
that the Administrator denies an application for a CAPS, the county will issue
a CAPS for an initially denied application for the subject property at the
earliest or the three following dates:
      (1)   June 30th of the year in which the CSCNS and county CIP specifies
provision of adequate capacity at the schools in the attendance district(s)
over which the CAPS application was denied; or
      (2)   Actual provision of adequate capacity at the schools in the
attendance district(s) over which the CAPS application was denied; or
      (3)   Ten years from the original CAPS application date provided all
other conditions of approval specified in this chapter are met.
   (C)   If the Administrator determines that a CAPS cannot be issued due to
inadequate school capacity, an applicant may obtain a CAPS by providing an
Advancement of Capacity (AOC) in the form of:
      (1)   A payment as specified in LSSACF; or
      (2)   The dedication of land for the purpose of school facility
construction provided that such land is located within an area targeted for
school construction by the CSCNS and such dedication is approved by the Board
of Education; or
      (3)   The construction of school facilities in accordance with the CSCNS
and with the approval of the Board of Education; or
      (4)   Such other contributions as shall be acceptable by the Camden
County BOC upon a finding by the BOC that such contribution shall be in keeping
with the CSCNS and that such contribution is in the public interest and will
otherwise accomplish the goals of this chapter.

§ 153.07 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.
   (A)   The county hereby adopts and incorporates by reference the Camden
Schools Capital Needs Study (CSCNS).
   (B)   The CSCNS will identify scheduled capacity improvements to Camden
County Schools, and it shall establish the capacity of each school in each
year.
(Ord. 2007-01-01, passed 2-19-07)
§ 153.08 DEDICATION OF FUNDING TO SCHOOL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   All funds collected by the AOC established by this chapter shall be
dedicated to funding of school capital improvements. Said improvements must be
in keeping with the CSCNS and must actually expand capacity of schools and not
just provide ancillary or support facilities or improve existing facilities.
   (B)   AOC funds shall go towards either debt (i.e.: bond) repayment, or
direct capital funding of capacity improvements.
   (C)   If school attendance districts are realigned by the Camden County
Board of Education, the CAPS districts identified in this ordinance and LSSACF
of this chapter shall be automatically redefined and the County Finance Officer
shall be charged with reconciliation of AOC funds accordingly.
(Ord. 2007-01-01, passed 2-19-07)
§ 153.09 APPEALS REQUESTS.
   (A)   Appeals of CAPS determinations may be made to the Camden County Board
of Adjustment (BOA) within 30 days of the final CAPS determination in question.
Appeal requests must be made in writing to the Administrator. The BOA will
review all appeals requests within 30 days of appeal request at an evidentiary
hearing before it sitting as a quasi-judicial board. At the evidentiary
hearing, the Administrator will present his or her reasons for the denial of
the CAPS and the evidence it relied on in denying the CAPS. The applicant
appealing the denial may present its reasons why the CAPS application should
have, in its view, been approved and the evidentiary basis it contends supports
approval. The BOA may:
      (1)   Affirm the decision of the Administrator;
      (2)   Remand to the Administrator for further proceedings in the event
evidence is presented at the hearing before the BOA not brought before the
Administrator; or
      (3)   Issue a CAPS. The BOA will only issue a CAPS if it finds that the
CAPS should have been issued by the Administrator as prescribed in the LSSACF.
   (B)   No CAPS shall be issued while a CAPS determination is being appealed
until final action of the BOA regarding the appeal.

§ 154.01 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses
to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Camden
County, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious effect of sexually oriented businesses. The provisions of this
chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials or other expressive
activities, including sexually oriented materials or activities. Similarly it
is not the intent nor the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment of the
United States Constitution, or to deny access by the distributors and
exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither
is the intent nor effect of this chapter to in any way condone or legitimize
the distribution of obscene materials or materials harmful to minors. The
authority of this regulation is contained in G.S. §§ 153A-121, 153A-123, 160A-
181.1, 153A-134, and 153A-135.

§ 155.04 CREATION OF VOLUNTARY AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Regions. Camden County is hereby divided into five regions as defined
below:

      (3)   Shiloh Watershed District.
      (4)   North River Watershed District.

districts, which meet the following standards:
      (1)   The district shall contain a minimum of 20 contiguous acres of
qualified forest land: ten contiguous acres of qualified farm land; or five
contiguous acres of qualified horticultural land.
      (2)   All land enrolled in a region defined in division (A) above shall
be part of a single district. If a single farm has acreage in two or more
regions, the farm shall participate in the district where the largest acreage
is found. All land in a region as defined in division (A) above shall be
treated as a single district.
   (C)   Education. The county may take such action as it deems appropriate
through the Advisory Board or other entities or individuals to encourage the
formation of the districts and to further their purposes and objectives,
including the implementation of a public information program to reasonably
inform landowners of the Voluntary Agricultural District program.
   (D)   Addition. Qualifying farmland in a region with an existing district
shall be added to the district
as herein provided.
(Ord. 2013-04-01, passed 5-6-13)
§ 155.05 CERTIFICATION AND QUALIFICATION OF FARMLAND.
   Requirements. To secure county certification as qualifying farmland in a
Voluntary Agricultural District a farm must:
   (A)   Be participating in the farm present-use-value taxation program
established by G.S. § 105-277.2 through § 105-277.7, or is otherwise determined
by the county to meet all the qualifications of this program set forth in G.S.
§ 105-277.3.
   (B)   Be managed, if highly erodible land exists on the farm, in accordance
with the Natural Resources Conservation Service defined erosion-control
practices that are addressed to the highly-erodible land.
   (C)   Be the subject of a conservation agreement, as defined in G.S. § 121-
35, between the county and the owner of the land that prohibits non-farm use or
development of the land for a period of at least ten years, except for the
creation of not more than three lots that meet applicable county zoning and
subdivision regulations.
(Ord. 2013-04-01, passed 5-6-13)
§ 155.06 APPLICATION, APPROVAL, AND APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Application procedure.
      (1)   A landowner may apply to participate in the Voluntary Agricultural
District program by making application to the chairperson of the Advisory Board
or a designated staff person. The application shall be on forms provided by the
Advisory Board.
      (2)   A conservation agreement required by G.S. § 106-737 and defined in
G.S. § 121-35 to sustain, encourage, and promote agriculture must be executed
by the landowner with the Advisory Board, which shall record a certified copy
of such with the Camden County Register of Deeds. Permitted uses include
agriculture, horticulture, forestry, and outdoor recreation.
   (B)   Approval process.
      (1)   Upon submission of the application to the Advisory Board, the
Advisory Board shall meet within 30 days to approve or disapprove the
application. The chairperson shall notify the applicant by first class mail of
approval or disapproval of participation in a district.
      (2)   Upon receipt of an application, the chairperson will forward copies
immediately to the following offices which shall be asked to provide comments,
if any, to the Advisory Board prior to the date set for the Advisory Board vote
on the application:
         (a)   The Camden County tax assessor.
         (b)   The Camden Soil and Water Conservation District office.
   (C)   Appeal. If an application is denied by the Advisory Board, the
landowner may, within ten days of notification of disapproval of the
application, request in writing that the Advisory Board reconsider its
decision. The request for reconsideration shall state the reason(s) therefore.
Upon either an initial denial, if no request for reconsideration was made, or
denial after reconsideration, the landowner shall have 30 days from the date of
notification to appeal the decision to the Board of Commissioners. The appeal
shall be presented in writing. The decision of the Board of Commissioners is
final.
(Ord. 2013-04-01, passed 5-6-13)
§ 155.07 REVOCATION, ENFORCEMENT AND RENEWAL OF CONSERVATION AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Revocation and enforcement.
      (1)   By providing 30 days advance written notice to the Advisory Board,
a landowner of qualifying farmland within a district may revoke the
conservation agreement or the Advisory Board may revoke the same conservation
agreement based on noncompliance by the landowner, subject to the same
provisions as contained in §
155.06(C) for appeal of denials. Such revocation shall result in loss of
qualifying farm status and loss of eligibility to participate in a district.
Absent noncompliance by the landowner, neither the Advisory Board nor the Board
of Commissioners shall revoke any conservation agreement prior to its
expiration.
      (2)   If the Advisory Board shall revoke this conservation agreement for
cause, the landowner shall have the appeal rights set forth in §
155.06(C).
      (3)   Transfers of land in a district due to death of the landowner, sale
or gift shall not revoke the conservation agreement unless the land no longer
qualifies for the present-use-value taxation program or, in the event that
there are water or sewer assessments held in abeyance, the new owner(s) fails
to agree in writing to accept liability for those assessments in the event that
the land is withdrawn either voluntarily or involuntarily from the district.
      (4)   Enforcement of the terms of a conservation agreement for land
enrolled in a district shall be limited to revocation of the conservation
agreement and the benefits derived therefrom.
      (5)   A notice of revocation shall be recorded in the county land record
system sufficient to provide notice that the land has been withdrawn from the
Voluntary Agricultural District program.
   (B)   Renewal. A conservation agreement for land within a Voluntary
Agricultural District shall
be automatically renewed unless the landowner provides 30 day written notice to
the Advisory Board of intent not to renew. Absent noncompliance by the
landowner, neither the Advisory Board nor the Board of Commissioners shall fail
to renew any conservation agreement unless this chapter or its authorizing
legislation has been repealed.
(Ord. 2013-04-01, passed 5-6-13)
§ 155.08 WAIVER OF WATER AND SEWER ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   Water connections.
      (1)   A landowner within an established district shall not be required to
connect to Camden County water and/or sewer systems until such time as the
residential portion of the property is subdivided or with the intent to sell.
      (2)   At the time a subdivision of the residential property is proposed
the subdivision shall comply with Chapter 50 of the Camden County Code of
Ordinances.
   (B)   Abeyance. Any special assessments established for the water and/or
sewer system shall be held in abeyance, without interest for farms in a
district, until improvements on the property are connected to the water or
sewer system for which the assessment was made.
   (C)   Termination of abeyance. When the period of abeyance ends, the
assessment is payable in accordance with the terms set out in the assessment
resolution.
   (D)   Suspension of statute of limitations. Statutes of limitations are
suspended during the time that any assessment is held in abeyance without
interest. The landowner may be required to sign an acknowledgment (that may be
incorporated into the conservation agreement) of the abeyance of the statute of
limitations upon collecting water and sewer assessments, or other utility
assessments.
   (E)   Other statutory abeyance procedures. Nothing in this section is
intended to diminish the authority of the county to hold assessments in
abeyance under G.S. § 153A-201, or other applicable law.
   (F)   Conflict with water and/or sewer system construction and improvements
grants. To the extent that this section conflicts with the terms of federal,
state, or other grants under which county utility systems are constructed this
section shall not apply. This section shall not apply to utilities that are not
owned by the county unless the county has entered into an agreement with the
entity(ies) owning the utilities and that agreement provides that this chapter
shall apply.
(Ord. 2013-04-01, passed 5-6-13)
§ 155.09 PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. G.S. § 106-740 provides that no state or local public agency
or governmental unit may formally initiate any action to condemn any interest
in qualifying farmland within a district until such agency or unit has
requested the Advisory Board to hold a public hearing on the proposed
condemnation. This provision ensures that the condemning agency or unit
considers the impact of its actions upon agriculture, forestry, and/or
horticultural prior to taking action that is not reversible. This provision is
not intended to, and does not prohibit, the condemning agency or unit from
taking action authorized by law.
   (B)   Procedure.
      (1)   Upon receiving a request, the Advisory Board shall publish notice
describing the proposed action in the appropriate newspapers of Camden County
within five business days of the request, and will in the same notice notify
the public of a public hearing on the proposed condemnation, to be held within
ten days of receipt of the request.
      (2)   The Advisory Board shall meet to review:
         (a)   Whether the need for the project has been satisfactorily
established by the agency or unit of government involved, including a review of
any fiscal impact analysis conducted by the agency involved; and
         (b)   Whether there are alternatives to the proposed action that have
less impact and are less disruptive to the agricultural activities of the
district within which the proposed action is to take place.
      (3)   The Advisory Board shall consult with the County Agricultural
Extension Agent, the Natural Resources Conservation Service District
Conservationist, and any other individuals, agencies, or organizations deemed
by the Advisory Board to be necessary for its review of the proposed action.
      (4)   Within five days after the hearing, the Advisory Board shall make a
report containing its findings and recommendations regarding the proposed
action. The report shall be made available to the public prior to its being
conveyed to the decision-making body of the agency proposing the acquisition.
      (5)   There will be a period of ten days allowed for public comment on
the report of the Advisory Board.
      (6)    After the ten day period for public comment has expired, the
Advisory Board shall submit a final report containing all of its findings and
recommendations regarding the proposed action to the decision making body of
the agency proposing the acquisition.
      (7)   The total time period, from the day that a request for a hearing
has been received to the day that a final report is issued to the decision
making body of the agency proposing the acquisition, shall not exceed 30 days.
If the agency agrees to an extension, the agency and the Advisory Board shall
mutually agree upon a schedule to be set forth in writing and made available to
the public.
      (8)   Pursuant to G.S. § 106-740, the Board of Commissioners shall not
permit any formal initiation of condemnation by local agencies while the
proposed condemnation is properly before the Advisory Board.
(Ord. 2013-04-01, passed 5-6-13)
§ 155.10 NOTIFICATION.

   (A)   Duty of the Advisory Board. It shall be the duty of the Advisory Board
to advise the Board of Commissioners or the agency or office to which the Board
of Commissioners delegate authority to oversee county land use planning, on the
status, progress, and activities of the county's Voluntary Agricultural
District program and to also coordinate the formation and maintenance of

use plan if one currently exists at the time this is enacted or when one is
formed.
   (B)   Posting of notice. The following notice, of a size and form suitable
for posting, shall be posted in the office of the Register of Deeds, and any
other office or agency the Advisory Board deems necessary:
      Camden County has established Districts to protect and preserve
agricultural lands and activities. These Districts have been developed and
mapped by the county to inform all purchasers of real property that certain
agricultural and forestry activities, including but not limited to pesticide
spraying, manure spreading, machinery and truck operation, livestock
operations, sawing, and other common farming activities may occur in these
Districts any time during the day or night. Maps and information on the
location and establishment of these Districts can be obtained from the North
Carolina Cooperative Extension Service office, the office of the Register of
Deeds, the County Planning office, or the Natural Resources Conservation
Service office.
   (C)   Growth corridors. At such time as the county might establish
designated growth corridors. Districts shall not be permitted in the designated
growth corridors, as delineated on the official county planning map without the
approval of the Board of Commissioners. Districts located in growth corridors
designated after the effective date of this program may remain, but shall not
be expanded within the growth corridor area without the approval of the Board
of Commissioners.
