   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private

pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any person to block,
obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any building open to the
public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following

meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including

and public facilities, the dedication or reservation of recreation areas or for
the provision of funds to be used to acquire recreation areas and for the
distribution of population and traffic in a manner that will avoid congestion
and overcrowding.
   (C)   Automatic amendment. Whenever any provision of this ordinance refers
to or cites a section of the General Statutes or a state or federal department
rule or regulation and that section is later amended or superseded, the
ordinance shall be deemed amended to refer to the amended section or the
section that most nearly corresponds to the superseded section.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, § 1.2; Ord. passed - -2021)
§ 151.003 JURISDICTION.

(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, § 1.3; Ord. passed - -2021)
§ 151.004 CONTINUITY.
   (A)   This Unified Development Ordinance replaces and supersedes both the
Town Zoning Ordinance dated July 20, 1982 and the Town Beach Subdivision
Ordinance dated October 15, 1996 and all amendments made to these two
documents.
   (B)   Any nonconforming use, structure or other requirement of the previous
zoning documents shall be considered to be out of compliance with the Unified
Development Ordinance.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, § 1.4)
§ 151.005 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   These regulations shall become effective on February 10, 2009 and on that
date, these regulations shall supersede, repeal and replace the Town Zoning

(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, § 1.5)
§ 151.006 RELATIONSHIP TO LAND USE PLAN.
   It is the intention of the Town Commissioners, hereafter referred to as the
“Town Commissioners,” that this ordinance implements the planning policies
adopted for the town, as reflected in the land use plan and other planning
documents. While the Town Commissioners reaffirm their commitment that this
ordinance and any amendment to it conform to the adopted planning policies, the
Town Commissioners hereby express their intent that neither this ordinance nor
any amendment to it may be challenged based on any alleged nonconformity with
any planning document.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, § 1.6)

sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Unified
Development Ordinance are severable. If any section, paragraph, sentence,
clause or phrase is declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court
of competent jurisdiction in a valid judgment or decree, the
unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining
sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases of this ordinance, since

phrase.

shall install in conjunction with the tiling catch basins as may be required by
the Town Zoning Administrator after taking into consideration the length of the

§ 151.023 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   (A)   Governing board. A governing board member shall not vote on any
legislative decision regarding a development regulation adopted pursuant to
this chapter where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably
likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact
on the member. A governing board member shall not vote on any zoning amendment
if the landowner of the property subject to a rezoning petition or the
applicant for a text amendment is a person with whom the member has a close
familial, business, or other associational relationship.
   (B)   Appointed Boards. Members of appointed Boards shall not vote on any
advisory or legislative decision regarding a development regulation adopted
pursuant to this chapter where the outcome of the matter being considered is
reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable
financial impact on the member. An appointed Board member shall not vote on any
zoning amendment if the landowner of the property subject to a rezoning
petition or the applicant for a text amendment is a person with whom the member
has a close familial, business, or other associational relationship.
   (C)   Administrative staff.
      (1)   No staff member shall make a final decision on an administrative
decision required by this chapter if the outcome of that decision would have a
direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the staff
member or if the applicant or other person subject to that decision is a person
with whom the staff member has a close familial, business, or other
associational relationship. If a staff member has a conflict of interest under
this section, the decision shall be assigned to the supervisor of the staff
person or such other staff person as may be designated by the development
regulation or other ordinance.
      (2)   No staff member shall be financially interested or employed by a
business that is financially interested in a development subject to regulation
under this chapter unless the staff member is the owner of the land or building
involved. No staff member or other individual or an employee of a company
contracting with a local government to provide staff support shall engage in
any work that is inconsistent with his or her duties or with the interest of
the local government, as determined by the local government.
   (D)   Quasi-judicial decisions. A member of any Board exercising quasi-
judicial functions pursuant to this chapter shall not participate in or vote on
any quasi-judicial matter in a manner that would violate affected persons'
constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations
of due process include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion
prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex
parte communications, a close familial, business, or other associational
relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of
the matter.
   (E)   Resolution of objection. If an objection is raised to a Board member's
participation at or prior to the hearing or vote on a particular matter and
that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members of the
Board shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
   (F)   Familial relationship. For purposes of this section, a "close familial
relationship" means a spouse, parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, or
grandchild. The term includes the step, half, and in-law relationships.
(Ord. passed - -2021)
§ 151.024 WHO MAY APPLY; APPROVALS RUN WITH LAND; VESTED RIGHTS; REVOCATION.
   (A)   Applications for development approvals may be made by the landowner, a
lessee or person holding an option or contract to purchase or lease land, or an
authorized agent of the landowner. An easement holder may also apply for
development approval for such development as is authorized by the easement.
   (B)   Unless provided otherwise by law, all rights, privileges, benefits,
burdens, and obligations created by development approvals made pursuant to the
Code of Minnesott Beach pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D attach to and run with
the land.
   (C)   Upon issuance of a development permit, the statutory vesting granted
by G.S. § 160D-108(c) for a development project is effective upon filing of the
application in accordance with G.S. § 143-755, for so long as the permit
remains valid pursuant to law. Unless otherwise specified by G.S. § 160D-108 or
other statute, local development permits expire one year after issuance unless
work authorized by the permit has substantially commenced.
   (D)   A vested right is established with respect to any property upon the
valid approval, or conditional approval, of a site-specific vesting plan as
provided in G.S. § 160D-108.1. Such a vested right confers upon the landowner
the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the property
under the terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan, including any
amendments thereto.
   (E)   Except where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or the
Code of Minnesott Beach, the statutory vesting granted by G.S. § 160D-108, once
established, expires for an uncompleted development project if development work
is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24
consecutive months.
   (F)   Notwithstanding division (C) of this section, a building permit issued
pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D, Article 11 expires by limitation six months
after the date of issuance if the work authorized by the permit has not been
commenced. If, after commencement, the work is discontinued for a period of 12
months, the permit shall immediately expire. No work authorized by any building

   (A)   Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals from and review any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official charged with enforcement of this chapter.

Chair, may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request
issuance of a subpoena, persons with standing under G.S. § 160D-1402(c) may
make a written request to the Chair explaining why it is necessary for certain
witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The Chair shall issue requested
subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope,
and not oppressive. The Chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a
subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the Chair may be appealed to
the full Board. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued pursuant
to this section, the Board or the party seeking the subpoena may apply to the
General Court of Justice for an order requiring that its subpoena be obeyed,
and issue these orders after notice to all proper parties the court shall have
jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all proper parties.
   (E)   Oath. The Chair of the Board, or any member acting as chair, and the

falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (F)   Variance; in general. When unnecessary hardships would result from
carrying out the strict letter of the UDO, the Board may vary any of the
provisions of the UDO upon a showing of all of the following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the UDO. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the UDO, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice
is achieved. Provided, however, no change in permitted uses may be authorized
by variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided
that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.
   (G)   Variance; Federal Fair Housing Act. Notwithstanding the provisions of
division (F) above, the Board may provide for a variance under the Federal Fair
Housing Act upon the following:
      (1)   Application requirements; determination of completeness.
         (a)   Persons authorized to file applications. An application for a
reasonable accommodation may be filed only by the owner of the land affected by
the reasonable accommodation; an agent, lessee, or contract purchaser
specifically authorized by the owner to file such application; or any unit of
government that is not the owner of the lot but proposes to acquire the lot by
purchase, gift, or condemnation.
         (b)   Pre-application conference. Before filing an application for a
reasonable accommodation, the applicant may request a pre-application
conference with the Zoning Administrator.
         (c)   Application filing. An application for a reasonable
accommodation shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator. No filing fee is
required for such application. Once the application is complete, the Zoning
Administrator shall schedule the application for consideration at a hearing
before the Board, and shall transmit to the Board all applications and other
records pertaining to such reasonable accommodation prior to the hearing on the
application.
      (2)   Approval criteria. The Board shall grant a reasonable accommodation
to any provision of the UDO if it finds by a greater weight of the evidence
that the proposed reasonable accommodation is determined to be both reasonable
and necessary, in accordance with the following:
         (a)   Reasonable. An accommodation will be determined to be reasonable
if it would not undermine the legitimate purposes and effects of existing
planning regulations, and if it will not impose significant financial and
administrative burdens upon the town and/or constitute a substantial or
fundamental alteration of the UDO's provisions; and
         (b)   Necessary. An accommodation will be determined to be necessary
if it would provide direct or meaningful therapeutic amelioration of the
effects of the particular disability or handicap, and would afford an equal
opportunity to enjoy and use housing in residential areas in the town.
      (3)   Effect of approval or denial.
         (a)   After the Board approves a reasonable accommodation, the
applicant shall follow the normal procedures set forth in the UDO, and any
other applicable ordinance, for approval of any permits, certificates, and
other approvals required in order to proceed with development or use of the
property. All orders, decisions, determinations, and interpretations made by
administrative officers under those procedures shall be consistent with the
reasonable accommodation granted by the Board.
         (b)   The Board shall refuse to hear a reasonable accommodation
request that has been previously denied, unless it finds that there have been
substantial changes in the conditions or circumstances relating to the matter.
      (4)   Lapse. Failure of an applicant to apply for a building permit or
any other required development permit, and commence uninterrupted construction
or action with regard to a variance granted hereunder within one year of
receiving approval of the reasonable accommodation shall automatically render
the variance null and void.
   (H)   Decision. As used in this chapter, the term "decision" includes any
final and binding order, requirement, or determination for special use permits.
The Board shall follow quasi-judicial procedures when deciding appeals and
requests for variances and special use permits. The Board shall hear and decide
all matters upon which it is required to pass under any statute or this
subchapter.

§ 151.076 APPEALS.
   The Board shall hear and decide appeals from decisions of administrative
officials charged with enforcement of this subchapter, pursuant to all of the
following:
   (A)   Any person who has standing under G.S. §§ 160D-1-02 and 160D-1402 or
the town may appeal a decision to the Board. An appeal is taken by filing a
notice of appeal with the Town Clerk and payment of any applicable fees adopted
by the Town. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.
   (B)   The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the
owner of the property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who
sought the decision, if different from the owner. The written notice shall be
delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail.
   (C)   The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the
written notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing
to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or
constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.
   (D)   It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to
appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing
the words "Zoning Decision" in letters at least six inches high and identifying
the means to contact an official for information about the decision is
prominently posted on the property that is the subject of the decision,
provided the sign remains on the property for at least ten days. Posting of
signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting shall be
the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the posting
shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Absent an ordinance
provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall not be required.
   (E)   The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the
appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if
the appellant is not the owner.
   (F)   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays
enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed
during the pendency of the appeal to the Board and any subsequent appeal in
accordance with G.S. § 160D-1402 or during the pendency of any civil proceeding
authorized by law or appeals therefrom, unless the official who made the
decision certifies to the Board after notice of appeal has been filed that
because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril
to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay
would seriously interfere with enforcement of this subchapter. In that case,
enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order,
which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the
appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the
appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15
days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of
decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a
2024 S-10
proposed use of property is consistent with this subchapter shall not stay the
further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such
property; in these situations the appellant may request and the Board may grant
a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected
by the issue being appealed.
   (G)   Subject to the provisions of division (F) of this section, the Board
shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
   (H)   The official who made the decision, or his or her successor if the
official is no longer employed by the town, shall be present at the hearing as
a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated
in the notice of appeal. If any party or the town would be unduly prejudiced by
the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board
shall continue the hearing. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any order, requirement,
decision, or determination that ought to be made. The Board shall have all the
powers of the official who made the decision.
   (I)   When hearing an appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall
be based on the record as defined by G.S. § 160D-1402(h) and the scope of
review shall be as provided in G.S. § 160D-1402(j).
   (J)   The parties to an appeal that has been made under this chapter may
agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution.

   In addition to any other penalties and remedies allowed under the town's
code of ordinances, if a building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure or land is used in violation of this subchapter, the town, in

NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES
§ 151.110 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this ordinance, there may exist
structures and uses of land and structures, which were lawful before the
original town zoning ordinance of July 20, 1982 was passed but which were
prohibited under that ordinance and its amendment and would be prohibited under
the terms of this ordinance. It is the intent of this Unified Development
Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue but they shall in no case
be expanded except as provided for in §
151.112(A).
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, § 4.1)
§ 151.111 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.

(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, § 4.2)
§ 151.112 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES DUE TO PHYSICAL RESTRICTIONS.
   Except as otherwise provided in Chapter 151 of the Unified Development
Ordinance, where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this
ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot or other requirements concerning the structure, the
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions.
   (A)   Nonconforming structures (except accessory buildings/structures) may
be enlarged only if the enlarged part of the structure meets the setback and
height requirements for the zone in which it is located.
   (B)   Nothing in this ordinance shall be taken to prevent the restoration of
a building damaged to the extent of not more than 75% of its assessed tax
value, by fire, explosion or other cause, act of God or the public enemy, nor
the continued occupancy or use of the building or part thereof which is
existing at the time of the partial destruction. Nonconforming buildings
damaged to an extent greater than 75% of the assessed tax value, or buildings
voluntarily razed, may be restored or replaced only by meeting the requirements
specified for substandard lots of record in §
151.212.
   (C)   Should the structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.

4.3; Ord. passed 5-10-2022; Ord. passed 2023, § 2)
§ 151.113 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND AND/OR BUILDINGS.

imposed by this ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful provided:
   (A)   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to
occupy a greater area than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this ordinance;
   (B)   If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of more than
90 days, any subsequent use shall conform to the uses specified by this
ordinance for the district involved. Only the Board of Adjustment or the courts
can grant extension of this period; and
   (C)   No additional structures that do not conform to requirements of this
ordinance shall be erected in connection with nonconforming uses.

Mayor and Town Clerk and bearing the seal of the town under the following

forth for amendment of this ordinance. These changes shall be entered on the
official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the Town
Commissioners, with an entry on the official zoning map as follows:
“On                                , by official action of the Town Board of
Commissioners, the following changes were made in the Official Zoning Map:
                                                                       .”
   (B)   The entry shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the Town Clerk.
   (C)   No amendment to the official zoning map shall become effective until
the change has been officially mapped and recorded.
   (D)   If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed
inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect
of also amending any future land-use map in the approved plan, and no
additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. A
plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The plan
consistency statement is not subject to judicial review. For a future land use
map that is deemed amended, if it is a CAMA plan, then such amendment is not
effective until it goes through the CAMA plan-amendment process.

INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
§ 151.140 LOCATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where boundaries prove to be uncertain as to their location on the official
zoning map, the following rules shall apply.
   (A)   Streets, rights-of-way and easements. Boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways or alleys shall be
construed to follow the centerlines.
   (B)   Lot lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot
lines shall be construed as following the lot line.
   (C)   Corporate limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following town
limits shall be construed as following the town limits.
   (D)   Property division. If a district boundary divides a lot, the
requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies
shall be extended to the balance of the lot, provided that the extension shall
not include any part of lot which lies more than 50 feet beyond the district
boundary, and further provided that the remaining parcel shall not be less than
the minimum required for the district in which it is located.
   (E)   Vacation and abandonment. Where any public street, alley or road is
hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to
parcels of abutting property shall apply to that portion of the street, alley
or road added thereto by virtue of the vacation or abandonment.
   (F)   Shorelines. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be
construed to follow those shorelines, and in the event of change in the
shoreline shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline.
   (G)   Further interpretation. In instances where uncertainty exists, the
Board of Adjustment shall interpret the intent of the map as to location of the
boundaries.

the useable property in the development shall be developed for residential uses
and the Town Commissioners may set a higher standard for residential use. A
wide range of uses are possible in an R-MU development, and the specific uses
allowed may be different in each R-MU development. Notwithstanding §

and approved by the Town Commissioners shall be treated as permitted uses
within the R-MU development.
      (2)   Mixed uses encouraged. Mixed use developments are strongly
encouraged in the R-MU zoning district, including the mixing of principal
residential uses with principal nonresidential uses.

the same building (e.g., retail on ground floor, office space above), or by
having two or more principal uses located in different buildings sited on the
same lot or parcel (e.g. freestanding child day care center located on the same
parcel as an office building). Mixed location uses in all cases must be
compatible as determined by the Town Commissioners.
   (J)   Designation procedure.
      (1)   Designation of an R-MU development shall require a rezoning

property.
   (K)   Standards. The following standards apply:
      (1)   Minimum tract size. The minimum tract size for an R-MU development
shall be 20 acres.
There shall be no more than four dwelling units of ownership, on average, for
each acre of the R-MU development property utilized. The term UTILIZED is

naturally occurring bodies of water, minus the roads, rights-of-way, utilities
and service buildings, and minus the unbuildable wetland areas and other bodies
of water contained within the plot.
      (2)   Lot size. The average lot size for single-family lots within the R-
MU development with frontage on a naturally occurring body of water shall be
three-fourths of an acre; otherwise, the average size of all single family lots
within R-MU development shall be one-half of an acre. There shall be no minimum
lot size for other structures in the R-MU development provided the proposed lot
sizes are set forth in the master plan and approved by the Town Commissioners.
The minimum lot sizes established hereunder may be waived by the Town
Commissioners, in its sole discretion, upon an affirmative finding that the
public health, safety and welfare will not be negatively impacted by the waiver
and is consistent with the General Statutes and other laws of the state.
      (3)   Wastewater treatment. All wastewater treatment of effluent
generated within the R-MU development must be through a State DENR approved
treatment and disposal system operated by either a unit of government or an
approved licensed public utility with a franchise granted by the State
Utilities Commission. Properly permitted septic systems by either county or
state agencies may be allowed for the treatment of wastewater effluent until it
is feasible to develop public wastewater treatment facilities for the R-MU
development and as required by the homeowner’s association for connection to
the public system. Wastewater treatment plans shall be included as a required
part of the final phase presentation and no approval will be considered until
all necessary permitting is secured and is presented with the plan.
      (4)   Water supply. All water supplied to property within the R-MU
development must be through an approved system operated by either a unit of
government or an approved licensed public utility with a franchise granted by
the State Utilities Commission. The water supply shall not deteriorate
or in any way affect the supply, pressure or quality of the existing public
water system when supplying water to the development.
      (5)   Setback; single family detached. The following minimum setbacks
shall apply for single- family detached dwellings:
 
Minimum front yard setback line 35 feet
Minimum side yard setback line  15 feet
Minimum rear yard setback line  25 feet
 
      (6)   Setback; single-family attached and two-family. The following
minimum setbacks shall apply for single-family attached dwellings and two-
family and multi-family dwellings:
 
Minimum front yard setback line    30 feet
Minimum rear yard setback line     15 feet
Minimum side yard setback line     15 feet
Minimum distance between buildings 15 feet
 
      (7)   Setback; other structures.  Setback; non-residential. There shall
be no minimum setback for non-residential structures in the R-MU development
provided the proposed setbacks are set forth in the approved master plan and
approved by the Town Commissioners.
      (8)   Other minimum specifications for residential buildings:
         (a)   Single family detached: refer to R-20 zoning requirements.
         (b)   Single family attached and multi-family: refer to R-M zoning

151.354.
         (b)   All base, material and paving must meet the then current
secondary road standards of the state.
         (c)   In all cases, there must be a maintenance agreement for all
streets.
         (d)   Further, in the event that any street in an R-MU development
shall not be constructed to minimum standards sufficient to allow its inclusion
in the state highway system for maintenance and is approved in the master plan,
a street disclosure and maintenance agreement to be recorded with the plat or
deeds as provided under §
151.354(G) of this ordinance shall be required.
      (9)   Environmental buffers. Variations from the minimum federal and
state mandated environmental buffers shall not be allowed without requisite
approvals from the appropriate federal and state agency.
      (10)   Common space. Each R-MU development shall provide adequate
private, common open space facilities including both active and passive

SIGNS
§ 151.245 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this subchapter to permit signs of a commercial,
industrial and residential nature in districts that have appropriate uses and
to regulate the size, placement, and design of signs intended to be seen from a
public right-of-way. The sign regulations in this chapter are not intended to
censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended to regulate
the adverse secondary effects of signs. The sign regulations are especially
intended to address the secondary effects that may adversely impact aesthetics
and traffic and pedestrian safety. This subchapter is not intended to extend
its regulatory regime to objects that are not traditionally considered signs
for the purpose of government regulations.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, §
12.1; Ord. passed 5-30-2023, § 2)
§ 151.246 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   All signs within the jurisdictional area shall be covered by these
regulations and shall be erected and maintained in accordance with the
provisions of this subchapter. Only those signs that are listed in this
subchapter shall be erected within the jurisdictional area of this subchapter.
   (A)   Traffic safety. No sign shall be erected or continued that:
      (1)   Obstructs the line of sight at intersections or along a public
right-of-way;
      (2)   Would tend by its location, color or nature to be confused with or
obstruct the view of traffic signs or signals, or would tend to be confused
with a flashing light of an emergency vehicle; and
      (3)   Uses admonitions such as “stop,” “go,” “slow,” “danger” and the
like, which might be confused with traffic directional signals and signs.
   (B)   Maintenance.  
      (1)   Whenever a sign becomes structurally unsafe or endangers the safety
of a building or the public, the Zoning Administrator shall order that the sign
be made safe or removed. A period of ten days following receipt of the order by
the person, firm, or corporation owning or using the sign shall be allowed for
compliance.
      (2)   Temporary signs.
         (a)   Temporary banner signs must be removed after three months.
         (b)   All other temporary signs must be removed after 12 months.

   (C)   Construction prohibited. No sign shall be attached to or painted on
any telephone pole, light pole, telegraph pole or other human-made object not
intended to support a sign or any tree, rock or other natural object.
   (D)   Illumination.  
      (1)   Illumination devices such as, but not limited to, floor or spot
lights shall be so placed and shielded as to prevent the rays of illumination
there from being cast on neighboring buildings or vehicles approaching on
public right-of-way from any direction.
      (2)   Temporary signs may not be illuminated.
   (E)   Prohibited signs. The following signs are specifically prohibited,
unless otherwise specified in this subchapter:

window, door, fire escape, stairway, ladder, or opening intended to provide
light, air, ingress, or egress to any building.
      (9)   Discontinued signs, including all structural, support, and other
related elements.
      (10)   Signs made wholly or partially of highly reflective material, so
as to generate a contrast between the sign and adjacent surfaces or the
surrounding area.
      (11)   Signs on roofs.
      (12)   Signs erected or lighted in such a manner or in such a location as
to obstruct the view of, or be confused with, any authorized traffic signal,
notice, or control device.
      (13)   Feather signs.
      (14)   Neon signs.
      (15)   Electronic changeable message signs.

§ 151.247 SIGN ADMINISTRATION, FILING PROCEDURE AND PERMITS.
   (A)   Administration. The Zoning Administrator shall only issue a permit for
the erection or construction of a sign which meets the requirements of this
subchapter.
   (B)   Filing procedure. Applications for permits to erect, hang, place,
paint or alter the structure of a sign shall be submitted on forms obtainable
from the Zoning Administrator. Each application shall be accompanied by a plan
showing the following:
      (1)   The area of the sign;
      (2)   The size, character, general layout and designs proposed for
painted displays;
      (3)   The method and type of illumination;
      (4)   The location proposed for the signs in relation to property lines,
zoning district boundaries, right-of-way lines and existing signs; and
      (5)   If conditions warrant it, the Zoning Administrator may require
additional information as will enable him or her to determine if the sign is to
be erected in conformance with these regulations.
      (6)   The applicant for a temporary sign permit shall deposit a sum in
accordance with the approved town fee schedule with the Zoning Administrator to
ensure proper removal of the temporary sign when its purpose ceases to exist or
when the permit period expires, whichever is the shorter period of time. The
deposit shall be returned to the applicant upon the satisfaction of the
requirements for removal.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, §
12.3; Ord. passed 5-30-2023, § 4)
§ 151.248 SIGNS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE A PERMIT.
   (A)   Temporary signs. Temporary signs measuring nine square feet or smaller
may be erected, hung, or placed without a permit but must otherwise follow the
regulations in this subchapter.
   (B)   Municipal signs. Signs erected, hung, or placed by the Town of
Minnesott Beach do not require permits.
   (C)   Zoning and subdivision jurisdiction boundaries.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, §
12.4; Ord. passed 5-30-2023, § 5)
§ 151.249 SIGNS WHICH REQUIRE A PERMIT.
   No sign except those listed in §
151.248 shall be erected, hung, placed, or structurally altered without a
permit from the Zoning Administrator. The following signs shall be erected,
hung, placed or structurally altered only after the Zoning Administrator has
issued a permit and the minimum requirements for the signs are met.
   (A)   Principal use signs.
      (1)   Each principal use sign shall require a permit.
      (2)   Principal use signs may be illuminated.
      (3)   Principal use signs shall meet the setback requirements set forth
elsewhere in this subchapter.
   (B)   Outdoor advertising signs.
      (1)   Outdoor advertising signs are herein regulated in the interest of
promoting traffic safety, safeguarding health and community appearance,
prohibiting the overcrowding of land and protecting the character of the area
in which they are located. In general, it is intended that outdoor advertising
signs be regulated to permit standard size signs, to protect the character of
the area wherein outdoor advertising signs are located and to conserve property
value in these areas, and that outdoor advertising signs be located away from
adjoining properties and nearby buildings to prevent damage from wind toppled
signs.
      (2)   In addition:
         (a)   No outdoor advertising sign may exceed 32 square feet.
Extensions or cutouts are not allowed. The area of an outdoor advertising sign
is measured by finding the area of the minimum imaginary rectangle or square of
vertical and horizontal lines, which fully enclose the sign, excluding supports
and/or the base of the sign;
         (b)   The maximum height of outdoor advertising signs shall not exceed
ten feet;
         (c)   The minimum spacing requirement of outdoor advertising signs
shall be 1,000 feet apart on one side of the street;
         (d)   Outdoor advertising signs shall be set back a distance equal to
the minimum setback requirements for the district in which they are located. In
districts without setback requirements, these signs shall be at least ten feet
from any right-of-way line or property line and 50 feet from the center of any
road intersection;
         (e)   An outdoor advertising sign may be illuminated;
         (f)   Outdoor advertising signs shall require a permit;
         (g)   The backs of all structures shall be painted in a neutral color
to blend with surrounding areas; and
         (h)   Shrubbery may be planted around sign bases.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, §
12.5; Ord. passed 5-30-2023, § 6)
§ 151.250 SIGN SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All signs described in §§
151.248 and
151.249 shall be set back at least ten feet from any public right-of-way or
property line.
   (B)   All signs described in §§
151.248 and
151.249 shall be set back at least 50 feet from the centerline of any road
intersection unless more stringent requirements are noted elsewhere in this
subchapter.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, §
12.6; Ord. passed 5-30-2023, § 7)
§ 151.251 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   Any permanent conforming sign existing prior to May 30, 2023, which becomes
non-conforming by the application of the provisions of this subchapter, shall
have one year to bring such sign into conformance with these provisions. The
non-conforming sign shall not be enlarged, extended, or altered except that the
change may make the sign become conforming to this code. Temporary signs that
were conforming prior to May 30, 2023, which become non-conforming by the
application of this subchapter, shall have three months to make only such
alterations as will make the sign conforming.
(Ord. passed 5-30-2023, § 8)
AMENDMENTS
§ 151.265 WHO MAY PETITION.
   (A)   A petition for a zoning amendment may be initiated by the Town
Commissioners, the Planning Board, the owner of any property within the zoning
jurisdiction of the town, any resident within the zoning jurisdiction of the
town or any person with a legal interest in real property within the zoning
jurisdiction of the town.
   (B)   No amendment to zoning regulations or the zoning map that down-zones
property shall be initiated nor is it enforceable without the written consent
of all property owners whose property is the subject of the down-zoning
amendment, unless the down-zoning amendment is initiated by the town. For
purposes of this section, "down-zoning" means a zoning ordinance that affects
an area of land in one of the following ways:
      (1)   By decreasing the development density of the land to be less dense
than was allowed under its previous usage.
      (2)   By reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in a
zoning ordinance or land development regulation to fewer uses than were allowed
under its previous usage.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, §
13.1; Ord. passed 7-6-2022, § 2.20)

(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, § 13.3)
§ 151.268 AMENDMENT SUBMISSION.
   (A)   All proposed zoning amendments to this ordinance or to the zoning map
shall be submitted to the Planning Board for review and comment. The review and

2024 S-10
   (B)   The Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed
amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and
any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning Board shall
provide a written recommendation within 30 days of referral of the requested
amendment to the governing board that addresses plan consistency and other
matters as deemed appropriate by the Planning Board. A comment by the Planning
Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan
shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the
governing board.
   (C)   The Planning Board recommendation is not binding on the Town
Commissioners.
(Ord. passed 2-10-2009, §
13.4; Ord. passed 7-6-2022, § 2.21)
§ 151.269 REQUIRED PUBLIC HEARING.
   (A)   No ordinance that amends any of the provisions of this ordinance may
be adopted until a public hearing has been held on the ordinance.
   (B)   The Administrator shall publish a notice of the public hearing on any
amendments to this ordinance once a week for two successive weeks in a
newspaper having general circulation in the area. The notice shall be published
for the first time not less than ten days or more than 25 days before the date
fixed for the hearing. In computing this period, the date of publication shall
not be counted but the date of the hearing shall be.
   (C)   With respect to map amendments, the Administrator shall mail written
notice of the public hearing to the recorded owners as shown on the county tax
listing of all properties whose zoning classification are changed by the
proposed amendment as well as the owners of all properties which are within 150
feet of the property rezoned by the amendment or whose property may be
substantially impacted because of access or property activity as a result of
the proposed rezoning. This notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten
but not more than 25 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The person
or persons mailing the notices shall certify to the Town Commissioners that the
mailing was done and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive and absent of
fraud.
   (D)   When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the Administrator shall
prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the site proposed for
rezoning, or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way at least ten
but not more than 25 days prior to the date of the public hearing. When
multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting
on each individual parcel is not required. However, the town shall post
sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested persons.
   (E)   The notice required or authorized by this section shall:
      (1)   State the date, time; and place of the public hearing;
      (2)   Summarize the nature and character of the proposed change;
      (3)   Reasonably identify the property whose classification would be
affected by the amendment, if the proposed amendment involves a change in
zoning district classification;
      (4)   State the full text of the amendment can be obtained from the Town
Clerk; and
      (5)   State that substantial changes in the proposed amendment may be
made following the public hearing.
   (F)   If the adoption or modification would result in changes to the zoning
map or would change or affect the permitted uses of land located five miles or
less from the perimeter boundary of a military base, the town shall provide
written notice of the proposed changes by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the commander of the military base not less than ten days nor
more than 25 days before the date fixed for the hearing. If the commander of
the military base provides comments or analysis regarding the compatibility of
the proposed development regulation or amendment with military operations at
the base, the governing board shall take the comments and analysis into
consideration before making a final determination on the ordinance.

§ 151.270 TOWN COMMISSIONERS ACTION ON AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   In considering proposed changes in the text of this ordinance or in
the zoning map, the Town Commissioners act in their legislative capacity and
must proceed in accordance with the requirements and provisions set forth in
this subchapter.
   (B)   At the conclusion of the public hearing on a proposed amendment, the
Town Commissioners may proceed to vote on the amendment, refer it for further
study or take any other action consistent with the usual rules of procedure.
All development regulation adopted pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D shall be
adopted by ordinance.
   (C)   The Town Commissioners are not required to take final action on a
proposed amendment within any specific period of time but should proceed as
expeditiously as practicable on petitions for amendments since inordinate
delays can result in the petitioner incurring unnecessary costs.
   (D)   If no written report is received from the Planning Board within 30
days of referral of the amendment to that Board, the governing board may
proceed in its consideration of the amendment without the Planning Board
report. The governing board is not bound by the recommendations, if any, of the
Planning Board.
2024 S-10
   (E)   Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, the
Town Commissioners shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is
consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive or land-use plan. The
requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear
indication in the minutes of the governing board that at the time of action on
the amendment the Board of Commissioners was aware of and considered the
Planning Board's recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted
comprehensive or land-use plan. That statement is not subject to judicial
review.
   (F)   When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, a
statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be
approved by the Town Commissioners. This statement of reasonableness may
consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other
attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned; (ii) the benefits and detriments
to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding community; (iii) the
relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the
tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be permissible under
the proposed amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public interest;
and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a zoning map
amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the
governing board statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.
   (G)   A Town Commissioner shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment
where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a
direct, substantial and readily identifiable financial impact on the member.

§ 151.271 PROTEST TO ZONING DISTRICT CHANGES.
   (A)   If a petition opposing a change in the zoning classification of any
property is filed in accordance with the provisions of this section, then the
proposed amendment may be adopted only by a favorable vote of three-fourths of
the Town Commissioners. For the purposes of this division, vacant positions on
the Town Board of Commissioners and members who are excused from voting shall
not be considered “members of the council” for calculation of the requisite
supermajority.
   (B)   To trigger the three-fourths vote requirement, the petition must:
      (1)   (a)   Be signed by the owners of either:
            1.   Twenty percent or more of the area included in the proposed
change; or
            2.   Five percent of a 100-foot-wide buffer strip extending along
the entire boundary of each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned.
2024 S-10
         (b)   A street right-of-way shall not be considered in computing the
100-foot buffer strip area as long as that street right-of-way is 100 feet wide
or less. When less than the entire parcel of land is subject to the proposed
zoning map amendment, the 100-foot buffer strip shall be measured from the
property line of that parcel. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the
town may rely on the county tax listing to determine the “owners” of
potentially qualifying areas.
      (2)   Be in the form of a written petition actually bearing the
signatures of the requisite number of property owners and stating that the
signers do protest the proposed change or amendment;
      (3)   Be received by the Town Clerk in sufficient time to allow the
governing body at least two normal working days before the date established for
a public hearing on the proposed amendment to determine the sufficiency and
accuracy of the petition; and
      (4)   Be on a form provided by the Town Clerk and contain all the
information requested on this form.
   (C)   A person who has signed a protest petition may withdraw his or her
name from the petition at any time prior to the vote on the proposed zoning
amendment. Only those protest petitions that meet the qualifying standards set
forth in G.S. §§ 160D-102, 160D-18(d) and 160D-603 at the time of the vote on
the zoning amendment shall trigger the supermajority voting requirement.
   (D)   The foregoing provisions concerning protests shall not be applicable
to any amendment which initially zones property added to the territorial
coverage of the ordinance as a result of annexation or otherwise, or to an
amendment to an adopted:
      (1)   Conditional zoning;
      (2)   Conditional zoning and special use permits; or
      (3)   If the amendment does not change the types of uses that are
permitted within the district or increase the total approved density for
residential development, or increase the total approved size of any buffers or
screening approved for the special use or conditional zoning.

involved which will be dedicated to the town, the subdivider must submit all
street plans to the Planning Board for review and to the Town Commissioners for
approval as part of the preliminary plat approval process.
   (D)   Public streets not dedicated to the town. Public streets not dedicated
to the town which are eligible for acceptance into the state highway system
shall be constructed to the standards necessary to be put on the state highway
system or the standards in this ordinance, whichever is stricter, in regard to

plat.
   (E)   Streets not dedicated to town and not eligible for state highway
system. Streets not dedicated to the town which are not eligible to be put on
the state highway system because there are too few lots or residences shall
nevertheless be dedicated to the public and shall be in accordance with the
standards in this ordinance or the standards necessary to be put on the state
highway system, whichever is stricter in regard to each particular item, so as
to be eligible to be put on the system at a later date. A written maintenance
agreement with provisions for maintenance of the street until it is put on the

status of the street shall be included with the final plat.
   (H)   Half-streets. The dedication of half-streets of less than 60 feet at
the perimeter of a new subdivision shall be prohibited. If circumstances render
this impractical, the subdivider shall furnish adequate provision for the
concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the street. Where there exists a
half-street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided
by the proposed subdivision. However, in circumstances where more than 60 feet
of right-of-way is required, a partial width right-of-way, not less than 60
feet in width, may be dedicated when adjoining undeveloped property is owned or
controlled by the subdivider, provided that the width of the partial dedication
is such as to permit the installation of the facilities as may be necessary to
serve abutting lots. When the adjoining property is subdivided, the remainder
of the full-required right-of-way shall be dedicated.
   (I)   Marginal access streets. Where a tract of land to be subdivided
adjoins a principal arterial street, the subdivider may be required to provide
a marginal access street parallel to the arterial street or reverse frontage on
a minor street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the arterial. Where
reverse frontage is established, private driveways shall be prevented from
having direct access to the principal arterial.
   (J)   Access to adjacent properties. Where, in the opinion of the Town
Commissioners, it is necessary to provide for street access to an adjoining
property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of
the property and a temporary turnaround provided. The extension dedicated shall
have the same right-of-way width as the street being extended.
   (K)   Nonresidential streets. The subdivider of a nonresidential subdivision
shall provide streets in accordance with I. F-4 of the North Carolina
Department of Transportation, Division of Highways Subdivision Roads, Minimum
Construction Standards and the standards in this ordinance, whichever are
stricter in regard to each particular item.
   (L)   Design standards. The design of all streets and roads within the
jurisdiction of this ordinance shall be in accordance with the accepted
policies of the State Department of Transportation, Division of Highways, as
taken or modified from the American Association of State Highway and

as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at
an angle less than 60 degrees.
   (N)   Property lines at intersections. Property lines at intersections

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. Chapter
143, Article 21, Part 6; Chapter 153A, Article 6; Chapter 160A, Article 8; and
Chapter 160D, Articles 7, 9, and 11 (effective January 1, 2021), delegated to
local governmental units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the Town of Minnesott Beach,
North Carolina, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. passed 5-12-2020)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Minnesott
Beach are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 5-12-2020)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP REPOSITORY. The location of the official flood hazard data to be applied
for floodplain management. It is a central location in which flood data is
stored and managed; in North Carolina, FEMA has recognized that the application
of digital flood hazard data products carry the same authority as hard copy
products. Therefore, the NCEM's Floodplain Mapping Program websites house
current and historical flood hazard data. For effective flood hazard data, the
NC FRIS website (http://FRIS.NC.GOV/FRIS) is the map repository, and for
historical flood hazard data the FloodNC website (http://FLOODNC.GOV/NCFLOOD)
is the map repository.

rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
during any one-year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant
to §
152.24.

(Ord. passed 5-12-2020)
§ 152.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where BFE data has been provided, as set
forth in §§
152.11 or
152.32, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
152.30, are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
152.05.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
152.05. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with §
152.37(B). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the floodproofing standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in
§
152.21(C), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
152.05.    
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15.
Additionally, when
the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less
above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers
or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches
in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) of this section.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor or below the
lowest horizontal structural member in VE zones:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)    Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at
least to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      (3)   Shall include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above;
      (4)   Shall, in coastal high hazard areas (Zone VE), meet the
requirements of §
152.35.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure;
         (b)   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally
modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the
addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
      (2)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure;
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one- year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with
the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the one-
year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this chapter.
Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of
each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure has
sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement
does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions.
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Temporary placement:
         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no
permanently attached additions.)
      (2)   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
   (G)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures.
      (1)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be
placed within a special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met:
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation

accordance with the provisions of §
152.30(D); and
         (h)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation in conformance with the provisions of division (D)(3) of this
section.
      (2)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet
or that is a minimal investment of $5,000 or less and satisfies the criteria
outlined above is not required to meet the elevation or floodproofing standards
of division (B) of this section. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with §
152.21(C).
   (I)   Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within a
special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met:

meet the elevation requirements of division (B) of this section shall not be
permitted in V or VE Zones. Tanks may be permitted in other flood hazard areas
provided the tanks are designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist
all flood-related and other loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during
conditions of the design flood and without release of contents in the
floodwaters or infiltration by floodwaters into the tanks. Tanks shall be
designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist the potential buoyant
and other flood forces acting on an empty tank during design flood conditions.
      (4)   Tank inlets and vents. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and
vents shall be:
         (a)   At or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or fitted
with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the
contents of the tanks during conditions of the design flood; and
         (b)   Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of
the design flood.
   (J)   Other development.
      (1)   Fences in regulated floodways and NEAs that have the potential to
block the passage of floodwaters, such as stockade fences and wire mesh fences,
shall meet the limitations of §

§ 152.35 COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA (ZONE VE).
   Coastal high hazard areas are special flood hazard areas established in §
152.11, and designated as Zones VE. These areas have special flood hazards
associated with high velocity waters from storm surges or seismic activity and,
therefore, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following provisions in addition to the provisions of §§
152.30 and
152.31:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall:
      (1)   Be located landward of the reach of mean high tide;
      (2)   Comply with all applicable CAMA setback requirements.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated so
that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor
(excluding pilings or columns) is no lower than the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Floodproofing shall not be utilized on any structures in coastal
high hazard areas to satisfy the regulatory flood protection elevation
requirements.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space
below the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor
either be free of obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls, open wood
latticework or insect screening, provided they are not part of the structural
support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally
high tides or wave action without causing damage to the elevated portion of the
building or supporting foundation system or otherwise jeopardizing the
structural integrity of the building. The following design specifications shall
be met:
      (1)   Material shall consist of open wood or plastic lattice having at

more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
         (c)   Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance of
20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by state or
local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than
that
which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of the
building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-
structural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with the
base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the North
Carolina State Building Code.
   (D)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be securely
anchored to pile or column foundations. All pilings and columns and the
structure attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all building components.
      (1)   Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base
flood.

components.
      (4)   Elevator shafts/enclosures that extend below the RFPE shall be
constructed of reinforced masonry block or reinforced concrete walls and
located on the landward side of the building to provide increased protection
from flood damage. Drainage must be provided for the elevator pit.
      (5)   Flood damage-resistant materials can also be used inside and
outside the elevator cab to reduce flood damage. Use only stainless steel doors
and door frames below the BFE. Grouting in of door frames and sills is
recommended.
      (6)   If an elevator is designed to provide access to areas below the
BFE, it shall be equipped with a float switch system that will activate during
a flood and send the elevator cab to a floor above the RFPE.
   (H)   Accessory structures, regardless of size or cost, shall not be
permitted below elevated structures.
   (I)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the
provisions of §
152.21 and divisions (C) and (D) of this section, on the current version of the
North Carolina V-Zone certification form or equivalent local version. In
addition, prior to the certificate of compliance/occupancy issuance, a
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify the finished
construction is compliant with the design, specifications and plans for VE Zone
construction.
   (J)   Fill/grading.
      (1)   Minor grading and the placement of minor quantities of

under and around buildings and for support of parking slabs, pool decks, patios
and walkways.
      (2)   The fill material must be similar and consistent with the natural
soils in the area.
      (3)   The placement of site-compatible, non-structural fill under or
around an elevated building is limited to two feet. Fill greater than two feet
must include an analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional
demonstrating no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave
reflection that would increase damage to adjacent elevated buildings and
structures.
      (4)   Nonstructural fill with finished slopes that are steeper than five
units horizontal to one unit vertical shall be permitted only if an analysis
prepared by a qualified registered design professional demonstrates no harmful
diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave reflection that would increase
damage to adjacent elevated buildings and structures.
   (K)   There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands which
would increase potential flood damage.
   (L)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted except in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be
placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided
the anchoring and elevation standards of this section have been satisfied.
   (M)   Recreational vehicles may be permitted in coastal high hazard areas
provided that they meet the recreational vehicle criteria of §
152.31(F)(1).

structures.
   (P)   In coastal high hazard areas, development activities other than
buildings and structures shall be permitted only if also authorized by the
appropriate state or local authority; if located outside the footprint of, and
not structurally attached to, buildings and structures; and if analyses
prepared by qualified registered design professionals demonstrate no harmful
diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave reflection that would increase
damage to adjacent buildings and structures. Such other development activities
include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Bulkheads, seawalls, retaining walls, revetments, and similar
erosion control structures;
      (2)   Solid fences and privacy walls, and fences prone to trapping
debris, unless designed and constructed to fail under flood conditions less
than the design flood or otherwise function to avoid obstruction of
floodwaters.
      (3)   Docks, piers, and similar structures.
   (Q)   No more than four electrical outlets and no more than four electrical
switches may be permitted below RFPE unless required by Building Code.

§ 152.36 STANDARDS FOR COASTAL A ZONE (CAZ) LiMWA.
   Structures in CAZs shall be designed and constructed to meet V Zone
requirements, including requirements for breakaway walls. However, the NFIP
regulations also require flood openings in walls surrounding enclosures below
elevated buildings in CAZs (see Technical Bulletin 1, Openings in Foundation
Walls and Walls of Enclosures). Breakaway walls used in CAZs must have flood
openings that allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters to minimize
damage caused by hydrostatic loads. Openings also function during smaller
storms or if anticipated wave loading does not occur with the base flood.
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated so
that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor
(excluding pilings or columns) is no lower than the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Floodproofing shall not be utilized on any structures in Coastal A
Zones to satisfy the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space
below the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor
either be free of obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls, open wood
latticework or insect screening, provided they are not part of the structural
support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally
high tides or wave action without causing damage to the elevated portion of the
building or supporting foundation system or otherwise jeopardizing the
structural integrity of the building. The following design specifications shall
be met:
      (1)   Material shall consist of open wood or plastic lattice having at
least 40% of its area open; or
      (2)   Insect screening; or
      (3)   Breakaway walls shall meet the following design specifications:
         (a)   Breakaway walls shall have flood openings to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified
by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the design criteria
in §
152.31(D)(3); and
         (b)   Design safe loading resistance shall be not less than 10 nor
more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
         (c)   Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance of
20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by State or
local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of
the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-
structural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with the
base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the North
Carolina State Building Code.
   (C)   Concrete pads, including patios, decks, parking pads, walkways,
driveways, etc. must meet the provisions of §
152.35(E).
   (D)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
provisions of §
152.35(C).
   (E)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the
provisions of §§
152.21 and
152.35(C) and (D), on the current version of the North Carolina V-Zone
certification form or a locally developed V-Zone certification form.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles may be permitted in coastal A Zones provided
that they meet the recreational vehicle criteria of §
152.31(F)(1).
   (G)   Fill/grading must meet the provisions of §
152.35(J).
   (H)   Decks and patios must meet the provisions of §
152.35(N) and (O).
   (I)   In coastal high hazard areas, development activities other than
buildings and structures must meet the provisions of §
152.35(P).

§ 152.37 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO).
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.11, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to §§
152.30 and
152.31, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
   (A)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of four feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
   (B)   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed
to the same level as required in division (A) of this section so that the
structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that
level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is
required in accordance with §§
152.21(C) and 152.31(B).
   (C)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes,
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(Ord. passed 5-12-2020)
§ 152.38 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AH).
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.11, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas are subject
to inundation by 1%-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding)
where average depths are one to three feet. Base flood elevations are derived
from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone. In addition to §§
152.30 and
152.31, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
   (A)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes,
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
