PREFACE
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of
the Village of Bald Head Island, North Carolina.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances
adopted by the village council. The source of each section is included in the
history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a
note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with
the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the
back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included
herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order,
and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate
usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to
relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations
and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of
this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system
used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of
two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter
number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section
within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and
the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is
identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted
in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example,
if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between
sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered
6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in
the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the
subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article
embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new
article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved
chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of
chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to
the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of
the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the
page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an
appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates
the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of
ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their
corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
   The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular
item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay
phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language
generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to
direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements 
   A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and
supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication
will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly
edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for
the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
   Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon
the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then
become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted
according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the
publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to
avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and
filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments 
   This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Senior
Code Attorney, and Catherine Ponson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation,
Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the
publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the
project.
   The publisher is most grateful to Alina Medina, Village Clerk, for her
cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.
It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code
of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible
to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day
administration of the village's affairs.

judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such
unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining

infraction, as provided by G.S. 14-4.
   (b)   Any provision of this Code or any other village ordinance may be
enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent
jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have
jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a
defense to the application of the village for equitable relief that there is an
adequate remedy at law.
   (c)   Any provision of this Code or any other village ordinance that makes
unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced
by injunction and order of abatement, and the general court of justice shall
have jurisdiction to issue such orders. When a violation of such a provision
occurs, the village may apply to the appropriate division of the general court
of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement
commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the
unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by
the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil
Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular. In addition to an injunction,
the court may enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the
cause. An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on
the property be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or
other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; that grass
and weeds be cut; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other
action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with
this Code or such ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with
an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the
court, he may be cited for contempt, and the village may execute the order of
abatement. The village shall have a lien on the property for the cost of
executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's
lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying
all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order.
The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the clerk of superior court
in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be
conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of
abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of
abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction
therewith.
   (d)   The provisions of this Code and any other village ordinance may be
enforced by any one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and
prescribed by this section.
   (e)   Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing
violation of any provision of this Code or any other village ordinance shall be
a separate and distinct offense.

   State Law References: to impose fines and penalties for violation of
municipal ordinances, G.S. 160A-175; violation of municipal ordinances a
misdemeanor, G.S. 14-4.
Sec. 1-7. Amendments to Code; effect of new ordinances; amendatory language.
   (a)   All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal or
in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering
system of this Code and printed for inclusion in this Code. When subsequent
ordinances repeal any chapter, section or subsection or any portion of this
Code, such repealed portions may be excluded from this Code by omission from
reprinted pages. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted
in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent
ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or
omitted are readopted as a new Code by the village council.
   (b)   Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by
amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this
Code in the following language: "That section ________ of the Code of
Ordinances, Village of Bald Head Island, North Carolina, is hereby amended to
read as follows: . . . ." The new provisions shall then be set out in full as
desired.
   (c)   If a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added,
the following language shall be used: "That the Code of Ordinances, Village of
Bald Head Island, North Carolina, is hereby amended by adding a section, to be
numbered ________, which such section reads as follows: . . . ." The new
section shall then be set out in full as desired.
   (d)   All sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed
must be specifically repealed by section, article or chapter number, as the
case may be.
Sec. 1-8. Supplementation of Code.
   (a)   By contract or by village personnel, supplements to this Code shall be
prepared on an annual basis. A supplement to the Code shall include all
substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the village
council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made
thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they
will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that
have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so
prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through
the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.
   (b)   In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which
have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from
reprinted pages.
   (c)   When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the
person authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive
changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement,
insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For
example, the codifier may:
      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions.
      (2)   Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections
and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes
in such catchlines, headings and titles.
      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be
inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change
existing section or other subdivision numbers.
      (4)   Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to
"this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or
to "sections ________ to ________" (inserting section numbers to indicate the
sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the Code).
   (5)   Update position, program, and department names and titles where
necessary to reflect the then-current naming conventions in use by the village
administration.
   (6)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original
meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the code; but in no case shall the
codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material
included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.
(Ord. No. 2013-0501, 5-17-2013)
Sec. 1-9. Ordinances not affected by Code.
   Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code shall be construed
to repeal or otherwise affect the validity of any of the following:
      (1)   Any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture
incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective

   (a)   In order to protect the citizens of the village, and their properties,

property where intent is an element, or any drug or gambling related offense.
   (b)   The village manager, or designee, shall conduct an investigation of
any final candidate for a permanent full-time or part-time position with the
village government and it shall be a precondition of employment that an
applicant for such a position shall upon request, provide fingerprints and all
other necessary personal identification including a birth certificate, social
security number and drives license, if available, so that the village manager

criminal records to determine if the applicant has a history of criminal
convictions or the crimes enumerated above by the use of the division of
criminal information network (DCI).
   (c)   The department of public safety shall provide the findings from the
use of the DCI to the village manager or designee, provided that all necessary

account the nature and the circumstances of the offense and the time frame of
the offense as it relates to the essential job functions for the position
applied.
   (e)    If this section or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provision
or applications of the ordinance which can be given separate effect and to that
end the provisions of this section are declared to be severable.
   (f)    Prior to denial or termination of employment based upon criminal
history record inquiry (CHRI) received from the criminal justice agency, the
department of public safety shall verify the existence of a record by either
obtaining a certified public record or by submitting a fingerprint card of the
individual to the CIIS section for verification that the CHRI record belongs to
the individual.
   (g)    Any ordinance or any part of an ordinance in conflict with this
section, to the extent of such conflict, is hereby repealed.
   (h)    This section is adopted in the interest of the public health, safety
and general welfare of the inhabitants of the village pursuant to G.S. 160A et
seq., and shall be in full force and effect from and after its adoption.

for use in this state.
      (2)   Rabies tags. A licensed veterinarian or a certified rabies
vaccinator who administers rabies vaccine to a dog or cat shall issue a rabies

of any animals involved, if known, within 24 hours of rendering treatment.
      (2)   Confinement of biting dogs and cats and confinement of animals
suspected of having rabies. Every dog or cat that bites a human being shall be
confined immediately. The animal shall be delivered within eight hours of the
incident, by the owner, to the county animal shelter or to a licensed
veterinary hospital. The animal shall be confined for observation for not less
than ten days. The owner shall be responsible for the cost of confinement at
either place. The animal services director shall have authority to order
confinement of a dog or cat to the county's animal shelter or any other
appropriate facility. Brunswick County Animal Services may waive the cost of
confining the animal at the shelter if the bite occurred on the owner's
premises and the animal was provoked. Final authority as to place of
confinement rests with the county health director. After reviewing the
circumstances of a particular case, the county health director may permit the
animal to be confined on the premises of the owner, but only after an
inspection and recommendation from the animal services director. The animal
services director's recommendation shall be based on whether or not there is a
suitable secure enclosure on the premises and other circumstances warrant
confinement on the owner's premises.
         a.   An owner or possessor of an animal which is suspected of having
rabies shall immediately notify the county health director or animal services
director and shall securely confine the animal until further instructed by the
county health director or animal services director.
      (3)   Destruction of infected dogs and cats. If a dog or cat, in or out
of confinement, develops rabies, as determined by a licensed veterinarian, it
shall be the duty of the owner to have such animal euthanized under the
supervision of the animal services director. Any dog or cat known to have been
bitten by another animal which is known or proved to be rabid shall be
euthanized immediately by the owner or by the animal services director unless
the dog or cat has been vaccinated against rabies more than three weeks prior
to being bitten and is given a booster dose of rabies vaccine within three days
of the bite.
(Ord. No. 2007-1001, Art. II, (3), 10-26-2007; Ord. No. 2007-1003, 10-26-2007)
Sec. 4-54. Sanctions, penalties, fines and remedies.
   Violations of this article [and Article II of the Brunswick County Animal
Control Ordinance], are punishable by prosecution in criminal court as provided
by G.S. 14-4, unless a greater penalty is provided elsewhere, or by the
imposition of civil penalties, as prescribed in article VII, or both.
Collection of civil penalties may be by civil action or by the use of a
collection agency.
      (1)   Failure to keep rabies tags on dogs and cats at all times. It shall
be a violation if a dog or cat is observed by an animal services officer not
wearing a valid rabies tag, regardless of whether or not the animal is on or
off the owner's property and regardless of whether or not the animal has been
vaccinated.
      (2)   Failure to produce proof of vaccination and/or failure to have
animal vaccinated when the owner is known. In addition to any civil penalties
imposed for violation of subsection (1) above, the owner of a dog or cat may be
assessed another civil penalty, if he or she fails to produce proof of
vaccination and/or fails to have the animal vaccinated within 72 hours of the
issuance of a written notice of violation and civil penalty. The notice of
violation and civil penalty shall specify that the owner has 72 hours to
produce proof of vaccination and/or to have the animal vaccinated and failure
to do so shall result in the assessment of a civil penalty. If the owner
presents proof of vaccination, within 72 hours of the issuance of the notice of
violation, the civil penalty shall not be assessed. Having the animal
vaccinated or showing proof of vaccination shall not discharge the civil
penalties assessed for violation of subsection (1) above.
         a.   If the animal is not vaccinated and/or the civil penalty is not
paid within 72 hours, animal services shall have the authority to summarily
seize the animal. The owner shall have give five days from the date of seizure
to redeem the animal. The owner may redeem the animal by paying the civil
penalty, the redemption fee and all boarding fees. If the owner wishes to
request a review of the seizure of the animal, the owner must file a written
request with the board of health's environmental committee within five days of
the seizure. If a timely request is filed, the board of health's environmental
committee shall convene within ten days of the receipt of said request. If the
owner disagrees with the board of health's environmental committee decision,
the owner must seek a review by the Brunswick County Superior Court within ten
days of the issuance of the board committee's written decision. If the owner
fails to redeem the animal, or fails to timely request a review of the seizure,
or fails to timely appeal the board committee's written decision, the animal
shall become the property of Brunswick County and shall be disposed of
according to this chapter.
         b.   The animal services officer may, in addition, issue a criminal
summons or warrant, pursuant to the G.S. 130A-25 for the owner's violation of
the G.S. 130A-185 or 130A-192. Any owner, if convicted, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more
than six months.
      (3)   Dogs or cats without valid rabies tags and the owner is unknown. If
a dog or cat is observed not wearing a valid rabies vaccination tag and the
owner is unknown and cannot be found, the animal services director or his
designee may impound the animal. Written notice of impoundment shall be posted
at the animal shelter for a minimum of five days. If the animal has not been
redeemed by the owner after five days the animal shall become the property of
Brunswick County to be disposed of according to this chapter. If the owner is
found, the animal shall be released upon payment of all redemption fees and a
civil penalty for failure to wear a valid rabies vaccination tag. The owner may
also be subject to other appropriate penalties described in Article IV [of the
Brunswick County Animal Control Ordinance], plus a civil penalty for the animal
being at large.
      (4)   Failure to provide animal services with rabies vaccination
certificates. Any veterinarian or certified rabies vaccinator who willfully
refuses to turn over rabies vaccination certificates to animal services
pursuant to G.S. 130A-189, shall be subject to the issuance of a criminal
summons or warrants or the filing of a civil action to obtain the certificates.
      (5)   Failure to notify the county health director and/or the animal
services director of a biting incident and failure to confine biting dogs and
cats. If the owner of a dog or cat, or the person being bitten, or the parent
of a child or other legal guardian or person standing in loco parents of the
person, fails to notify the health director and/or the animal services director
and provide the names and addresses of the person(s) bitten and the names and
addresses of the owner(s) of any animals involved in a biting incident; or the
owner, who has knowledge of a dog or cat biting incident, fails to confine the
animal pursuant to section
4-53, the animal services director or the county health director may seek the
issuance of a criminal summons or warrant charging the person with a violation
of G.S. 130A-196.

   Violations of this article [and Article III of the Brunswick County Animal
Control Ordinance], are punishable by prosecution in criminal court as provided
by G.S. 14-4, unless a greater penalty is provided elsewhere, or by the
imposition of civil penalties, as prescribed in Article VII, or both.
Collection of civil penalties may be by civil action or by the use of a
collection agency.
      (1)   Failure to adequately provide for animals and cruel treatment of
animals. Whenever it has been determined by an animal services officer that an
animal is not being adequately provided for or is being cruelly treated, as
defined in section
4-78, above, he may file with the magistrate a sworn complaint requesting an
order allowing him to take immediate custody of, and provide suitable care for,
the animal. The magistrate, pursuant to G.S. 19A-46 and this chapter, shall
issue the order only when he finds probable cause to believe that the animal is
being cruelly treated and that it is necessary for the animal services officer
to take immediate custody. Any magistrate's order issued under this section
shall be valid for only 24 hours after its issuance. After the animal services
officer executes the order, he shall return it with a written inventory of the
animal(s) seized to the clerk of court.
         a.   The animal services officer may request that a law enforcement
officer accompany him to help seize the animal. He may forcibly enter any
premises or vehicle when necessary to execute the order only if he reasonably
believes that the premises or vehicle is unoccupied by any person and that the
animal is on the premises or in the vehicle and only if the animal services
officer is accompanied by a law enforcement officer. In any case, he must give
notice of his identity and purpose to anyone who may be present before entering
the premises. If the premises is occupied and access to the premises and the
animal is denied by the occupant, the animal services officer shall obtain a
judicial order from a district court judge authorizing forcible entry. Forcible
entry shall only be used during the daylight hours.
         b.   When the animal services officer seizes an animal, he must leave
with the owner, if known, or affix to the premises or vehicle a copy of the
magistrate's order and a written notice of the description of the animal, the
place where the animal will be taken, the reason for taking the animal, a list
of conditions, if any, which must be met before the owner can redeem the animal
and the animal services officer's intent to file a complaint in district court
requesting custody of the animal if the conditions are not met.
         c.   When the animal services officer takes custody of such an animal,
he shall file a verified complaint asking the district court to determine
custody of the animal. The animal services officer may also seek injunctive
relief and any other relief he deems appropriate. This complaint shall be filed
as soon as possible, but in no event longer than 30 days after the taking of
the animal. If the owner surrenders the animal, the animal services officer
does not have to file a complaint seeking custody of the animal.
         d.   The animal services officer must take any animal seized directly
to a safe and secure place and provide suitable care for it. The necessary
expenses of caring for a seized animal, including necessary veterinary care,
shall be a charge against the animal's owner and a lien on the animal to be
enforced as provided by G.S. 44A-4.
      (2)   Alternative remedy and sanction. If it is determined by an animal
services officer that an animal is not in immediate danger, or the condition or
problem which gives rise to inadequate care or cruel treatment can be corrected
immediately or within a short period of time, not to exceed 72 hours, he may,
in lieu of subsection (1), above, issue a written notice of violation
requesting the owner or possessor of the animal to cease and desist or to
correct the problem within 72 hours. If the condition or problem is not
corrected within 72 hours or the owner or possessor of the animal fails to
cease or desist from the cruel treatment or fails to adequately provide for the
animal, the animal services officer may take action as outlined in subsection
(1), above.
      (3)   Violation of section
4-78(2); (clean shelter). Notwithstanding the other provisions and sanctions of
this article, when it has been determined by an animal services officer that
animals have been allowed to live in unsanitary conditions, and that said
conditions resulted from the owner's unwillingness or inability to clean the
area where animals are housed or that the conditions resulted from the number
of animals involved, animal services may summarily seize the animals. Before
the animals are seized, the animal services director or health director shall
issue a declaration of unsanitary conditions and notice of seizure to the
owner. If the owner wishes to request a review of the seizure of the animals,
the owner must file a written request with the board of health's environmental
committee within five days of the seizure. If a timely request is filed, the
board of health's environmental committee shall convene within ten days of the
filing of said request. If the within ten days of the filing of said request.
If the owner disagrees with the board of health's environmental committee
decision, the owner must seek a review by the Brunswick County Superior Court
within ten days of the issuance of the board committee's written decision. If
the owner fails to timely request a review of the seizure or fails to timely
appeal the committee's written decision, the animal shall become the property
of Brunswick County and shall become the property of Brunswick County and shall
be disposed of according to this chapter.
      (4)   Violation of section
4-78(4)--(9). When it has been determined by an animal services officer that
there has been a violation of one or more of the following subsections (4)--
(9), he may initiate the issuance of a criminal summons or warrant for
violating the following criminal statutes:

   Any person found guilty under any of the above criminal statutes shall be
subject to the penalty therein prescribed, or if no penalty therein prescribed,
or if no penalty is prescribed, then according to G.S. 14.4.
      (5)   Violation of section
4-78(10); (reporting injured or killed domestic animals). When it has been
determined by an animal services officer that a domesticated animal has been
injured or killed, as a result of coming into contact with an automobile,
motorcycle, bicycle or other vehicle, and the person operating said conveyance
fails to report the same, and the operator can be identified by an eyewitness
or physical evidence, the animal services officer may issue a written notice of
violation and civil penalty to the operator.
         a.   Any owner or lessee of real property who fails to report the
existence of an injured or suffering domesticated animal on his property as
required by section
4-78(10) above, may be issued a written notice of violation and civil penalty.
      (6)   Violation of section
4-78(11) or (12); (animals as prizes and public exhibits of animals). Any
person who violates section
4-78(11) shall be subject to the issuance of a criminal warrant or summons and,
if convicted, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to
exceed $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than six months. Any person who fails
or refuses to close down an exhibit, function or activity after being
instructed to do so by animal services shall be subject to the issuance of a
criminal warrant or summons and, if convicted, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than six
months.

often as necessary in order to determine whether the work complies with this
article and the appropriate codes.
      (2)   When deemed necessary by the appropriate inspector, materials and
assemblies may be inspected at the point of manufacture or fabrication, or
inspections may be made by approved and recognized inspection organizations;
provided, no approval shall be based upon reports of such organizations unless
the appeals are in writing and certified by a responsible officer of such
organization.
      (3)   All holders of permits or their agents shall notify the inspection
department and the appropriate inspector at each of the following stages of
construction so that approval may be given before work is continued:
         a.   Foundation inspection. The foundation inspections shall be made
after trenches are excavated and the necessary reinforcement forms are in
place, and before concrete is placed. Drilled footings, piles, and similar
types of foundations shall be inspected as installed.
         b.   Framing inspection. The framing inspection shall be made after
all structural framing is in place and all roughing-in of plumbing and
electrical and heating has been installed, after all fire blocking, chimneys,
bracing and vents are installed, but before any of the structure is enclosed or
covered. Poured in place concrete structural elements shall be inspected before
each pour of any structural member.
         c.   Fireproofing inspection. The fireproofing inspection shall be
made after all areas required to be protected by fireproofing are lathed, but
before the plastering or other fireproofing is applied.
         d.   Final inspection. The final inspection shall be made after the
building or structure has all doors hung, fixtures set, and is ready for
occupancy, but before the building is occupied.
   (b)   Calls for inspection. Request for inspections may be made to the
office of the inspection department or to the appropriate inspector. The
inspection department shall make inspections as soon as practicable after
request is made therefor, provided such work is ready for inspection at the
time the request is made.
   (c)   Reinspections. Reinspections may be made at the convenience of the
inspector. No work shall be inspected until it is in proper and completed
condition ready for inspection. All work which has been concealed before the
inspection and approval shall be uncovered at the request of the inspector and
placed in condition for proper inspection. Approval or rejection of the work
shall be furnished by the appropriate inspector in the form of a notice posted
on the building or given to the permit holder or his agent. Failure to call for
inspections or proceeding without approval at each stage of construction shall
be deemed a violation of this article.
   (d)   Certificate of occupancy. No new building or part thereof shall be
occupied, and no addition or enlargement of any existing building shall be
occupied, and no existing building, after being altered or moved, shall be
occupied, and no change of occupancy shall be made in any existing building or
part thereof, until the inspection department has issued a certificate of
occupancy therefor. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a
portion of a building which may safely be occupied prior to final completion
and occupancy of the entire building. Application for a certificate of
occupancy may be made by the owner or his agent after all final inspections
have been made for new buildings, or, in the case of existing buildings, after
supplying the information and data necessary to determine compliance with this
article, the appropriate regulatory codes and chapter
32, pertaining to zoning, for the occupancy intended. The inspection department

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 9-1. Purpose and intent.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide physical standards and
guidelines for commercial site and building design that seek to preserve Bald
Head Island's ecosystem and maintain the natural beauty that defines Bald Head
Island. The design standards are intended to allow for creative development of
commercial areas that respects Bald Head Island's character while responding to
the immediate context of the proposed construction. The specific intention is
to ensure:
   (1)   Proposed development that minimizes disruption of the natural
environment.
   (2)   Architectural planning and design in concert with and reinforcing of
existing Bald Head Island character and scale.
   (3)   Creation or enhancement of connectivity of existing development and
resources.
   (4)   Orientation and siting to establish public space and community
welfare.
   (b)   The design standards established by this chapter are intended to
complement and enhance, not supersede, the village zoning ordinance. While
there may be overlap between the concepts expressed in this chapter and the
village zoning ordinance, each constitutes a separate review and approval
process required for commercial development on Bald Head Island.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-2. Concept: Bald Head Island character.
   Buildings on Bald Head Island are typically a blend of "low country coastal
vernacular" and "shingle style" architecture. Massing, materials, and
architectural detailing are incorporated to create a homogeneous informal
impression with a personal pedestrian scale. Bald Head Island's character is
exemplified by an orderly, well-proportioned composition of buildings
integrated into the natural environment.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-3. Form based design.
   Form based codes are the rules that define each building's physical form,
its relationships to its neighbors and to the public realm. Each building
typology has its own set of requirements that uniquely address the
environmental and architectural context of its location. Each building is part
of collective architectural order to create public ways, streets, and common
spaces.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-4. Definitions.
   The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning.
   Applicant means the property owner and any authorized agent submitting an
application for review pursuant to this chapter.
   Arbor means an area shaded by trees, shrubs or vines on a latticework
structure – see trellis.
   Authorized agent means a person authorized by a property owner to act on
their behalf. All authorizations must be in writing and submitted to the
village prior to or contemporaneous with an application.
   Caliper means the diameter of a living tree at breast height or
approximately 4.5 feet from ground level.
   Conceal means to hide behind grade-level screening within the footprint of a
structure, as specified within these design standards, or to keep completely
from sight of any public road or fairway view by vegetation, natural terrain or
other solution approved by the CRB.
   CRB means the commercial review board established by this chapter and
appointed by the village council.
   CRB administrator means the person charged with supporting the work of the
CRB and administration of this chapter as shall from time to time be designated
by the village manager.
   Exotic plant means any plant not native to Bald Head Island or North
Carolina as listed in appendix
A.6.
   Grade, average means the sum of the varying elevations of the ground around
the perimeter of the building including, but not limited to decks, staircases,
porches and the like divided by the number of elevation changes included in the
calculations.
   Impervious surface means the area of the property covered by structures or
materials that do not allow water to penetrate or percolate into the ground.
For example, this would include any covered structures, paved or graveled
walkways/driveways or decking without sufficient spacing between the boards
(less than one-fourth inch). It would also include marl, for though water can
penetrate marl, it does not percolate into the spaces of the ground beneath
quickly enough to earn a pervious rating. However, a surface of number 57
stone, as designated by the American Society for Testing and Materials, laid at
least four inches thick over a geotextile fabric is considered pervious. These
standards include the building footprint (with cantilevered elements), not the
roof overhangs.
   Invasive plants mean exotic plants not native to Bald Head Island that have
the potential to spread. Invasive species are a major threat to our environment
because they (1) can change habitats and alter ecosystem function and ecosystem
services and (2) crowd out or replace native species.
   Limited common area means those portions of the common area that serve only
a limited number of units and which may include, but specifically is not
limited to, walkways, parking, buildings or areas serving only specified lots
and such other similar areas as designated by the village. The limited common
area will be managed and maintained by the village at the expense of only the
owners of units served.
   Massing means the composition of building forms.
   Muntin means a strip separating panes of glass in a sash.
   Native plant means a plant that occurs naturally in a particular location
without direct or indirect human intervention. The distinction between native
and non-native species is important because native species have generally
adapted and evolved with the competing species, predators, and diseases of an
area over many centuries or longer. Bald Head Island native plants support
indigenous wildlife, habitats, ecosystem function and ecosystem services.
   Naturalized area means an area of native vegetation that consists of
undisturbed understory and ground cover. Removal of understory and ground cover
in naturalized areas on building sites is prohibited. New construction projects
must avoid damaging naturalized areas outside the limits of construction
fencing.
   New construction means the construction, alteration, movement, enlargement,
replacement, repair, use and occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and
demolition of every building, structure or any appurtenances connected with or
attached to such buildings or structures on Bald Head Island.
   Rake means the sloped sides at the end of a gable roof forming a triangle.
   Renovation, major means any renovation of heated space within a building or
non-heated space greater than 250 sq. ft. Major renovations are further divided
into categories as set out in appendix
A.5.
   Renovation, minor means any renovation that is not a major renovation. Minor
renovations are further divided into categories as set out in appendix
A.5.
   Service area means portions of the common area located within the property
reserved for the exclusive use of one or more, but fewer than all, of the
owners.
   Shed means the secondary roof form.
   Understory means an underlying layer of vegetation, especially the plants
that grow beneath a forest's canopy.
   Unit means property, whether improved or unimproved, which may be
independently owned and conveyed and which is intended for development, use and
occupancy. The term will refer to the land, if any, which is part of the unit
as well as any improvements thereon.
   Unit, improved means a unit with a completed structure built upon it for
which the village has issued a certificate of occupancy.
   Unit, unimproved means a vacant lot with no completed structure built upon
it.

Secs. 9-5—9-20. Reserved.
ARTICLE II. APPLICABILITY ANDADMINISTRATION.
Sec. 9-21. Applicability of design standards.
   (a)   The provisions of the design standards shall apply to development,
including, but not limited to the construction, alteration, movement,
enlargement, replacement, repair, use and occupancy, location, maintenance,
removal and demolition of every building, structure or any appurtenances
connected with or attached to such buildings or structures on Bald Head Island
for either non-residential or mixed commercial/residential use, and located in
an area or on a lot or parcel of land designated for nonresidential development
by zoning district or overlay regulation, planned unit development, or other
land use restriction.
   (b)   The standards of this section shall:
      (1)   Establish the criteria for application review.
      (2)   Set grounds to approve, deny, or approve with conditions.
      (3)   Set grounds for appeal.
      (4)   Establish a schedule for and stages of submissions.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-22. Commercial review board.
   (a)   The commercial review board (CRB) is established by the Village of
Bald Head Island to administer the design standards and to review all
applications for new construction and renovations on any properties in
commercially zoned districts.
   (b)   The CRB is composed of a five-person voting board, with two alternates
who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting. Members of
the CRB are appointed by the village council. Council should give priority to
persons with backgrounds in planning, development, design, architecture,
landscape architecture, or construction. Board members sit for staggered three-
year terms with two members and one alternate being appointed in odd-numbered
years and three members and one alternate being appointed in even numbered
years. In appointing the initial CRB, council shall appoint two regular members
and one alternate to an initial term that expires June 30, 2025, and three
regular members and one alternate to an initial term that expires June 30,
2026, in order to create staggered terms. Council may fill vacancies for
unexpired terms only.
   (c)   The CRB will be advised by the CRB administrator and an architect and/
or landscape architect under contract with the village. Both are non-voting
positions.
   (d)   The CRB will hold an organizing meeting annually in the month of
August. At that meeting, the CRB will elect one of its members to serve as
chair and preside over the board's meetings and one member to serve as vice-
chair to serve as acting chair in the absence of the chair. The persons so
designated will serve in these capacities for one year and are eligible for
reelection.
   (e)   Other than the organizing meeting, meetings of the CRB will be held
pursuant to a regular schedule set at the organizing meeting or adopted at any
properly noticed meeting thereafter or at the call of the chair within 60 days
of submittal of a complete application, as determined by the CRB administrator.
All meetings of the CRB are open to the public. The board will keep minutes of
its procedures, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if
absent or failing to vote, an indication of such fact and final disposition of
all matters before the board, all of which shall be of public record.
   (f)   A quorum shall consist of more than one-half of the appointed members
of the CRB eligible to vote, including any alternate seated to replace an
absent or disqualified member, present for any meeting. Once the existence of a
quorum is established, votes may proceed by simple majority of the members
present at the meeting.
   (g)   CRB approval is required prior to undertaking any new construction,
exterior renovations, or site work. When reviewing a submitted set of plans,
the CRB may require compliance with requirements that, although not itemized
specifically, are supported by sections of the design standards, or agreed upon
by the applicant.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-23. Amendments.
   The CRB may periodically consider and determine that there is a need to
amend the design standards. Any design standard amendment must be considered
and adopted as an ordinance by the village council before implementation. If a
design standard amendment is adopted after an application is submitted, but
before a CRB approval is granted, the applicant may choose which version of the
design standard will apply to consideration of the application.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-24. Effect on nonconforming structures.
   It is recognized that lawful nonconforming structures may currently exist at
the adoption of these design standards or may develop as a result of either
future amendments of these design standards or amendment of the Bald Head
Island zoning map. Such nonconformities may continue, but generally should not
be changed, expanded or enlarged in such a manner as to increase the extent of
the nonconformity with the then existing design standards. It is the purpose of
this section to encourage the eventual cessation of nonconformities, but to
provide that such structures may be reasonably repaired and maintained.
   (a)   Any nonconforming structure in existence at the time of the adoption
of this chapter or subsequent amendment to this chapter or the Bald Head Island
zoning map that creates a nonconforming structure shall not be subject to these
design standards at the time of adoption. Use of the structure may be continued
without the need for alteration to conform with these design standards. Such
use includes performing normal repair and maintenance updates to the structure,
except that where an exterior feature of a structure is to be repainted or
reclad, such work must be done in conformance with the color and siding
requirements of these design standards. Additionally, replacement of features
such as doors, windows, roof materials, or decorative items on a nonconforming
structure should, as far as possible, be done in a way that conforms with the
spirit of these design standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the
intent of this section to permit nonconforming structures to be repaired or
maintained in the normal course even if a conforming feature cannot reasonably
be used.
   (b)   The square footage of a nonconforming structure shall not be expanded
or enlarged except (1) to comply with the requirements of federal or state laws
or a local ordinance of general applicability, including a zoning ordinance
where use of the structure is changed, or (2) to make such structure conform
with these design standards.
   (c)   Any nonconforming structure which, at any time, is not in use for an
180 day period following the adoption of this chapter or subsequent amendment
that creates a nonconforming structure shall be considered to have discontinued
operations and, therefore, regardless of the reason or intent of such
discontinuance, will no longer be permitted for any use without alteration to
substantially comply with these design standards as determined by the CRB. The
initial decision as to whether an existing nonconforming structure has been
abandoned shall be made by the CRB administrator.
   (d)   The reconstruction or renovation of a nonconforming structure that is
damaged or destroyed as a result of fire, storm, or other natural/
uncontrollable factor such that more than 50% of the structure would need to be
reconstructed in order for the structure to continue being used shall be
subject to the new construction design standards of this chapter, and shall be
permitted only upon securing all approvals required for a new construction
project.

ARTICLE III. REVIEW PROCESS.
Sec. 9-41. Purpose.
   The primary purpose of all CRB reviews is: (a) to assess and confirm
conformance with these design standards and any other applicable village
ordinance, and (b) to assess the impact of requested deviations and approve or
disapprove such in the context of the stated objectives of these design
standards. The property owner or the owner's designated agent is solely
responsible for compliance with the design standards and assuring compliance
fulfillment by their designer of the approved plan.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-42. Review requirements.
   (a)   Review stages. The CRB review procedure allows for a multi-stage
process wherein the property owner receives optional draft reviews, a
preliminary review, and a final review as described in this section. The CRB,
with agreement of the applicant, may determine that an application for a minor
renovation is appropriate for a one stage review process during preliminary
review. All new construction and major renovations are expected to go through
at least a two-stage review process that includes preliminary review and final
review.
      (1)   Draft review(s). A draft plan review is optional, but strongly
encouraged. This supplemental step enables the CRB to consider the design
aspects of the building and site prior to the formal submission process. Submit
one full-size printed copy and one emailed PDF. No appeal is available from
recommendations issued following a draft review.
      (2)   Preliminary review. This is a formal submittal and required stage
in the review process. All submission requirements identified in appendix
A.3 apply. Submit one full-size printed copy and one emailed PDF copy. No
appeal is available from recommendations issued following a preliminary review.
      (3)   Final review. Applicant should revise their preliminary submission
as required by CRB and indicate each change with a "revision cloud" and a
written description attached to the final application. Include a scaled
landscape plan and paint application. Submit one full size printed copy and one
emailed PDF copy. Village technical review must be complete and incorporated in
the submittal.
   (b)   Drawings required. Preliminary and final review submittals for
projects with a total value above $300,000 and a total project area greater
than 3,000 square feet must include drawings that are signed by and that carry
the seal of a North Carolina licensed professional engineer or licensed
architect responsible for their preparation. This assures the review process of
appropriate and desirable levels of competency and aesthetic to maintain
compatibility in Bald Head Island's unique building environment and is
invaluable in planning a compliant and lasting structure on Bald Head Island.
   (c)   Fees. Fees related to the submittal process may be found in appendix
A.5. Any submittal requiring a fee must include the fee to be considered
complete. All fees are subject to annual review and update by the village
council.
   (d)   Final approval required. Construction activity, including, but not
limited to, pile driving and material deliveries are not permitted without
written final approval by the CRB, a site management meeting with the CRB
administrator or designated agent, and an executed preconstruction site
management compliance form. The applicant will be notified in writing of all
review decisions of the CRB as soon as possible following each meeting, but no
later than 14 days following the meeting. For convenience and to speed
delivery, email notification to an email or emails provided in the application
will be used unless mail notice is requested.
   (e)   Administrative decision. A CRB review decision is administrative in
nature. The CRB applies the objective standards set forth in this chapter when
issuing a decision.
   (f)   Vesting. Unless a longer period is approved during the application
process, project approval by the CRB is valid for 24 months from the date of
written notification to the property owner. If the Village of Bald Head Island
building permit has not been issued and on-site construction has not begun
within 24 months from CRB issuance of written approval, the CRB approval
expires.
   (g)   Expired approvals. If an owner wishes to proceed with a previously
approved project for which the approval has expired, the project will be
subject to the current construction review design process based upon current
design standards and fees.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
9-43. Decision review meeting.
   Any applicant disagreeing with a review decision of the CRB may, but is not
required to, contact the CRB administrator to request a further meeting to
review the reasons for the decision. This request may be made at any time
within 15 days after the date of the CRB letter notifying the applicant in
writing of the review decision. The CRB will hold a meeting with the applicant
no later than the next scheduled CRB meeting or within 60 days, whichever is
sooner. The designer and the applicant must be present at this meeting. Any
appeal deadlines established by this chapter shall be tolled until the
conclusion of the decision review meeting.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
9-44. Appeal.
   The applicant or other party with standing may appeal a CRB final review
decision by notifying the CRB administrator in writing of this intent within 30
days of receipt of notification of the CRB final review decision. Such appeal
will be referred to the village planning board for a hearing following the
quasi-judicial procedures set forth in Sec.
32-102(c). The CRB administrator shall represent the CRB at the hearing.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-45.   Enforcement.
   CRB approval is required for all new construction and for any
reconstruction, alteration, or improvement that qualifies as a major or minor
renovation within the commercially zoned districts. The requirements of these
design standards are enforceable in accordance with Secs.
32-61 through
32-66 of the Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances. Applicants or
their representatives must bring any deviations from exterior approved plans to
the attention of the CRB immediately upon discovery for the CRB to review the
deviation and determine if it may be permissible or if other action will be
recommended. Applicants must not assume automatic approval of a construction
detail because it currently exists on Bald Head Island. In addition to the
remedies set forth in Secs.
32-61 through
32-66 of the Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances, the CRB is
authorized to assess civil penalties for violations of this chapter of up to
$500 per day on a project-wide basis.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-46.   Variances.
   (a)   Upon a finding of unnecessary hardship following an evidentiary public
hearing held pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sec.
32-104(c) of the Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances, the CRB may
authorize reasonable variances from compliance with any of the standards set in
this chapter.
   (b)   Variances are permitted to alleviate practical difficulties and
hardships in the strict enforcement of the design standards. Such variances may
only be granted, however, when unique circumstances dictate, and no variance
shall (a) be effective unless in writing; or (b) preclude the CRB from denying
a variance in other circumstances.
   (c)   The CRB shall determine whether a variance to the design standards
will be granted following the procedures set forth in Sec.
32-104(c) of the Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances. The concurring
vote of four-fifths of the CRB shall be necessary to grant a variance. A final
decision on a variance will be sent to the applicant in writing. Any variance
granted by the CRB expires simultaneously with CRB project approval expiration.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-47.   Appeal to superior court.
   Any appeal from a final review decision of the Planning Board regarding
application of the design standards or a CRB variance decision may be made by
an aggrieved party and shall be made to the Superior Court of Brunswick County
in the nature of certiorari. Any such petition shall be filed with the clerk of
the superior court within 30 days after the written decision is filed with the
village clerk, or after a written copy thereof is delivered to every aggrieved
party who has filed a written request for such copy with the village at the
time of its hearing of the case, whichever is later.

ARTICLE IV. GENERAL SITE DESIGN.
Sec. 9-60.   District standards.
   Each of the three districts to which these design standards apply has
distinct characteristics, both programmatic/user requirements and
environmental/natural resource concerns, demanding subtle differences in site
and building design approach. These design standards are established to ensure
that the long-term interests, health, and natural environment of the community
are protected. Key issues of concern include:
   (a)   Marina/Harbour District. Functions as the entrance to the community
both figuratively and practically. The site design must consider:
      (1)   Pedestrian, cart and tram traffic and parking related to ferry
service.
      (2)   Service/delivery activity related to barge service.
      (3)   Flexibility and protection in recognizing environmental changes of
riverfront and marina location.
      (4)   Focus on natural resources and views.
      (5)   "Gateway" program, enhancing the "entrance" to the village and link
to the community historic district.
   (b)   Mid-Island District. Functions as the primary commercial/service
district. The site design must consider:
      (1)   Context and scale of adjacent development, commercial and
residential.
      (2)   Increased traffic to support proposed use, services, deliveries,
trash, and vehicle storage.
      (3)   Pedestrian/cart access and parking.
      (4)   Protection of the existing natural environment.
   (c)   East Beach District. Functions as a low-density mixed-use and/or
commercial development area. The site design must consider:
      (1)   Alleviating existing disruption of the East Beach residential area.
      (2)   Minimal impact of natural setting.
      (3)   Scale and density to respond to residential surroundings.
      (4)   Restriction of vehicular traffic.
      (5)   Promotion of pedestrian traffic.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-61. Building location and orientation.
   The building design and location must address the following concerns and
issues:
   (a)   Buildings, parking, access, and ancillary requirements must minimize
and protect existing natural environment.
   (b)   Buildings must front and be parallel to streets, public spaces, and/or
pedestrian thoroughfares.
   (c)   Building siting must respond to and "anchor" significant vistas and
nodal points.
   (d)   Building locations should support and create public spaces.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-62. Relation to grade.
   Public accessibility requirements encourage the placement of the finish
floor as close as possible to the finish grade unless specific site conditions
or flood zones require otherwise. First floor elevation and elevation of
related exterior spaces must consider connectivity to adjacent developments
when appropriate to promote through-district accessibility.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-63. Setbacks.
   Setback requirements vary with location, district overlay zones, and
proposed use. The building setbacks requirements for each property are found in
the deed restrictions, recorded covenants (if any), these design standards and
the Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances. Zoning requirements are
also found in the Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances. Proposed
designs must adhere to the most restrictive of the setback and zoning
requirements applicable to a particular property. Reference
appendix A.2. Mechanical equipment, and storm water control measures shall be
allowed in rear and side setbacks.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-64. Parking.
   Parking layout design must meet the following requirements:
   (a)   Parking requirements are to be met on proposed development property or
met by a dedicated approved alternate location.
   (b)   Parking is to be located behind the front façade of buildings unless a
component of the overall streetscape.
   (c)   Parking layouts are to be interrupted to accommodate preservation of
existing trees.
   (d)   Parking and loading for buildings located at an intersection are not
allowed on lot corners.
   (e)   Parking and/or vehicular use areas shall maintain a minimum of six
feet distance from property lines (excluding driveways) to allow for screening.
Refer to Sec.
9-105 Landscape E.3.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-65. Loading and delivery; service areas; mechanical equipment;
utilities.
   No loading, service areas, mechanical equipment or utilities should be
located along primary streets or visible from public areas. Screening is to
match or complement the related building. Natural screening may be allowed in
certain circumstances. Each application will be considered on a case-by-case
basis.

Sec. 9-66.   Open/public space.
   Five percent of commercial parcels shall be designated open/public space and
enhance the pedestrian environment. Orientation, building placement, protection
of natural setting, hardscape elements, and pedestrian access should consider
and enhance:
   (a)   Pedestrian environment.
      (1)   Promoting connectivity between commercial areas and the residential
community.
      (2)   Open areas visible from the street, fronting the building, and
encouraging use.
      (3)   Connected walkways.
      (4)   Garden walls establishing court areas.
      (5)   Porches, decks, patios or terraces that are used for more than
access to the project, including seating areas for restaurants, dog-walk areas,
merchandise display areas, and court areas.

   (b)   Landscape requirements. Existing natural growth, including forest
undergrowth, is part of the public domain and must be preserved to maintain the
character of Bald Head Island. Special care for and inclusion of specimen trees
as focal points to the design is encouraged.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Secs. 9-67—9-79. Reserved.
ARTICLE V. GENERAL BUILDING DESIGN.
Sec. 9-80.   Form and massing.
   Overall building mass should be broken down to prevent a "box like" design
or the appearance of a three-story structure. Large buildings should be
modulated using repetitive bays, patterns of architectural components (i.e.
windows, doors, balconies), or recesses in the façade itself.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)

IMAGES/0-0-0-1860.png]
Sec. 9-81. Scale.
   Buildings should incorporate two scales of architectural definition
simultaneously. At the ground level and along pedestrian paths the building
should respond to the scale of the people using the building. From the street
or at a greater distance, architectural detailing and the overall form of the
building should combine to create a coherent image.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-82. Context.
   Building forms should consider adjacent buildings and districts to
facilitate a smooth transition that reinforces a sense of neighborhood.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-83. Composition.
   Incorporating a building form comprised of a distinct base, body, and roof
is important to reinforce the horizontal and traditional character of Bald Head
Island structures.
   (a)   Rhythm. There is a recognizable rhythm to structures on Bald Head
Island. The restrictions on height, roof slope and proportions tend to generate
repeating architectural forms. The number of different forms and the frequency
with which they are repeated creates the building's rhythm.
   (b)   Height restrictions. Except as permitted by the Village of Bald Head
Island Code of Ordinances or the Urban Code, a building may be no higher than
45 feet, unless noted otherwise herein.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1984.png]
 
   (c)   Relation to grade. Every effort should be made to keep the base and
finish floor in scale and harmony with surrounding existing architecture unless
site conditions dictate otherwise. Stairs, ramps, terraces, and other
connective elements providing access to the finished grade must be integrated
into the articulation of the building's base.
   (d)   Façade development. Articulation of the building façade must consider
the following:
      (1)   Building at corners or terminating axial focal points should
incorporate additional embellishment or distinct composition to emphasize the
location.
      (2)    Consistent use of materials and level of detail on the primary
elevation shall continue to all publicly visible sides of the building.
      (3)    Porches are an integra l part of the style and archite cture on
Bald Head Island. The use of porches is encouraged as a tool to establish scale
and break down continuous vertical surfaces of the building's body.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1864.png]
   (e)   Roof forms. Roof design should be simple with limited roof types
incorporated into the composition. Repetition of forms is often used to reduce
the scale of the overall form and reinforce the rhythm of the building.

Secs. 9-84—9-100. Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. SPECIFIC BUILDING REQUIREMENTS.
Sec. 9-101.   Materials.
   (a)   Base. The base of a building should be distinct from the main body of
the building. Approved base materials include painted wood, stucco finished
concrete or block, and painted brick.
   (b)   Body. The body of the building should be clad consistent with the
following standards:
      (1)   Exterior siding. The most common exterior material used in the main
building façade on Bald Head Island is cedar shingles or shakes, either painted
or left natural. Horizontal wood or cement siding, vertical board and batten
patterns and other siding materials will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
      (2)   Metal siding. Metal siding may be approved if it evokes a
traditional aesthetic and is incorporated into an overall architectural theme.
Metal siding that looks like a prefabricated metal building will be reviewed on
a case-by-case basis.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/04d9b716e983e4e34f07febf6dd8e7a37cefec19/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1866.png]
 
      (3)   Vinyl siding. Not allowed under any circumstances.
   (c)   Street level glass. Commercial buildings typically have large amounts
of glass on the street level. The design must integrate this need for glass
with the requirement under "proportion" for the glass to be taller than it is
wide. The most common solution is to gang several residential style windows
together to create a large area of glass. The use of metal "storefront" glass
is not encouraged.
   (d)    Windows. Windows should reflect the architectural style of the
project. Projects with a traditional design should use traditional window types
such as double-hung or casement windows. When large areas of glass are
required, multiple windows should be ganged together. Using an odd number of
windows in a grouping is recommended. If a grouping of windows exceeds four
windows, the window trim should be varied to create rhythm within the window
grouping. Windows with divided lights are required to use simulated divided
lights with mullions on the outside and inside of the glass. Decorative glass
or applied glass film must be approved by the CRB. Dark tinted or reflective
glass will not be approved.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1870.png]
   (e)   Window requirements.
      (1)   75% or more of the window shapes must be vertical /rectangular.
      (2)   Single and double hung windows must have a minimum height to width
ratio of 1.5 to 1.
      (3)   Accent windows should be used sparingly.
      (4)   Trapezoidal windows are not allowed.
      (5)   Window and door trim. Traditional window trim is designed with a
head larger than the jambs and sill. The head, jambs or sills often extend
beyond the adjacent joints to create "horns." "Picture frame" window trim is
not recommended.
   (f)   Doors. Wood doors are preferred. Fiberglass and metal doors are
approved where required because of flood requirements and in secondary
locations with heavy traffic. Aluminum storefront doors are not approved unless
consistent with adjacent windows.
   (g)   Fascia and soffits. Material quality and finish shall be comparable to
typical trim application on a building. Allowable materials include wood,
cementitious fiber boards or divided panels.
   (h)   Roof design. Roof materials shall include standing seam metal, cedar,
and fiberglass shingles. Pitched roof designs are encouraged. Directly adhered
membrane or industrial metal roofs can be approved if the roof is not visible
from the exterior of the building. Parapet walls are an approved method of
concealing membrane or industrial metal roofs.
   (i)   Roof style. Primary roofs shall be gable, hip or gambrel. Commercial
buildings should be seen as an extension of the residential character and scale
of Bald Head Island. Plate height for primary roofs should be kept as low as
possible, integrating the top inhabited story into the roof mass and reducing
the scale of the building. Flat roofs are only allowed when: (1) used to
accentuate a building element as a focal point or an element establishing
building rhythm, and (2) architecturally integrated as an attached shed or room
to a principal pitched roof. Flat roofs must be bordered by parapet or
balustrade or trimmed with prominent cornice capping the wall. Rooftop decks
must be architecturally integrated into the overall roof design and not
contribute to a three-story appearance.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1872.png]
   (j)   Roof pitch and overhang. Principal eave overhangs of all structures
shall be 24 inches minimum and rake overhangs of all structures shall be 12
inches minimum. This minimum standard for overhangs may not be sufficient for
every design. The overall massing should be considered when designing
overhangs. Gable roof pitch should be a minimum of 8:12. The pitch of hip roofs
shall be a minimum of 6:12. Secondary roofs shall be pitched a minimum of 4:12.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-102.   Components.
   (a)   Entry. A commercial building may have several "front doors." Primary
entry-doors should reflect the architectural style of the project and be
distinct in prominence from standard access units.
   (b)   Column trim-enclosure. Scale and level of detail shall be consistent
with overall design and length of the column. Patterns and size may vary to
establish patterns and rhythm in elevations.
   (c)   Rafters. Barge and exposed rafters should be sized in proportion to
the structure. Larger projects are encouraged to use rafter sizes and spacing
bigger than the typical sizes used on a smaller structure.
   (d)   Beams and brackets. Where exposed beams and brackets are used with
rafters, these members should be sized proportionally with the rafters and the
overall scale of the project.
   (e)   Decks. Decks more than four feet deep or four feet high must be
supported on dedicated deck pilings rather than braced from the building
pilings. These deck support pilings must be a minimum of eight inches by eight
inches. Cantilevered decks, balconies and other heated space must be bracketed
or braced from the building pilings or walls.
   (f)   Porches. The use of porches is encouraged. The designer is responsible
for ensuring that a porch used for exit access or as a seating area meets
local, state and federal requirements. Porch ceilings should be tongue and
groove or panels with a pattern of baton strips.
   (g)   Elevators. Every effort should be made to keep elevators inside the
building. However, if this is not possible, exterior elevators may be allowed,
provided they are concealed or incorporated into the overall pattern/scale of
the building elevations.
   (h)   Exterior lighting. Light pollution is avoidable. Building and site
design should be frugal with exterior lighting.
      (1)   All exterior lighting fixtures, regardless of design, are subject
to approval.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/04d9b716e983e4e34f07febf6dd8e7a37cefec19/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1874.png]
      (2)   All lighting will be baffled to prevent direct visualization of the
light source.
      (3)   All exterior wall lighting shall have a baffle-to-light source
relationship that creates a maximum spread of light of 90 degrees from the
bottom of the baffle. All fixture lenses and bulb covers must maintain the
source-to-baffle relationship indicated in the diagrams and examples of the
baffle-to-light source relationship calculations per figure 13.
      (4)   All pathway low-luminary lighting shall have a baffle-to-light
source relationship that creates a maximum spread of light of 120 degrees from
the bottom of the baffle. All pathway lighting shall be no higher than 18
inches above grade as measured from the top of the light fixture.
      (5)   All hooded exterior wall fixture bulbs will be from the white
family and no bulb shall be brighter than 450 lumens. (Approximat ely 40 watts
incandescent, ix watts LED, ten watts CFL). The bulb/light color temperature
must be 3,000 kelvins or less, which is warm white in color.
      (6)   Pathway or stairway lighting fixtures must utilize a maximum
equivalent of 100 lumens or less. This light style must be reviewed and
approved by the CRB and must be used sparingly.
      (7)    Placing television sets or other electro nic equipm ent on
exterior decks, porches , and the like is not permitted, unless it is possible
to shield from horizon tal view by neighbors and from the street/alley and the
like. Special note should be made of the Village of Bald Head Island Noise
Ordinance.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1876.png]
   (i)   Interior lighting. The design standards encourage window treatment,
light fixture design, timers, switching configurations, and other options that
limit light pollution caused by interior lighting. It is also important to
limit the projection of interior lighting to the exterior of the structure. All
buildings should utilize shades/blinds as appropriate to limit light emanating
from within the structure to the outdoors, and interior lights must be turned
off after business hours except those required for safety/security purposes.
   (j)   Color and texture. The design standards encourage traditional color
schemes that emphasize gray and neutral color for the main body of the project
and off-whites for the trim and decoration.

Sec. 9-103.   Commercial lot: usage/building typology.
   Within the three commercial districts: Marina/ Harbour District, Mid-Island
District, and the East Beach District, specific site and building requirements
are established to protect the public domain and overall community character.
The "condition types" in these design standards respond to the uniqueness of
each area and allowable uses. See appendix A for building type setbacks and
parking requirements.
   (a)   Type A: Mixed use-residential/commercial. Federal Road/Shoals Alley
development and Bridge-Lot development: to maintain the "Street character" of
lots bordering residential neighborhoods, designs are required to meet building
setback, coverage, and design requirements of immediately adjacent
neighborhoods (reference Bald Head Association Design Guidelines, which may be
available online from the Bald Head Association) excepting as follows:
      (1)    Height. Maximum height of the primary roof structure is 45 feet
above virgin grade at the building perimeter. "Usable space" located above a
height of 30 feet is to be accommodated within the roof mass (reference
composition).

   (b)    Type B: Commercial/service/storage/warehousing. These buildings and
related service yards require increased setbacks with protected natural
screening to preserve the natural character of the access street. Additional
considerations:
   (1)   Minimize width of curb cut to 16 feet and clearing of drive ROW to 12
feet.
   (2)   Require exterior storage of vehicles and materials to be located
behind the front line of the street elevation of the building.
   (3)    Provide screening for exterior storage of materials.

   (c)   Type C: Mid-Island & Marina/Harbour District; commercial/residential.
Special considerations include:
      (1)   Primary massing and elevation datums to relate to existing/
neighboring structures.
      (2)   Separation of residential parking and service facilities from
commercial requirements.
      (3)   Minimize exterior lighting at upper levels.
   (d)   Type D: high density; Mixed use residential/commercial. Muscadine
corridor: To maintain the “street character” of lots bordering residential
neighborhoods, designs are required to meet building setback, coverage, and
design requirements of immediately adjacent neighborhoods (reference Bald Head
Association Design Guidelines, which may be available online from Bald Head
Association) excepting as follows:
      (1)   Height. Maximum height of the primary roof structure is 45' above
virgin grade at the building perimeter. “Usable space” located above a height
of 30' is to be accommodated within the roof mass (reference composition).
   (e)   Type E: institutional campus/public service buildings. Special
consideration should consider:
      (1)   Primary massing and elevation datums to relate to existing/
neighboring structures.
      (2)   Defined pedestrian access points to promote continuity of campus
program.
      (3)   Special use permitting.
      (4)   Safety: adjacency to primary streets, address heavy traffic passing
through campus areas, designate pedestrian "drop off” areas.

(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-104.   Specific site requirements.
   (a)   Storm water management. Allowable impervious surface area is based on
storm water permits issued by the North Carolina Department of Environmental
Health and Natural Resources (NCDEHNR). Different sites are subject to
different storm water requirements depending on the location, grade, existing
detention or retention structures, and the terms of the specific storm water
plan filed with and approved by NCDEHNR. The designer is responsible for
determining the storm water requirements, designing the project within the
impervious surface available, and securing all required permits.
   (b)   Hardscape paving. Exterior walkways may be paved with concrete pavers,
wood boardwalks or concrete. Loose gravel, rock or landscaped paving is not
approved for required building access. Asphalt paving is only approved for
passenger vehicle parking. Pervious paving and "honeycomb" paving is encouraged
in parking areas. Gravel, rock or landscaped paving can be used on ornamental
paths in a landscape plan.
   (c)   Signage. Building and overall project signage is regulated by the
Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances and these design standards. All
signs must be submitted to the CRB for approval. CRB approval is required for,
but not limited to, the color, shape, graphic design, font style, and message
to the extent necessary to preclude offensive or derogatory language. Provided
that a business logo is consistent with existing architecture and in compliance
with the requirements of the Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances and
these design standards, such logo may be used as or incorporated into project
signage. Except as otherwise set forth in these design standards, Village of
Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances, Sec.
32-403 regulates attachment methods for signs, the sign size, location and
other criteria.
   (d)   Landscape. Landscape plans are required and must show the type, size
and number of plants and the irrigation system, walkways or ornamental areas
incorporated into the landscaping. Details of any landscape accessories such as
benches, pergolas, trellises, or other permanent or semi-permanent structures
must be provided. Approved plant types and drawing requirements are listed in
appendix
A.6.
   (e)   Accessories. Flags/ flagpoles: the request to install a ground-mounted
flagpole must be submitted for approval and must include a site plan with
dimensions and specifications for the proposed pole location. Only one ground-
mounted flagpole may be installed on a property. Any ground-mounted flagpole
must be made of wood or high-quality metal. The flagpole must be no taller than
25 feet and no taller than the primary structure. A bracket-mounted flag kit is
allowed on main structures and does not require approval. The maximum flag size
allowed is four feet by six feet and does require approval. United States flags
shall be in good condition and displayed in a respectful manner in accordance
with the United States flag code of 1976.
   (f)   Parking and space requirements. The number of required parking spaces
for each project is identified in appendix
A.1.
   (g)   Trellis. When a trellis is to be installed, the following standards
must be met:
      (1)   Material: dimensional lumber.
      (2)   Maximum footprint of detached trellis: 120 square feet.
      (3)   Height: maximum ten feet, minimum eight feet measured from finish
elevation to lowest horizontal member
      (4)   Proportion to complement other structures on the lot.
(Ord. No. 2023-1102, 11-17-2023; Ord. No. 2024-0702, 7-19-2024)
Sec. 9-105. Landscaping.
   (a)   General considerations. When designing a landscape plan, please be
aware of the following:
      (1)   Disturbance of wetland areas and vegetation is to be avoided when
possible.
      (2)   Village approval is required for removal of any tree of three-inch
caliper or greater at 48 inches above grade.
      (3)   A plot plan showing trees of three inches or greater diameter is
required before proceeding, or those trees should be marked on the tree survey
if part of new construction. (See Tree Mitigation and Review Process sections
of the design standards.)
   (b)   Clearing, trimming and maintenance, special conditions.
      (1)   Vegetation salvaging. Prior to any clearing, the CRB administrator
must be contacted to schedule the tagging and salvaging of critical Bald Head
Island vegetation from the proposed construction area.
      (2)   Lot clearing for sale of property. Clearing of the entire
understory or clearing for the sole purpose of selling a lot is not permitted.
However, to provide ease of access, a path of 36 inches in width may be cleared
as long as no trees, tree limbs or clustered growth, subject to village
approval, are disturbed. Any violation due to more extensive clearing will be
subject to fines and/or mitigation.
      (3)   Lot clearing for survey or staking. Some clearing of understory
trees and shrubs may be required to prepare a site for survey or to stake the
proposed building site. Permission to clear such understory trees and shrubs
shall not be required by the CRB for the purpose of surveying but clearing
shall be limited to vegetation less than three inches in diameter at 48 inches
as measured along the trunk from ground level or any tree limb less than three
inches in diameter. Any vegetation larger than this, or any vegetation that
exists as clustered growth or having horizontal branching habits, must be
approved for removal regardless of diameter size. Exception: it is understood
that when surveying to establish the property lines of a lot, vegetation may
impede the ability of the surveyor to establish a sight line. Any vegetation
directly in the sight line that is less than three inches in diameter at 48
inches, as measured from the base at ground level, may be removed. CRB approval
must be granted to remove any vegetation three inches or greater in the sight
line. Violations of this requirement are subject to mitigation and fines.
      (4)   Lot clearing for any construction. All construction sites must
adhere to provisions in other sections of the design standards. The intent when
clearing for construction or renovation projects should be to disturb as small
an area as possible. An approved site plan is required prior to any vegetation
removal for construction.
      (5)   Understory removal. Understory should be removed only in the
designated building area as shown on the approved site plan. Building materials
or equipment should not be allowed to destroy remaining areas of understory or
be placed near trees. All trees should be protected with fencing and this
fencing must remain in place for the entire construction process.
      (6)   Canopy and understory trimming. Cutting and thinning should be kept
to an absolute minimum.
      (7)   Dune vegetation. The removal of vegetation from any dune area is a
critical issue. This vegetation (shrubs, grasses, or vines) holds the dunes in
place preventing erosion and storm damage. Due to the wind and salt
environment, most of these plants never grow large enough to be subject to
approvals for trees. However, they may be covered by additional CRB approval
requirements regarding limbs, clustered growth or understory.
      (8)   Mulch. If available, mulch used should come from the Bald Head
Island mulch site or be a pre-bagged product to help control pests.
      (9)   Synthetic/artificial plants. Synthetic and artificial plants are
not allowed.
      (10)   Pine straw. Pine straw is not allowed.
      (11)   Nothing may be affixed to a tree or vegetation.
      (12)   Grass. Installation of turf grass lawns is not permitted. Use of
native grasses that are naturally maintained are permitted (see plant lists).
      (13)   Herbicides. Herbicides can damage the root zones of desirable
trees and shrubs. The need for and use of herbicides may best be determined by
landscape professionals.
      (14)   Avoid using bush-hogs when removing vegetation since it is very
easy to scrape and damage desirable trees and shrubs with heavy equipment and
to increase undesirable compaction and root system damage.
      (15)   Maintenance. All reasonable means shall be taken during and after
construction to protect and preserve existing and newly installed landscape
material. Maintenance, irrigation, and replacement programs are to be in place
at completion of construction to ensure established landscapes.
   (c)   Tree and vegetation removal/mitigation.
      (1)   All existing trees three inches or greater in diameter, at 48
inches as measured along the trunk from the base of the tree at ground level,
shall be entered on a tree survey and submitted to the CRB with proposed site
plans. This survey shall depict the exact location, size and drip line or
canopy line of the trees and clearly identify the trees that will be removed
and the trees that will remain, along with a description of steps that will be
taken to protect them. Additionally, for dune lot tree surveys, vegetation,
(classified as two square feet or more of clustered growth at ground level
regardless of branching habits or branch diameter) shall also be noted on the
survey and if any of this type of vegetation is to be removed, it should be
clearly identified.
      (2)   Existing trees and vegetation must be protected during construction
with fencing. The fencing must remain in place throughout the entire
construction process. This fencing shall be wood snow fence and protect the
extents of the drip line where practicable (See Figure 21).

IMAGES/0-0-0-1993.png]
 
      (3)   The CRB may require a mitigation rate of up to 100% for each inch
of diameter of trees or vegetation to be removed. A mitigation response needs
to be determined by the CRB.
      (4)   All specimen trees shown on the tree survey outside of the building
envelope shall be carefully protected from construction activities in any
manner deemed appropriate by the CRB, including protective fencing. This
fencing shall remain in place throughout the construction process (see
construction/site standards).
   (d)   Unauthorized removal of trees and vegetation.
      (1)   The unauthorized removal of trees or clustered growth on any
property is considered a serious event and violation. The Village of Bald Head
Island Code of Ordinances restricts removal of trees and clustered growth.
Failure to obtain CRB approval prior to removal may result in fines and
mitigation.
      (2)   The Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances provides that
removal of any tree or trees three inches or greater in diameter at 48 inches
above grade requires permission and/or a landscape permit from the village
building inspector, even if the tree is determined to be dead or diseased.
      (3)   Per the Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances, removal of
branches of five inches or more in diameter also requires village approval.
      (4)   CRB approval is required for the removal of trees three inches in
diameter; understory vegetation one inch or greater in diameter, measured 48
inches along the trunk from ground level; tree limbs of three inches or more in
diameter; and clustered growth vegetation two square feet or more at ground
level regardless of branching habits or diameter.
      (5)   Removing trees or branches without first obtaining CRB approval
will result in a fine, and mitigation of the loss of trees or limbs. The
Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances allows the village to assess
fines of $500 per inch of diameter at 48 inches above grade of the cut tree.
      (6)   If mitigation is required, the property owner may be required to
plant a tree(s) of like kind and of the same size as the cut tree(s) within 180
days of the fine, guaranteeing the tree to survive for one year after the
planting date.
      (7)   The building inspector must approve the location(s) of the planted
tree(s). The CRB also has the discretion to require submittal of a landscaping
plan.
      (8)   In the case of "competing trees," the building inspector shall
decide which tree(s) will be removed. The removal of dead trees requires the
same CRB approvals as live trees but does not require a village contractor
permit. If a decision by the building inspector is disputed, the property owner
must provide sufficient evidence to show the tree is dead, represents a danger
to individuals or property or that the tree is diseased and will not live.
   (e)   Landscaping requirements for new construction and major renovation.
      (1)   Engage a trained landscape design professional.
      (2)   New construction landscape plans should utilize the proposed site
plan with topographical information provided by the survey/site plan that is
required for a draft level submittal.
      (3)   Parking and vehicular use areas shall be screened from adjacent
properties and public right-of-way with existing/protected vegetation or a
continuous solid row of evergreen plantings that will reach a minimum height of
four feet at maturity as set out in the latest edition of “American Standard
for Nursery Stock,” by the American Horticulture Industry Association, Inc.
(ANSI Z60.0).
      (4)   Commercial uses must be screened from abutting residential zoning
using either existing or planted vegetation. The screening shall be evergreen,
continuous, and a minimum of six feet in height at planting and of a variety
that reaches a minimum height of 25' at maturity as set out in the latest
edition of “American Standard for Nursery Stock,” by the American Horticulture
Industry Association, Inc. (ANSI Z60.1). Plants shall be spaced accordingly to
achieve this performance requirement.
      (5)   Existing built sites planning a major renovation should utilize a
site plan that includes all existing improvements, remaining existing
landscaping, hardscape and illustrate the proposed changes.
      (6)   Verify setbacks of the property as determined by the design
standards and the Village of Bald Head Island Code of Ordinances, as well as
government waterfront setback controls and maximum allowable impervious.
      (7)   Plants indigenous to Bald Head Island (identified as "native" on
the plant list) should be the predominant source for landscape plans. It is
required that a minimum of 70% of the new plant material be native to Bald Head
Island. The use of non-native plants (see glossary for definition) is limited
to a maximum of 10% of the plan. Up to 30% of the plant material may be N.C.
native. The plant lists are subject to change and plants not on these lists may
be considered.
      (8)   No known invasive plants may be planted (see plant lists, appendix
A.6.).
      (9)   Artificial plants are not allowed.
      (10)   During construction, naturalized areas of the property that are
not within the CRB approved building area (denoted by the limits of
construction fencing) must not be disturbed. Any areas outside the limits of
construction fencing that are disturbed must be restored to their original
natural character.
      (11)   The clearing of understory is not permitted in setbacks except as
permitted in these design standards within six feet of the structure, or as
necessary for an approved site plan or landscape plan and as reflected in the
approved site plan or landscape plan. For example, some clearing within a
setback may be required for driveway access. All clearing for new construction
must be reflected in the CRB approved plan.
      (12)   Water conservation is an important Bald Head Island issue. Drip
irrigation to maximize water effectiveness is strongly recommended. The plant
selection should consider limiting use of drip irrigation to the first year for
the establishment of new plantings.
   (f)   Recommended plant list. The lists are based upon plants that have been
found to be native to Bald Head Island, native to North Carolina and examples
of some of the non-native plants that have been planted on Bald Head Island.
The distinction between native and non-native species is important because
native species have generally adapted and evolved with the competing species,
predators, and diseases of an area over many centuries or longer. Bald Head
Island native plants support indigenous wildlife, habitats, ecosystem function
and ecosystem services. There are suggestions for which plants typically do
well in the various micro-island environments. The "please don't plant me" list
(found in appendix A.6.(g)) also includes common non-native invasive plants.
Lawns are not allowed. In reviewing landscape plans, the CRB will consider
plants not on these lists provided they are not considered invasive or
aggressive. Reference plant list in appendix
A.6.

is due at or before the preliminary submittal. A submittal will not be placed
on the meeting agenda for preliminary review if the fee is not timely received.
   (c)   The fees for new construction and major renovations cover a
preliminary and final review of the project. If another formal review is
needed, an additional review fee must be paid. This requirement is intended to
encourage the investment of appropriate preparation in the original submittal
and to simplify and expedite the approval process.
   (d)   For a submittal to be treated as a re-submittal, there can be no
changes to the building or project other than those required by changes, if
any, in the standards. All re-submittals will be subject to the standards in
effect as of the re-submittal date. Any changes other than those necessary to
meet current design standard requirements will be considered new construction,
subject to a new construction fee.

NUISANCES*

193.
DIVISION 1.
GENERALLY
Sec. 10-31. Beach Vitex (Vitex rotundifolia).
   (a)   Declaration of public nuisance. The plant known as Beach Vitex (Vitex
rotundifolia), is hereby found and declared to be a public nuisance due to the
significant negative impacts this plant has upon the public beaches and sand
dunes and loggerhead turtles, piping plovers, and native vegetative noted
above. It is estimated that there are five acres of Beach Vitex on Bald Head
Island located in at least 32 different locations.
   (b)   Planting of Beach Vitex prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any
person to plant or cause to be planted Beach Vitex (Vitex rotundifolia) on any
property located on Bald Head Island in the County of Brunswick.
   (c)   Eradication and restoration. In cooperation with the following
organizations (others may be added) Bald Head Island Conservancy, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, N.C. Cooperative Extension, South Carolina Beach Vitex
Taskforce, North Carolina Beach Vitex Taskforce, N.C. State University, a
program(s)will be developed to eradicate Beach Vitex from Bald Head Island. As
eradication precedes restoration of these areas with native plants and other
appropriate plants will be accomplished. The village will cooperate with
private land owners in this task but reserves the right to proceed with the
eradication and restoration project even if the land owner objects.
   (d)   Disposal. Since Beach Vitex has the ability to generate new plants
from seeds, stem sections and root sections, the proper disposal of plants and
plant parts is important. The village will collect Vitex separately from other
yard waste and will treat it appropriately. Beach Vitex clippings will not be
chipped and shredded into mulch and distributed around the island.
   (e)   Financing of this project. The Village of Bald Head Island will
provide funding for this project with the expectation that grants will be made
available at a later date to provide cost sharing and/or reimbursement for the
cost of this project. It is anticipated that it will take three to five years
to completely eradicate Beach Vitex from Bald Head Island. Estimated cost is
$5,000.00 per acre over this period of three to five years. It is recognized
that future programs of education and/or eradication may be necessary and the
village may undertake such as the council may from time to time approve.

clearly indicates a different meaning:
   Abandoned motor vehicle means any motor vehicle located within the confines

is:
      (1)   Left unattended upon a street or right-of-way within the village
for longer than 12 hours;
      (2)   Left unattended on property owned or operated by the village other

      (1)   Inoperable;
      (2)   Partially dismantled or wrecked; or

   Cross References: Definitions generally, §
1-2.
Sec. 10-52. Responsibility of removal.
   Whenever any motor vehicle is abandoned or junked upon the public streets or
highways of the village or any property owned by the village, it shall be the
duty and responsibility of the owner of such motor vehicle to cause the removal
thereof immediately and to pay for all costs incidental thereto. It shall be
unlawful for any person to allow a motor vehicle owned by that person to remain
abandoned upon a public street or highway or upon any property owned by the
village after notice has been given to such person for the removal of the
vehicle.
(Ord. No. 37, § 2, 9-18-1993)
Sec. 10-53. Authority of removal.
   Any motor vehicle which is abandoned or junked upon the public streets or
highways of the village or on property owned by the village or on private
property owned by individuals other than the owner of such vehicle may be
removed by or under the direction of the village building inspector or the
department of public safety to a storage garage or other area, provided no such
vehicle shall be removed from private property without the written request or
permission of the owner, lessee or occupant of such property unless the council
or a duly authorized city official shall find in writing that the aesthetic
benefits of removing a vehicle outweigh the burdens imposed upon the owner of
such property. Such finding shall be based upon a balancing of the monetary
loss of the apparent owner against the corresponding gain to the public by
promoting or enhancing community appearances. The following factors shall be
considered in making such a determination:
      (1)   Protection of property values;
      (2)   Promotion of tourism and other economic development and
opportunities;
      (3)   Indirect protection of public health and safety;
      (4)   Preservation of the character and integrity of the community; and
      (5)   Promotion of the comfort, happiness and emotional stability of area
residents.

lessee or occupant thereof, the person at whose request such vehicle is removed
shall be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the village for any expenses
incurred by reason of the removal and/or storage of such vehicle.
   (b)   The owner of any vehicle removed pursuant to this division from any
public street or highway or from any property owned by the village or any

of the possible sale or disposition thereof shall be given as promptly as
possible to the owner thereof at the owner's last known address according to
the latest registration certificate of title on file with the state division of
motor vehicles or the village police office and shall describe the vehicle,
place of storage and procedure for recovery thereof.
   (d)   Notice need not be given to the registered owner when the vehicle does
not display a license plate or a valid village registration certificate.
   (e)   Any time that an abandoned or junked vehicle shall be removed to a
place of storage, the village shall collect the currently required towing fee
and the currently required daily storage fee. Any owner shall have the right to
a prompt hearing to determine whether the vehicle was abandoned or junked
within the village in order to contest the towing and/or storage. The hearing
shall be heard by the village manager who shall determine by preponderance of
the evidence as to whether the same was in fact abandoned or junked. The right
of appeal from such decision shall be to the district county for the county. At
the conclusion of the hearing the village manager shall render his decision.
The decision shall be further reduced to writing and forwarded to the owner or
other individual seeking such hearing. Upon the mailing of the notice of
decision by the village council, the owner or other individual seeking a
hearing shall be entitled to appeal to the district court for the county by
giving due notice of appeal within ten days of the date that the notice of the
village manager's decision shall have been mailed to the individual appealing.
Pending any hearing or appeal in this division, the owner or other individual
may obtain a release of the vehicle at any time after the towing and/or storage
fee is paid or by posting a bond with the village in the form of cash in the
amount of the towing and/or storage fees. Unless the cash bond shall be paid,
storage fees shall continue to accrue pending resolution of the appeal.

and applicable law by the private property owner(s) responsible for such
maintenance, the access may be maintained, modified or removed by the village,
in its discretion. The cost of removal shall be due and payable by the private
property owner(s). Upon obtaining a license from the building inspector, owners
of waterfront lots adjacent to village-owned property may connect to an
existing access on village property, unless such connection would violate an
ordinance or other law, interfere with public uses of the village property,
interfere with village plans or uses of the property or constitute a public
nuisance.

single day.
   (6)   Permits for events hosted or sponsored by commercial entities,
including non-profit organizations, shall only be issued at beach accesses #5
and 39.
   (7)   All permit applications will be submitted, processed and allocated
using a process developed by the director of public safety. The public interest
in ensuring equitable and broad access to the enjoyment of beach bonfires will
guide permit allocation. No person shall be permitted to submit more than one
application per day of intended burning.
   (8)   Permits will be issued no earlier than twenty-four (24) hours prior to
the requested burn date, pending confirmation of suitable weather and
environmental conditions at the time of burn.
   (9)   Permits must be confirmed by and obtained from the department of
public safety before any fire on the beach is lit. All persons burning a beach
bonfire must have a copy of the permit on site and available for viewing by
department of public safety personnel at all times.
   (10)   Any violation of the conditions set forth in this section, including
failure to obtain or present a permit, lighting a fire outside designated
areas, or violating environmental protections, shall result in immediate
revocation of the beach bonfire permit, prohibition from obtaining future
permits for a one-year period, and possible fines as set forth in Sec.
12-52.

DIVISION 1.
GENERALLY
Subdivision 1.
Coastal Regular Phase
Sec. 14-31. Statutory authorization.
   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of
Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of
Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local
governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(Ord. of 9-26-2008, Art. 1, § A; Ord. of 3-20-2018)
Sec. 14-32. Findings of fact.
   (a)    The floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of Bald Head Island are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (b)    These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities
and by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other
hazards.
(Ord. of 9-26-2008, Art. 1, § B; Ord. of 3-20-2018)
Sec. 14-33. Statement of purpose.
   It is the purpose of this article to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that
may increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. of 9-26-2008, Art. 1, § C; Ord. of 3-20-2018)
Sec. 14-34. Objectives.
   The objectives of this article are to:
    (1)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
    (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
    (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
    (4)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
    (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges)
that are located in floodprone areas;
    (6)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
   (7)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the National
Flood Insurance Program;
   (8)   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
   (9)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of floodprone areas; and
    (10)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.
(Ord. of 9-26-2008, Art. 1, § D; Ord. of 3-20-2018)

waste may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into
any waters, including groundwaters.
   Elevated building means a nonbasement building which has its lowest elevated
floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers,
pilings, or columns.
   Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation,
buildings, structures or development into a special flood hazard area, which
may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   Existing building and existing structure means any building and/or structure
for which the "start of construction" commenced before January 27, 1986.
   Flood or Flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or

enforce the floodplain management regulations.
   Floodplain development permit means any type of permit that is required in
conformance with the provisions of this article, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
   Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but
not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
   Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation
facilities, structures, and their contents.
   Flood-resistant material means any building product [material, component or
system] capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours)
with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost
cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to
alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not
flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers
are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict
evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally
unstable are not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively
after submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to Technical Bulletin
2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, and available from the FEMA.
Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable flood-resistant
materials.
   Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse, including the

that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   Floodway encroachment analysis means an engineering analysis of the impact
that a proposed encroachment into a floodway or non-encroachment area is
expected to have on the floodway boundaries and flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge. The evaluation shall be prepared by a
qualified North Carolina licensed engineer using standard engineering methods
and models.
   Freeboard means the height added to the BFE to account for the many unknown
factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, blockage of bridge or culvert openings, and the hydrological effect of
urbanization of the watershed. The BFE plus the freeboard establishes the
"regulatory flood protection elevation".
   Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for
its intended purpose unless it is located in close proximity to water, limited
to a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo
or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-
term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.

historic district designated by a community with a "certified local government
(CLG) program".
Certified local government (CLG) programs are approved by the U.S. Department
of the Interior in cooperation with the North Carolina Department of Cultural
Resources through the State Historic Preservation Officer as having met the
requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended in
1980.
   Letter of map change (LOMC) means an official determination issued by FEMA
that amends or revises an effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance
study. Letters of map change include:
   (1)   Letter of map amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to
an effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA is based on technical
data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being in the
floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
   (2)   Letter of map revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that
may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, special flood hazard area
boundaries and floodway delineations, and other planimetric features.
   (3)   Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F): A determination that a
structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is,
therefore, no longer located within the special flood hazard area. In order to
qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in
accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations.
   (4)   Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP
requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood
hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map or
flood insurance study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built
documentation, a letter of map revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the
effective FIRM.
   Light duty truck means any motor vehicle rated at 8,500 pounds gross
vehicular weight rating or less which has a vehicular curb weight of 6,000
pounds or less and which has a basic vehicle frontal area of 45 square feet or
less as defined in 40 CFR 86.082-2 and is:
   (1)   Designed primarily for purposes of transportation of property or is a
derivation of such a vehicle, or

on coastal map studies marking the extents of Coastal A Zones (CAZ).
   Lowest adjacent grade (LAG) means the elevation of the ground, sidewalk or
patio slab immediately next to the building, or deck support, after completion
of the building.
   Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than
a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of this article.
   Market value means the building value, not including the land value and that
of any accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may
be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value), or
adjusted tax assessed values.
   New construction means structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of the initial floodplain management
regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   Non-encroachment area (NEA) means the channel of a river or other
watercourse, including the area above a bridge or culvert when applicable, and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
foot as designated in the Flood Insurance Study report.
   Otherwise protected area (OPA) see "Coastal Barrier Resources System
(CBRS)".
   Post-FIRM means construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after the effective date of the initial flood
insurance rate map.
   Pre-FIRM means construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred before the effective date of the initial flood insurance
rate map.
   Primary frontal dune (PFD) for purposes of this article only means a
continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep
seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and
subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major
coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the
point where there is a distinct change from a relatively steep slope to a
relatively mild slope.
   Principally above ground means that at least 51 percent of the actual cash
value of the structure is above ground.
   Public safety and/or nuisance means anything which is injurious to the
safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable
number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the
customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or
basin.
   Reference level is the top of the lowest floor for structures within special
flood hazard areas designated as zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99. The reference level
is the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor
for structures within special flood hazard areas designated as zone VE.
   Regulatory flood protection elevation means the "base flood elevation" plus
the "freeboard". In "special flood hazard areas" where base flood elevations
(BFEs) have been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus one (1) foot
of freeboard). In "special flood hazard areas" where no BFE has been
established, this elevation shall be at least one (1) foot above the highest
adjacent grade.
   Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into
compliance with state and community floodplain management regulations, or, if
this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that
impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected
development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the
ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   Salvage yard means any nonresidential property used for the storage,
collection, and/or recycling of any type of equipment, and including but not
limited to vehicles, appliances and related machinery.
   Sand dunes means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or
mounds landward of the beach.

a one percent or greater chance of being flooded in any given year as
determined in section
14-37, of this article.
   Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   Structure means a walled and roofed building, or a gas, liquid, or liquefied
gas storage tank that is principally above ground.
   Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
during any one-year period whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before the damage occurred. See definition of "substantial
improvement". Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost
of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or
exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
during any one year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
    (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure
and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to section
14-65.
   Technical Bulletin and Technical Fact Sheet means a FEMA publication that
provides guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP,
which are contained in Title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at
Section 60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by
state and local officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP
regulations and by members of the development community, such as design
professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing
bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create
regulations; rather they provide specific guidance for complying with the
minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations.
   It should be noted that Technical Bulletins and Technical Fact Sheets
provide guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or
community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design
professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more
restrictive state or local regulations apply to the building or site in
question. All applicable standards of the state or local building code must
also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
   Temperature controlled means having the temperature regulated by a heating
and/or cooling system, built-in or appliance.
   Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article.
   Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in divisions 2 and 3, of this article,
is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
   Water surface elevation (WSE) means the height, in relation to NAVD 1988, of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.
   Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

   (g)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the BFE and the elevation to which the
structure is to be built and that such construction below the BFE increases
risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the BFE may result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
   (h)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the FEMA and the State of North Carolina
upon request.
   (i)   Conditions for variances.

structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or
non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (j)   A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities or sites,
hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage
facilities that are located in special flood hazard areas provided that all of
the following conditions are met.
      (1)   The use serves a critical need in the community.
      (2)   No feasible location exists for the use outside the special flood

(Ord. of 9-26-2008, Art. 5, § A; Ord. of 3-20-2018)
Sec. 14-82. Specific standards.
   In all special flood hazard areas where BFE data has been provided, as set
forth in section
14-37, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of section
14-81, are required:
   (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the reference level, including
basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as
defined in section
14-35.
   (2)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in section
14-35. Structures located in zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with Article 5, Section I (2). A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the floodproofing standards of this
subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the
floodplain administrator as set forth in section
14-62(c), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   (3)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor or below the
lowest horizontal structural member in VE zones:
      a.   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      b.   Shall not be temperature-controlled or conditioned;
      c.   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      d.   Shall include, in zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         i.   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         ii.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         iii.   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         iv.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         v.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         vi.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      e.   Shall, in coastal high hazard areas (zone VE), either be free of
obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls, open wood latticework or
insect screening, provided they are not part of the structural support of the
building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or
wave action without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or
supporting foundation system or otherwise jeopardizing the structural integrity
of the building. The following design specifications shall be met:
         i.   Material shall consist of open wood or plastic lattice, or insect
screening; or
         ii.   Breakaway walls shall meet the following design specifications:
            1.   Breakaway walls shall have flood openings that allow for the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters to minimize damage caused by
hydrostatic loads, per section
14-82(3)d.i-iv; and
            2.   Design safe loading resistance shall be not less than 10 nor
more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
            3.   Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance
of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by state or
local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of
the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-
structural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with the
base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the North
Carolina State Building Code.
         iii.   Concrete pads, including patios, decks, parking pads, walkways,
driveways, pool decks, etc. the following is required:
            1.   Shall be structurally independent of the primary structural
foundation system of the structure and shall not adversely affect structures
through redirection of floodwaters or debris; and
            2.   Shall be constructed to breakaway cleanly during design flood
conditions, shall be frangible, and shall not produce debris capable of causing
damage to any structure. (The installation of concrete in small segments
(approximately 4 feet x 4 feet) that will easily break up during the base flood
event, or score concrete in 4 feet x 4 feet maximum segments is acceptable to
meet this standard); and
            3.   Reinforcing, including welded wire fabric, shall not be used
in order to minimize the potential for concreted pads being a source of debris;
and
            4.   Pad thickness shall not exceed 4 inches; or
            5.   Provide a design professional's certification stating the
design and method of construction to be used meet the applicable criteria of
this section.

nonstructural fill may be permitted for landscaping and for drainage purposes
under and around buildings and for support of parking slabs, pool decks, patios
and walkways.
         ii.   The fill material must be similar and consistent with the
natural soils in the area.
         iii.   The placement of site-compatible, non-structural fill under or
around an elevated building is limited to two feet. Fill greater than two feet
must include an analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional
demonstrating no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave
reflection that would increase damage to adjacent elevated buildings and
structures.
         iv.   Nonstructural fill with finished slopes that are steeper than
five units horizontal to one unit vertical shall be permitted only if an
analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional demonstrates no
harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave runup and wave reflection that would
increase damage to adjacent elevated buildings and structures.
   (4)   Additions/improvements.
      a.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         i.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure.
         ii.   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally
modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the
addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
      b.   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a substantial
improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to the existing
structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall require only the
addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      c.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         i.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure.
         ii.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      d.   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market
value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply
with the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the
one year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this article.
Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the
structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered
substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
requirement does not, however, include either:
         i.   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions.
         ii.   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (5)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, etc.) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the
following criteria shall be met:
      a.   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
      b.   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;

14-81(4); and
      g.   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in
conformance with the provisions of section
14-82(3)d.
An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 or that is a minimal
investment of $5,000 or less and satisfies the criteria outlined above is not
required to meet the elevation or floodproofing standards of section
14-82(2). Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other
accessory structures in accordance with section
14-62(c).
   (6)   Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within a
special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met:
      a.   Underground tanks. Underground tanks in flood hazard areas shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads during conditions of the design flood,
including the effects of buoyancy assuming the tank is empty;
      b.   Above-ground tanks, elevated. Above-ground tanks in flood hazard
areas shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation
on a supporting structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement during conditions of the design flood. Tank-supporting

designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist all flood-related and
other loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of the design
flood and without release of contents in the floodwaters or infiltration by
floodwaters into the tanks. Tanks shall be designed, constructed, installed,
and anchored to resist the potential buoyant and other flood forces acting on
an empty tank during design flood conditions.
      d.   Tank inlets and vents. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and vents
shall be:
         i.   At or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or fitted
with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the
contents of the tanks during conditions of the design flood; and
         ii.   Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of
the design flood.

MINOR DEVELOPMENTS*
*   State Law References: Area Management Act, G.S. 113A-100 et seq.
DIVISION 1.
GENERALLY
Sec. 14-101. Administrative policy.
   (a)   Designation of responsible local officer.
      (1)   Appointment. A permit officer is hereby appointed and authorized to
carry out the duties described in this policy and required to implement the
provisions of division 2 of this article.
      (2)   Qualifications. The permit officer shall be required to
successfully complete, within the first 12 months of employment, the required
course of study consisting of no more than two weeks duration that shall be
developed by the department of environment and natural resources in cooperation
with one or more of the state's institutions of higher learning.
      (3)   General duties. In discharging his duties the permit officer shall:
         a.   Administer and enforce in duly designated AECs the minor
development permit process, all applicable local ordinances, and all other
guidelines and standards established by the coastal resources commission (CRC)
and the village pursuant to the CAMA.
         b.   Be familiar with existing state and federal permits required in
this jurisdiction so that he can aid potential developers in determining when a
major development permit rather than minor development permit is required, and
to aid the developers in applying to the CRC when a major development permit is
required.
         c.   Assist in identifying and assessing projects of greater than
local concern and bringing them to the attention of the CRC. Such projects of
regional, state or national concern are almost certain to require some other
state permit and, therefore, require a major development permit from the CRC.
Therefore, they will usually be brought to the attention of the CRC through the
major development permit application.
         d.   Be responsible for implementing any procedures agreed on by the
governing bodies of the jurisdictions to which this article applies for the
purpose of coordinating the CAMA minor development permit with other locally
required permits. Such locally required permits include, but are not limited
to, plumbing permits, electrical permits, building permits, septic tank
permits, sand dune permits, and certifications of compliance with zoning and
subdivision regulations.
      (4)   Records. The permit officer shall prepare a quarterly summary of
all permit applications and dispositions to be presented to the governing body
of each of the jurisdictions to which this plan applies, to the CRC and to the
secretary of the department of environment and natural resources. The permit
officer shall keep correct and comprehensive records of all transactions
related to minor development permit requests (applications, grants, denials,
other dispositions) and shall maintain such records so long as any part of the
structure or entity to which it relates remains in existence; or, in the case
of denials or other instances, for a period of ten years.
   (b)   Procedures for responding to complaints.
      (1)   Citizen complaints. Upon receiving complaints from local citizens
that the implementation and enforcement plan is not being properly administered
and enforced the village council will investigate the situation and respond to
the alleged deficiencies. If the person making the complaint is not satisfied,
then he will be advised that he may take his complaint either in writing or in
person to the CRC.
      (2)   Response to the CRC. Upon notification from the CRC concerning
deficiencies in administration and enforcement of the plan, the village council
will investigate the alleged problem and prepare a response for the CRC. If the
allegation of deficiencies is found to be valid, the village council will,
within 30 days of the original notification from the CRC, inform the CRC of its
willingness and ability to correct the deficiency and prevent similar problems
in the future. If the village council finds the CRC's allegation of
deficiencies invalid, they will so inform the CRC. If the CRC disagrees with
that finding, the village council may request a hearing before the CRC or in
some other manner attempt to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the CRC
within a 90-day period after receipt of the CRC's original notification of the
deficiency. It is understood that if no such solution is reached within the 90-
day period, then the authority to issue permits for minor development pursuant
to this plan shall be automatically relinquished until such a time as the CRC
is convinced that the program will be properly enforced.

Management Act by issuing minor development permits in Areas of Environmental
Concern (AECs) within the village;
      (2)   Insure that minor development undertaken within AECs is in

commission, the department of human resources, the department of environment
and natural resources, the department of administration, the state mining
commission, the state pesticides board, or the state sedimentation control
board; which occupies a land area of 20 acres or less; or which occupies on a

shall be obtained from the designated permit officer.
   (c)   Posting requirements. The following materials shall be posted by the
permit officer on the administration building of thevillage:
      (1)   A precise description and map approximating all AECs within the
village;
      (2)   A copy of the standards for development adopted by the coastal
resources commission for each type of AEC found in the jurisdictions and the
statutory grounds on which a permit may be denied or conditioned;
      (3)   A copy of this division together with locally adopted
administrative policies for its enforcement;
      (4)   The name, location and mailing address of the permit officer
designated in subsection (b)of this section.
(Ord. No. 5, § 2(a), (b), 1-27-1986)
Sec. 14-124. Permit application.
   (a)   Required materials. An application for a minor development permit
shall consist of submitting the following to the permit officer and the
secretary of environment and natural resources:
      (1)   A completed application using a form approved and adopted by the
coastal resources commission. The application may be made in duplicate to the
permit officer who will then forward a copy to the secretary of environment and
natural resources.
      (2)   The currently required administration fee.
   (b)   Time limits. Upon receipt of a complete application for a minor
development permit, the permit officer shall have 25 calendar days to make
final disposition of the application unless the applicant is given written
notice by registered mail of one additional 25-day extension. Such extensions
may be made only in circumstances where the magnitude or complexity of the
proposed development requires additional time for proper evaluation of the
application.
   (c)   Incomplete and inappropriate applications. The permit officer shall
return incomplete, insufficient, or unauthorized applications to the applicant
within 15 calendar days. Any application received for any activity which
constitutes major development shall be returned by the permit officer with
instructions for submitting the application to the appropriate state agency.
   (d)   Coordination with other local permits. The permit officer shall
determine from the application what other local permits are required for the
development and shall inform the applicant of these other permit requirements.
   (e)   Disposition of permit application. After consideration of the evidence
submitted with the application, the permit officer shall grant, deny, or give
conditional approval to the minor development permit. The permit officer shall
maintain a record of all evidence and all matters relevant to each minor
development permit application. Such relevant information shall include, but is
not limited to, applications, correspondence, public notices, responses to
public notices, and a copy of the final disposition. Statutory grounds upon
which a permit officer bases the denial, conditioned grant, or return of
application shall be set out in writing. One copy shall be maintained by the
permit officer and one copy shall be given to the applicant, either in person
or by registered mail.
      (1)   Grant. A minor development permit shall be granted only if
consideration of the application results in none of the appropriate findings
listed in G.S. 113A-120(a).
      (2)   Conditional approval. The approval of a minor development permit
may be conditioned upon the acceptance by the applicant of certain reasonable
conditions as set out by the permit officer to protect the public interest with
respect to the appropriate findings listed in subsection (e)(1) of this
section. The applicant must sign the conditioned grant of approval as an
acceptance of the amendments of the proposed project plans in a manner
consistent with the conditions set out by the permit officer before the permit
shall become effective.
      (3)   Passive approval. Failure of the permit officer to approve or deny
a properly completed and filed application, or to give notice of an extension
beyond the initial 25-day disposition period shall result in a passive grant. A
passive approval shall have the full force and effect of an unconditioned
approval.
   (f)   Permit display. The property owner shall cause the properly granted
minor development permit to be displayed in full view on the site of the
development. This requirement shall apply to every permit no matter how it is
granted. It is, therefore, necessary that the property owner acquire a permit
received by passive approval for purposes of posting on the site before
proceeding with the development.
   (g)   Notice of permits approved. The permit officer shall give notice in a
local newspaper of general circulation at least once each month of permit
applications which have been approved either conditionally or unconditionally.

commission. The hearing before the commission shall be a quasi-judicial hearing
conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Coastal Area Management
Act (CAMA), any applicable rules and regulations adopted by the commission, and
any other state laws applicable to such procedures.
   (b)   Appeal to superior court. Any person directly affected by any final
decision or order of the coastal resources commission may appeal such decision

(Ord. No. 5, § 4, 1-27-1986)
Sec. 14-126. Injunctive relief and penalties.
   (a)   Injunctive relief. Upon violation of this division, the permit officer
may, either before or after the institution of proceedings for the collection
of any penalty imposed by CAMA for such violation, institute a civil action in
the general court of justice in the name of the affected local government for
injunctive relief to restrain the violation and for such other or further
relief in the premises as the court shall deem proper.Neither the institution
of the action nor any of the proceedings thereon shall relieve any party to
such proceedings from any penalty prescribed by CAMA for any violation of same.
   (b)   Penalties. Any person adjudged guilty of knowingly and wilfully
undertaking any development without acquiring such a permit, or of conduct
exceeding the authority of a permit granted, or of failure to observe the
agreed modification of a conditioned grant, or of any other applicable
regulations adopted by the village or the coastal resources commission pursuant
to the CAMA shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and for each violation shall be
punished in accordance with G.S. 113A-126. In addition, if any person continues
or further commits any of the above violations after written notice from the
permit officer, the court may determine that each day during which the
violation continues or is repeated constitutes a separate violation subject to
the foregoing penalties.

Sec. 14-127. Amendment procedures.
   (a)   Consistency. Amendments to this division shall be in accordance with

hearing concerning the proposed amendment shall be held. Notice of the public
hearing shall appear in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15
calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. The permit officer shall
compile and maintain a complete record of the hearing and written comments.
   (c)   Request to waive formal amendment requirements. Whenever a proposed
amendment is deemed sufficiently insignificant by the village council, that
body may petition the commission for a waiver of formal hearing and notice
requirements.

amendment, the amendment shall be submitted to the coastal resources commission
for approval. Upon coastal resources commission approval such amendment shall
be adopted by the village council as a part of the ordinances implementing this

Sec. 22-10. Summary of state regulations.
   The responsibility for administering the state's stormwater regulations is
shared by two divisions of the DEQ. These divisions are the Division of Coastal
Management and the Division of Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources.
   (1)   The Division of Coastal Management administers the Coastal Area
Management Act (CAMA). CAMA's goal is to protect areas of environmental concern
(AEC), which are fragile areas where incompatible development may result in
irreversible damage. CAMA identifies four broad categories of AEC's: estuarine
systems, ocean hazard areas, public water supplies, and natural and cultural
resource areas. Within these broad categories, there are 14 subcategories. The
subcategories that are most applicable to the village are: coastal wetlands,
estuarine waters, estuarine shorelines, public trust areas, ocean erodible
areas, high hazard flood areas, inlet hazard flood areas, and unvegetated beach
areas. Any structure to be built in an AEC must be permitted by the Division of
Coastal Management and must meet use standards adopted under CAMA and provided
in l5A NCAC 7H .0208. For a development in an AEC to be approved, it must be
water-dependent and must minimize impacts to the area's soil and ecology. Some
examples of water-dependent uses include bulkheads, piers, and marinas.
   (2)   The Division of Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources administers the
Sedimentation Pollution Control Act. This Act requires developers to prepare
erosion and sediment control plans for developments that disturb one acre or
larger. The plan must describe the temporary and permanent control measures the
developer will use to prevent accelerated erosion and off-site sedimentation.
Erosion and sediment control plans must meet certain site performance
standards, including restabilization of construction sites within a reasonable
time period, maintenance of a buffer along any natural watercourse or lake, and
protection from certain storm intensities. This Act gives local agencies the
authority to inspect land disturbing activities and to prosecute violators.
         The Division of Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources also administers
the state stormwater management program set froth in 15A NCAC 2H 1000 et seq.
This section of the administrative code regulates the density of developments
and mandates standards for engineered stormwater controls. The regulations
include requirements for non- residential developments with built-upon area of
more than 10,000 square feet, along with any development that requires a CAMA
major permit.
(Ord. of 5-20-2000, § 6; Ord. No. 2016-1202, 12-16-2016)
Sec. 22-11. Mandatory standards for existing development.
   (a)    No landscaping using impervious materials such as solid plastic and
vinyl that have a substantial or material impact on water percolation into the
soil, will be permitted. Property owners must remove any such materials
installed after May 20, 2000. Failure to comply within 30 days of notification
is subject to a fine of $50.00 for each incident and day of violation as well
as any and all costs of removal.
   (b)    Yard wastes, including dredge spoil, leaves, and yard trimmings, may
not be deposited into surface waters. Acceptable management practices for yard
wastes include composting and land filling. Persons who deposit yard wastes
into surface waters are subject to a fine of $200.00 for each incident of
violation as well as any and all costs of removal, cleanup and remediation.
   (c)    Septic systems must be pumped and maintained on a regular basis
according to local regulations to prevent contaminated wastewater from
discharging to surface waters. Owners of systems that are found to be
discharging to surface waters will be given seven calendar days to correct such
conditions. Property owners who fail to comply following this seven-day period
will be subject to a fine of $200.00 for each incident and day of violation as
well as any and all costs of cleanup and remediation.
   (d)    Hazardous compounds must not be discharged to a septic system. Such
compounds include but are not limited to paint, paint thinner, solvents,
pesticides, and petroleum products. Persons who discharge these hazardous

Sec. 22-12. Mandatory standards for new developments.
   Persons who fail to comply with these regulations after they have received
notice from the village will be subject to a $500.00 fine for each violation
and other actions or penalties as may be authorized by the village.
   (1)   Developments that require state certification.
      a.   For developments that are one acre or larger and for non-residential
developments with a built-upon area or more than 10,000 square feet, the state
will require a stormwater certification or permit from the Division of Energy,
Mineral, and Land Resources. The developer must submit a copy of the stormwater
certification or permit to the village manager.
      b.   The Division of Water Quality may require a wetland 401 water
quality certification and/or a dredge and fill permit. If so, the developer
must submit copies of the permit application and the permit to the village
manager.
      c.   Developments that infringe upon state-defined areas of environmental
concern (AEC) will require either a CAMA major from the Division of Coastal
Management or a CAMA minor permit from the village manager. If a CAMA major
permit is required, then the developer must submit a copy of the permit
application and the approved permit to the village manager.
   (2)   Developments that do not require state certification. A development
which disturbs less than one acre, with a built-upon area of 10,000 square feet
or less for non- residential development, and does not infringe upon any state-
defined areas of environmental concern will usually not require state
certification. However, such developments will be subject to the following
requirements:
      a.   All requirements set forth in section
22-11 of this chapter.
      b.   When it is feasible, lots which are adjacent to waterways should be
graded so that they drain away from the waterway. Bulkheads that have received
the necessary approvals may be installed to accomplish this.
      c.   Direct outlet channels to surface waters are prohibited, except
discharging of stormwater ponding by persons or entities permitted by the state
or federal government and approved by the village will be allowed.
   (3)   Village requirements.
      a.   The village manager and the village building inspector have the
authority to monitor development projects to ensure that developers comply with
the state permits mentioned in this section. The village shall also have the
authority to levy fines when the state permits have been violated.
      b.   The developer must submit a signed and notarized operation and
maintenance plan or manual for stormwater systems, indicating what operation
and maintenance actions are needed, what specific quantitative criteria will be
used for determining when those actions are to be taken, and who is responsible
for those actions to the village manager.
      c.   Where no stormwater collection system exists, site grading shall not
be done in such a manner that stormwater runoff is directed onto adjoining
lots.
      d.   Roadway drainage systems and stormwater control systems must be
designed by a professional engineer licensed in the state.

   Persons who fail to comply with these regulations after they have received
notice from the village will be subject to a $500.00 fine for each violation
and other actions or penalties as may be authorized by the village.
   (1)   For construction activities that disturb one acre or more, the state
will require an erosion and sediment control plan. The developer must submit a
copy of the approved erosion and sediment control plan to the village manager.
   (2)   The village manager and the village building inspector have the
authority to monitor construction activities to ensure that developers comply
with the erosion and sediment control plan. The village shall also have the
authority to levy fines when the erosion and sediment control plan has been
violated.
   (3)   Construction activities that disturb less than one acre and infringe
upon a state defined area of environmental concern will require a CAMA minor
permit from the village manager.
   (4)   All debris and trash must be contained onsite during construction. All
garbage receptacles must have high sides or covers to prevent the airborne
transport of debris such as plastic and paper. In addition, hazardous materials
used during the construction process must be stored and disposed of properly to
ensure that they do not enter surface waters. All equipment and/or tools should
be covered when not in use.
(Ord. of 5-20-2000, § 9; Ord. No. 2016-1202, 12-16-2016)

Appendix A. A citizen’s guide to identifying and reporting pollution problems.
   (a)    It is very important for you, as a citizen of the village, to report
problems when observed, so that the appropriate government agency can take
immediate action. Public reporting of pollution problems allows us to more
efficiently keep our community clean and environmentally safe.
   (b)    Be on the lookout for these common pollution problems:
   (1)   Unprotected areas of bare soil on a construction site or on any other
site. Construction sites must have erosion control structures such as siltation
fences and vegetated filters. In addition, no construction site should be left
without vegetation for longer than 30 working days after work on the site has
been completed. Under no circumstances should bare soil be left within 50 feet
of a wetland or waterway.
   (2)   Illegal dumping and illegal dump sites. Look for debris dumped in
creeks and along roadsides by companies and individuals trying to avoid
landfill fees.
   (3)   Discharges to creeks, wetlands or the ocean. Look for channels running
directly from a home or business to a wetland or a natural waterway. In
addition, look for pipes that discharge directly to a natural waterway.
   (4)   Oil and other chemical spills. Oil appears as a shiny slick on the
surface of natural waters. Other chemical spills may be identified when water
has an unusual color or odor.
   (5)   Sewer and septic system leaks from pipes and manholes. Usually, the
best way to identify sewer and septic problems is the odor. If you sense a
problem, try to identify the source.
   (6)   Degraded water. Some things to look for include bright green algae
growth, unusual odors, and dead aquatic life.
   (c)    To report pollution problems:
   (1)   If you see a pollution violation such as illegal dumping, in progress,
write down important information such as license plate numbers and company
names. If possible, you should take photographs as evidence. This information
may be used to hold polluters accountable.
   (2)   Report pollution violations and water pollution problems to the
village manager at (910) 457-9700.
   (3)   If the violation is of a very serious nature you may report problems
directly to the state Department of Environmental Quality in Wilmington at
(910) 796-7215. Once you describe the nature of the problem, you will be
directed to the appropriate person and agency.
(Ord. of 5-20-2000, app. A; Ord. 2016-1202, 12-16-2016)
Appendix B. A citizen's guide to improving water quality on the village. 
   Clean water and a healthy environment start with you and your neighbors.
This list offers many easy and inexpensive ideas that will benefit water
quality within the village. By practicing these suggestions, you will be doing
your part for a cleaner and healthier environment.
    (1)   Lawn and garden care. Well-maintained lawns and gardens can be a real
benefit to water quality and the local community. They add beauty, control
erosion, filter runoff from adjacent hard surfaces, reduce dust, and help
moderate summer heat. However, lawns and gardens are often the reason for
excessive water use and unnecessary applications of fertilizer. To help:
      a.   Reduce soil erosion by planting appropriate plant cover on bare
patches of ground.
      b.   Do not apply pesticides or fertilizer if heavy rain is expected. Use
only fertilizers that are really needed, based on soil tests and specific needs
of your plants. The agricultural extension center will test soils for free, and
some nurseries may also offer this service.
      c.   Keep fertilizer off driveways and sidewalks where it will be washed
into storm drains.
      d.   Remember that it is illegal to dump yard waste into creeks, ponds,
wetlands, and the ocean. Yard waste may be either composted or landfilled.
      e.   When removing mildew from your house or roof, use the most dilute
solution of cleaner that will do the job. If possible, use biodegradable
products.
      f.   Contact your county extension agent at (910) 253-2610 for
information on plant and integrated pest management (reducing the application
of chemicals by using natural controls).
   (2)   Household chemicals. Most households contain numerous chemicals that
can be dangerous if released into the environment such as: spot remover,
furniture polish, deodorizers, drain cleaner, oven cleaner, disinfectants,
ammonia, paint and other finishes, thinners and solvents, and batteries. These
chemicals can become pollutants if residues are poured down home drains or onto
the land surface. To help:
      a.   Select the least toxic products that will do the job and use only
when necessary. Use only recommended amounts and do not mix chemicals.
      b.   Do not apply chemicals near creeks, wetlands, or the ocean. Stuff
used cans of paint with newspapers and allow to dry before putting the cans
into the trash.
      c.   Never pour household chemicals down the drain or onto the ground.
   (3)   Motor vehicles. The oil from a single automobile can produce an eight-
acre oil slick, and a single quart of motor oil can contaminate as much as two
million gallons of drinking water. Used oil, antifreeze, and other motor
vehicle fluids are often dumped on land or into roadside ditches. To help:
      a.   Maintain motor vehicles and repair leaks promptly.
      b.   Dispose of used motor oil in oil recycling centers. Many auto parts
stores will take used oil and car batteries.
      c.   Arrange with local service stations or recycling centers to take
your used antifreeze. Avoid gas tank overflows during refueling.
      d.   Take your car to a commercial car wash where the cleaning water is
discharged to a treatment plant. If you do wash your car at home, use a
nontoxic and biodegradable detergent.
   (4)   Septic tanks. Septic systems depend upon bacterial action and soils to
absorb the discharge of household wastewater. If the drain field is damaged or
the soil becomes saturated, nearby surface waters may become contaminated with
sewage products.
      a.   Do not overload the system by allowing an inappropriately large
number of people to share a single dwelling.
      b.   Avoid putting household chemicals down the drain that could destroy
bacteria.
      c.   Consider giving up garbage disposals that add unnecessary solids and
grease to the system.
      d.   Do not flush or pour down the drain: grease, coffee grounds,
cigarettes, facial tissues and paper towels, sanitary products, and disposable
diapers.
      e.   Keep automobiles and heavy equipment off the system.
      f.   Maintain adequate vegetative cover over the drain field.
      g.   Follow the guideline below to determine how frequently to have your
septic tank pumped.
   Estimating Septic Tank Inspection and Pumping Frequency in Years
 
Tank Size (gallons) Number of People Using the System
                    1  2 4 6 8
900                 11 5 2 1 1
1,000               12 6 3 2 1
1,250               16 8 3 2 1
1,500               19 9 4 3 2
 
   (5)   Grinder pump stations. Grinder pump stations are located on the lots
within the village that have sewer service. These stations receive wastewater
discharged from a residence or commercial site and hold it until a certain
volume is being stored. At this point, the grinder pump turns on, grinding the
solids in the wastewater while it is pumped to the wastewater treatment
facility. If these pump stations are not properly maintained they may
malfunction, causing a discharge of untreated wastewater to nearby surface or
groundwaters.
      a.   Avoid putting household chemicals down the drain that could harm the
pump or electrical connections.
      b.   Consider giving up garbage disposals that add unnecessary grease to
the system.
      c.   Do not flush or pour down the drain grease, coffee grounds,
cigarettes, facial tissues and paper towels, sanitary products, and disposable
diapers.
      d.   Keep automobiles and heavy equipment away from the pump station.
      e.   Assure that the high water alarms are working properly so that
maintenance personnel may be notified upon failure of the system.
   (6)   Hard surfaces. Hard surfaces such as paved roads, driveways, rooftops,
and parking lots cause rapid runoff of rainwater. As water flows from hard
surfaces, it captures pollutants before it is discharged into our waterways. On
the other hand natural, vegetated areas improve water quality by soaking up and
cleansing rain. To help: On your property, try to limit the area of impervious
surfaces such as concrete, brick, highly compacted gravel, crushed shell,
coquina, and covered decks.
   (7)   Boats. Recreational boaters use a variety of cleaners, finishes, and
antifouling compounds, and are often responsible for discharging garbage,
sewage, and petroleum products into our waterways. Boats that create excessive
wakes contribute to shoreline erosion and increase sediment loads to adjacent
waterways. To help:
      a.   Avoid producing wakes within 500 feet of shore.
      b.   Scrub boats with brush and water instead of routinely using soap or
detergent. If cleaners are needed to remove stains, use phosphate-free
detergents.
      c.   Do not discharge boat sewage or trash into waterways.
      d.   Use a drop cloth when scraping boat hulls to catch toxic chips of
paint or antifouling.
   (8)   Animal waste. Animal wastes are high in nutrients and bacteria which
can contribute to excessive plant growth in waterways as well as closure of
shellfishing beds and swimming areas. Clean up after pets and dispose of wastes
in the trash or toilet.

as soon thereafter as can reasonably occur.
   Repairs completed by the permittee must be refurbished using 6" of ABC
stone, mechanically compacted in 2" lifts and 1 1/2" of I-2 asphalt. The repair
must be level with the existing road. The repair will be inspected by a village
representative before the posted bond is refunded to the applicant. Repairs not
within the above guidelines constitute a violation hereof.
   Repairs which are to be completed by the village or which are completed by
the village as a result of permittee's or any person's failure to comply
herewith or with any permit provision, shall be charged to the bond and to the
permittee or person responsible at a rate not less than the cost of repair of
such intrusive activity as shown by the village's invoice. The invoice of the
village shall be conclusive as to the cost of repair charged hereunder. Any
such cost incurred by the village in excess of the amount of a cash or other
bond shall be paid by the permittee or person responsible within seven days of
notification of charges being mailed to the person responsible or to the
permittee at the address shown on the application.
   To any fine or village repair invoice not paid in full within ten calendar
days of notification having been mailed to the permittee or person responsible
shall be added an additional fine of $50.00. Unpaid amounts shall accrue an

of a plat or heir division if the recording would be in conflict with this
section.
   (b)   No parcel identifier number as referred to in G.S. 161-30 shall be

improvements, including but not limited to streets, drainage works, utilities
or other improvement, nor shall any subdivider sell or contract to sell or

subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved under this
chapter and recorded in the office of the county register of deeds, shall be
guilty of a class I misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.00. The
description by metes and bounds, in the instrument of transfer, or other
document used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt
the transaction from this penalty. The village, by and through the village
council, may bring an action for injunction of any illegal subdivision,
transfer, conveyance or sale of land, and for an order requiring the offering
party to comply with this chapter.
   (b)   Building permits required pursuant to G.S. 160A-471 may be denied for
lots that have been illegally subdivided. In addition to other remedies, the
village may institute an appropriate action or proceedings to prevent the
unlawful subdivision of land, to restrain, correct, or abate the violation, or
to prevent any illegal act or conduct.

maintenance thereof. However, the village council may by resolution accept any
dedication made to the public of lands or facilities that are located within
its subdivision regulation jurisdiction. Acceptance of dedication of lands or
facilities located within the subdivision regulation jurisdiction but outside
the corporate limits of the village shall not place on the village any duty to
open, operate, repair, or maintain any street, utility line, or other land or
facility and the city shall in no event be held to answer in civil action or
proceeding for failure to open, repair, or maintain any street located outside
its corporate limits. Acceptance of the dedication or maintenance of any such
facility shall require a resolution of acceptance and/or maintenance by the
village council.

   State Law References: approval, G.S. 160A-374.
Sec. 26-13. Amendments to chapter.
   The village council may from time to time amend the terms of this chapter,
but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by
or shall have been submitted to the planning board for review and
recommendation. The planning board shall have 60 days within which to make a
recommendation. If the planning board fails to make a recommendation within the
specified time, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval for the
amendment.
(Ord. No. 8A, art. III, § VI, 7-17-1998)
Sec. 26-14. Exceptions to terms of chapter.
   (a)   Generally. Where, because of severe topographical or other conditions
peculiar to the site, strict adherence to the provisions of this chapter would
cause an unnecessary hardship, the village council may, on recommendation of
the planning board, authorize an exception to the terms of this chapter only to
the extent that is in the best interest of the village and not to an extent
which would violate the intent of this chapter. The village council shall not
approve exceptions unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence
presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public
safety, or health, or be injurious to other property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for exception is sought are
unique to the parcel and are not applicable generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict
adherence to these regulations is enforced.
   (b)   Conditions. In approving exceptions, the village council may require
such conditions as shall, in its judgement, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of this chapter.
   (c)   Procedures. A petition for any such exception shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider to village manager for review. The petition shall
state fully the grounds for the application and all the facts relied upon by
the petitioner. The petition shall then be presented to the planning board for
review. Upon review, the planning board shall provide a recommendation as to
whether the exception is or is not justified, and for what reason, and if
justified, under what terms and conditions. The petition will then be presented
to the village council, along with planning board recommendations for a final
decision. No preliminary or final plat shall be approved until all questions of
exception of this chapter have been resolved.
   (d)   Time applicability of modifications. Any exception granted under the
terms of this chapter shall expire 24 months from the date on which the
exception was granted, in the event the plat has not been recorded.

PLAT APPROVAL GENERALLY*
*   State Law References: for plat approval, G.S. 160A-373.
Sec. 26-51. Generally.
   (a)   The following sections are an outline of the procedure for obtaining
approval of the subdivision of land within the territorial jurisdiction of this
chapter. The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists
of two separate steps. However, informal consultation with the village manager
for advice and assistance and preparation of a sketch plan is recommended prior
to the submission of the preliminary plat. The first step is the preparation
and submission to the planning board, and then to the village council a
preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision. The second step is the
preparation and submission to the village manager of a final plat together with
required certificates and assurances. The final plat is the instrument recorded
in the office of the register of deeds when duly approved pursuant to the terms
of this chapter.
   (b)   Any subdivider wishing to subdivide any tract shall submit a
preliminary plat of such proposed subdivision for approval. The following
procedures shall dictate the process of approval of a subdivision in the
jurisdiction of the village.
(Ord. No. 8A, art. IV, § I, 7-17-1998)
Sec. 26-52. Filing fees.
   Filing fees for subdivisions shall be as set forth by the village council in
their approved fee schedule and shall be modified from time to time, the
modification of which shall not constitute an amendment to this chapter
requiring review by the planning board. Filing fees shall be payable to the
village upon initial submission of the preliminary plat to the manager by the
subdivider.
(Ord. No. 8A, art. IV, § II, 7-17-1998)
Sec. 26-53. Procedures for securing approval of subdivisions.
   (a)   Sketch plan.
      (1)   Submission. Prior to the filing of a preliminary plat, a sketch
plan may be submitted to the village manager. The purpose of the sketch plan is
to enable the staff to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning
and engineering work necessary for the preparation of a preliminary plat and
final plat as required in this chapter.
      (2)   Conference. For the purpose of informal and confidential review and
discussion, a conference may be held between the subdivider or his agent, and
appropriate village staff. At the request of the staff, a field trip to the
subject property may be planned with representatives of the subdivider present.
      (3)   Review. Following the conference, based on the information on the
submitted sketch plan, the conferring officials may, as promptly as possible,
advise the subdivider of the extent to which the proposed subdivision conforms
to the applicable requirements of this chapter and may further suggest any
modifications of the plan which are deemed advisable or necessary to secure
compliance.
   (b)   Preliminary plat submission.
      (1)   Submission. The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat and
submit it to the manager with the application fee and all required
supplementary material. Ten copies of the preliminary plat and required
supplemental material shall be submitted to the manager not less than 21 days
prior to the next meeting of the planning board. The preliminary plat shall
contain all information as set forth in section
26-124 of this chapter.
      (2)   Review procedure.
          a.   Generally. One copy of the preliminary plat may be submitted to
the following people/agencies as determined by the village manager: village
manager, village engineer, director of public safety, building inspector, water
and sewer utilities, affected electric and telephone utility, and other
applicable review agencies. These agencies are to report facts, conclusions,
and recommendations to the village manager as soon as possible, but not later
than 14 days after submittal of the preliminary plat. The village manager will
also review the preliminary plat for compliance with the terms of this chapter.
   By letter filed with the village manager, an applicant shall identify an
official agent or agents in order to file a proposal prior to such proposal
being accepted to begin the timing and review process pursuant to this chapter.
This official agent so identified shall have full authority over representation
of the proposal including authority to agree to and make any changes determined
during the course of review.
         b.   Technical review. Fourteen days prior to the planning board
meeting, the village manager may call and conduct a technical review committee
meeting. Attendance of the subdivider/agent is mandatory. Notice of the meeting
by first class mail shall be given to the subdivider or the designated agent.
Representatives of the above referenced review agencies will also be invited to
attend to offer comments on the subdivision proposal. Presence and
participation of the official agent is mandatory. If the subdivider or the
official agent does not attend the review session, no discussion of the
proposal will be allowed, and it is automatically rescheduled for the next
monthly review session. At this meeting, the village manager will review the
subdivision proposal to check for compliance with all applicable plat
requirements and regulations set out in this chapter.
         c.   Planning board approval. The manager shall submit the preliminary
plat proposal to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the planning board
occurring more than 28 days after the submission of the preliminary plat to the
manager. The subdivider shall submit ten copies of the proposal to the planning
board, including any necessary revisions, not less than seven days prior to the
regularly scheduled meeting. The manager may report to the planning board as to
the compliance of the preliminary plat to the requirements of this chapter and
shall make any recommendations with regard thereto that the manager deems
relevant to the preliminary plat. The planning board shall consider the
preliminary plat in open session and shall require the attendance of the
subdivider or his agent. Notice of the meeting by first class mail shall be
given to the subdivider or designated agent. Failure of the subdivider or agent
to attend the planning board meeting at which such preliminary plat is
considered shall result in the deferral of any discussion or consideration
thereof and the automatic rescheduling of consideration of such plat to the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the planning board. If the subdivider or
his agent fails to attend two consecutive regularly scheduled meetings of the
planning board at which such preliminary plat is scheduled for consideration,
the proposal shall be deemed withdrawn by the subdivider. At its meeting the
planning board shall review the preliminary plat proposal and all other
pertinent material, shall hear from the official agent, and shall determine
whether the proposal meets the policy, purposes and standards established by
this chapter. The planning board then shall recommend to the village council
approval, conditional approval, deferral, or denial of the subdivision
proposal.
         d.   Village council approval. The planning board shall submit its
findings and recommendations to the village council at their next regularly
scheduled meeting. Upon recommendation from the planning board, the plat shall
be submitted to the village council. The subdivider shall submit ten copies of
the proposal to village staff for distribution to the council no less than ten
days prior to the village council meeting. The village council may approve,
reject, defer or grant conditional approval of the proposal.
   (c)   Subdivision final approval.
      (1)   Compliance with improvement requirements. Upon approval of the
preliminary plat by the village council, the subdivider may proceed with the
preparation of the final plat, and installation of or arrangement for required
improvements in accordance with the approved preliminary plat and the
requirements of this chapter. Prior to approval of a final plat, the subdivider
shall have installed the improvements specified in this chapter or guarantee
their installation as provided in this chapter. No final plat will be accepted
for approval unless the village manager acknowledges compliance with the
improvement or guaranteed standards of this chapter. No final plat will be
approved by the village manager until and unless the subdivider shall have
completed construction of the subdivision improvements or posted the cash or
equivalent security or surety in accord with the requirements set forth in
sections
26-201 and
26-202.
      (2)   Partial development. If the preliminary plat is approved with
designated phases, the final plat may constitute that portion of the
preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at that
time. Such portion shall conform to all requirements of this chapter including
installation of required improvements. The face of the plat shall also contain
certifications, all to be executed as required in section
26-91 et seq.
      (3)   Signature for recordation. Once the final plat has been approved by
the village manager, he shall sign it in the name of the village council, as
its agent, for recordation. The village manager has the authority to require a
final plat to come before the village council in a regular meeting, for
approval for recordation.
      (4)   Minor corrections. In the event of changes between the approved
preliminary plat and the final plat submitted to the manager for approval, the
manager shall have the authority to approve such final plat only in those
instances where the discrepancy between the approved preliminary plat and the
submitted final plat shall be in order to correct typographical errors or other
revisions to the preliminary plat not affecting compliance with any of the
substantive features of the subdivision. In any circumstance, the manager shall
have the authority to submit any revised final plat to the village council for
approval of revisions.
   (d)   Preliminary plat approval standing in time.
      (1)   Approval of any preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of 24
months from and after the date of approval thereof. Within 24 months of the
date of approval of any preliminary plat, the subdivider shall install all
required subdivision improvements or make any provisions for guarantee of the
installation thereof pursuant to section
26-91 et seq. and thereafter may submit a final plat for approval by the
manager. Failure of the subdivider to install subdivision improvements or
provide and post the necessary guarantees in lieu thereof and to provide to the
manager a final plat for approval or to record such approved final plat within
such 24-month period shall void the approval of the preliminary plat. Any
subsequently proposed subdivision of such property shall be approved only upon
conformity with the terms and conditions of this chapter.
      (2)   For any subdivision which has received approval of the preliminary
plat and which discloses on its face that the subdivision is to be approved and
recorded in sections or phases, and where the plat for one such section or
phase shall receive final approval and be recorded within 24 months of the date
of preliminary approval thereof, the subdivider shall automatically have an
additional 18 months from and after the expiration of 24 months from the date
of approval of the preliminary plat in which to complete subdivision
improvements for all sections or phases thereof or post the appropriate bond in
lieu thereof and to submit to the manager a final plat of all other sections or
phases thereof and to record the same. Any portion of the subdivision which had
received approval of the preliminary plat but the final plat to which is not
approved and recorded within such succeeding 18-month period shall have such
approval as to that portion of the subdivision voided and any future
subdivision thereof shall be approved only upon conformity with the terms and
conditions of this chapter.
      (3)   No plat which has received preliminary approval shall be submitted
to the manager for final approval in phases or sections other than preliminary
plats which show plainly on the face thereof that the plat is to be submitted
for final approval in phases or sections.

ARTICLE IV.
MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS
Sec. 26-121. Generally.
   Each subdivision shall contain the improvements specified in this article,
which shall be installed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter
and paid for by the subdivider, unless other means of financing is specifically
stated in this chapter. Land shall be dedicated and reserved in each
subdivision as specified in this article. Each subdivision shall adhere to the
minimum standards of design established by this article.
(Ord. No. 8A, art. VI, § I, 7-17-1998)
Sec. 26-122. Name duplication.
   The name of the subdivision shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the
name of an existing subdivision within the village.
(Ord. No. 8A, art. VI, § II, 7-17-1998)
Sec. 26-123. Lots.
   The orientation, size, width, depth, and other standards of design for lots
in a proposed subdivision must comply in all respects with the requirements of
chapter
32, pertaining to zoning for the district in which the subdivision is located
and any other specifically adopted plans.
(Ord. No. 8A, art. VI, § III, 7-17-1998)
Sec. 26-124. Streets.
   (a)   Generally. The arrangement, character, width, grade, and location of
all streets shall provide for the most advantageous development of the entire
neighboring area, and shall be considered in relation to existing and planned
streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets. Standards that apply to streets are as follows in subsection (b)
through (l).
   (b)   Relationship of proposed streets to adjoining streets. The proposed
street system shall be extended in alignment with existing streets unless
otherwise approved by the village council.
   (c)   Street names. Proposed streets, which are proposed to be in alignment
with others already existing and named, shall bear the name of the existing
streets. Other street names shall be assigned by the subdivider subject to the
approval of the village manager. Names of streets which duplicate or are
phonetically similar with the names of existing streets shall not be approved.
   (d)   Access to public streets. Every lot shall have either direct or
indirect access to a public street. A lot has direct access to a public street
if the lot abuts such a street for at least 30 feet. A lot has indirect access
if it is abutting a public street for less than 30 feet or has access to a
public street only by means of a private street. All private streets shall be
designed so as to afford, for emergency vehicles as well as public utility and
maintenance vehicles, ingress and egress over such street to each lot with
indirect access.
   (e)   Intended use of streets. Street widths shall be as following:
      (1)   Secondary streets. Streets leading into and within subdivisions,
whether public or private, shall be provided with a right-of-way. Every
secondary street which connects a subdivision to a public street serves as a
means of ingress and egress and shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 30
feet. However, the village council may require wider rights-of-way in
circumstances, where, due to design, topography or other factors peculiar to
the land to be subdivided, the minimum width set forth herein is deemed to be
inadequate to permit such street to function safely as a secondary street.
      (2)   Primary thorough fares. When a street within a subdivision serves
as a collector for 100 lots or more, or is capable of extension onto abutting
lands with that capability, it shall be classified as a primary thoroughfare
and there shall be a minimum right-of-way of 40 feet for single lane primary
thoroughfares and bifurcated primary thoroughfares. If a street connects two
primary thoroughfares, it shall be classified as primary thoroughfare,
regardless of the number of lots it serves. Other internal secondary streets in
a subdivision may be provided with a right-of-way width of 30 feet. If a
subdivision connects to an existing primary thoroughfare, and contiguous
alignment would warrant the extension of such thoroughfare, the village council
may allow easements on both sides of the right-of-way to compose the required
width.
   (3)   Service access thoroughfare. When a paved surface is provided
primarily for service vehicles and resident vehicles and not general traffic it
shall be classified as a service access thoroughfare.
   (f)   Minimum design and construction standards. It is the intent of this
chapter that all streets, within a subdivision or not, be designed and
constructed to minimum standards including drainage, grading, subbase, base and
paving. Any new subdivision road shall be paved and constructed according to
the minimum standards of design and construction according to this chapter. For
every public street, all of the following minimum design and construction
standards and criteria for subdivisions shall apply:
      (1)   Design criteria by road classification.
         a.   The following list classifies road types into three categories
and dictates the minimum design standards for each classification:
 
Classification Type
A              Secondary streets and culs-de-sac

         b.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles (90 degrees).
         c.   New street intersections shall, whenever practical, coincide in
centerline alignment with any existing or approved preliminary plat or final
plat intersections on the opposite side of the street. Innovations in design
are encouraged through such means as curvilinear streets, culs-de-sac, courts,
and circles.
         d.   At all intersections, there shall be either an unobstructed 25-
foot radius or a 25-foot diagonal cutoff. Minimum sight distance along
intersecting roads shall be 50 feet. Crossovers will be 1 1/2 times as wide as
its connecting roads, with a minimum turning radius of 22 feet.
         e.   Add two feet to pavement width if stand up roll-out curbing is
used. If curbing is flush with pavement surface, then curbing shall at least be
one foot wide on each side to allow two additional feet of barrier-free driving
surface area.
      (2)   Pavement design. All streets shall meet the following minimum
requirements for base and pavement surface:
 
Base Course             Pavement Surface
6" ABC stone, compacted 1.5" SA or I-2 asphalt or BST
4" asphalt Base         1.5" SA or I-2 asphalt or BST
ABC                     Aggregated base course, no. 7 stone
SA                      Bituminous concrete surface course, type F-1 (sand
                        asphalt)
I-2                     Bituminous concrete surface course, type I-2
BST                     Bituminous surface treatment (3 courses)
 
*Geosynthetic material, when used under four inches of compacted ABC stone
base, shall be considered the equivalent of six inches compacted ABC stone
alone.
   Any design or materials that may vary from any street design or materials
listed in subsection (f)(2) of this section shall have performance
characteristics equal to or greater than design and materials required in
subsection (f)(2) of this section and the use of the such design and/or
materials shall be approved by the manager only prior to actual installation of
the street and then only upon a showing by the subdivider, by clear, cogent and
convincing evidence, to the manager that such proposed substitute design or
materials meets or exceed performance characteristics of the design or
materials required by and similarly meet all requirements set forth in the then
current edition of North Carolina Standard Specifications for Roads and
Structures published by the state department of transportation.
      (3)   Drainage criteria. All subdivisions must meet all state, federal,
and village stormwater and drainage requirements.
      (4)   Utility easements.
         a.   For public streets, the construction and maintenance of all
utilities, cable, and telephone lines shall be located in the street rights-of-
way between the paved roadway and the street right-of-way line, except gravity
collection sewer lines may be located under the pavement within the right-of-
way. Where topography or subdivision design considerations make such location
impractical and utilities must be located outside the right-of-way, then a
perpetual unobstructed easement shall be provided with access to the street
right-of-way. The approving board shall determine where these exceptions are
necessary.
         b.   In addition, manholes should be designed and located in such a
manner that will cause the least interference with roadway users, other
utilities and future highway expansion. Every effort should be made to avoid
their location in wheel paths or at street intersections. All plans,
specifications, design computations, and installations of manholes shall meet
the state department of transportation standards.
         c.   Easements shall be provided for each drainage path, and shall be
a width adequate to accommodate any such installation and maintenance.
         d.   An easement for utilities which cannot be accommodated within the
street easement shall be provided to ensure that there can be service to each
lot by electric, telephone, water and sewer utilities. When such easements are
required they shall provide ten feet on each side of the lot line, for a total
of 20 feet.
   (g)   Water and sewer systems.
      (1)   Each lot shall be capable of service with a water system and a
sewage disposal system meeting standards and requirements of the state.
      (2)   When a subdivision is within 1,000 feet of a water or sewer system,
and the system has the capacity to provide the necessary water and sewer, the
subdivider shall connect to such system and shall design a water distribution
system for the subdivision meeting any requirements of state and village
ordinances.
   (h)   Platting to ownership boundaries; reserve strips. All subdivisions
must extend to outer property lines of the parcel of property to be subdivided.
Survey descriptions must conform to existing survey descriptions of record to
ensure there is no land area remaining between the lots and streets and the
property boundary.
   (i)   Observance of federal and state requirements. The subdivider shall
exercise care in determining that all federal and state regulatory statutes and
administrative code requirements relating to lands and waters are satisfied.
   (j)   Private streets.
      (1)   The road classification utilized (A, B, C) for public streets shall
be the same as private. The following requirements should apply to all private
streets:
 
Description        A (feet) B (feet) C (feet) D (feet)
Right-of-way width 20       30       40       20
Clearing width     16       16       16       14
Base course width  12       14       12       12
Clearing height    12       12       12       12
 
   *The Harbor streets are covered under a separate agreement made effective
March 21, 2013.
      (2)   The village council may allow clearing widths in some cases to be
less, due to specimen tree preservation. Due to the site specific concerns of
the island, every effort should be made to blend roadways with the natural
contours of the island.
      (3)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles (90 degrees).
      (4)   New street intersections shall, whenever practical, coincide in
centerline alignment with any existing or approved preliminary plat or final
plat intersections on the opposite side of the street. Innovations in design
are encouraged through such means as curvilinear streets, culs-de-sac, courts,
and circles.
      (5)   The village council in some cases may require wider roads or
clearing area to promote public safety and the interest of the public. Private
streets must be indicated on plats as private, and maintenance and upkeep shall
be the responsibility of the property owner's association. For private streets,
the following statement shall be printed in bold on the plat of record:
   NOTE: THE STREETS DESIGNATED HEREON AS "PRIVATE" ARE NOT OR WILL NOT BE
CONSTRUCTED TO MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR DEDICATION TO AND ACCEPTANCE BY THE
VILLAGE OF BALD HEAD ISLAND AND THE VILLAGE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE, NOW OR AT
ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE, FOR MAINTENANCE OF ANY STREET, PAVEMENT, UTILITY OR
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS LOCATED WITHIN THE RIGHTS-OF-WAY OF ANY PRIVATE STREET.
   (k)   Street acceptance standards. In order for a street to be accepted into
the village street system, the following criteria shall be met:
      (1)   The street must be public as defined in this chapter and therefore
must meet the minimum design and construction standards set forth in subsection
(f)of this section ("construction standards").
      (2)   The individual(s)or entity dedicating the street ("dedicator") must
dedicate the entire street right-of-way to the village free of charge.
      (3)   The dedicator shall provide a sealed North Carolina engineer's
written certificate stating that the street meets the construction standards
and has no condition or deterioration which suggests any existing or imminent
failure to comply with the construction standards. In addition, the engineer
will evaluate the street being proposed, assess for drainage issues, and submit
a sealed certificate that the street has adequate drainage for use as a public
street. The cost of the engineer's certification and drainage assessment shall
be the responsibility of the dedicator.
      (4)   Dedicator shall submit a letter stating that there has been no
flooding or drainage issues within the past 12 months on the street being
proposed for dedication.
   The village has the right to go onto and inspect the street and to obtain
core samples for independent testing and analysis prior to acceptance of the
street. The village has the right to refuse acceptance of any street offered
for dedication.
   (l)   Timber bridge construction standards.
      (1)   The village shall review and approve all plans and specifications
for timber bridges proposed to be constructed as a part of any public or
private street. Timber bridges, whether constructed as a part of public or
private streets, shall adhere to public and private street standards for right-
of-way widths, unobstructed driveable area as determined by required base
width, clearing height, minimum turnaround radius, and minimum sight distances
in accordance with article IV of this chapter.
      (2)   The proposed construction shall comply with all village ordinances,
state building codes, village transportation plans, and all applicable CAMA
requirements. Further, timber bridges must be designed and constructed to the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
standard specifications for bridges and structures.
      (3)   The village transportation engineer shall review and approve design
and construction plans for compliance with this section, and to address other
safety concerns as needed, prior to construction. Such improvements shall be

FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Sec. 26-201. Preparation of final plat and installation of improvements.
   Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the village council,
the subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the final plat, and the
installation of or arrangement for required improvements in accordance with the
approved preliminary plat and the requirements of this chapter. Prior to
approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall have installed the improvements
specified in this chapter or guaranteed their installation as provided in this
chapter. No final plat shall be approved by the manager until all subdivision
improvements have been completed or guarantees furnished in lieu thereof in
accord with this article. For any preliminary plats which indicate on their
face that the subdivision will be accomplished in sections or phases, all
subdivision improvements for that phase shall be completed prior to submission
of the final plat for that phase to the manager for approval.
(Ord. No. 8A, art. VIII, § I, 7-17-1998)
Sec. 26-202. Improvements guarantees.
   (a)   Agreement and security required. In lieu of completion of subdivision
improvements prior to final plat approval, the subdivider may execute an
agreement with adequate surety or security whereby the subdivider shall commit
to completion of all improvements subsequent to final plat approval. Upon
execution of an agreement by the subdivider, together with posting of adequate
security or sureties as required in this chapter, the final plat shall be
approved by the manager if otherwise in conformity to the requirements of this
chapter. In conjunction with the agreement to complete subdivision
improvements, the subdivider shall either provide a surety for the completion
of the improvements or post a cash or equivalent security to secure completion
of the subdivision improvements. The security or surety performance bond shall
be in an amount of 1.25 times the cost of completion of all subdivision
improvements as estimated by the village manager.
      (1)   Surety performance bond. The subdivider may obtain a performance
bond from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in the state. The
bonds shall be payable to the village and shall be in an amount equal to a
minimum of 1.25 times the entire cost, as estimated by the village manager, of
installing all required improvements. The duration of the bond shall be until
such time as the improvements are accepted by the village.
      (2)   Cash or equivalent security. The subdivider shall deposit cash, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or other instrument readily convertible into cash
at face value or with the financial institution designated as an official
depository of the village. The use of any instrument other than cash shall be
subject to the approval of the village. The amount of deposit shall be equal to
a minimum of 1.25 times the cost, as estimated by the village manager, of
installing all required improvements. If cash or other instrument is deposited
in escrow with a financial institution as provided above, then the subdivider
shall file with the village an agreement between the financial institution, the
subdivider, and the village in accordance with the following:
         a.   The cash or equivalent security shall be held by the financial
institution in trust until release of the cash or equivalent security by the
village. Such cash or equivalent security shall not be used or pledged by the
subdivider in any manner, revoked, withdrawn or diverted until release of the
sum by the village.Failure by the subdivider to complete all subdivision
improvements pursuant to plans and specifications within the time limitations
specified therefor and in conformity with this chapter shall be a default by
the subdivider under its agreement. Upon notification by the manager of the
subdivider's default and submission to the financial institution of an
engineer's estimate of the amount needed to complete the improvements, the
financial institution shall immediately pay to the village funds estimated to
complete the improvements plus administrative fees up to the full balance of
the cash or equivalent security. If the cash or equivalent security is in
excess of the amount estimated by the engineer to complete the subdivision
improvements plus administrative fees associated therewith, the financial
institution shall continue to hold remaining portions of cash or equivalent
security until notified by the manager that the improvements have in fact been
completed. Once improvements have been completed by the village, the village
may make additional demands of the financial institution for the total actual
cost of completion of the improvements, together with administrative costs
incurred by the village associated with default and completion of the
subdivision improvements by the village. The financial institution shall
thereupon pay from the cash or equivalent security all costs incurred by the
village in completion thereof plus all administrative costs up to the full
balance of the cash or equivalent security. Thereafter the financial
institution may release to the subdivider any remaining cash or equivalent
security.
      (3)   Default. If failure by the subdivider to complete all subdivision
improvements pursuant to the plans therefor and pursuant to this chapter within
the time frames set forth in the agreement, the manager shall notify the
subdivider, the surety, the financial institution holding any security, and any
other interested parties of the fact of default and the village's intent to
complete all subdivision improvements. Upon such default the village shall
undertake an engineer's estimate of the cost of completion of such
improvements. The village may demand that the surety complete the improvements
or may undertake the completion of the improvements itself. If the village
shall elect to complete the improvements itself, the village may demand of the
surety or the financial institution holding the cash or equivalent security an
amount equal to the estimated cost of completion, together with all
administrative costs, professional fees and any and all other costs anticipated
to be incurred by the village in the completion of the improvements. Upon such
demand the surety or the financial institution shall deliver funds in the
amount of such estimated cost of completion to the village which shall then use
such funds to complete the improvements; however, tender by the surety or the
financial institution of estimated cost of completion to the village in an
amount less than the surety's obligation or the cash or equivalent security
shall not release the surety or financial institution from its obligations
hereunder. If there remains any cash or equivalent security or any unused
portion of the surety's bond after demand for the estimated cost of completion,
the surety or financial institution shall retain such excess until completion
of the improvements by the village. Upon completion of the improvements and
ascertainment of the actual cost thereof, including all administrative or other
costs incurred by the village in the completion of the improvements, the surety
or financial institution shall tender to the village the actual costs incurred
in completion of the improvements including administrative and other fees up to
the maximum amount of the bond or cash or equivalent security. Upon completion
of the project by the village and payment of the actual costs thereof by the
surety or financial institution, the obligations of the surety or financial
institution shall terminate and any cash or equivalent security held by any
financial institution may be returned to the subdivider.
      (4)   Release of guarantee security. Upon successful completion of
subdivision improvements by the subdivider, the village shall notify the surety
or financial institution of the fact of successful completion of the
improvements and the release of the subdivider from any further obligations
under his agreement as well as the release of the surety or financial
institution from the obligation of its bond or security agreement.

vehicle and order its towing and removal by the village to an impound area
designated by the Village Manager for the safe storage thereof. The officer

vehicle and shall be responsible for the delivery of the vehicle into the
custody of any person with whom the village contracts to tow and/or store
vehicles.
   (b)   Notice. The village shall make a concerted effort to determine the
identity of the owner or lawful possessor of the towed and impounded vehicle.
Upon identification, the village will notify the owner or lawful possessor of
the fact that the vehicle has been towed and impounded, the place where the
vehicle is located, the reason for the towing and impoundment, including any
violation with which the owner or lawful possessor is charged, the procedure
that must be followed to have the vehicle returned, and the procedure the owner
must follow to request a probable cause hearing on the towing. The village may
attempt to give notice to the vehicle owner or lawful possessor by telephone or
electronic means; however, whether or not the owner or lawful possessor is
reached by telephone or electronic means, written notice, including the
information set forth above, shall, unless waived in writing, also be mailed to
the registered owner's last known address.
   (c)   Fees. An owner or lawful possessor seeking to reclaim an impounded
vehicle shall be assessed the actual costs incurred by the village for towing
and storage of an impounded vehicle. The Village Manager is authorized and
empowered to contract for the towing and storage of vehicles. Any such contract
must provide for a schedule of reasonable towing fees and shall be available
for inspection with the Village Clerk.
   (d)   Reclaiming impounded vehicle. The Department is authorized to retain
possession of any vehicle towed pursuant to this section until such time as the
owner or lawful possessor shall appear to claim possession of the vehicle. In
order to reclaim possession of any vehicle towed and impounded, including
during the pendency of a request for a probable cause hearing, the owner or
lawful possessor shall:
   (1)   Present evidence of ownership or lawful possession of the vehicle;
   (2)   Present evidence that a licensed driver is present and authorized to
operate the vehicle on village streets; and
   (3)   Pay all assessed towing and storage costs that accrued during the
period of impoundment and sign a receipt confirming the release and return of
the vehicle, or post a bond for double the amount of such fees and charges to
the contractor with whom the village has contracted to tow and/or store
vehicles.
   (e)   Hearing before sale or final disposition. After the removal of an
abandoned or a nuisance vehicle, the owner or lawful possessor is entitled to a
hearing for the purpose of determining if probable cause existed for removing
the vehicle. A request for hearing must be filed in writing with the Village
Clerk within 30 days of the written notice issued pursuant to this section.
Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the Village Manager shall set a quasi-
judicial hearing before the Village Transportation Committee, or, if no such
Transportation Committee is then-organized and existing, before the Village
Council within 30 days of receipt of the request. The Village Manager may
establish rules and procedures that govern the appeal and quasi-judicial
hearing process. The decision of the Transportation Committee or Village
Council is subject to further review on appeal to the District Court of
Brunswick County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for
writ of certiorari shall be filed within 30 days after the date that the
Transportation Committee or Village Council issues a written decision.

an abandoned or a nuisance vehicle under this chapter which is not claimed by
the owner or lawful possessor may be disposed of by the village or its
contractor for towing and/or storage of vehicles. Disposition of such a vehicle
shall be carried out through a procedure similar to that provided in G.S.
Chapter 44A, Article 1. If the vehicle is not purchased at sale and the
estimated value is less than the amount of fees accrued for towing and storage,
the vehicle may be destroyed.

Sec. 30-48. Village's responsibility and liability.
   (a)   Where village water and/or sewer service is available, the village
shall run a service line from its distribution line or collection line to the
property to be served.
   (b)   The village may install its water meter or sewer tap at the property
line or, at the village's option, on the consumer's property, or in a location
mutually agreed upon.
   (c)   The village does not assume the responsibility of inspecting piping or
apparatus on the customer's property.
   (d)   The village reserves the right to refuse or discontinue service unless
the consumer's lines or piping are installed in such a manner as to prevent
cross connections, backflow, or other such problems.
   (e)   The village shall not be liable for damage of any kind whatsoever
resulting from water or sewer service located on the consumer's premises,
unless such damage results directly from negligence on the part of the village.
The village shall not be responsible for any damage done by or resulting from
any defect in the piping, fixtures or appliances on the consumer's premises.
The village shall not be responsible for acts or negligence of third persons or
forces beyond the control of the village. The village shall not be responsible
for damages of any nature resulting from any interruption, cancellation, or
refusal of sewer or water service.
   (f)   The village shall not be responsible for any leaks which may develop
or occur on the premises of water and/or sewer consumers. However, regarding
residential and non-residential water services, in water leak instances, the
Village manager, director of public services, or the designee of either of
them, may consider a discretionary adjustment up to 50% of the estimated water
loss component of billed water deliveries during the month in which the water
loss occurred. The consumer must request an adjustment within 60 days after the
date of the bill for the month in which the incident occurred. The request must
include a suitable repair invoice from a licensed plumber or, in the event the
repairs are made by the owner, the repairs must be inspected and approved by
the village building inspector prior to any adjustment. Adjustments may be
considered for nonresidential sewer charges in the same manner as adjustments
for water services but only where it can be demonstrated to the village's
satisfaction that water lost did not enter the sanitary sewer system. Because
the residential sewer charge is not based on water consumption, adjustments may
not be considered for residential sewer charges. Only one adjustment may be
considered for any given property within a 24-month period; provided, however,
in the sole discretion of the Village Manager, a second adjustment within said
24-month period may be given in extenuating circumstances beyond the reasonable
control of the consumer.
   (g)   Under normal conditions, the consumer will be notified of any
anticipated interruption of service, but the village is not responsible for any
failure to give or the content of any service notices.

claim to the village utilities department before the bill becomes delinquent.
Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be
effective in preventing late charges and/or discontinuance of service as
provided in this article. The consumer may pay such bill under protest and the
payment shall not prejudice the claim.
   (b)   If the meter is out of order, fails to register accurately, or its
seal is broken, the property owner, occupant or tenant served by such a meter
shall be charged at the average rate of consumption for similar billing periods
as shown by the meter, when in order.
   (c)   If any owner, occupant or tenant served by a water meter is not
satisfied with the meter reading and shall desire that the meter be tested, the
meter shall be tested upon request. The cost of the meter test shall be borne

lack of competent supervision or work quality by a contractor, the director of
public services may at his option:
      (1)   Halt work until approved supervision is obtained and the work is
performed in accordance with village requirements and/or approved plans; or
      (2)   Provide constant inspection by village personnel at the expense of
the applicant or contractor.
   (b)   Inspection of a project performed by the village does not consist of
or imply supervision. The applicant or the contractor undertaking the
improvement is solely responsible for ensuring that the project is completed
properly and in compliance with approved specifications, plans and regulations.
The responsible party may be required, at its cost, to rearrange or redo any
work to bring it into conformity with such approved plans and specifications.

Sec. 30-153. Fats, oils, and greases control.
   (a)   Scope and purpose. To aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer
blockages and obstructions from contribution and accumulation of fats, oils,
and greases into said sewers system from industrial or commercial
establishments, particularly food preparation and serving facilities.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   Cooking establishments. Those commercial establishments engaged in
activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption
foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following preparation activities:
cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing,
rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting,
toasting or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing, barbecuing,
and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot non-drinkable food
product in or on a receptacle that requires washing.
      (2)   Fat, oils, and greases. Organic polar compounds derived from animal
and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules.
These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures
established in 40 CFR 136, or successor provision, as may be amended from time
to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as "grease" or "greases".
      (3)   Grease trap or interceptor. A device for separating and retaining
waterborne greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the
trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These
devices also serve to collect settable solids generated by and from food
preparation activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the
sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Grease traps and interceptors
are sometimes referred to herein as "grease interceptors".
      (4)   Non-cooking establishments. Those commercial establishments
primarily engaged in the preparation of precooked foodstuffs that do not
include any form of cooking. These include cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs
preparation and serving establishments.
      (5)   Minimum design capability. The design features of a grease
interceptor and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and
retain greases from grease-laden wastewaters discharged to the public sanitary
sewer.
      (6)   User. Any person who contributes, causes or permits the
contribution or discharge of wastewater into the village system, including
persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile sources such as those who
discharge hauled wastewater.
   (c)   Grease interceptor maintenance, record keeping, and grease removal.
   (1)   Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by the
director of public services or his designee. Grease interceptors shall be
installed at the user's expense, when such user operates a cooking
establishment. Grease interceptors may also be required in non-cooking or cold
dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments when they are deemed necessary by
the director of public services for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease. No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from
subject grease interceptors to exceed 325 milligrams per liter, as identified
by EPA method 1664, or its successor method, or 275 milligrams per liter, as
identified by EPA method 413, or its successor method. All grease interceptors
shall be of the type designed and capacity approved by the director of public
services or his designee and shall be easily accessible for user cleaning and
village inspections. All such grease interceptors shall be inspected, serviced
and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain
minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but
not less often than every 30 days. Users who are required to pass water through
a grease interceptor shall:
         a.   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at
actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as
predicted by the uniform plumbing code fixture criteria, between the influent
and effluent baffles with 20 percent of the total volume of the grease
interceptor being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified
hereafter as a "sludge pocket"'.
         b.   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required,
but at intervals of not longer than 30 days at the user's expense. Grease
interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit,
rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc.,
which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of
the grease interceptor.
         c.   Accept the following conditions: If any skimmed or pumped wastes
or other materials removed from grease interceptor are treated in any fashion
onsite and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and
after said onsite treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment
(Ord. of established grease numerical limit consistent with and contained in
(c)(1) on all discharges of wastewater from said grease interceptor in the
village sanitary sewer collection and treatment system.
         d.   Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said
device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently achieved.
"Consistent" shall mean any wastewater sample taken from said grease
interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described
in (c)(1). If an establishment desires, because of documented space
constraints, an alternate to an out-of-building grease interceptor, the request
for an alternative location shall contain the following information:
            1.   Location of village sewer main and easement in relation to
available exterior space outside building.
            2.   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing
for all services at that site.
      e.   Understand and agree that: the use of biological additives as a
grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon prior written
approval by the director of public services. Any establishment using this
method of grease abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a
manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured
from the traps outlet, is consistently achieved.
      f.   Understand and agree that: the use of automatic grease removal
systems is conditionally permissible upon prior written approval by the
director of public services and Brunswick County department of health. Any
establishment using this equipment shall operate the system in such a manner
that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the
unit's outlet, is consistently achieved.
      g.   Understand and agree that: The director of public services reserves
the right to make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy and need, based
on review of all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance,
facility site and building plan review and to require repairs to, or
modification or replacement of such traps.
      (2)   The user shall maintain written record of trap maintenance for
three years. All such records will be available for inspection by the village
at all times.
      (3)   No non-grease laden sources can be connected to sewer lines
intended for grease interceptor service.
      (4)   Except as provided herein for a period of one year following
adoption of this article, although installation of grease interceptors will be
required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
section for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease
interceptors. If, during this one-year period an obstruction of a village sewer
main(s)occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the
environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer
collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an
accumulation of grease in the village's sewer main(s), the village will take
appropriate enforcement actions, as stipulated in the village's sewer use
ordinance or resolution, against the generator or contributor of such grease.
      (5)   Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches, shall be
provided over each chamber and sanitary fee. The access manholes shall extend
at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water
inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily removable covers
to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater sampling activities.

WATER CONSERVATION STANDARDS
Sec. 30-171. Purpose.
   These water conservation standards are enacted by the village for the
purposes of:
      (1)   Reducing the rate of increase in overall water use through year-
round water conservation practices that will help maximize the community's
existing and planned water supply sources and help reduce seasonal peak day
demands that result in higher cost to purchase Brunswick County water which in-
turn means increased cost to the consumer.
      (2)   Such year-round practices shall include:
         a.   Reducing indoor use by encouraging the installation and
maintenance of ultra-low flow toilets, faucet aerators, low-flow showerheads
and similar devices, as well as other creative and commonsense indoor
conservation practices.
         b.   Reducing irrigation and irrigation-related water waste without
sacrificing landscape quality through the cultivation of lower water use
plants; improved landscape design and planting practices; more efficient
watering practices; and improved irrigation system design and maintenance.
         c.   Repair all leaks. Malfunctioning toilets and irrigation system
are the most common cause of high water use. Toilets can be checked by adding a
food coloring to the toilet tank and visually checking to see if the color
appears in the bowl, if it does the toilet is leaking. Irrigation systems
should be checked regularly for proper operation. Insure sprinkler heads are
intact and automatic controller and valves are operating correctly.
(Ord. of 10-26-2007)

determined schedule of irrigation frequency and duration.
   Irrigation system. Any permanently installed system of pipes, hoses, or
other conveyance devices and appurtenances that provides water to living plant
material through spray heads or other emission devices located at, above, or
below the ground surface. For the purposes of these standards, a sprinkler,
soaker hose, or other device connected to its water source via a moveable
above-ground garden hose is not considered to be an irrigation system.
   Non-residential. Any user, other than a residential user, including, but not
limited to, laundromat, restaurant, bar/lounge, public pool or pool house, ice
cream shop, hardware store, gift shop, real estate office, florist, general
service office, repair shop, motels/hotels, pharmacy, clothing store, beauty or
barbershop, and other commercial or public use structures, and all mixed use
structures (as defined in the village zoning ordinance) that include

Sec. 32-44. Landscape permits and building permits.
   (a)   Issuance of landscape permit.
   (1)   No lot or tract within the village may be cleared, excavated, graded
or filled until the building inspector has issued a landscape permit, whether
or not such activity is in connection with a proposed construction.
   (2)   Special consideration must be given to preserving as much natural area
as possible and to preserving all plants of special concern as designated in
subsection (k) of this section.
   (3)   The site development plan required by subsection (c) of this section
prior to the issuance of a permit shall clearly define those areas where
existing dunes, berm and vegetative cover shall remain undisturbed and shall
include plans for restabilizing any revegetation areas disturbed. Disturbance
of the natural vegetation shall only be permitted in those circumstances in
which such disturbance is reasonably necessary to allow safe construction of
the proposed dwelling and its appurtenant facilities, such as septic tank and
driveway. Such special consideration must be given to preserving as much
natural area as possible.
   (4)   Provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall require issuance
of a landscape permit under this article for the maintenance of roads within
the village right-of-way and hand clearing of three-inch and smaller caliper
trees.
   (5)   Cutting of any tree or trees larger than three inches in caliper at
four feet above grade without first obtaining a proper landscape permit will
require the offender to obtain a permit, pay the required fine, and mitigate
the loss of such tree or trees. Pruning tree branches and/or limbs larger than
five inches in caliper without first obtaining a proper landscaping permit will
require the offender to obtain a permit, pay the required fine, and mitigate
the loss of such branches and/or limbs.
   (6)   In the case of competing trees, the building inspector shall make the
decision of which tree to remove. The removal of dead trees with a three-inch
caliper or greater, shall not require a permit but shall require the approval
of the building inspector prior to removal. If a decision by the building
inspector is disputed, the property owner must provide sufficient evidence to
show the tree is dead, represents a danger to individuals or property, or the
tree is diseased and will not live.
   (7)   Failure to comply with the requirements of the approved site plan
shall be considered a violation and shall be subject to the immediate issuance
of a stop work order by the building inspector and to the other procedures and
remedies of subsection (k) of this section.
   (b)   Issuance of building permit. No building or other structure shall be

accompanied by a site development plan pursuant to section
32-128 of this chapter and building plans, all county, state and federal
permits required by law or regulation and such other relevant information as he
may require. Each residential lot shall have the lot lines clearly marked on
the ground and certified as correct by a registered professional engineer or
land surveyor prior to applying for a building permit. All new construction
permitted must be located with a distance of 1,000 feet of a pressurized fire
hydrant.
   (d)   Survey markers located on relevant points. Surveyors control markers
shall be located on each property line, including street right-of-way, at the
point of closest approach of the planned structure to that line. No
construction shall begin on site until the markers required by this chapter
have been properly established and examined and approved by the building
inspector. Failure to construct any structure in accordance with these markers
shall be a cause for the building inspector to issue a stop work order and to
revoke a building permit previously issued.
   (e)   Areas of environmental concern. Each application for a building permit
shall include information as to the location of applicable areas of
environmental concern. Prior to issuance of a building permit the building
inspector shall ascertain whether the proposed structure or facility conforms
to the state regulations for areas of environmental concern issued pursuant to
the coastal area management act.

(b) of this section, an on-site inspection of the property shall be made by the
building inspector.
   (g)   Posting of permits prior to starting work. Before work is started on
any property, the required permit or permits shall be posted in a prominent
place on the property.
   (h)   Expiration of permit if work not started in specified time. Each
permit issued pursuant to subsection (b) and (c) of this section shall expire

shall be required to remove, relocate, grade, excavate, fill or disturb sand,
soil, dirt or earth or remove any naturally occurring trees, shrubbery, grass
or other naturally occurring vegetation if such removal is in accordance with
site plans for construction of a structure, for which plans a building permit
either has been issued by the building inspector, only upon a determination by
the building inspector, that the activity requested by the applicant is
necessary to achieve one of the following purposes:
   (1)   Erection or protection of a structure or improvement on the property;
   (2)   Promote the growth and health of vegetation without significantly
destabilizing the soil thereon or otherwise damaging the ecology of the
property.
   (j)   Designation and protection of plants of special concern.
   (1)   It shall be the policy of the village to protect to the maximum extent
feasible those trees and shrubs native to the maritime forest and dune areas of
the village. All improvements shall be designed in such a way so as to minimize
the destruction of plants of special concern and to preserve and to protect
those remaining as much as practicable. Where relandscaping is required by this
chapter, relandscaping shall be accomplished as much as feasible through the
use of those plants which naturally occur within this area, including plants of
special concern.
   (2)   The village hereby designates the following plants as plants of
special concern.
   (k)   Replacement of damaged shrubs; time limit; violation. Any sand, soil,
dirt or earth which has been removed, relocated, graded, excavated, added to,
filled or disturbed in violation of this chapter and any naturally occurring
vegetation which has been killed, damaged, destroyed or removed in violation of
this chapter shall be restored or replaced within 60 days of notice from the
building inspector. Each day after the 60-day period that the violator fails to
perform such restoration or replacement shall constitute a new and separate
violation. Any such replacement shall, where feasible, be accomplished through
the use of plants which naturally occur within this area, with emphasis upon
use of plants of special concern

analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning taking into account,
among any other applicable factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and
other attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned; (ii) the benefits and
detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding community;
(iii) the relationship between the current actual and permissible development
on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be permissible
under the proposed amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public
interest; and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment.

signers do protest the proposed change or amendment and unless it shall have
been received by the zoning official in sufficient time to allow at least two
normal workdays excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, before the

determine the sufficiency and accuracy of the petition.
   (b)   Protest petitions only apply to zoning map amendments and are not
applicable to text amendments.
   (c)   For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the council and
members who are excused from voting shall not be considered 'members of the

Sec. 32-101. Establishment.
   (a)   The village council shall appoint a planning board consisting of five
members and two alternates to hear appeals of administrative decisions,
variance requests, special use permits, or any other quasi-judicial decision
permitted by G.S. Chapter 160D and to provide a recommendation to village
council on proposed amendments, supplements, changes, modifications or repeals
of this chapter. The term of each regular member and alternate is three years
commencing on July 1 of the year of appointment, except that in appointing the
initial planning board under this ordinance, council shall appoint two regular
members and one alternate to an initial two-year term that expires June 30,
2023, in order to create staggered terms. There are no term limits for service
on the planning board. Council may fill vacancies for the unexpired term only.
   (b)   The two alternates shall substitute in the absence or temporary

of a member. When substituting, such alternates shall have the same voting
privileges as a regular member.
   (c)   A member of the planning board shall not vote on any quasi-judicial
decision in a manner that would violate an affected persons' constitutional
rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations of due process
include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to
hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte
communications, a close familial, business, or other associational relationship
with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter.
A member of the planning board shall note vote on any advisory or legislative
decision regarding a development regulation adopted pursuant to this chapter
where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a
direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. A
member of the planning board shall note vote on any zoning amendment if the
landowner of the property subject to a rezoning petition or the applicant for a
text amendment is a person with whom the member nas a close familial, business,
or other associational relationship. If an objection is raised to a planning
board member's participation at or prior to the hearing or vote on a particular
matter, whether quasi-judicial, advisory, or legislative, and that member does
not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members of the board shall by
majority vote rule on the objection.

Sec. 32-103. Duties generally.
   The planning board shall exercise all duties that may be assigned to
planning boards under G.S. 160D-301 and boards of adjustment under G.S. 160D-
302. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the express intent of this chapter
that all questions of interpretation and enforcement shall first be presented
to the zoning official or his authorized representative, and that such
questions shall be presented to the planning board only on an appeal from the
decision of the zoning official or his authorized representative, and that
recourse from the decision of the planning board shall be to the courts as
provided by law.
(Ord. No. 29, § 6.3, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021- 0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-104. Appeals and variances.
   (a)   Generally.
   (1)   The planning board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by
the zoning official in the enforcement of this chapter. The board may, so long
as such action is in conformity with the terms of this chapter, reverse or
affirm wholly or partly or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination and to that end shall have the powers of the zoning official from
whom appeal is taken.
   (2)   The planning board shall authorize in specific cases variance from the
terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter will result in undue hardship, so that the spirit of this chapter shall
be observed and substantial justice done.
   (b)   Appeals.
   (1)   An appeal from the decision of the zoning official may be taken to the
planning board by any person, firm, or corporation with an ownership, leasehold
or other property interest in the property that is subject of the decision
being appealed, an option or contract to purchase the property that is the
subject of the decision being appealed, or by any officer or department of the
village. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the decision by the
zoning official, by filing with the village clerk and with the planning board a
notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. Any other person with
standing to appeal has 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or
constructive notice of the determination within which to file an appeal.
   (2)   An appeal stays enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of
any fines assessed during the pendency of the appeal and any subsequent civil
actions, unless the zoning official certifies to the board after notice of
appeal has been filed that, because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay
would cause imminent peril to life or property or, because the violation is
transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the
this chapter, in which case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by a court of record to whom an appeal
has been made. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may
file with the zoning official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal,
and the planning board shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after the
request is filed.
   (3)   When hearing an appeal, the planning board may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any
order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The
planning board shall have all the powers of the official who made the decision.
   (c)   Variances.
   (1)   Public hearing and certain conditions required. In order to grant a
variance, the planning board must conduct an evidentiary public hearing and
find the following conditions to be met:
      a.   There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the
particular piece of property in questions because of its size, shape, or
topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in that same
district;
      b.   Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant
any special privileges that are denied to other residents of the zoning
districts in which the property is located;
      c.   A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other residents of the
zoning district in which the property is located;
      d.   The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and
intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the
general welfare;
      e.   The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the
applicant; and
      f.   The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make
possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
      g.   Where applicable, the planning board may also consider whether
granting a variance is necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable
accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a
disability.
   (2)   Evaluation of impact of grant. In considering all proposed variances
from this chapter, the planning board shall, before making any finding in a
specified case, first determine that the proposed variance will not constitute
any change in the zone shown on the zoning map and will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent property, or materially increase the public
danger of fire and safety, or materially diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
   (3)   No variance for prohibited uses. No permitted use of land in other
districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. Under no
circumstances shall the planning board grant a variance to allow a use not
permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district involved, or any
expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in the
district.
   (4)   Attachment of conditions. In granting a variance the planning board
may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, and other
features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable
in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. In order for such conditions to
be effective the applicant or landowner must consent to the same in writing.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms under
which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
punishable under sections
32-61 through
32-65 of this chapter.

Sec. 32-105. Appeals in the nature of certiorari.
   Any person, firm, or corporation with standing under G.S. 160D-1402 may
appeal a quasi-judicial decision of the planning board in the nature of
certiorari to the superior court, provided such appeals shall be taken within
30 days after the decision of the planning board is filed with the village
clerk, or after a written copy thereof is delivered to the applicant, whichever
is later.

   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any district
shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
   (1)   Use of property lines. Where district boundaries are indicated as
approximately following street lines, and lot lines, such lines shall be

with width are indicated as the district boundary, the actual district boundary
line shall be the centerline of such area.
   (2)   Use of the scale. In unsubdivided property or where a zone boundary
divides a lot, the location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by
dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.

official shall interpret the intent of the map as to the location of such
boundaries.
   (4)   Planning board. The decision of the zoning official may be appealed to

   (g)   MFPO maritime forest protection overlay district. The specifications
and standards of this district were established in order to permit development
that is compatible with the environmentally sensitive nature of the Bald Head
Island and Middle Island maritime forests, and to preserve land in a natural
state where such land is considered to be a vital link in the local groundwater
replenishment cycle and where the destruction of natural vegetation could have
a harmful effect on the stability of the soil and its resistance to erosion.
More specifically, the maritime forest protection overlay district is designed
to protect natural features and functions of the area in the interest of
health, safety and general welfare of the residents and visitors to Bald Head
Island and Middle Island. Such features include, but are not limited to,

all uses within the maritime forest protection overlay district. These
performance standards are in addition to or over and above the requirements of
the applicable zoning district.
      a.   Prestaking or preconstruction lot clearing. Some clearing of
understory trees and shrubs may be required to prepare a site for sale or
survey or to stake the proposed building site. Permission to clear such
understory, trees and shrubs shall not be required by the building inspector,
but shall be limited to such vegetation with a three-inch caliper at four feet
above grade.
      b.   Lot alteration. No alteration of a lot or building site shall occur
prior to the issuance of a building permit. Trees shall not be removed except
as necessary for the construction of the principal structure, accessory use,
parking area, driveway access and septic tank/nitrification field system. Soil
disturbing activities and site alteration shall not exceed the minimum
necessary to provide for the location of the principal use structure, any
accessory use improvements, driveway access, and utility service improvements.
No specimen tree (a 24-inch diameter trunk at four feet above ground level)
shall be removed unless construction is impractical without the removal of such
tree.
      c.   Construction containment. The area of construction shall be limited
to five feet outside of the perimeter of structure construction and two feet
outside of a driveway referred to in this chapter as "limit of construction." A
lay down yard for construction material must be shown on plans submitted for

extent permitted by applicable regulatory agency, only if the property is
unbuildable or unaccessible without the fill permit. Open decking or boardwalks
may be built over wetlands where approved by the local GAMA permit officers and
division of coastal management or other appropriate governmental agency or
authority.
      e.   Off-street parking, driveways and carports. Parking areas on a lot
shall be located under the principal structure whenever possible. All off-

intersections of streets or roads and culs-de-sac may exceed the permitted
limits set out hereinabove to accommodate an appropriate turning radius, as
determined by the village council, for vehicular traffic, including without
limitation, emergency vehicles, fire protection and fighting equipment or
vehicles and construction vehicles.

standards of this district are established in order to permit development that
is compatible with the pastoral environment of this district.
   (i)   NC neighborhood commercial district. The neighborhood commercial
district (NC) is primarily intended to accommodate very low intensity office,
and personal service uses within residential areas. The district is established
to provide convenient locations for businesses, which serve the needs of island
residents and visitors without disrupting the character of the neighborhood.
The neighborhood commercial district is a transitional land use zoning district
in which the principal use of land is residential with some office and service
uses allowed to serve the surrounding residential districts and in which
traffic and parking congestion can be reduced to a minimum in order to preserve
residential values and promote the general welfare of the surrounding
residential districts.
   (1)   Buffer requirements. Nonresidential uses which abut undeveloped lots
or lots utilized for residential purposes shall maintain a ten-foot undisturbed
vegetative buffer along rear and side property boundaries.

         1.   All parking areas shall be located and designed so as to avoid
undue interference with the use of public streets and alleys.
         2.   There shall be a maximum of one driveway per lot. In the case
that adjacent lots are under single ownership, shared driveways shall be
utilized in an attempt to provide the minimum number of access points possible.
   (3)   Maximum floor area ratio. The total square footage of floor area
permitted in the neighborhood commercial zoning district shall be determined as
a ratio to the total square footage of the land area of the site. The ratio
shall be .20. The floor area shall be the sum of the areas on all floors of the
building measured from the outside faces of the exterior walls, including
halls, lobbies, stairways, elevator shafts. enclosed porches and balconies, and
belowgrade floor areas.
   (4)   Recombination of lots. Lots may not be recombined for the purpose of
increasing the size of the structure built on the lot. The maximum floor area
ratio would apply to the largest lot existing prior to the recombination.

homeowners' association amenity property being appurtenant to taxable real
property owned by a member of the association, shall be allowed, subject to the
other restrictions within this chapter, within the various zoning districts of
the village but only if the taxable property owned by the member(s) of the
homeowners' association to which the property is appurtenant is located within
the village.

Sec. 32-163. Ornamental structures, fences and walls.
   (a)   Specifications. Ornamental structures not to exceed ten feet in
height, fences and walls not to exceed four feet in height, and ground-level
wooden walkways not to exceed 18 inches in height, may be constructed or
erected on any property, or within any applicable building setback provided
these structures do not impede site path visibility. Fences and walls shall be
limited to four feet in height except that, in the following locations, fences
and walls shall not exceed six feet in height:
   (1)   Within any nonresidential zone, when the purpose of the fence is to
provide security or is to screen from rights-of-way or adjoining properties
nonresidential activities or uses; or
   (2)   To provide screening between a residentially zoned property and a
nonresidentially zoned property.
   (b)   Scientific or ecological studies. Notwithstanding any provision in
this chapter to the contrary, fences or similar structures constructed for
purposes of scientific or ecological study or analysis are allowed, subject to
the following conditions:
   (1)   The zoning official determines that the purpose of the fence or
similar structure is in the best interest of the village;
   (2)   The location, height and style of fencing is appropriate for the
intended use as determined by the zoning official;
   (3)   The applicant has procured permission to construct the fence from the
appropriate landowner; and
   (4)   The zoning official determines that the fence or structure will have
no adverse impact on adjoining properties.
   (c)   Maritime forest protection overlay district. In the maritime forest
protection overlay district, no disturbance, damage or destruction of trees,
and only minor disturbance, damage or destruction of naturally occurring
vegetation and growth shall result from the construction or placement of the
proposed ornamental structures, walls, walkways or fences.
   (d)   Permit required. A permit for the permitted uses in this section must
be procured prior to construction.
   (e)   Sand fencing construction standards. The purpose of the following
regulations is to promote the most effective method of sand accretion utilizing
sane fencing, and to minimize the fencing's impact on nesting sea turtles and
emerging hatchlings:
   (1)   Sand fencing erected seaward of the peak of the primary dune or
protective storm berm shall be erected at angles of at least 45 degrees to the
shoreline, facing the predominate wind direction. Individual fence sections
should not exceed 25 feet in length spaced parallel to each other at least nine
feet apart. If sand fence sections are erected in segments ten feet in length
or less, parallel to each other, they may be spaced no less than seven feet
apart. Such sand fencing shall be installed landward of the mean high water
mark to avoid damage by wave action. No fencing may be installed that
unreasonably restricts public use of hard sand beach areas.
   (2)   Sand fencing erected within 150 feet landward of the peak of the
primary dune or protective storm berm shall be erected in a continuous line
parallel to the shoreline, with no breaks or openings allowed in the fencing,
except for beach access points. There must be a minimum of 20 feet maintained
between the closest point of fencing constructed landward and seaward of the
peak of the primary dune or protective storm berm.
   (3)   In the absence of a primary dune or storm berm within an area of
privately owned property reasonably appropriate for dune recreation, the
building inspector may establish the appropriate location for sand fence
erection.
   (4)   Continuous sand fencing erected landward of the peak of the primary
dune or protective sand berm must be kept intact without gaps, or it shall be
immediately removed or repaired. It shall be the responsibility of the building
inspector to notify the owner of any derelict or nonconforming sand fencing,
and to require immediate remedy.
   (5)   Sand fencing erected for the purpose of delineating beach access
points is exempt from the provisions of this section. A permit for sand fencing
must be procured prior to construction.

Sec. 32-164. Home occupations.
   (a)   The use must be conducted entirely within the dwelling by a member of
the immediate family residing on the premises. No persons outside of the
immediate family members will assist or be employed. No more than 25 percent of
the floor space within the dwelling may be used in connection with such
occupation.
   (b)   No chemical equipment or product shall be used except those which are
normally used for purely domestic or household purposes. No equipment or
process shall be used in such home occupation which creates noise, noxious
odors, glare, fumes or other nuisance or electrical or mechanical interference
detectable to the normal senses off the lot, if the occupation is conducted in
a single-family housing unit, or outside the housing unit if conducted in other
than a single-family housing unit. In the case of electrical interference, no
equipment or process shall be used which creates visual or audible interference
in any radio or television receivers off the premises, or causes fluctuations
in line voltage off the premises. No equipment or process shall be used which
creates electromagnet disturbances off the premises.
   (c)   No commodity or product display shall be visible from the exterior of
the dwelling.
   (d)   There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the building or
premises, or other visible evidence of the conduct of such home occupation,
including, without limitation, the displaying of any type of sign.
   (e)   The activity involved shall not noticeably detract from the outward
residential character of the neighborhood.
   (f)   Pedestrian traffic, vehicle traffic, and any other activity associated
with a home occupation shall not significantly disrupt the peace and
tranquility of the residential neighborhood.
   (g)   Any equipment is to be stored inside an enclosed shelter, shed or
garage. There shall be no outside storage.
   (h)   If, at any time there is any noncompliance with the provisions of this
chapter relating to limited home occupations, then the zoning official will
serve notice of violation and order to cease.
   (i)   A property owner proposing a home occupation must first file an
application for such proposed use with the zoning official and affirm that he
has read and understands the provisions of this article.

ARTICLE VI. NONCONFORMING USES *
 
Notes
* *   Cross References: Buildings and building regulations, ch. 6.
Sec. 32-221. Purpose and intent.
   After August 17, 1991, pre-existing structures or lots of record and
existing and lawful uses of any building or land which does not meet the
minimum requirements of this chapter for the district in which they are located
or which would be prohibited as new development in the district in which they
are located shall be considered as nonconforming. It is the intent of this
chapter to permit these nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed,
discontinued, or destroyed, but not to encourage such continued use, and to
prohibit the expansion of any nonconformance.
   (1)   Substandard lots of record and structures. Any lot of record or
structure existing at the time of adoption of this chapter, which does not meet
one or more of the minimum requirements of this chapter for the district in
which it is located, shall be subject to the following exceptions and
modifications:
      a.   Adjoining lots. When two or more adjoining lots with continuous
frontage are in one ownership at any time after the adoption of this chapter,
and such lots individually are less than the minimum square footage required in
the district in which they are located, then such group of lots shall be
considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted area and width
for the district in which located.
      b.   Lot not meeting minimum lot size requirements. Except as set forth
in this chapter, in any district in which single-family dwellings are
permitted, any lot or record existing at the time of the adoption of this
chapter which has dimensions which are less than required by this chapter may
be used as a building site for a single-family dwelling providing the lot area
and width are not less than 80 percent of the requirements in the district. If
the lot is smaller or narrower, a variance may be requested of the planning
board.
      c.   Yard requirements modified. Except as set forth in subsection (1)a
of this section, where a lot has width or depth less than that required in the
district in which it is located, the zoning official shall be authorized to
reduce the yard requirements for such lot by not more than 20 percent.
Additional or other forms of yard modification may be permitted with a variance
granted by the planning board.
      d.   Enlargement of nonconforming structures. Any building which is
nonconforming solely because of its encroachment in a required yard area may be
extended in any lawful manner that does not further encroach in that yard.
   (2)   Nonconforming uses of buildings. The nonconforming use of a building
may be extended throughout the building provided no structural alterations,
except those required by law or ordinance or ordered by an authorized officer
to secure the safety of the building, are made therein but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building. If the nonconforming use of
such building is discontinued for a continuous period exceeding 180 days, every
future use of such premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter; provided that this provision shall not apply to any nonconforming
commercial or industrial use which normally operates less than 90 calendar days
in any given calendar year. The nonconforming use which normally operates less
than 90 calendar days in any given year (i.e., seasonal operation) shall not be
resumed after 365 days have passed without operation. This provision shall not
prevent the restoration of a nonconforming building, or a building used for
nonconforming use which has been destroyed to the extent of not more than 50
percent of its replacement value, but only if such building is restored within
one year of the date of its destruction.
   (3)   Nonconforming uses of land. The nonconforming use of land shall not be
enlarged or increased, nor shall any nonconforming use be extended to occupy a
greater area of land than that occupied by such use at the time of the passage
of this chapter. If any nonconforming use of land, other than for the location
of a mobile home or mobile office is discontinued for a continuous period
exceeding 120 days, any future use of land shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. If the nonconforming use of land for location of a
mobile home or mobile office is discontinued, either by destruction of the
mobile home or by removal thereof, any further use of land shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter except as provided in subsection
(1)d. of this section.

ARTICLE VII.  SPECIAL USES
Sec. 32-251. Purpose.
   The development and execution of this chapter is based on the division of
the village into districts within which the use of land and buildings and the
bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are
substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are some land uses
which are basically in keeping with the intent and purposes of the district
where permitted, but which may have an impact on the area around them which can
only be determined by review of the specific proposal. These uses may be
established, under certain standards and with proper controls, in such a manner
as to minimize any adverse effects. In order to ensure that these uses, in
their proposed locations, would be compatible with surrounding development and
in keeping with the purposes of the district in which they are located, their
establishment shall not be as a matter of right, but only after review and
approval of a special use permit as provided in this article.
(Ord. No. 29, § 12.1, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021- 0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-252. Application and fees.
   Applications for special use permits, signed by the applicant. shall be
addressed to the planning board. A fee in an amount currently in effect by
action of the village council will be paid at the time of application. Each
application shall contain or be accompanied by such legal description maps,
plans, and other information so as to completely describe the proposed use and
existing conditions.
   (1)   Structures. Location of all structures within 50 feet of the property,
location and depth, if known, of any existing utility lines in the property or
along any adjacent street.
   (2)   Other requirements.
      a.   Location of property boundaries, location of any easements for
utility lines or passage which cross or occupy any portion of the property for
proposed lines.
      b.   Detailed construction plans shall be submitted prior to issuance of
a building permit.
      c.   The applicant shall submit with its application a list of names and
addresses of all abutting property owners along with one set of envelopes
stamped and with typed addresses to each person on the list. In the absence of
evidence to the contrary, the applicant may rely on the county tax listing to
determine owners of abutting property. These addressed envelopes and the list
must be submitted to the zoning official as part of an application prior to
scheduling a public hearing.
      d.   A site development plan as set forth in section
32-128 of this chapter shall be provided with each application.
(Ord. No. 29, § 12.2, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021- 0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-253. Procedures for determining special use permit applications.
   The special uses, as specified in the various districts may be permitted
only after approval by the planning board following a public evidentiary
hearing. The planning board shall follow the quasi-judicial procedures set
forth in section
32-102(c) when scheduling and hearing an application for a special use permit.
(Ord. No. 29, § 12.3, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021- 0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-254. General provisions concerning special use permits.
   (a)   Compliance with other codes. Granting of a special use permit does not
exempt the applicant from complying with all of the requirements of building
codes and other ordinances.
   (b)   Revocation. In any case where the conditions of a special use permit
have not been or are not being complied with, the zoning official shall give
the permittee notice in writing that the conditions of the special use permit
have been violated, specifying the manner in which such conditions have been
violated and ordering compliance therewith within ten days of the date that
such notice shall be mailed to the permittee and the landowner if not the
permittee at the address set forth on the original special use permit
application or such other address as the zoning official has on file. If, at
the end of such ten-day period, the conditions of the permit have not been met
by the permittee, the zoning official shall give to the permittee written
notice of his intent to seek revocation of the special use permit. Such notice
shall be in writing and shall specify the conditions of the permit which have
been violated by the permittee and shall specify a time and place for a public
evidentiary hearing before the planning board to consider the revocation
request. Such revocation hearing shall follow all quasi-judicial procedures
applicable to an approval as set forth in section
32-102(c). Following the hearing, the planning board shall revoke, modify, or
leave intact the original special use permit according to its findings. Such
permit shall be revoked only if the planning board finds that specific
standards set by the permit have been violated and that such standards are and
remain material to the permit and that such violation adversely affects the
surrounding or adjacent zoning districts. The special use permit may be
modified as the planning board shall, in its discretion, deem to be appropriate
if the planning board shall find that specific standards of the permit have
been violated but that such violated standard has, due to a change in
circumstances, become not material or that the violated standard does not
adversely affect the surrounding or adjacent zoning district.
   (c)   Expiration. In a case where a special use permit has not been
exercised within the time limit set by the planning board, which period may not
be shorter than 12 months, or within twelve months if no specific time limit
has been set, then without further action, the permit shall be null and void.
Exercised, as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for
the construction of the main building have been let; or in the absence of
contracts that the main building is under construction to a substantial degree;
or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial investment are contracted
for, in substantial development, or completed. When construction is not a part
of the use, exercised shall mean that the use is in operation in compliance
with the conditions set forth in the permit.
   (d)   Duration of special use. Any conditions imposed on a special use
authorized and exercised shall be perpetually binding upon the property unless
expressly limited by the special use permit or subsequently changed or amended
by the planning board after a public hearing.
   (e)   Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any special use
the planning board may stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, or construction, maintenance, and operation of the
special use as it deems necessary for the protection of the public and to
secure compliance with the standards and requirement specified in this chapter.
In order for such conditions to be effective the permittee must consent to the
same in writing. In all cases in which special uses are granted, the planning
board shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary to
ensure that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and
will be complied with.
   (1)   Such conditions may include a time limitation.
   (2)   Conditions may be imposed which require that one or more things be
done before the use requested can be initiated. For example, "that a solid
board fence be erected around the site to a height of six feet before the use
requested is initiated."
   (3)   Conditions of a continuing nature may be imposed. For example,
"exterior loud speakers shall not be used between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and
9:00 a.m."

Sec. 32-255. Commercial filming permits.
   (a)   Commercial filming activity allowed. Notwithstanding any other
provisions in the village code of ordinances, pursuant to this section,
commercial filming projects shall be allowed in all zoning districts within the
village limits.
   (b)   Requirements. Any proposed commercial filming activity must comply
with and be permitted pursuant to the village commercial filming guidelines, as
may be modified from time to time by the village council, a copy of which may
be obtained at village hall.
   (c)   Penalties. Commencing commercial filming activities without a permit
may result in fine of $5,000.00, which must be paid to the village at village
hall within ten days of receiving a citation for such unpermitted filming
activity. Failure to comply with the commercial filming permit and/or the
village commercial filming guidelines may result in a fine of $5,000.00, which
must be paid to the village at village hall within ten days of receiving a
citation for such failures, or suspension, modification, or termination of the
commercial filming permit. Each continuing day during which a violation occurs
shall be deemed a separate offense. Violations under this section shall not be
punishable as a misdemeanor under G.S. 14-4.

ARTICLE VIII. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
Sec. 32-291. Purpose and intent.
   (a)   The purpose and intent of these planned unit development regulations
is to promote innovative design in development by providing flexibility in
regard to permitted uses and bulk regulations. These regulations are designed
to promote the development of attractive, desirable communities of place, where
residents and visitors can work and live in a development pattern that
integrates residential and nonresidential uses in a design that is accessible
to pedestrians and encourages the use of alternative modes of transportation
and shared parking and offers greater conveniences to the residents of the
village.
   (b)   It is the intent and policy of the village to encourage planned unit
developments because of the extensive planning that is required prior to
development. Planned unit developments allow the village to plan for large
areas and to manage the impacts of growth on the provision of government
services and infrastructure.
   (c)   It is the intent of the village to encourage the use of this section
in conjunction with the other elements of this chapter in order to encourage
the development of new communities.
   (d)   It is the intent of the village to provide flexibility in design in
order to achieve, to the greatest possible degree, land development which is
responsive to the natural and environmental assets and liabilities of any given
site. Environmentally sensitive features should be protected and development
concentrated in more suitable or less sensitive areas in order to preserve the
island's unique natural resources. Development should be located and undertaken
in a manner that will be the least disruptive to the natural functions of the
environmentally sensitive lands. The maintenance and restoration of trees and
other elements of the environmentally sensitive lands is an integral part of
any planned unit development activities.

   The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicated a different meaning:
   Commercial use means the occupancy, use, or intended use of land or
structures or any portion thereof for the transaction of business, whether
wholesale or retail, or the rendering or receiving of services. Warehousing, if
directly related to on-site commercial activity, shall be considered to be
commercial use.
   Master plan means a development plan depicting an entire proposed planned
unit development, including proposed phases, which is submitted for council
approval in accordance with this chapter.
   Mixed-use development means a project which integrates a variety of land
uses including but not limited to residential, commercial, office, retail,
public, or entertainment, in a compact urban form.
   Mixed-use structure means a structure that will contain both commercial, on
at least one floor, and residential within the same structure.
   Open space means any portion of a parcel or area of land or water which is
open and primarily undisturbed by structures, including areas maintained in a
natural and undisturbed character. The only aboveground structures which are
allowed within an open space are walkways and structures related thereto, such
as benches, all of which are intended to accommodate casual, pedestrian use,
and minor utility structures for pumps, wells and similar purposes.
   Recreational use means the occupancy, use, or intended use of land or
structures or any portion thereof by persons for relaxation, amusement, play or
the like.
   Residential unit means an enclosure of one or more rooms providing permanent
provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation designed and/
or constructed for permanent occupancy by one family. Accessory uses, including
crofters, to the extent it is under the same ownership and on the same lot as
the principle residential unit shall be deemed a part of the principle use.
   Residential use means the buildings for residence such as attached or
detached single-family dwellings, apartment complexes, condominiums,
townhouses, cottages, etc., and their associated outbuildings such as garages,
storage buildings, gazebos, etc.
   Single-family dwelling, attached, means a structure containing more than one

of a specific phase. Site specific plans shall be submitted for preliminary as
well as final approval in accordance with the two step site specific approval
process defined in section 32-305 of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 29, § 13.2, 8-17-1991; Ord. No 2000-21, 9-16-2000; Ord. No. 2005-012,
7-15-2005; Ord. No. 2021-0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
   Cross reference—Definitions generally, §
1-2.
Sec. 32-293. Districts in which allowed.
   Planned unit developments are permissible in all zoning districts, provided
that an application for the planned unit development is submitted, reviewed,
and approved in accordance with this chapter. The planned unit development
district is an overlay district which is applied only at the request of the
applicant.
(Ord. No. 29, § 13.3, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021-0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-294. Minimum area of development.
   The parcel proposed for development as a planned unit development shall be a
minimum of ten contiguous acres.
(Ord. No. 29, § 13.4, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021-0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-295. Design standards.
   Planned unit developments are exempt from this chapter and chapter 26,
subdivisions, with the exception of the following:
   (1)   Wetlands. Acologically sensitive lands, such as marsh, Carolina Bays,
pocosins and swamps, when in the ownership of the owner/applicant, are to be
preserved whenever possible for the public interest. For such lands, as long as
such areas are left undisturbed, they shall be included in the gross density.
   (2)   Maximum ground coverage.
      a.   Maximum ground coverage of sites developed as residential structures
and accessory uses shall be 30 percent of the gross site area for these uses.
      b.   Maximum ground coverage of sites developed as nonresidential shall
be 50 percent of the site specific area for these uses.
      c.   Applicant may exceed restrictions if applicant can effectively
demonstrate, through an innovative engineered design, that the protection
provided by the design would be equal to or exceed the protection by the
limitations of 30 and 50 percent as specified in subsections (2)a and (2)b of
this section.
   (3)   Streets/internal trafficways. A basic characteristic of a planned unit
development is that the internal trafficways or streets, whether public or
private, do not follow fixed linear geometric lines as do most streets, but
instead are curvilinear and of meandering character. This is intended to
provide for the further protection of trees, landscape specimens, and other
environmentally sensitive concerns by building around these areas and for
deliberate slower paced traffic movements and making generous use of features
that promote lower vehicular speeds. Creative design of trafficways is
encouraged. All planned unit developments must adhere to chapter 26,
subdivisions, article III, design standards, of this Code. Prior to the
approval of a final plat, the developer shall have installed all required
improvements, or guaranteed their installation in accordance with chapter 26,
subdivisions, article IV, final approval, of this Code.
   (4)   Setbacks. Minimum setbacks and distances between structures shall be
as follows: minimum distance between internal structures shall be as required
by the North Carolina Department of Insurance, and a minimum setback of 25 feet
shall be required from any peripheral property line of the planned unit
development except, where the peripheral property line is the boundary between
the planned unit development and the State of North Carolina Maritime Forest
Preserve, the required minimum setback shall be 20 feet. A minimum of ten feet
shall be required for all front property lines.
   (5)   Utilities. Each development shall be capable of service with a water
system and a sewage disposal system meeting standards and requirements of the
state. When a development is within 1,000 feet of a water or sewer system, and
the system has the capacity to provide the necessary water and sewer, the
developer shall connect to such system and shall design a water distribution
system for the subdivision meeting any requirements of state and village
ordinances. Except as otherwise allowed by this chapter, all utilities and
easements for each planned unit development must be provided in accordance with
subsection 26-124(f)(4). Notwithstanding that provision, or any other provision
of this section, and with the approval of the village manager, water and sewer
line installations may be located under the paved surfaces of public roads if
such construction is reasonably necessary to preserve natural features of the
land, including trees. All utilities shall be installed underground.
(Ord. No. 29, § 13.5, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2000-21, § 1, 9-16-2000; Ord. No. ZO-
01-04, 6-18-2004; Ord. No. 2021-0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-296. Allowable uses.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, notwithstanding
the permitted or special uses specified as allowed in the underlying zoning
district, a planned unit development may contain any or all of the following
uses:
   (1)   If the parcel proposed for development as a planned unit development
is less than 20 acres, only residential use of any type permitted by article
III of this chapter and associated recreational uses, will be allowed.
   (2)   If the parcel proposed for development as a planned unit development
is equal to or greater than 20 acres, any use not otherwise prohibited in the
village may be allowed, provided that no more than ten percent of the gross
acreage of the planned unit development shall be used for commercial use.
   (b)   All uses that are set out in an approved master land use plan shall
thereafter be treated as permitted uses within the planned unit development.
   (c)   A minimum of 70 percent of the total number of allowable residential
units in an approved planned unit development shall be single-family. Thirty
percent may be developed as residential uses other than single-family.
Notwithstanding this requirement, once a master plan is approved in accordance
with this provision, the number of single-family residential units approved may
be reduced, as long as the number of non-single-family residential uses is not
increased, notwithstanding the fact that such decrease in single-family
residential units may result in a build-out density whereby more than 30
percent of the total residential units are other than single-family units.
   (d)   Any allowed use may be combined with any other use in a planned unit
development or individual building, at the discretion of the village council.
(Ord. No. 29, §
13.6, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2000-21, § 1, 9-16-2000; Ord. No. 2021-0607, § 1, 6-
28-2021)
Sec. 32-297. Recreational and open space requirements.
   (a)   Each planned unit development shall provide at least 20 percent of the
parcel proposed for development in open space. Of the total required open
space, ten percent shall be in uses other than golf course. Such required open
space may be developed and incorporated into a central amenities package and
shall be contiguous except where otherwise deemed appropriate.
   (b)   Upon approval by the village council as part of its approval of the
master plan, any or all of the required open space reserved under subsection
(a) of this section may be dedicated to the village for recreational or open
space purposes.
   (c)   Any required open space which is not dedicated to the village shall be
maintained by a homeowners' or property owners' association or other nonprofit
organization with appropriate restrictions recorded which restrict in
perpetuity the use of such land and facilities to open space and recreational
uses, as shown on the master plan.
(Ord. No. 29, § 13.7, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021-0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-298. Residential density.
   Planned unit developments shall have residential densities no greater than
the maximum density allowed for the predominant zoning classification, by
acreage, based on the following formula:
   (Maximum single-family density x 70%) + (Maximum Multifamily density x 30%)
x 50% = Maximum planned unit development residential density (in units/acre)
(Ord. No. 29, § 13.8, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021-0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-299. Density bonuses.
   In approving an application for planned unit development, if the village
council finds that an increase in density will not have an adverse impact on
the public health, safety, and welfare of the village and that the development
meets the purpose and intent of this chapter, the village council, at their
discretion, may grant a density bonus of up to 15 percent of permitted gross
density calculated according to the following:
   (1)   Construction of on-site bike and/or fitness trails or facilities: not
more than five percent;
   (2)   Construction of park, open space or greenway facilities that exceed
minimum village standards: not more than five percent;
   (3)   Creative use of stormwater impoundments (ponds) for recreation, views
over water, incorporation in parks or for waterfront promenades: not more than
five percent;
   (4)   Development following the standards of traditional urban development:
not more than ten percent; and
   (5)   Donation of school or other public facility site: not more than ten
percent.
(Ord. No. 29, § 13.9, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021-0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-300. Development standards and improvement requirements.
   (a)   The village may approve as a part of the planned unit development
process, notwithstanding any requirements of the underlying zoning ordinance,
the lot dimensions, setbacks, parking, interior landscaping, and buffers within
the planned unit development.
   (b)   Planned unit developments containing both residential and
nonresidential uses shall be designed, located and oriented on the site so that
the nonresidential uses are directly accessible to residents of the planned
unit development. For the purposes of this section, directly accessible shall
mean pedestrian and vehicular access by way of improved sidewalks or paths and
streets that do not involve leaving the planned unit development or using a
major thoroughfare. Directly accessible does not necessarily mean that
nonresidential uses need to be located in a particular location but that the
siting of such uses considers the accessibility of the residential areas of the
planned unit development to the nonresidential use.
(Ord. No. 29, § 13.10, 8-17-1991; Ord. No. 2021-0607, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 32-301. Phasing of development.
   (a)   Construction of the nonresidential portions of the planned unit
development, phase or section, shall be designed and phased to ensure that the
impacts of the nonresidential development upon the surrounding community and
properties will not be detrimental to further residential development of the
community and adjacent properties, or the use and enjoyment of adjacent
residential properties. Impact of the nonresidential portion includes but is
not limited to the visual impact and perception of the nonresidential
development. Construction of the commercial development which is part of the
planned unit development shall commence no earlier than such time as building
permits have been issued for 15 percent of the dwellings in the planned unit
development, unless another schedule which fulfills the intent of this section
has been approved by the village council as part of the master plan approval.
   (b)   All open space and recreational amenities shall be dedicated and
completed before certificates of occupancy may be issued for more than 50
percent of the dwellings in the planned unit development or, if the approved
master plan divides the planned development into phases, in that phase of the
planned unit development of which the amenity is a part.

Sec. 32-305. Site specific plan approval.
   (a)   If the planned unit development is of the size that it must be
completed in phases, it is the responsibility of the applicant or owner to
present site specific plans of each phase, prior to the development of that
phase, to the village manager or his designee. The applicant or agent will be
presented with a planned unit development compliance sheet to assist with the
completing of the site specific plan in a more accurate and efficient manner.
The site specific plans are in more detail and must contain all information as
required for preliminary plats in chapter 26, article VII, of this code.
   (b)   If the proposed planned unit development is to be completed in one
initial phase, the applicant or owner may submit a master plan that contains
all of the elements of the site specific plan.
   (c)   Site specific approval is a two-step process. The preliminary site
specific plat must have village approval prior to installation of the required
improvements. Following the installation of the required improvements, a final
site specific plat shall be approved by the village manager. A mylar with the
appropriate information will be required for signatures of the village manager
or his designee so that the applicant or owner can record the site specific
plan. Submission of the preliminary site specific plans and final site specific
plans must occur no later than 14 days prior to the regularly scheduled
technical review committee meeting. Filing fees as set forth by the village
council in their approved fee schedule, which shall be modified from time to
time, shall be payable to the village upon submission of such preliminary and
final plans. Necessary revisions of plans resulting from technical review
committee comments must be received 14 days prior to the subsequent technical
review committee meeting to be considered at that meeting. If the number of
submittals are such that additional staff time is necessary to review the
documents, then at the discretion of the village manager or his designee those
submittals not being reviewed will be continued to the agenda for the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the technical review committee, occurring no
more than 45 days from the previous technical review committee.
   (d)   Approval of any site specific plan shall be valid for a period of 24
months from and after the date of approval thereof. Within 24 months of the
date of approval of any site specific plan, the developer shall install all
required improvements or make any provisions for guarantee of the installation
thereof pursuant to section
26-201 of this code and thereafter may submit a final site specific plan for
approval by the manager or his designee. Failure of the developer to install
improvements or provide and post the necessary guarantees in lieu thereof and
to provide to the manager a final plat for approval or to record such approved
final plat within such 24-month period shall void the approval of the site
specific plan. Any subsequent proposed development of such property shall be
approved only upon conformity with the terms and conditions of this chapter.

beneficial to the occupants of the master plan area.
      d.   Minor changes in order to correct typographical errors or other
revisions not affecting compliance with any of the substantive features of the
planned unit development.
   (2)   The village council approval is required for the following:
      a.   Significant changes in major infrastructure features (i.e., roads/
access, sewer, water, storm drainage) of the master plan.
      b.   Change in land use designation to increase density for master plan
or site specific plan.
      c.   Any other significant change to the master plan or site specific
plan as determined by the village manager.

Sec. 32-307. Enforcement provisions.   
   (a)   Any person violating any section of this chapter shall be guilty of a
class 3 misdemeanor and punishable by a fine not to exceed $50.00 or
imprisonment not to exceed 20 days. Each day that a violation continues shall
be considered a separate and distinct offense.
   (b)   In addition to and not in lieu of any criminal remedies set forth in
subsection (a) of this section, the village may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and
permanent, mandatory or prohibitory injunction preventing the unlawful
erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion,
maintenance or use of any land or structures in violation hereof, including
order of abatement directing that buildings or other structures located on any
property subject hereto be closed, demolished or removed, if necessary, to come

Sec. 32-308. Procedures for establishing a moratorium.
   (a)   The village may adopt temporary moratoria on any village development
approval required by law. The duration of any moratorium shall be reasonable in
light of specific conditions that warrant imposition of the moratorium and may
not exceed the period of time necessary to correct, modify, or resolve such
conditions. Except in cases of imminent and substantial threat to public health
or safety, before adopting an ordinance imposing a development moratorium with
a duration of 60 days or any shorter period, the governing board shall hold a
public hearing and shall publish a notice of the hearing in a newspaper having
general circulation in the area not less than seven days before the date set
for the hearing. A development moratorium with the duration of 61 days or
longer, is subject to the notice and hearing requirements of G.S. 160D-601.
Absent an imminent threat to public health or safety, a development moratorium
adopted pursuant to this section shall not apply to any project for which a
valid building permit issued pursuant to G.S. 160D-1108 is outstanding, to any
project for which a special use permit application has been accepted as
complete, to development set forth in a site-specific vesting plan approved
pursuant to G.S. 160D-108.1, to development for which substantial expenditures
have already been made in good-faith reliance on a prior valid development
approval, or to preliminary or final subdivision plats that have been accepted
for review by the village prior to the call for a public hearing, if
subsequently approved, shall be allowed to proceed to final plat approval
without being subject to the moratorium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
complete application for a development approval has been submitted prior to the
effective date of a moratorium, G.S. 160D-108(b) applies when permit processing
resumes.
   (b)   Any ordinance establishing a development moratorium must expressly
include at the time of adoption each of the following:
   (1)   A clear statement of the problems or conditions necessitating the
moratorium and what courses of action, alternatives to a moratorium, were
considered by the village council and why those alternative courses of action
were not deemed adequate.
   (2)   A clear statement of the development approvals subject to the
moratorium and how a moratorium on those approvals will address the problems or
conditions leading to the imposition of the moratorium.
   (3)   An express date of termination of the moratorium and a statement
setting forth why that duration is reasonably necessary to address the problems
or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
   (4)   A clear statement of the actions, and the schedule for those actions,
proposed to be taken by the village during the duration of the moratorium to
address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
   (c)   No moratorium may be subsequently renewed or extended for any
additional period unless the village shall have taken all reasonable and
feasible steps proposed to be taken by the village in its ordinance
establishing the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to
the imposition of the moratorium and unless new facts and conditions warrant an
extension. Any ordinance renewing or extending a development moratorium must
expressly include, at the time of adoption, the findings set forth in (b)(1)
through (b)(4) of this section, including what new facts or conditions warrant
the extension.
   (d)   Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a moratorium on development
approvals required by law may apply to the appropriate division of the General
Court of Justice for an order enjoining the enforcement of the moratorium, and
the court shall have jurisdiction to issue that order. Actions brought pursuant
to this section shall be set down for immediate hearing, and subsequent
proceedings in those actions shall be accorded priority by the trial and
appellate courts. In any such action, the village shall have the burden of
showing compliance with the procedural requirements of this section.

   These rules are promulgated pursuant to G.S. 113A-112 and G.S. 113A-124 by
the Secretary of the Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources
in his capacity as executive head of the North Carolina agency designated by
the Governor to administer federal funds granted by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration under the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act.

15A NCAC 7I .0102 Policy.
   The purpose of these criteria is to establish the means and procedures by
which local governments may request and receive the funds necessary to
implement locally developed Coastal Area Management Act implementation and
enforcement programs. These provisions are designed to ensure that no local
government will have to forego the assumption of permit-letting authority
because of inadequate local finances or to severely burden its local budget in
order to undertake a Coastal Area Management Act local implementation and
enforcement program. These provisions are designed to ensure that localities
will be treated uniformly yet equitably with the goal that two localities in
similar situations will be similarly treated.

SECTION .0200 - POLICY AND STANDARDS
15A NCAC 7I .0201 Value of coastal resources.
   The Department of Natural Resources and Community Development and the
Coastal Resources Commission recognize the increased financial burden imposed
by Coastal Area Management Act implementation efforts, realize that the
protection of coastal lands and waters is beneficial to state and national
interests, and believe that the cost of coastal management should be shared by
all levels of government.

15A NCAC 7I .0202 Multi-unit programs.
   Implementation and enforcement programs sponsored by more than one local
government (multi-unit programs) are encouraged where such consolidations are
likely to operate more efficiently and effectively. Such consolidated programs
allow the employment of a person or persons who can spend a substantial
percentage of time in Coastal Area Management Act permit-letting activities and
thereby afford an opportunity to build expertise, operate more efficiently, and
foster the economic administration of the program.

   In general, local governments that are subgrantees of federal and state
funds administered by the Department of Environment, Health, and Natural
Resources will be subject to accounting techniques and procedures similar to
those applicable to the Department of Environment, Health, and Natural
Resources as grantee of federal funds administered by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. More specifically, the requirements of General
Statutes and standards generally applicable to local governments, Federal
Management Circulars 74-4 and 74-7, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration administrative grants standards will be observed. These
standards and regulations are the same as those applicable to Coastal Area
Management Act land use planning grants.

SECTION .0500 - LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT PLANS
15A NCAC 7I .0501 Purpose.
   The Coastal Area Management Act authorizes, but does not require, a city or
county in the coastal area to act as a permit-letting agency for minor
development permits in areas of environmental concern. These Rules establish
the criteria for preparation of local implementation and enforcement plans by
local governments. Before a local government can become a permit-letting
agency, a plan consistent with these criteria must be submitted to the Coastal
Resources Commission for approval. These criteria are provided to assist local
government in:
      (1)   Establishing procedures to be followed in developing local
implementation and enforcement programs;
      (2)   Establishing the scope and coverage of said programs;
      (3)   Establishing minimum standards to be prescribed in said programs;
      (4)   Establishing staffing requirements of permit-letting agencies;
      (5)   Establishing permit-letting procedures;
      (6)   Establishing priorities of regional and statewide concern;
      (7)   Establishing that the program is consistent with the land use plan.

over which it later gains control.
   (c)   A county implementation and enforcement plan shall be limited to areas
not covered by any city plans unless the county acts as the permit-letting
agency for a city or cities. A county may begin such duties only after the
county's implementation and enforcement plan has been amended to include such
area.
   (d)   In any city in which neither the city nor the county elects to become
the permit-letting agency, the secretary will have that duty.
   (e)   Only the Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources may

adjusted by the village manager, taking into account the scope of the project
and the possible or actual impact of the project on the village.
III.    Application.
   Following the pre-production meeting, an application must be submitted on
the village's standard form shall be in effect at the time and presented to the
village film liaison for review no later than ten working days prior to the
proposed project start date.
IV.   Required Notice.
   The applicant shall notify all businesses and property owners which may be
affected by the filming activity no later than seven days prior to the proposed
project start date. The notification shall include the location and duration of
the proposed filming activities, a copy of the permit application, a cover
letter from the applicant including contact information for the applicant, and
specifics regarding lights, noise, and special effects. The businesses and
property owners which must be notified shall be determined by the village film
liaison accounting for the impact of the planned activity. A proposed list of
those persons or businesses requiring notification for review must be forwarded
to the village film liaison with the permit application. The list shall include
the name and address of the businesses and property owners. Following the
issuance of the notification, the applicant must provide the village film
liaison with written confirmation that such notice was given.
   Business and property owners shall have three days from the receipt of the
notice to contact the village film liaison regarding any objections or concerns
with the proposed film project. The applicant shall cooperate and assist the
village film liaison in addressing any meritorious objections or concerns.
   The village may deny or revoke permits where the applicant fails to comply
with the notice requirements contained herein.
V.   Restrictions.
   Bald Head Island generally discourages filming during high tourist
occupancy. The village manager may restrict filming in streets, neighborhoods,
parks, or specific districts. Additionally, the village may impose such other
conditions upon a permit as shall be deemed necessary. Applicants are urged to
confer with the village film liaison before beginning location scouting. In the
event of natural or civil disasters, the village may cancel or suspend all
village issued commercial filming permits. In the event that evacuation of a
street, neighborhood, or district is deemed necessary by the village, all
outstanding permits for the affected area shall be indefinitely suspended. Such
suspensions shall be lifted after the state of emergency proclamation or other
evacuation order has been lifted, and following a safety evaluation conducted
by the village, the applicant, and any applicable utility company.
VI.   Indemnification.
   The applicant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the village, its
officers, agents, and employees from and against all claims, suits, actions,
damages, liability, costs and expenses (including but not limited to its
attorney's fees and expenses), and expenses for bodily or personal injury, loss
of life or property or damage or other legal claim whatsoever arising from, or
out of, any matter or occurrence concerning filming in the Village of Bald Head
Island.
VII.   Traffic Control.
   Approval must be obtained from the village manager and the director of
public safety prior to any film activity that would disrupt the normal flow of
traffic on any village street. If needed, traffic control must be handled by
the village's public safety officers, who shall be hired by the applicant at
the applicant's sole expense.
   Request for street closure or diverting of traffic should be made seven days
prior to the start of activity to allow for the planning of alternative routes
and proper signage. Such requests must be sent to the village manager and the
director of public safety. All filming activity that involves the holding,
delaying, or re-routing of traffic must be accompanied by at least one public
safety officer.
VIII.   Explosives.
      Explosives, pyrotechnics, fire, or smoke-making machines shall not be
used unless specifically approved by the village manager and the director of
public safety.
IX.   Special Effects Hours.
   Special effects involving sirens, gunshots, speeding cars, or other loud
noises are limited to the hours between 8:00 am to 11:00 pm.
X.   Lighting.
   Lighting for filming both during the day and at night, shall be oriented
away from neighboring property whenever possible. Lighting at night during
turtle nesting season, July through September, shall be shielded so as not to
disturb turtle nesting.
XI.   Use of Public Right-of-Way.
   Residents or business owners may not charge the applicant for the use of the
public right-of-way in front of their homes or businesses, nor prohibit its
use.
XII.   Removal of Vegetation.
   Removal, cutting or trimming of vegetation in the public right-of-way or on
village owned lands shall be prohibited unless specifically approved by the
Village manager and any applicable home owner's association.
XIII.   Filming on Private Property.
   No filming shall take place on private property without the written consent
of the property owner.
XIV.   Garbage Assistance.
   Whenever the project blocks or holds traffic on streets which are scheduled
for garbage pickup, applicant shall move all trash containers to a location
that is accessible to the sanitation vehicles. After the trash containers have
been emptied, they shall be returned to their property owners by the applicant.
XV.   Parking and Equipment.
   All equipment and support vehicles not in immediate use shall be parked so
as not to cause any interference to pedestrians or vehicular traffic, or to
impede safe lines of vision at intersections. Vehicles or equipment used during
the project must not block fire hydrants, driveways, or other access ways. No
internal combustion engine ("ICE") vehicles shall be brought on Island roads
without first obtaining the requisite ICE permits.
XVI.   Areas of Environmental Concern.
   Whenever a film set contains dirt, sod, plants, petroleum products, or other
hazardous materials and is located near an environmentally sensitive area, the
production company shall take such measures as deemed necessary to insure that
such materials do not encroach, seep, or intrude into the environmentally
sensitive area. There shall be no disturbance of primary dunes, beach
vegetation, or beach groins. Driving motor vehicles upon the beach is
prohibited pursuant to Village Ordinance Section 28-33.
XVII.   Daily Clean-Up.
   At the end of each day of shooting, the production company will clean and
restore the site location, including public and private lands, to a clean and
orderly condition. The village may grant an exception for filming activities
that are more than one day in duration.
XVIII.   Removal of Sets.
   All sets, piling, fences, building materials, debris, equipment, and any
other materials brought in or built by the applicant shall be removed within
seven days after conclusion of filming. All public property shall be returned
to its original condition.
XIX.   Expenses.
   The production company shall be responsible to the village and shall
reimburse the village for any expenses, including employee overtime, which are
directly attributable to the project.
XX.   Penalties.
   Failure to comply with the guidelines and conditions set forth herein, or
the requirements of the specific permit may result in fines or suspension,
modification or termination of any or all permits issued pursuant to Village
Ordinance Section 32-255. The applicant shall be responsible to the village for
any costs or expenses incurred as a result of the production company's or other
person's failure to follow the ordinance or commercial filming guidelines.
XXI.   Fees.
   Application fees and fees for the use of village staff, equipment, or
emergency apparatus shall be subject to the current fee schedule in place at
time when the applicant submits a permit application. In addition, the village
may charge the applicant a fee for any street closures, barricades, or for
permitting the use of explosives or fireworks during filming.
XXII.   Duration, suspension, modification, and termination of permits.
   The village shall set effective dates during which a commercial film permit
is valid. A permit shall expire at the end of those effective dates. Prior to
or during the effective dates, the village may suspend, modify, or terminate
any permit in the interest of public safety, environmental protection, or where
filming activities cause a nuisance to village residents or property owners or
impede the operation of government activity.
