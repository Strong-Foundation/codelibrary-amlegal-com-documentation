GOVERNING BODY
§ 30.01 TOWN CHARTER.
   The Town of Holden Beach is established by charter from the North Carolina
General Assembly and conferred with powers and duties specified therein from
which are derived its powers and duties as set forth in this code. As such, no
action inconsistent with the Charter shall be permitted except those that may
be authorized by amendments adopted pursuant to state statute.
(Ord. 07-04, passed 5-22-07)
§ 30.02 FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
   (A)   The town shall operate under the Commissioner-Manager (weak Mayor)
form of government. The legislative authority of the town shall be vested in
the Mayor and Town Board of Commissioners, hereinafter referred to as the BOC,
which shall consist of a Mayor and five Commissioners chosen as hereafter
provided.
   (B)   The BOC shall not in any manner dictate the appointment or removal of
any town administrative officers or employees whom the Town Manager or any of
his or her subordinates are empowered to appoint, but they may express their
views, and fully and freely discuss with the Town Manager anything pertaining
to appointment and removal of such officers and employees.
   (C)   Interference with administration. Except for the purpose of inquiries
and investigation under the following subsections, the BOC shall deal with town
officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision by the
Town Manager solely through the Town Manager, and neither shall the BOC give
orders to any such officers or employees, either publicly or privately.
      (1)   Investigations. The BOC may make investigations into the affairs of
the town and the conduct of any town department, office or agency.
      (2)   Independent audit.  The BOC shall provide for an independent annual
audit of all town accounts and may provide for such more frequent audits as it
may deem necessary. Such audits shall be made by a certified public accountant
or firm of such accounts who have no personal interest, direct or indirect, in
the fiscal affairs of the town government or any of its officers. The BOC may,
without requiring competitive bids, designate such accountant or firm annually
or for a period not exceeding three years; provided that the designation for
any fiscal year shall be made not later than 30 days after the beginning of
such fiscal year. If the state makes such an audit, the BOC may accept it as
satisfying the requirements of this section.
   (D)   Nothing contained herein shall prevent the BOC from creating,
abolishing, consolidating, altering, or modifying departments within the town.
(Ord. 07-04, passed 5-22-07)
§ 30.03 COLLECTIVE NAME.

government for all ceremonial purposes and by the governor for the purposes of
disaster or emergency declarations. The Mayor shall sign ordinances and
resolutions only on their passage; shall sign deeds, bonds, contracts and other
instruments approved by BOC as required by law. Willful failure by a mayor to
discharge their legal duties shall result in those duties being assumed by the
Mayor Pro Tem by reason of disqualification, as set forth in §
30.05. Legal remedies for failure to discharge the duties of Mayor may result
in legal censure or charges of contempt, and may serve as grounds for
impeachment. The Mayor shall convene the Town BOC in special called session
when deemed necessary by the Mayor. Unless otherwise expressly provided by law
or this chapter, the Mayor shall have no vote on any question before the Town
BOC except in case of a tie.
(Ord. 07-04, passed 5-22-07)

pleasure of the BOC.
   (B)   The Mayor Pro Tempore shall discharge the duties and exercise the
powers and authority of Mayor in the absence, disability, disqualification of
the Mayor and during a vacancy in the office of Mayor; provided his or her
rights and duties as BOC shall remain unimpaired; except he or she shall
receive the salary or expenses of Mayor when serving in that capacity. No
additional oath of office shall be required of the Mayor Pro Tempore upon
assuming the duties of the Mayor beyond that oath taken at the time of
appointment to Mayor Pro Tempore.

duties of Mayor, whatever the cause, the Town BOC shall elect from its
membership a provisional Mayor Pro Tem to act until a Mayor or Mayor Pro Tem
can act, who shall take the same oath and be clothed with all of the rights,
power and authority of Mayor until a Mayor or Mayor Pro Tem can act except the
right to receive the salary and expense of Mayor when no vacancy exists in the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 92.01 CONDITIONS PROHIBITED AS NUISANCES.
   The intent of these provisions is to control potentially dangerous
conditions that could affect the general public health, welfare and/or safety
of town property owners and/or visitors. Conditions identified as potentially
being a public nuisance will be investigated by the town staff and then

notification that the condition has been so judged. Conditions, on any parcel
of land or lot, that may be judged by the town as being a public nuisance
involve:
   (A)   Accumulation of dead foliage, trees less than four inches in diameter,
undergrowth, grass, weeds or similar vegetation that (by their existence)
creates a fire hazard, encourages accumulation of other debris, or fosters the
inhabitance of snakes, rats, mice and other vermin in numbers that might create
a public health or safety hazard. Uncontrolled growth of vegetation that
extends onto an adjacent property owner's land.
   (B)   Accumulation of household debris/trash/junk or unused items, including
vehicles and trailers, or placement of mechanical equipment of any type not
normally associated with a residential structure.
   (C)   Accumulation of standing surface water on a lot that has been caused
by improper stormwater management by the property owner, or adjacent property
owner, and thus facilitates the breeding of insects.
   (D)   Any condition which violates the rules and regulations of the County
Health Department.
   (E)   Storm or erosion damaged structures and resulting debris. The
existence of any of the following conditions associated with storm- or erosion-
damaged structures or their resultant debris shall constitute a public
nuisance:
      (1)   Damaged structure in danger of collapsing;
      (2)   Damaged structure or debris from damaged structures where it can

injury;
      (3)   Any structure, regardless of condition, or any debris from a
damaged structure which is located in whole or in part in a public trust area
or public land.
   (F)   Miscellaneous. Any other condition that is specified as a nuisance in
this chapter.

NOISE CONTROL
§ 92.20 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The town is recognized as a quiet, family-oriented beach community,
and houses in the town are situated so that they are in close proximity.
Residents and visitors come to the beach community to enjoy the relative
peacefulness and serenity of the place, and excessive noise from one location
can disturb the peace and become a nuisance to the public.
   (B)   Furthermore, it is recognized that excessive and unnecessary noise:
      (1)   Endangers the physical and emotional health and welfare of people
who reside or vacation in the residential neighborhoods and on the beach strand
of the town;
      (2)   Interferes with legitimate family and recreational activities;
      (3)   Depresses property and rental values;
      (4)   Contributes to potentially violent confrontations among persons
occupying neighboring properties or enjoying the beach strand; and
      (5)   Requires police and public safety resources to respond to such
disturbances and confrontations.

BEACH VEGETATION
§ 92.40 PURPOSE.
   The plant know as Beach Vitex (Vitex Rotundifolia), is hereby found and is
declared to be a public nuisance due to the significant negative impacts this
plant will have upon the public beaches and sand dunes, loggerhead sea turtles
and native vegetation such as Sea Oats, Bitter Panicum, Seashore Elder and
American Beachgrass. It shall be unlawful for any person to plant or cause to
be planted Beach Vitex (Vitex Rotundifolia) on any property located within the
municipal town limits of the town.
(Ord. 06-02, passed 3-27-06)
§ 92.41 NOTICE TO ABATE NUISANCE.
   In cooperation with the following organizations, said list not being
exhaustive, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, NC Cooperative Extension, South
Carolina Beach Vitex Taskforce, North Carolina Beach Vitex Taskforce, NC State
University, a program(s) will be developed to eradicate Beach Vitex from
municipal limits. Upon identification of any Beach Vitex plant, the property
owner shall be ordered to eradicate the plant from his or her property pursuant
to an acceptable means of removal and disposal. As eradication precedes
restoration, the plant must be removed from properties before the property is
restored with native plants or other appropriate plants. As Beach Vitex has the
ability to generate new plants from seeds, stem and root sections, the proper
disposal of plants and plant parts is important. The town shall be responsible
for the collection of Beach Vitex separately from other yard waste and will
treat it appropriately. Beach Vitex clippings shall not be chipped and shredded
into mulch and distributed to any yard waste disposal site. The town shall
cooperate with private landowners in this task to proceed with the eradication.
The penalty for failure to comply with this section shall be prescribed in §
92.99.

Penalty, see § 94.99
§ 94.03 FRONTAL DUNE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS
   (A)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, town’s FRONTAL DUNES
shall mean the dunes designated by the town’s designee as the “frontal dunes”;
otherwise, they are the first mounds of sand located landward of the ocean
beach with sufficient vegetation, height, and configuration to offer protection
from ocean storms. Considering the fact that oceanfront property limits extend
to the mean high water mark, the frontal dune may be located on private
property. The town’s FRONTAL DUNE although similar may be different than the
state’s CAMA designated dune, so as to be located closest to the structure as
possible to encourage maximum buffer from hazard.
   (B)   Purpose of the frontal dune. It is desirable to maintain a continuous
frontal dune along the ocean-front of the island, extending from Lockwoods
Folly Inlet to Shallotte Inlet. A continuous frontal dune thus maintained
provides a single, ocean water surge flood control structure that serves to
mitigate the effects of storms, that could by their very nature cause damage to
public and private property. It is the intent of the town that the frontal dune
be maintained to standard specifications and by sand renourishment, so that the
above-mentioned protection can be provided.
   (C)   Frontal dune policy and regulations. The following policies and
regulations apply: (penalty for failure to adhere is $500.00 per violation).
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person or vehicle to cross the
designated frontal dune, except for official town business or emergency access,
unless such crossing is over a town approved ramp and/or stairs.
      (2)   Frontal dune policy and restrictions.
         (a)   Whenever property owners elect to construct a walkway across the
frontal dune on their property, to provide pedestrian access to the beach
strand, the following specifications shall apply. (Note: the same criteria
applies when property owners seek to apply for town approval of an encroachment
agreement to construct a walkway over public property adjacent to their
residence.)
            1.   The walkway shall be constructed only of building materials
approved by the North Carolina Residential Building Code. The walking
passageway shall be no wider than four feet. The underside of the walkway
across the frontal dune shall be a minimum of 18 inches and a maximum of 36
inches above the crest of the sand. Exception: Town owned CAMA accessways may
utilize a six-foot walkway.
            2.   The first step down to the beach strand shall be placed no
farther seaward than the beginning of the downward slope of the CAMA frontal
dune.
            3.   Steps shall be of open tread construction with a maximum riser
height of eight and one-quarter inches and a minimum tread depth of nine
inches, and shall meet the requirements of the North Carolina Residential
Building Code.
            4.   In accordance with North Carolina State Division of Coastal
Management’s enforcement of the Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA), the walkway
access to the beach strand over the frontal dune shall be conclusively presumed
to entail negligible alteration of the dune. In no case shall the walkway be
permitted if it will, in the opinion of the Local CAMA Permit Officer, diminish
the dune’s capacity as a protective barrier against flooding and erosion.
            5.   Except for handicap ramps, steps from the walkway to the beach
strand shall be placed only perpendicular to the frontal dune line.
         (b)   Showers shall not be located on walkways over the dune south of
its landward toe. Shower runoff must not drain onto any portion of the frontal
dune or south of the landward toe.
         (c)   In those instances where a residence or other structure is
located directly adjacent to the frontal dune, stormwater runoff from roofs
shall be controlled by the property owner so as not to erode sand on any
portion of the frontal dune.
         (d)   Sand fences.
            1.   The installation of sand fence along the oceanfront, when
properly located and erected, is an effective method to control blowing sand
which may lead to the formation of dunes. However, when improperly located and
erected, sand fencing may interfere with emergency beach access, cause
accumulation of debris, and discourage sea turtle nesting.
            2.   SAND FENCING is defined as a fence normally constructed of
untreated and unpainted wood held together with twisted wire, with the fence
being nailed to a minimum of one and one-half inch by three and one-half inch
(two-by-four) posts that are spaced at intervals not less than five feet and
are embedded no more than two feet into the sand, and extending no higher than
four feet above grade.
            3.   No sand fence shall be erected without a no-cost sand fence
permit issued by the town Inspections Department. The permit may be requested
and returned by mail following completion.
            4.   All sand fencing shall be installed in individual lengths of
ten feet or less, at an angle between 45 and 90 degrees to the shoreline,
facing west. The lengths of sand fence will be spaced at least seven feet
apart, parallel to each other, to allow sea turtles and pedestrians to pass
through. This method of sand fencing encourages sand accretion and minimizes
negative impacts to nesting sea turtles.
            5.   The Building Inspector shall have the authority to summarily
remove, abate, or remedy a sand fence determined dangerous or prejudicial to
the public safety whether by reason of its location, or its subsequent state of
disrepair or damage. Any fence so removed will be delivered to its owner if
known, and if not, will be disposed of by the Public Works Department in an
appropriate manner.
         (e)   Property owners are encouraged to vegetate and fertilize the
portion of the frontal dune on their property.
         (f)   An exception to this policy is that ocean front property owners
or their agents may traverse on (or over) the specific portion of the frontal
dune within the limits of their property (above the mean high water mark), so
as to make minor dune repairs, plant vegetation, install sand fencing and
otherwise maintain the frontal dune on their property so that it may afford the
intended degree of flood protection per this section.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.01 PURPOSE.
   The North Carolina General Assembly has authorized the governing bodies of
all cities, counties and towns acting individually, or collectively, to require
any special purpose unit of government or private developer of a major
development project to submit detailed statements reflecting the environmental
impact on such projects.
('85 Code, § 12-1) (Ord. 11, passed - - )
§ 150.02 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this chapter, MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT shall mean and
include shopping centers, subdivisions, and other housing developments,
industrial and commercial projects, and projects involving dredging or filling,
and any project which involves any change (by bulldozing, cutting of trees or
vegetation, or otherwise) of more than 50% of the surface area of any proposed
project, but shall not include any projects of less than two contiguous acres
in extent. Any project significantly affecting the quality of the environment
includes (without limitation) projects that may have a detrimental impact on
air or water quality or on ambient noise levels for adjoining areas; that
involve a possibility of contamination of a public or domestic water supply
system or source; or will affect fish, wildlife, ground water, flooding,
erosion, or sedimentation.
('85 Code, § 12-3) (Ord. 11, passed - - )
§ 150.03 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT REQUIRED.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners of the town hereby establishes pursuant to
G.S. Chapters 113A, and 113B that any special purpose unit of government or
developer of any major development project significantly affecting the quality
of the environment of this state shall submit a detailed statement setting
forth the following:
      (1)   The environmental impact of the proposed action.
      (2)   Any significant adverse environmental effects which cannot be
avoided should the proposal be implemented.
      (3)   Mitigation measures proposed to minimize the impact.
      (4)   Alternatives to the proposed action known to the person submitting
the statement, including:
         (a)   Alternative uses of the land in question; and
         (b)   Alternative ways (involving other lands) to achieve the purposes
of the proposed project.
      (5)   The relationship between the short-term uses of the environment
involved in the proposed action and the maintenance and enhancement of long-
term productivity.
      (6)   Any irreversible and irretrievable environment changes which would
be involved in the proposed action, should it be implemented.
   (B)   At least ten copies of the environmental impact statement shall be
filed with the Town Clerk for action by the Board of Commissioners and
transmittal to affected state and federal agencies. One copy shall be placed in
a file at the office of the Town Clerk and shall be made available for
inspection by the public.
   (C)   Guidelines relating to the preparation of environmental statements
under G.S. § 113A-4 shall apply in the preparation of the statement required by
this section.
('85 Code, § 12-2) (Ord. 11, passed - - )
§ 150.04 ENFORCEMENT.
   Construction of any major development project shall not be commenced until
the Board of Commissioners has held two regular meetings subsequent to the
filing of the Environmental Impact Statement. During this period, the Board of
Commissioners shall hold a legislative hearing on the Impact Statement. Notice
of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within
the area no less than one week prior to the date of the hearing. The Building
Inspector shall not issue any building permit or Certificate of Occupancy or
compliance for any structure within a major development project except upon a
finding by the Board of Commissioners that the requirements of this chapter
have been met. Nor shall any approval, permit, license, certificate, or filing
provided for by any zoning ordinance, subdivision control ordinance, or other
land control use ordinance be granted or allowed the Board of Commissioners,

ABANDONED STRUCTURES
§ 150.30 FINDINGS; INTENT.

Inspector finds to be hazardous to the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the town, due to the attraction of insects or rodents; conditions
creating a fire hazard; dangerous conditions constituting a threat to children;
or frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the absence of sanitary
facilities, the town may exercise its police power to abate the nuisance.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority granted by G.S. §§ 160D-1201 et seq., the
contents of which are incorporated herein as if set out in full, it is the
intent of this subchapter to provide for the repair, closing or demolition of
any such abandoned structures in accordance with the same provisions and
procedures as are set forth by law for the repair, closing, or demolition of
dwellings unfit for human habitation.
   (B)   When a local inspector finds any defects in a building, or finds the
building has not been constructed in accordance with applicable state and local
laws; or that a building, because of its condition, is dangerous or contains
fire hazardous conditions; it shall be the inspector's duty to notify the owner
or occupant of the building of its defects, hazardous conditions, or failure to
comply with law. The owner or occupant shall each immediately remedy the
defects, hazardous conditions, or violations of law in the property he owns.
   (C)   Defective conditions may include the following (without limiting the
generality of this section):
      (1)   Defects increasing the hazards of fire, accident, or other
calamities;
      (2)   Lack of adequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities;

determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an
order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter, and improve such
dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness

order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close such dwelling
or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations, and improvements have been

she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact to support such
determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an
order directing and requiring the owner to remove or demolish the same within a
reasonable specified period of time.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall
fail to comply with an order of the Inspector to repair, alter, or improve or
to vacate and close the dwelling within the time specified therein, or if the
owner of a dilapidated dwelling shall fail to comply with an order of the
Inspector to remove or demolish the dwelling within the time specified therein,
the Inspector shall submit to town council of the town at its next regular
meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney to petition the superior court
for an order directing such owner to comply with the order of the Inspector, as
authorized by G.S. § 160D-1203(4).
      (2)   After failure of an owner of a deteriorated dwelling or dwelling
unit, or of a dilapidated dwelling, to comply with an order of the Inspector to
remove or demolish the dwelling within the time specified therein, if
injunctive relief has not been sought or has not been granted as provided in
the preceding division (C)(1), the Inspector shall submit to the governing body
an ordinance ordering the inspector to cause such dwelling or dwelling unit to
be repaired, altered, improved, or vacated and closed and removed or

year pursuant to the ordinance or order, the governing body shall have the
authority as set forth in G.S. § 160D-1203(6).
   (D)   Appeals from orders of Inspector. An appeal from any decision or order
of the Inspector may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby or by any
officer, board or commission of the town. Any appeal from the Inspector shall
be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the
order, and shall be taken by filing with the Inspector and with the Town Board
of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as “Board”, a written notice of appeal
which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing
of any notice of appeal, the Inspector shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all the paper constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was
made. When appeal is from a decision of the Inspector refusing to allow the
person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his or her decision shall remain in
force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the
Inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have
the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the Board, unless
the Inspector certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal is filed with
him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which
shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of this requirement would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be
suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause
shown upon not less than one days written notice to the Inspector, by the
Board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1208
(f) and division (E) of this section. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for
the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the patties, and shall
render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or
by agent or attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make any decision and order
as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have
the powers of the Inspector, but the concurring vote of four-fifths of the
members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or
order of the Inspector. The Board shall have power also in passing upon
appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, to
adapt the application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the
end that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and
welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
   (E)   Decision subject to review. Every decision of the Board shall be
subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within
15 days of the decision of the Board, but not otherwise, as provided in G.S. §
160D-1208(c). In addition, any person aggrieved by an order issued by the
inspector or a decision rendered by the Board may also petition the superior
court for an injunction restraining the public officer carrying out the order
or decision and the court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction
restraining the public officer pending a final disposition of the case. The
petition shall be filed within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering
of the decision. Hearings shall be had by the court on a petition within 20
days and shall be given preference over other matters on the court’s calendar.
The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall enter such final
order or decree as law and justice may require. It shall not be necessary to
file bond in any amount before obtaining a temporary injunction under this
division (E).

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article
21 of Chapter 143; Article 6 of Chapter 153A; Article 8 of Chapter 160A; and
Articles 7, 9, and 11 of Chapter 160D of the North Carolina General Statutes,
delegated to local governmental units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the Town of Holden Beach,
does ordain as follows:
   (B)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (C)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(‘85 Code, § 8-4.1) (Ord. 28, passed - - ; Am. Ord. 06-06, passed 5-22-06; Am.
Ord. 18-13, passed 8-6-18; Am. Ord. 24-08, passed 6-18-24)
§ 154.02 PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that
may increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
      (6)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
      (7)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the
National Flood Insurance Program;
      (8)   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
      (9)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas; and
      (10)   To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a
special flood hazard area.

§ 154.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter it's most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure located on the same
parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Garages, carports and storage
sheds are common urban accessory structures. Pole barns, hay sheds and the like
qualify as accessory structures on farms, and may or may not be located on the
same parcel as the farm dwelling or shop building.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING BUILDING). An extension or increase in the floor
area or height of a building or structure.
   ALTERATION OF A WATERCOURSE. A dam, impoundment, channel relocation, change
in channel alignment, channelization, or change in cross-sectional area of the
channel or the channel capacity, or any other form of modification which may
alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the riverine
flow of water during conditions of the base flood.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.

of the base flood as published in the Flood Insurance Study. When the BFE has
not been provided in a special flood hazard area, it may be obtained from
engineering studies available from a federal or state or other source using
FEMA approved engineering methodologies. This elevation, when combined with the
freeboard, establishes the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   BREAKAWAY WALLS. A wall that is not a part of the structural support of the
building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the
building or the supporting foundation system.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   CAMA. North Carolina’s Coastal Area Management Act. This act, along with the
Dredge and Fill Law and the federal Coastal Zone Management Act, is managed

1.5 feet. Coastal A Zones are not normally designated on FIRMs. (See Limit of
Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA)).
   COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES SYSTEM (CBRS). Consists of undeveloped portions of
coastal and adjoining areas established by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act
(Cobra) of 1982, the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act (CBIA) of 1990, and
subsequent revisions, and includes areas owned by federal or state governments
or private conservation organizations identified as otherwise protected areas
(OPA).
   COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA. A special flood hazard area extending from

Officer as having met the requirements of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 as amended in 1980.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official determination issued by FEMA that
amends or revises an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance
Study. Letters of Map Change include:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter,
to an effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA is based on
technical data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being
in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property, a portion of a property, or structure is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, special flood hazard
area boundaries and floodway delineations, and other plan metric features.
      (3)   Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F): A determination that
a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is,
therefore, no longer located within the special flood hazard area. In order to
qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in
accordance with the community’s floodplain management regulations.
      (4)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP
requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood
hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or
Flood Insurance Study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built
documentation, a Letter of Map Revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the
effective FIRM.
   LIGHT DUTY TRUCK. Any motor vehicle rated at 8,500 pounds gross vehicular
weight rating or less which has a vehicular curb weight of 6,000 pounds or less

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP REPOSITORY. The location of the official flood hazard data to be applied
for floodplain management. It is a central location in which flood data is
stored and managed; in North Carolina, FEMA has recognized that the application
of digital flood hazard data products carry the same authority as hard copy
products. Therefore, the NCEM’s Floodplain Mapping Program websites house
current and historical flood hazard data. For effective flood hazard data the
NC FRIS website (http://FRIS.NC.GOV/FRIS) is the map repository, and for
historical flood hazard data the Flood NC website (http://FLOODNC.GOV/NCFLOOD)
is the map repository.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, not including the land value and that of

   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or  footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main

   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any combination of repairs, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
during any two-year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure, and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant
to §
154.38.
   TECHNICAL BULLETIN AND TECHNICAL FACT SHEET. 
      (1)   A FEMA publication that provides guidance concerning the building
performance standards of the NFIP, which are contained in Title 44 of the U.S.
Code of Federal Regulations at § 60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are
intended for use primarily by state and local officials responsible for
interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and by members of the development
community, such as design professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as
updates of existing bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins
do not create regulations; rather they provide specific guidance for complying
with the minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations.
      (2)   It should be noted that technical bulletins and technical fact
sheets provide guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations.
State or community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence.
Design professionals should contact the community officials to determine
whether more restrictive state or local regulations apply to the building or
site in question. All applicable standards of the state or local building code
must also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
   TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED. Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in or appliance.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in §§
154.20 et seq. and §§
154.35 et seq. is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION (WSE). The height, in relation to NAVD 1988, of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

§ 154.21 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in §
154.05 or §
154.37(K) and (L), the following provisions, in addition to §
154.20, are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
154.03.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
154.03. Structures located in A, AE and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed to the
regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all
areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with this chapter. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall certify that the standards of this division are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in
§
154.36(C), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New or replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the
reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
154.03.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by engineer certification, or in accordance with the most current edition of
the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured Homes, adopted by the
Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15 or a certified
engineered foundation. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an
elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the
chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When
the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering
certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) of this section.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the floodplain administrator and the
local emergency management coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed areas of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which are below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
         Exception: Elevators and accessible interior stairs may be finished if
approved flood proof materials are used below the RFPE.
         Exception: elevators and accessible interior stairs may be finished if
approved floodproof materials are used below the RFPE.
      (2)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials, up to
the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      (3)   Shall include, in Zone AE, flood openings to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by
a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum
design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above;
      (4)   Shall allow, in Coastal High Hazard Areas (Zone VE), breakaway
walls, open wood latticework or insect screening, provided it is not part of
the structural support of the building and is designed so as to breakaway,
under abnormally high tides or wave action, without causing damage to the
structural integrity of the building, provided the following design
specifications are met:
         (a)   Material shall consist of open wood latticework or insect
screening; or
         (b)   Breakaway walls shall meet the following design specifications:
            1.   Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall be not less
than ten nor more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
            2.   Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance
of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by state or
local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of
the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-
structural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with the
base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the North
Carolina State Building Code.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Due to free of obstruction requirements in V zone and all AE is
regulated as V zone in the Town of Holden Beach.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction; and
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Where an independent perimeter load-bearing wall is provided
between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall be
considered a separate building and only the addition must comply with the
standards for new construction.
      (5)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a two year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with
the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the two
year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this chapter.
Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten- year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement
does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;
or
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Temporary placement. Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days
and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently
attached additions); or
      (2)   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
   (G)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the floodplain administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
floodplain administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified should not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures.  
      (1)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be

hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation in conformance with division (D) of this section.
      (2)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet
that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or
floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with §
154.36(C).
      (3)   Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within a
special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met:

   (I)   Fill shall not be used for structural support. Limited non-compacted
and non-stabilized fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for
landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided it is demonstrated through coastal
engineering analysis that the proposed fill would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation and not cause any adverse impacts by wave ramping and
deflection to the subject structure or adjacent properties.
   (J)   There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase
potential flood damage.
   (K)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted except in an existing

must be followed in order for an owner to secure a modification to his or her
lot boundaries, provided the procedures outlined below are followed:
   (A)   Any owner seeking to secure a modification of his or her lot
boundaries shall apply to the Board of Adjustment. A fee, set by the Board of
Commissioners from time to time, but in no event less than $175 shall be paid
to the town with each application for lot boundary modification. Said fee is
intended to cover the cost of advertising and other administrative expenses
that may be involved in the processing of the application;
   (B)   An evidentiary hearing shall be held within the Town Council chambers
to consider said application. All property owners within 100 feet of the
affected properties, shall be given ten days notice by regular mail. The
procedures outlined by the Board of Adjustment’s rules shall be followed,
except where said procedures may be modified herein;
   (C)   A concurring vote of 4/5 of the Board of Adjustment is required in
order to allow any modification to a lot boundary;
   (D)   A survey drawn by a registered land surveyor, or engineer, shall
accompany all requests for lot modification. Said survey shall be drawn in a
manner that can be recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Brunswick
County;
   (E)   The boundaries of two adjacent lots owned by the same person and
platted prior to September 28, 1998 and containing less than 7,500 square feet
per lot may be redrawn if all conditions of this section are met, together with
the following restrictions:
      (1)   The modification will not materially endanger the public health and
safety and insure that the owner will have adequate access to the property, and
density in the area will not be increased by said modification;
      (2)   The modification will not substantially injure the value of
adjoining or abutting properties;
      (3)   The location and character of the modification will be in harmony
with the area in which it is located and in general conformity with the town
plan of development;
      (4)   Any existing violation of the current town code or any existing
variance must be brought into compliance with town ordinances prior to or by
lot boundary modification;
      (5)   No existing lot may be subdivided pursuant to this section;
      (6)   Any lot which upon modification is 7,500 square feet or larger must
meet all current subdivision and zoning regulations;
      (7)   After modification, no lot shall be permitted to contain fewer than
5,000 square feet, nor shall the street frontage be less than 50 linear feet;
      (8)   No new lot shall be created and the number of lots involved in the
modification shall not increase;
      (9)   The property line between the back of lots shall not be changed;
      (10)   Side lot lines shall be at substantially right angles to street
lines or radial (if same are consistent with surrounding plats) and shall
always be straight lines.
   (F)   Once the Board of Adjustment has approved the boundary modification,
the plat map shall be recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds of
Brunswick County and a copy of the recorded plat shall be furnished to the
town. No building permit may be issued for any property until a modification
has been approved and the plat recorded.
   (G)   After approval of lot modification by the town, the lots as modified
shall only be conveyed and described as modified and depicted on the plat
referenced in division (F) above.

Official Zoning Map, but no such corrections shall have the effect of amending
the original Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map shall be
identified by the signature of the Mayor of the town attested by the Town
Clerk, and bearing the seal of the town. Unless the prior Official Zoning Map
has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant
parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved, together with all available
records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. Copies of the Official Zoning

§ 157.056 CONSERVATION (C).
   (A)   The Conservation District is established as a district in which the
principal use of land is the effective long-term management and protection of
significant, limited, or irreplaceable areas. Management is needed due to the
natural, cultural, recreational, scenic, or natural productive values of local,
regional, state, and national concern. Areas included within this district are
depicted on the Zoning Map and will include the following lands and waters:
coastal wetlands, public trust waters, estuarine waters, ocean hazard and inlet
hazard areas seaward of the first line of stable vegetation, and the Corps of
Engineers A.I.W.W. right-of-way (excepting only those areas shown as Rural
Special Use). Other large homogenous tracts of marshland within the town are
also classified as Conservation. Because of map scale requirements all areas
described herein as Conservation are not able to be shown on the Zoning Map.
   (B)   Development activities within the Conservation category AEC's
described above must be consistent with the regulations (15A NCAC7H)governing
development. Suitable uses would include piers, docks, and gazebos, but no
permanent commercial structures or habitable dwellings of any type. Temporary
bridges and landings to access spoil areas for the specific purpose of
servicing soil areas provided CAMA and town requirements are met. A specific
start and completion date, together with the establishment of operating hours,
(completion is the return to the pre-service condition) is required. After such
specific work is completed, the temporary facilities will be removed and the
area restored to its pre-service condition.
   (C)   The intent of the Conservation class is to perpetuate the natural,
productive, scenic, cultural, and recreational features of the coastal zone.

§ 157.057 CONSERVATION CONDITIONAL ZONING (CS).
   (A)   The Conservation Conditional Zoning is established as a district in
which the principal use of land, like the Conservation Zoning, is the effective
long-term management and protection of significant, limited, or irreplaceable
areas. Management is needed due to the natural, cultural, recreational, scenic,
or natural productive values of local, regional, state, and national concern.
   (B)   Projects and activities may occur within Conservation Special Use
classified areas consistent with the protection provided for by the regulations
(Federal, State and Local).
   (C)   It is also the intent of the Conservation Special Use District to
perpetuate the natural, productive, scenic, cultural, and recreational features
of the coastal zone.
   (D)   (1)   Activities within this zone may include the following:
         (a)   Marine and wetlands research;
         (b)   Environmental and ecological studies; and
         (c)   Educational and recreational programs related to the above.
      (2)   Such activity may require temporary or permanent structures or
facilities.
      (3)   Any temporary use must be limited to no more than six months, with
periodic renewal; upon completion, the lands will be restored to their original
state.
      (4)   Permanent and temporary use will be consistent with divisions (A),
(B) and (C) above.
      (5)   For any specific use of these lands, application must be made to
the Planning and Zoning Board for review including, but not exclusive to, a
prospective plan and procedures with facilities and resources to be employed.
Upon review, the project will be forwarded to the Board of Commissioners for
consideration and disposition.

§ 157.058 RURAL DISTRICT (R).
   (A)   The Rural District is established as a district in which the principal
use of land is for single-family dwellings. There will be a maximum of 2.5
units per acre based on that area not defined as coastal wetlands AEC and in
accordance with State, Federal and local requirements.
      (1)   A dwelling is a residence where people live for domestic purposes.

shall be considered to be inconsistent with domestic residential usage and is
not allowed. This would include persistent usage for group gatherings for the
purpose of short-term social or recreational activities. This would include use
as a clubhouse, lodge, public or private clubs, cabana clubs and property owner
association facilities except when contiguous, owned by and within the borders
of an on-island residential subdivision.

platted lot. All impervious structures outside of main structure shall not
exceed 40% of buildable land plus area of the main structure. All Health
Department and CAMA requirements must also be met. Open decks are not
considered in the allowable coverage percentage of the main structure, but they
must meet all setback requirements. Gravel, sand and grassed areas are
considered pervious. An approved pervious product shall be allowed to cover any
portion of the remaining 40% of allowed built- upon area. (See definition of
APPROVED PERVIOUS PRODUCT.)
         (b)   Driveways, parking lots, parking spaces, parking areas, patios
and other similar areas and surfaces located in the front yard setback, rear
yard setback and side yard setbacks adjacent to a street right-of-way shall be

§ 157.064 SPECIAL ENTERTAINMENT USES - VIDEO GAMING MACHINES.
   (A)    Authority. The provisions of these regulations are adopted by the
Board of Commissioners of the Town of Holden Beach, after review by the
Planning Board and after public hearing as required by statute. From and after
the effective date set forth hereinafter, these regulations shall apply to
every building, lot, tract, or parcel of land within the corporate limits of
the town and within its satellite or extraterritorial area as same is
controlled by the town's zoning ordinance.
   (B)    Statement of purpose. The Town of Holden Beach is primarily
residential in character. There is limited commercial development on the
Island, and said development has been established to serve and meet the needs
of the beach’s visitors and year-round residents. The nature and character of
the town and its beach has been that of a family beach, intended to encourage
families to come to the beach. Future development is encouraged to maintain
this approach, and the Land Use Plan, adopted by the town, encourages low key
development. The property values at Holden Beach have steadily increased and
the Board is of the opinion that maintaining control over the development of
the Island to maintain the present development standards and family values has
positively affected the property values within the jurisdiction of the Town of
Holden Beach. It is the intent of the Board of Commissioners to create an
atmosphere where anyone and their child, grandchild, or young person could move
freely within the town.

NONCONFORMANCE PROVISIONS
§ 157.100 CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   Nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of
this chapter may be continued, subject to the restrictions and qualifications
set forth in this subchapter.
('85 Code, § 15-4.1) (Ord. 33, passed 10-5-81; Am. Ord. 4-90, passed 4-2-90)
§ 157.101 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the
regulations (other than the area or width requirements) applicable to the
district in which the lot is located, such a use may be made as of right.
Otherwise, the nonconforming lot may be used only in accordance with a special
use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall issue such a
permit if it finds that:
      (1)   The proposed use is one permitted by the regulations applicable to
the district in which the property is located; and
      (2)   The property can be developed as proposed without any significant
negative impact on the surrounding property or the public health, safety, or
welfare. In issuing the permit authorized by this section, the Board may allow
deviations from applicable dimensional requirements (such as setback lines and
yard size minimums) if it finds that no reasonable use of the property can be
made without such deviations.
   (B)   Whenever this chapter creates a nonconforming lot and the owner of the
nonconforming lot also owns land adjacent to it, and a portion of this other
land can be combined with the nonconforming lot to create a conforming lot
(without thereby creating other nonconformities), the owner of the
nonconforming lot, or his successor in interest, may not take advantage of the
provisions of division (A) of this section.

Penalty, see § 157.999
§ 157.102 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   (A)   Except as specifically provided in this section it shall be unlawful
for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent
of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a nonconforming use may be
extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was
made nonconforming by this chapter, was manifestly designed or arranged to
accommodate such use. However, a nonconforming use may not be extended to
additional building or to land outside the original building.
   (C)   The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a
nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes
used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if
these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity
rather than changes in kind and no violations of other divisions of this
section occur.
   (D)   Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures
on open land are unlawful if they result in:
      (1)   An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming
use.
      (2)   Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such
as yard requirements, height limitations, or density requirements.
      (3)   The enclosure of previously unenclosed areas. An area is unenclosed
unless at least 75% of the perimeter of the area is marked by a permanently
constructed wall.
   (E)   Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where
nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged.
   (F)   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any structure used for
single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be
replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the replacement
does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing
nonconformities with respect to yard size and setback requirements. This
division is subject to the limitations stated in §
157.104 of this subchapter on abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming
situations.
   (G)   A structure that is nonconforming in any respect or a structure that
is used in a nonconforming manner may be reconstructed or replaced if partially
or totally destroyed subject to the following restrictions:
      (1)   The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use may not be
increased.
      (2)   The reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with
respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements, height
limitations, or density requirements, and such dimensional nonconformities must
be eliminated if that can reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening
the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming
use of such building.
      (3)   The reconstructed building may not enclose areas that were
previously unenclosed. An area is unenclosed unless at least 75% of the
perimeter of the area is marked by a permanently constructed wall.
      (4)   Under no circumstances can a mobile or manufactured home in a
nonconforming situation be replaced.

Penalty, see § 157.999
§ 157.103 CHANGE IN KIND OF NONCONFORMING USE.
   A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use. Thereafter, the
property may not revert to a nonconforming use.

Penalty, see § 157.999
§ 157.104 ABANDONMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE; SPECIAL USE PERMIT.
   (A)   When a nonconforming used is discontinued for a consecutive period of
180 days, or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to
reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may thereafter be used
only for conforming purposes, except as provided in division (B) of this
section.
   (B)   The Board of Adjustment may issue a special use permit to allow a
nonconforming use that has been discontinued for more than 180 consecutive days
to be reinstated if it finds that:
      (1)   The nonconforming use has been discontinued for less than two
years.
      (2)   The discontinuance resulted from factors that, for all practical
purposes, were beyond the control of the persons maintaining the nonconforming
use.
   (C)   (1)   If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming
situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a
consecutive period of 180 days, or discontinued for any period of time without
a present intention of resuming that activity, then that property may
thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to
the district in which the property is located, unless the Board of Adjustment
issues a special use permit to allow the property to be used (for a conforming
purpose) without correcting the nonconforming situation.
      (2)   The Board shall issue such a special use permit if it finds that:
         (a)   The nonconforming situation can-not be corrected without undue
hardship or expense.
         (b)   The nonconforming situation is of a minor nature that does not
adversely affect the surrounding property or the general public to any
significant extent.
   (D)   For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a
nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings,
activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered
as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming
apartment building or one space in a nonconforming mobile home park shall not
terminate the right to continue if the use as a whole is continuously
maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a
conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period
shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. And so, if a mobile home
is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming
residential structure also is located, removal of that mobile home for 180 days
terminates the right to replace it.
   (E)   The provisions relating to the 180-day period of discontinuance of use
shall not apply to rental property normally rented on a seasonal basis.

five regular members and three alternate members. All members shall be
residents of the town. Appointments shall normally be made as of July 1 of each
year. Regular and alternate members shall be appointed for staggered terms of
three years, provided that vacancies occurring for reasons other than
expiration of term shall be filled as they occur, for the unexpired remainder
of the term. No member shall serve for more than two consecutive terms, and
having served two consecutive terms, no member shall be eligible for
reappointment until after remaining off the Board for one year. For this
purpose, a member appointed to fill a vacancy for more than one-half a term
shall be considered as having served a full term. Faithful attendance at
meetings of the Board is to be considered by the Town Commission at the time of
reappointment of any regular member or alternate member. Members of the Board
of Adjustment may be removed for cause by the Town Commissioners upon written
charges and after public hearing. Unexcused absence from three consecutive
meetings, or any absence from six meetings in any calendar year shall be cause
for removal. ('85 Code, § 15-10.1)

Board shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at other such times as
the Board may determine. The Chairperson, or in his absence, the acting
Chairperson, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All
meetings of the Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes
of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon every question, or his
absence or failure to vote, indicating such fact, and also keeping records of
its examination and any other official action. ('85 Code, § 15-10.2)

interpretation of this chapter and appeals for variances may be taken to the
Board of Adjustment by any person aggrieved or by any office, department,
board, or bureau of the town affected. Notice of an appeal to the Board of
Adjustment shall be filed with the Building Inspector within 30 days of the
date of the denial. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the
action, unless the Building Inspector certifies to the Board that by reason of
facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent
peril to life and property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by
a court of record.
      (1)   Hearing of the appeal. After receipt of notice of an appeal, the
Board Chairperson shall schedule the time for a hearing, which shall be at a
regular or special meeting.

adopted by the Board of Commissioners, which shall be available at the office
of the Town Clerk, shall be paid to the town for each appeal to cover the
necessary administrative costs and advertising.
   (D)   Powers and duties. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following
powers and duties:
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant
that there is error in any decision made by the Building Inspector or other
administrative official in the carrying out or enforcement of any provision of
this chapter. A concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the Board
shall be necessary to reverse, wholly, or partly any such decision.
      (2)   To approve special uses enumerated within the various zoning
districts.
      (3)   To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the
terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. In granting any variance, the
Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with
this chapter. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by
the Board unless and until the following findings are made:
         (a)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other land, structures, or buildings in the same district.
         (b)   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter.
         (c)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
         (d)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other land,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
('85 Code, § 15-10.4)
   (E)   Appeal from the Board of Adjustment. An appeal from the decision of
the Board of Adjustment may be made to the County Superior Court within 30 days

fourths of all the members of the Board of Commissioners. For the purposes of
this division, vacant positions on the Board and members who are excused from
voting shall not be considered “members of the Board” for calculation of the
requisite supermajority.
      (2)   To qualify as a protest under this section, the petition must be
signed by the owners of either 20% or more of the area included in the proposed
change or 5% of a 100-foot-wide buffer extending along the entire boundary of
each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned. A street right-of-way
shall not be considered in computing the 100-foot buffer area as long as that
street right-of-way is 100 feet wide or less. When less than an entire parcel
of land is subject to the proposed zoning map amendment, the 100-foot buffer
shall be measured from the property line of that parcel. In the absence of
evidence to the contrary, the city may rely on the county tax listing to
determine the “owners” of potentially qualifying areas.
   (B)   The Town Clerk shall certify that petitioners are in fact the owners
of 20% of certain specified properties as required above.

§ 158.01 GOALS AND PURPOSES.
   The central environmental goal of the town is to restore and preserve water
quality and the natural ecological functions of the surface waters that are
included in its planning area and to minimize the impact of flooding and runoff
of pollutants on health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the town. In
order to meet this important goal, the Town Stormwater Management chapter is
adopted for the following purposes:
   (A)   To regulate existing developments, future developments, and
construction activities according to state requirements and to institute
additional mandatory requirements to prevent careless pollution of surface
waters, damage to property due to excessive flooding and surface water runoff
that causes damage to adjacent property.
   (B)   To establish the authority of the town to administer and enforce
stormwater regulations.
   (C)   To create public education programs so that the citizens of the town
will have knowledge of how to reduce and prevent pollution from their homes and
businesses.

irreversible damage.
   BUILT-UPON AREA. That portion of an individual development project that is
covered by impervious or partially impervious cover including buildings,
pavement, compacted soil (including coquina and marl), recreation facilities,
gravel roads and parking areas, and the like. Uncovered wood-slatted decks and
the water area of a swimming pool are not considered to be built-upon area.
   CAMA. The Coastal Area Management Act which was adopted by North Carolina in
1974. The Act established a comprehensive regional resource management program

species. Included in this definition of coastal wetlands is "such contiguous
land as the Secretary of DENR reasonably deems necessary to affect any such
order in carrying out the purposes [of the regulations]." ((3.5. 113-230(a)).
   DEVELOPMENT. Any land disturbing activity which increases the amount of
built-upon area or which otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation
into the soil. A "future development" means any land which is utilized for a
land-disturbing activity after the effective date of this chapter.

other graphic representations, for the control of soil erosion and
sedimentation resulting from a land disturbing activity.
   ESTUARINE SHORELINE. A non-ocean shoreline connected to the estuarine water
which are especially vulnerable to erosion, flooding, and other adverse effects
of wind and water. Estuarine shorelines extend from the mean high water level
(in areas of tidal influence) or normal water level (in areas without tidal
influence) along the estuaries, sounds, bays, and brackish waters for a
distance of 75 feet landward unless otherwise set by the Coastal Resources
Commission.

(Ord. No. 98-09, passed 5-28-98; Am. Ord. 99-18, passed 9-13-99)
§ 158.05 SUMMARY OF STATE REGULATIONS.
   The responsibility for administering North Carolina's stormwater regulations
is shared by three divisions of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR). These divisions are the Division of Environmental Management,
the Division of Coastal Management, and the Division of Land Quality. These
state regulations are supplemented by local requirements outlined in this
chapter.
   (A)   (1)   The Division of Environmental Management (DEM) administers the
requirements set forth in 15A NCAC 2H .1003. This section of the administrative
code regulates the density of developments and mandates standards for
engineered stormwater controls. Generally, DEM defines low density as
development that has built-upon area of 25% or less.
      (2)   High density developments must have engineered stormwater controls
that are designed, constructed, and maintained according to state standards.
These controls capture the stormwater runoff and hold it for a period of time.
During the detention process, pollutants are removed by infiltration and/or
sedimentation.
   (B)   The Division of Coastal Management administers the Coastal Area
Management Act (CAMA). CAMA's goal is to protect Areas of Environmental Concern
(AEC), which are fragile areas where incompatible development may result in
irreversible damage. CAMA identifies four broad categories of AECs: Estuarine
systems, Ocean Hazard Areas, Public Water Supplies, and Natural and Cultural
Resource Areas. Within these broad categories, there are 14 subcategories. The
subcategories that are most applicable to the town are: Coastal Wetlands,
Estuarine Waters, Estuarine Shorelines, Public Trust Areas, Ocean Erodible
Areas, High Hazard Flood Areas, Inlet Hazard Flood Areas, and non-vegetated
Beach Area.
      Any structure to be built in an AEC must be permitted by the Division of
Coastal Management and must meet General Use Standards which are listed in CAMA
(15A NCAC 7H.0208). For a development in an AEC to be approved, it must be
water-dependent and must minimize impacts to the area's soil and ecology. Some
examples of water-dependent uses include bulkheads, piers, and marinas.
   (C)   The Division of Land Resources administers the Sedimentation Pollution
Control Act. This Act requires developers to prepare Erosion and Sedimentation
Control Plans for developments that are one acre or larger. The Plan must
describe the temporary and permanent control measures the developer will use to
prevent accelerated erosion and off-site sedimentation. Sedimentation and
erosion control plans must meet certain site performance standards, including
re-stabilization of construction sites within a reasonable time period,
maintenance of a buffer zone, any natural watercourse or lake, and protection
in the 10-year storm. This act gives local agencies the authority to inspect
land-disturbing activities and to prosecute violators.

§ 158.06 MANDATORY STANDARDS FOR EXISTING DEVELOPMENT.
   Persons who fail to comply with the below listed standards shall be subject
to a fine of $200 for each violation of this section, after notification by the
town.
   (A)   Landscape easements. Owners, of property that is identified by the
town as having special topographic drainage characteristics, shall be asked by
the town to consider granting a five-foot easement along property lines, where
grass swales could be constructed (by the town) to direct the flow of surface
water runoff. Grass swales shall be designed in accordance with the State Best
Management Practices (BMPs). If such easements are granted, thus granting the
town access to work on private property, the town would maintain the drainage
pattern as it so determines.
   (B)   No landscaping, using impervious materials such as solid plastic and
vinyl, will be permitted. Property owners should remove any such materials
installed before the effective date of this chapter.
   (C)   Yard wastes, including dredge spoil, leaves, and yard trimmings, may
not be deposited into drainage structures.   Acceptable management practices
for yard wastes include composting and land-filling.
   (D)   Septic systems should be maintained by the property owner on a regular
basis according to county regulations to prevent contaminated wastewater from
discharging to surface waters. In order to correct contaminated discharges, the
town may remove the water meter from the property of the septic system
violation until such time as violation is corrected.
   (E)   Hazardous compounds must not be discharged into a septic system. Such
compounds include but are not limited to paint, paint thinner, solvents,
pesticides, and petroleum products. It is undesirable to directly or indirectly
place or discharge into surface and subsurface water drainage systems materials
or liquids that could potentially degrade surface or subsurface water quality,
restrict the flow of water in those systems, contribute to soil pollution on
the island, or create soil erosion. The following are specifically prohibited
to be placed or discharged (directly or indirectly) into surface and subsurface
water systems:
         (1)   Sewage or other household wastewater, including that associated
with temporary portable toilets.
         (2)   Water flowing from leaking water lines and lawn sprinkler
systems, resulting in soil erosion.
         (3)   Petroleum products such as used motor oil, paint, solvents and
gasoline.
         (4)   Commercial and household solid waste (garbage/trash).
(Ord. 98-09, passed 5-28-98; Am. Ord. 99-18, passed 9-13-99)
§ 158.07 MANDATORY STANDARDS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.
   Persons who fail to comply with these regulations, after they have received
notice from the town, will be subject to a $500 fine for each day of the
violation, and other actions or penalties as may be authorized by the town.
(Ord. 98-09, passed 5-28-98; Am. Ord. 99-18, passed 9-13-99)
§ 158.08 DEVELOPMENTS THAT REQUIRE STATE CERTIFICATION.
   (A)   For developments that are one acre or larger, the state will require a
stormwater certification or permit from the Division of Environmental
Management. The Stormwater Management Plan required by the state certification
or permit will assure proper disbursal of stormwater on and from the lot so as
not to cause harm or erosion to neighboring property. The property owner or
their representative must submit a copy of the DEM stormwater certification or
permit to the town.
   (B)   The Department of Environmental Management may also require a Wetland
401 Water Quality Certification and/or a Dredge and Fill Permit. If so, the
property owner or their representative must submit copies of the permit
application and the permit to the town, five business days prior to acting on
the permit.
   (C)   Developments that infringe upon state-defined Areas of Environmental
Concern (AEC) will require either a CAMA major from the Division of Coastal
Management or a CAMA minor permit from the town. If a CAMA major permit is
required, then the property owner or their representative must submit a copy of
the permit application and the approved permit to the town, five business days
prior to acting on the permit.
   (D)   The town shall monitor development projects to assure that the above
mentioned permit criteria are adhered to, and will issue a notice of violation,
or cause such a notice to be issued by the state.
   (E)   An Operation and Maintenance Plan (OMP) will be prepared by the
property owner or their representative to assure proper and continual operation
of the Division of Environmental Management certification or permit per §
158.08 (A) above. The OMP will indicate what operation and maintenance actions
are needed, what specific quantitative criteria will be used for determining
when those actions are to be taken, and who is responsible for those actions.
   (F)   Roadway drainage systems and stormwater control systems must be
designed by a qualified registered professional engineer properly licensed by
the state. The town may require re-certification if the property is transferred
prior to actual development.
   (G)   All future subdivisions will require a ten-foot landscape drainage
easement around perimeter of development.
(Ord. 98-09, passed 5-28-98; Am. Ord. 99-18, passed 9-13-99)
§ 158.09 DEVELOPMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE STATE CERTIFICATION.
   Any land disturbing activity (as defined in earlier section of this chapter)
must comply with the criteria presented below. A development which is under one
acre and does not infringe upon any State-defined Areas of Environmental
Concern will usually not require State Certification. However, such
developments shall be subject to the certain town requirements as discussed
below:
   (A)   The primary intent of these regulations is to satisfactorily control
stormwater on individual parcels of land, and areas in between, so as not to
adversely affect the quantity and quality of surface water flows as a result of
natural rainfall, and to control runoff onto adjacent property, or water
induced soil erosion in any form. Because of the low lying nature of the
barrier island upon which the town is situated, it is important that surface
water runoff be controlled as much as is reasonably possible within property
boundaries, and not drained onto adjacent areas, both private and public (for
example streets and roads).
   (B)   The amount of any fill materials to be placed for whatever purpose
(height above existing grades) shall be limited to either 12 inches above the
average centerline of the road adjacent to the property.
   (C)   Prior to the placement of any soil fill material on parcels of land,
with the exceptions as listed below in division (D), the property owner or
their appointed representative shall apply for a Stormwater Permit. The permit
shall contain the following information:
      (1)   Site plan drawn to a scale of 1:20 on white bond paper a minimum of
8.5" x 14" in size. The plan will be clearly and legibly labeled and will show
existing land grades of the parcel (topographic relief), adjacent property
lines with existing land grades at the property line, and proposed finished
land grades for the property in question. Elevations of adjacent property will
be shown at minimum intervals of 25 feet, with a minimum of four points per
property. If there is a residence on adjacent property, the elevation of the
concrete slab of the residence will be indicated, as well as the elevation of
existing grade at the corners of the structure. The site plan shall also show
the location and elevation of a benchmark established on or adjacent to the
property, to be used as an on-the-ground elevation reference.
      (2)   Location, area and composition of all features proposed to be
located on the property such as building structures, driveways, sidewalks,
septic tank and drain field, or any other feature that may impact stormwater
management per these regulations.
      (3)   Designation of ground level pertaining to FEMA base flood
elevations and height above mean sea level per §
157.006 of the Town Code. This is in reference to the point at which ground
level will be measured (in reference to the height restriction) in order that a
home may be constructed on the property.
      (4)   Per information presented above, it is the intent of these
regulations that stormwater flow be routinely contained within property lines
in question, and not be directed onto adjacent real estate. Within property
lines, sheet flow drainage of stormwater over grassy or adequately vegetated
surfaces will be managed in such a manner so as not to create soil erosion,
sedimentation buildup, or channeling water in any way onto adjacent property.
In all cases when stormwater is proposed to be directed toward a public street,
the plan will be designed so as to control the first 1.5 inches of rainfall
from impervious surfaces during a 24-hour period within the property
boundaries.
      (5)   Using the above guidance, the proposed direction of flow for
stormwater will be clearly shown throughout the plan, so as to provide the
approving authority with sufficient information to determine how the applicant
proposes to manage stormwater primarily on site. In addition to sheet flow
drainage, engineered stormwater management solutions are encouraged. The
completed plan must be sealed by an engineer or land surveyor licensed to
practice in the stormwater runoff planning in the state. The engineer or land
surveyor in question shall certify that all aspects of the stormwater permit
plan have been complied with according to the design.
      (6)   A retaining wall not to exceed 30 inches in height is allowed to
retain the added soil fill materials on site as indicated in the septic permit,
to prevent stormwater flow onto adjacent property. When the wall extends along
the property lines, beyond the boundaries of the highest fill allowed, toward
the street side or property rear, it must be decreased in elevation by a
minimum of one foot for every 12 feet of wall length so that it remains
parallel to the slope of the line of fill.
      (7)   In those cases where the property in question is lower than
adjacent property, additional fill materials may be added to bring the property
up to the existing grade of adjacent properties, so long as an engineered
stormwater plan is approved.
      (8)   Direct outlet channels to surface water are prohibited unless
designed for State Best Management Practices (BMPs). Stormwater must be allowed
to pool and infiltrate on the lot or through drainage swales designed in
accordance with BMPs.
   (C)   All future subdivisions will require ten-foot stormwater easements
around the perimeter of development. The proposed development must comply with
all other requirements of the stormwater management plan.
   (D)   Exceptions to this section shall include:
      (1)   The placement of topsoil (not to exceed three inches) for the
purpose of landscaping will not require a Stormwater Permit.
      (2)   Bulkheads or retaining walls at existing houses on canal lots will
not require a site plan sealed by an engineer if the bulkhead, retaining wall
and fill are the same height as adjacent property. Wing-walls as required by
the building code are exempt from division (B)(4) of this chapter.
   (E)   Any person who installs fill material or constructs a bulkhead,
retaining wall, or similar structure without a permit is subject to a fine of
$500 for each incident and day of violation. Any person found in violation will
be given ten days to remove fill material or bulkhead, retaining wall, or
similar structure before the penalty begins, and to restore the site to its
original condition.
   (F)   No residence Certificate of Occupancy (CO) shall be issued until the
Building Inspector has inspected and certified the satisfactory completion of
those criteria specified in the approved Stormwater Permit pertaining to the
location upon which the home was constructed.
   (G)   In those instances where a Stormwater Permit is denied by the Building
Inspector, the applicant may appeal the case to the Planning and Zoning Board.
The appellate authority higher than the Planning and Zoning Board shall be the
Board of Commissioners.

§ 158.10 MANDATORY STANDARDS FOR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES.
   Persons who fail to comply with these regulations after they have received
notice from the town will be subject to a $500 fine for each violation, and
other actions or penalties as may be authorized by the town.
   (A)   For construction activities that are one acre or larger, the state
will require a Sedimentation and Erosion Control Plan from the Division of Land
Quality. The developer must submit a copy of the approved Sedimentation and
Erosion Control Plan to the Town Manager. For construction activities that do
not require state certification, all requirements of §
158.09 are applicable.
   (B)   The town shall monitor development projects to assure that the above
mentioned permit criteria are adhered to, and will (if required) issue a notice
of violation, or cause such a notice to be issued by the state.
   (C)   Construction activities, that are under one acre and infringe upon a
State-defined Area of Environmental Concern, will require a CAMA minor permit
from the Local Permit Officer for the town.
   (D)   No area outside of a subdivision shall have any change of the terrain,
drainage (and the like) without prior approval from the town. Future
subdivisions shall not have the terrain, drainage (and the like) altered before
a review of the area is conducted by state and/or county officials; e.g. the
County Health Department has inspected the site pertaining to the proposed
alterations.
(Ord. 98-09, passed 5-28-98; Am. Ord. 99-18, passed 9-13-99)
§ 158.11 MANDATORY STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION.
   (A)   The town will promote, encourage, and facilitate public education
programs on stormwater management.
   (B)   The public must be informed of how to identify and report pollution
violations and water quality problems. Such actions and conditions shall be
reported to the Town Manager. Serious violations may be reported to the
Department of Environmental and Natural Resources in Wilmington. (See Appendix
A for a suggested format for public distribution materials on this topic.)
   (C)   The public must be informed of how to minimize water pollution in
their homes and businesses. Some of the issues that shall be addressed are lawn
and garden care, use of household chemicals, motor vehicle care, septic tank
maintenance, and pet care. (See Appendix B for a suggested format for public
distribution materials on this topic.)
   (D)   Any brochures printed by the town will also be made available on audio
tape for the handicapped, upon request.
(Ord. No. 98-09, passed 5-28-98; Am. Ord. 99-18, passed 9-13-99)
§ 158.12 INSPECTION AND NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   The town will, upon prior notification to the property owner, make
reasonable inspections to determine whether or not the provisions of this
chapter are being followed.
   (B)   A Notice of Violation may be issued by the town in those cases where
the provisions of this chapter have not been followed. Notice will be hand-
delivered or served by Certified Mail and shall set forth the measures to
achieve compliance. A time-frame shall be established by the town for
compliance, with the length of time being set depending on the situation. The
notice shall state that if the provisions are not adhered to, then civil action
may result, including assessment of stated monetary penalties.
(Ord. 98-09, passed 5-28-98; Am. Ord. 99-18, passed 9-13-99)
