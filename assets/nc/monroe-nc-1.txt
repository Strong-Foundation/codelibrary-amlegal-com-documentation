SESSION LAWS OF 2007
CHAPTER 160A
   An act to provide for an increase in the penalty set for a red light
violation detected by a camera; to require that the clear proceeds of each
penalty collected be transferred to the local school board; to define what
amounts may be deducted from each penalty by a municipality to arrive at the
amount of clear proceeds from each civil penalty that must be transferred to
the local school board; and to permit a collection assistance fee to be
collected from the responsible party if the civil penalty is not paid within a
specified time .
The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:
Section 1. G.S. § 160A-3001.1(C) reads as rewritten:
   § 160A-300.1. Use of traffic control photographic systems.
   (c)   Municipalities may adopt ordinances for the civil enforcement of G.S.
§ 20-158 by means of a traffic control photographic system, as described in
subsection (a) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. § 20-
176, in the event that a municipality adopts an ordinance pursuant to this
section, a violation of G.S. § 20-158 at a location at which a traffic control
photographic system is in operation shall not be an infraction. An ordinance
authorized by this subsection shall provide that:
      (1)   The owner of a vehicle shall be responsible for a violation unless
the owner can furnish evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the
violation, in the care, custody, or control of another person. The owner of the
vehicle shall not be responsible for the violation if the owner of the vehicle,
within 30 days after the date of personal service or mailing of notification of
the violation, furnishes the officials or agents of the municipality which
issued the citation either of the following:
         a.   An affidavit stating the name and address of the person or
company who had the care, custody, and control of the vehicle.
         b.   An affidavit stating that the vehicle involved was, at the time,
stolen. The affidavit must be supported with evidence that supports the
affidavit, including insurance or police report information.
      (1a)   Subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not apply, and the
registered owner of the vehicle shall not be responsible for the violation, if
notice of the violation is given to the registered owner of the vehicle more
than 90 days after the date of the violation.
      (2)   A violation detected by a traffic control photographic system shall
be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty of seventy-five
dollars ($75.00) shall be assessed, and for which no points authorized by G.S.
§ 20-16(c) shall be assigned to the owner or driver of the vehicle nor
insurance points as authorized by G.S. § 58-36-65.
      (3)   The owner of the vehicle shall be issued a citation which shall
clearly state when the penalty is due and the manner in which the violation may
be challenged. The owner shall comply with the directions on the citation. The
citation shall be processed by officials or agents of the municipality and
shall be forwarded by personal service or first-class mail to the address given
on the motor vehicle registration. If the owner fails to pay the civil penalty
or to respond to the citation within 30 days after the date the citation is
served or mailed, the owner shall have waived the right to contest
responsibility for the violation, and shall be subject to a civil penalty not
to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). The municipality may establish
procedures for the collection of these penalties and may enforce the penalties
by civil action in the nature of debt.
      (4)   The municipality shall institute a nonjudicial administrative
hearing to review objections to citations or penalties issued or assessed under

CHAPTER 20
   An act to require secondary purchases of motor vehicles for scrap metal or
salvage parts to maintain records, and to amend the junked motor vehicle law
applicable to the City of Monroe.
The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:
Section 1. Chapter 20 of the General Statues is amended by adding a new section
to read:
§ 20-62.1. Purchase of vehicles for purposes of scrap or parts only.
   (a)   Records for Scrap or Parts. - A secondary metals recycler, as defined
in G.S. §66-11(a)(3), and salvage yard, as defined in G.S. § 20-137.7(6),
purchasing motor vehicles for the recovery of scrap metal or the purposes of
dismantling or wrecking such motor vehicles for the recovery of scrap metal or
for the sale of parts only, must comply with the provision of G.S. §20-61,
provided, however, that a secondary metals recycler or salvage yard may
purchase a motor vehicle without a certificate of title, if the motor vehicle
is 10 model years old or older and the secondary metals recycler or salvage
yard comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   Maintain a record of all purchase transactions of motor vehicles.
The following information shall be maintained for transactions of motor
vehicles:
         a.   The name and address of the secondary metals recycler or salvage
yard.
         b.   The name, initials, or other identification of the individual
entering the information.
         c.   The date of the transaction.
         d.   A description of the motor vehicle, including the make and model
to the extent practicable.
         e.   The vehicle identification number (VIN) of the vehicle.
         f.   The amount of consideration given for the motor vehicle.
         g.   A written statement signed by the seller or the seller's agent
certifying that the seller or the seller's agent has the lawful right to sell
and dispose of the motor vehicle.
         h.   The name and address of the person from whom the motor vehicle is
being purchased.
         i.   A photocopy or electronic scan of a valid drivers license or
identification card issued by the Division of Motor Vehicles of the seller of
the motor vehicle, or seller's agent, to the secondary metals recycler or
salvage yard, or in lieu thereof, any other identification card containing a
photograph of the seller as issued by any state or federal agency of the United
States: provided, that if the buyer has a copy of the seller's photo
identification on file, the buyer may reference the identification that is on
file, without making a separate photocopy for each transaction. If seller has
no identification as described in this sub-subdivision, the secondary metals
recycler or salvage yard shall not complete the transaction.
      (2)   Maintain the information required under subdivision (1) of this
subsection for not less than two years from the date of the purchase of the
motor vehicle.
   (b)   Inspection of Motor Vehicles and Records. - At any time it appears a
secondary metals recycler, salvage yard, or any other person involved in
secondary metals operations is open for business, a law enforcement officer
shall have the right to inspect the following:
      (1)   Any and all motor vehicles in the possession of the secondary
metals recycler, the salvage yard, or any other person involved in secondary
metals operations.
      (2)   Any records required to be maintained under subsection (a) of this
section.
   (c)   Violations. - Any person who knowingly and willfully violates any of
the provisions of this section, or any person who falsifies the statement
required under subsection (a)(1)g. of this section, shall be guilty of a Class
1 misdemeanor for a first offense. A second or subsequent violation of this
section is a Class I felony. The court may order a defendant seller under this
subsection to make restitution to the secondary metals recycler or salvage yard
for any damage or loss caused by the defendant seller arising out of an offense
committed by the defendant seller.
   (d)   Confiscation of Vehicle or Tools Used in Illegal Sale. - Any motor
vehicle used to transport another motor vehicle illegally sold under this
section may be seized by law enforcement and is subject to forfeiture by the
court, provided, however, that no vehicle used by any person in the transaction
of a sale of related metals is subject to forfeiture unless it appears that the
owner or other person in charge of the motor vehicle is a consenting party or
privy to the commission of a crime, and a forfeiture of the vehicle encumbered
by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured
party who had no knowledge of or consented to the act.
      Whenever property is forfeited under this subsection by order of the
court, the law enforcement agency having custody of the property shall sell any
forfeited property which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is
not harmful to the public, provided that the proceeds are remitted to the Civil
Fines and Forfeitures Fund established pursuant to G.S. § 115C-457.1.
   (e)   Exemptions. - As used in this section, the term "motor vehicle" shall
not include motor vehicles which have been mechanically flattened, crushed,
baled, or logged and sold for purposes of scrap metal only.
   (f)   Preemption. - No local government shall enact any local law or
ordinance with regards to the regulation of the sale of motor vehicles to
secondary metals recyclers or salvage yards.
(Sess. L. 2007, C. 20, Sec. 1)
Section 2.  G.S. § 20-61 reads as rewritten:
§ 20-61. Owner dismantling or wrecking vehicle to return evidence of
registration.
   Except as permitted under G.S. § 20-62.1, any owner dismantling or wrecking
any vehicle shall forward to the Division the certificate of title,
registration card and other proof of ownership, and the registration plates
last issued for such vehicle, unless such plates are to be transferred to
another vehicle of the same owner. In that event, the plates shall be retained
and preserved by the owner for transfer to such other vehicle. No person, firm
or corporation shall dismantle or wreck any motor vehicle without first
complying with the requirements of this section. The Commissioner upon receipt
of certificate of title and notice from the owner thereof that a vehicle has
been junked or dismantled may cancel and destroy such record of certificate of
title.
(Sess. L. 2007, C. 20, Sec. 2)
Section 3. G.S. § 160A-303.2(a) reads as rewritten:
   (a)   A municipality may by ordinance regulate, restrain or prohibit the
abandonment of junked motor vehicles on public grounds and on private property
within the municipality's ordinance-making jurisdiction upon a finding that
such regulation, restraint or prohibition is necessary and desirable to promote
or enhance community, neighborhood or area appearance, and may enforce any such
ordinance by removing or disposing of junked motor vehicles subject to the
ordinance according to the procedures prescribed in this section. The authority
granted by this section shall be supplemental to any other authority conferred
upon municipalities. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a
municipality to require the removal or disposal of a motor vehicle kept or
stored at a bona fide "automobile graveyard" or "junkyard" as defined in G.S. §
136-143.
   For purposes of this section, the term "junked motor vehicle" means a
vehicle that does not display a current license plate and that:
      (1)   Is partially dismantled or wrecked; or
      (2)   Cannot be self-propelled or moved in the manner in which it
originally was intended to move; or
      (3)   (applicable to most localities) Is more than five years old and
appears to be worth less than one hundred dollars ($100.00); [or]
      (4)   Is more than five years old and appears to be worth less than five
hundred dollars($500.00). This subdivision applies only to the Cities of
Belmont, Bessemer City, Cherryville, Gastonia, Monroe and Mount Holly, and the
Towns of Ahoskie, Cramerton, Dallas, Farmville, LaGrange, Mint Hill, Louisburg
and Stanley.
(Sess. L. 2007, C. 20, Sec. 3)
Section 4. Section 3 of this act is effective when this act becomes law. The
remainder of this act becomes effective December 1, 2007 and applies to
offenses committed and motor vehicles purchased on or after that date.

cast in such an election shall be for the operation of such stores, it shall be
legal for Alcoholic Beverage Control stores to be set up and operated in the
City of Monroe, but if a majority of the votes cast in such election shall be
against Alcoholic Beverage Control stores, no such stores shall be set up or
operated in the City of Monroe under the provisions of this Act. In said

Monroe. Thereafter, all Public-Local and Private Laws applicable to the sale of
intoxicating beverages within the City of Monroe in force and effect prior to
the authorization to operate Alcoholic Beverage Control stores shall be in full
force and effect the same as if such election had not been held, and until and
unless another election is held under the provisions of the Act in which a
majority of the votes shall be cast “For Alcoholic Beverage Control Stores.” No
election shall be called and held in the City of Monroe under the provisions of
this Act within three (3) years from the holding of the last election
thereunder. It shall be the duty of the governing body of the City of Monroe to
order the Alcoholic Beverage Control election on its own motion or within sixty
(60) days after a petition shall have been presented, filed and signed by at
least fifteen percent (15%) of the number of the registered and qualified
voters of the City of Monroe that voted in the election for the governing body
of said city in the last election requesting the same. (Sess. L. 1963, C. 541,
Sec. 4)
Section 5 Board of Alcoholic Beverage Control.
   If the operation of the Alcoholic Beverage Control stores is authorized
under the provisions of this Act, the governing body of the City of Monroe
shall immediately create a Board of Alcoholic Beverage Control to be composed

   (A)   This code in part carries forward by re-enactment some of the Code of
the City of Monroe (adopted by the City Council on March 1, 1984, as amended)

force such existing provisions so that all rights and liabilitites that have

amended, which are not re-enacted herein are hereby repealed.

their finality, the same as if this code had not been adopted, and any and all
violations of the existing zoning ordinance, prosecutions for which have not
yet been instituted, may be hereinafter filed and prosecuted; and nothing in

shall be itself repealed, the repeal shall not be construed to revive the

(Am. Ord. O-2002-04, passed 1-15-02)
§ 10.18 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage
date of the original ordinance, and the most recent three amending ordinances,
if any, are listed following the text of the code section. Example: (Ord. 10,
passed 5-13-60; Am. Ord. 15, passed 1-1-70; Am. Ord. 20, passed 1-1-80; Am.
Ord. 25, passed 1-1-85)
   (B)   (1)   If a G.S. cite is included in the history, this indicates that
the text of the section reads substantially the same as the statute.
Example: (G.S. § 160A-69) (Ord. 10, passed 1-17-80; Am. Ord. 20, passed 1-1-
85).
      (2)   If a statutory cite is set forth as a “statutory reference”
following the text of the section, this indicates that the reader should refer
to that statute for further information.
      Example:
         § 31.10 MAYOR.
            The Mayor shall preside at all meetings of the legislative body.
         (Ord. 10, passed 1-1-80)
      Statutory reference:

   (C)   If a section of this code is derived from the previous code of
ordinances of the city published in 1984 and subsequently amended, the 1984
code section number shall be indicated in the history by “('84 Code, §     ).”
§ 10.19 ENFORCEMENT OF ORDINANCES
   (A)   General Enforcement. Violations of this Code of Ordinances or any
other city ordinance, except § 70.31, shall constitute a misdemeanor and/or, at
the election of the city, shall subject the violator to civil penalties and/or,
where permitted by law, equitable remedies for said violation as hereinafter
provided.
   (B)   Injunction and Order of Abatement Remedies.
      (1)   Any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance that makes
unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced
by injunction and order of abatement by the general court of justice. When a
violation of such a provision occurs, the city may apply to the appropriate
division of the general court of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory
injunction and/or order of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the
unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action
shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil
proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in
particular.
      (2)   An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures
on the property be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or
other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; that
abandoned or junked vehicles be removed; that improvements or repairs be made;
or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into
compliance with this Code or any other city ordinance. If the defendant fails
or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within
the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the city may
execute the order of abatement. The city shall have a lien on the property for
the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and
materialman's lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of
abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for
compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by
the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount approved by the Judge before whom the
matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance
with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the Judge.
Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction
issued in conjunction therewith.
   (C)   Civil Penalties.
      (1)   Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Code or
any other city ordinance, the penalty for which is a civil penalty, the city
shall cause a notice of violation to be issued to the violator by the
appropriate official of the city and served on the violator or his agent,
either in person or by first class United States mail, postage prepaid and
addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records
of the city or as obtained from the violator or his agent. The appropriate city
official serving the notice of violation shall sign and have notarized an
affidavit describing the type of service and the date of service. The violator
shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing or personal service of the
notice of violation. The notice of violation shall set out the nature of the
violation, the Code section or ordinance violated, the date or dates of the
violation, and shall contain an order to immediately cease the violation. The
notice of violation shall specify that a second and subsequent citations will
assess a civil penalty, together with costs, attorney fees, and such other
relief as provided by law. The notice of violation shall also inform the
violator of the violator's appeal rights. If the violation is in the nature of
an offense for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil
proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be stated within which the
violation must be abated.
         (2)   The violator must file an appeal from a notice of violation
within 10 days from the service date of the notice of violation as indicated on
the affidavit of service. An appeal is deemed filed when it is received by the
City Manager or his designee. Forms and instructions for filing an appeal shall
be made available at the office of the City Manager or his designee. A violator
who fails to file an appeal within the time period described above is deemed to
have forfeited the appeal for the violation, the notice of violation, the civil
citations, and the civil penalties assessed for the violation. Appeals shall be
heard by the Board of Adjustment or other administrative process established by
the City. The decision of the Board of Adjustment of other hearing officer is
subject to review in the Superior Court of Union County in the nature of
certiorari.
      (3)   Where the city determines that the period of time stated in the
original notice of violation is not sufficient for abatement based upon the
work required or based on a consent agreement, the city may amend the notice of
violation to provide for additional time.
      (4)   Upon failure of the violator to comply the notice of violation
within 10 days of service of the notice of violation, a civil citation shall be
issued by the appropriate official of the city and served on the violator or
his agent, either in person or by first class United States mail, postage
prepaid and addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in
the records of the city or obtained from the violator or his agent. The
appropriate city official serving the civil citation shall sign and have
notarized an affidavit describing the type of service and the date of the
service. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing or
personal service of the civil citation.
      (5)   The civil citation shall direct the violator to immediately cease
the violation, shall inform the violator of the civil penalty, and shall direct
the violator to make payment of the civil penalty to the City Manager or his
designee, within 10 days of the date of the civil citation, or alternatively to
pay the citation by mail postmarked within 10 days of service of the civil
citation. Once a notice of violation has been issued and the 10-day warning
period has expired, civil citations may be issued for each day the same or
similar violation continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated.
If a violation is repeated within a two year period from the date of the
initial violation, it shall be considered to be a continuation of the initial
violation and shall be subject to additional penalties and remedies as set
forth in this section and section
10.99. A repeat violation is one which is identical to or reasonably similar to
a previous violation for which a notice of violation or civil citation has been
issued by the city.
      (6)   If the violator fails to respond to a civil citation within 10 days
of its service, and pay the penalty prescribed therein, the city may institute
a civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of the North
Carolina General Court of Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty,
costs, attorney fees and such other relief as permitted by law.
   (D)   In the event any provision of this section is found to be in conflict
with any other provision of any other ordinance or code of the city, the more
specific provision shall prevail. In the event any provision of this section is
found to be invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain effective and valid.
   (E)   The time periods in this section shall be computed in the manner set
forth in Rule 6(a) and 6(e) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (F)   The provisions of this Code and any other city ordinances may be
enforced by one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed
by this section.
   (G)   The existing provisions of the Code of Ordinances, the violation of
which shall subject the offender to civil penalties and/or a combination of any
other remedy authorized and prescribed by this section, are as follows:
Chapter 55 - Solid Waste
Chapter 90 - Abandoned and Junked Motor Vehicles

other city ordinance, except §

violating the provisions of this Code is, upon conviction, guilty of a
misdemeanor and is subject to a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500)
and/or subject to imprisonment for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days.
   (B)   Unless otherwise provided, civil penalties shall be in the following
amounts:

expired, civil citations in the above amounts may be issued for each day the
same or similar violation continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or
abated in accordance with Section
10.19(C)(5).
   (C)   In the event any provision of this section is found to be in conflict
with any other provision of any other ordinance or code of the city, the more
specific provision shall prevail. In the event any provision of this section is
found to be invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain effective and valid.

('84 Code, § 2-3)
§ 30.02 MAYOR TO BE THE EXECUTIVE HEAD; DUTIES.
   Subject to the provisions of the Charter, the Mayor shall be chief executive

(Ord. O-2000-20, passed 4-18-00)
§ 30.08 ELECTRONIC MEDIA.
   The proliferation of forms of electronic media including email, social
media, web sites, etc. has resulted in an explosion in the sources and forms of
communication available regarding the City of Monroe. While elected and public
officials are perceived by the public to comment officially on behalf of the
city, they also have personal rights guaranteed as citizens by the U.S.
Constitution including the First Amendment right of freedom of speech. The
proliferation in the sources and forms of communications often result in
confusion by the citizens of the City of Monroe as to what constitutes official
statements, public notice, and official positions of the city versus personal
opinions of city elected and public officials. The purpose of this section is
to identify what are official communications regarding the city, what
communications are expressly authorized by City Council, and what
communications are personal opinions or statements of elected or public
officials. It is the intent of the Monroe City Council, through this section,
to allow open dialogue in all forms and content of communications between the
city, its elected officials, and city staff while, at the same time, protecting
the First Amendment rights of all individuals including city elected officials
and city staff. It is also the intent of this section to clearly identify what
sources of electronic media communications are official communications with
actual authority to provide official statements, notices, positions, and
policies of the City of Monroe.
   (A)   Authorized electronic media. The City of Monroe shall maintain
official City of Monroe electronic media sites and accounts including but not
limited to web sites, social media sites and accounts, and email addresses
which shall be clearly identified as sites with expressed authority to make
official communications on behalf of the City of Monroe. Such authorized
electronic media sites include the following:
      (1)   Official City of Monroe web site and social media sites;
      (2)   Official City of Monroe Departmental web sites and social media
sites and accounts within the subject matter of each city department;
      (3)   Each email address assigned to a City of Monroe employee but only
for matters within the individual employee's duties. Any electronic media
communication on a departmental site or contained in a city employee's email
that is outside the subject matter of a department or outside the scope of an
individual employee's duties are not authorized communications on behalf of the
city or viewpoints of the city.
   (B)   Unauthorized electronic media. All web sites, social media sites,
emails or other forms of electronic media of an elected official, including
Mayor and City Council members, city staff, or other city public official,
other than the authorized electronic media identified above, are personal only
and are not officially authorized communications on behalf of the City of
Monroe. Such unofficial electronic media sites shall be clearly identified as
personal sites and not officially authorized to communicate or express
viewpoints on behalf of the city. The sites of elected officials, including the
Mayor and City Council members shall clearly post and maintain the following
language: "This site or email is the personal site or email of [name and
office], and the content or views expressed herein are strictly my own and not
the views of the City of Monroe."
   (C)   City seal, logos, address. No person or entity may use or attach the
city seal or a city logo to any electronic media. In addition, no city email
addresses, city web site links, mailing addresses, or telephone numbers may be
used, attached, or associated with any electronic media except as used for
official business of the City of Monroe. City Council members, including the
Mayor, are authorized to display their title and city logos on their personal
social media accounts and email provided the social media account or email
contain the disclaimer set out in division (B) above.

compensation and opportunity for training and advancement, including upgrading
and promotion, without regard to age, sex, race, color, religion, national
origin, non-job related disability, political affiliation, or marital status.
Applicants with physical disabilities shall be given equal consideration with
other applicants for positions in which their physical disabilities do not
represent an unreasonable barrier to satisfactory performance of duties.
   (B)   All personnel responsible for recruitment and employment will continue
to review regularly the implementation of this personnel policy and relevant
practices to assure that equal employment opportunity based on reasonable, job-
related job requirements is being actively observed to the end that no employee

affiliation, or marital status. Notices with regard to equal employment matters

selection of a particular candidate.

sitting Mayor or members of City Council at the time of the initial employment

add an additional qualification for candidacy for office. Further, no sitting
Council member shall directly or indirectly influence or attempt to influence
any employment decision including but not limited to promotions, demotions, pay
or benefit increases, reprimand or other personnel action on behalf of an
immediate family member. IMMEDIATE FAMILY is defined as spouse, mother, father,

   For purposes of this ordinance, the following words shall have the following
meanings:
   ALARM USER PERMIT. A permit issued by the city to a user allowing the
operation of an alarm system within the city.
   ALARM SYSTEM. Any mechanical or electrical device which is designed for the
detection of an unauthorized entry into a building, structure, facility, or for
alerting others of a medical emergency situation, of the commission of a
robbery within a building or other structure, or of other hazardous situations;
and which emits a sound or transmits a signal or message when activated which
causes automatic signal tranmission to be made directly or indirectly to the
Police Department. For the purposes of this definition, an "Alarm System" shall
not include:
   (1)   A device installed on a motor vehicle;
   (2)   Devices which are not designed or used to register alarms that are
audible, visible, or perceptible outside of the protected building, structure,
or facility.

of police to administer this article.

other entity owning or leasing an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm
system is maintained for the protection of such premises.
   CHIEF OF POLICE. The chief of police of the City of Monroe Police Department

   FALSE ALARM. The activation of an alarm system with the transmission of an
alarm signal through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper
installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his employee or agents,
unless law enforcement response is cancelled by the alarm user or his agent
before police personnel arrive at the alarm location. A false alarm shall not
include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or
activated by unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include other
extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm
user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure
shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and
receives permission from the user's alarm company and the Monroe Police
Department, to test the system.

permit for that system has been revoked pursuant to §
35.25 of this ordinance. The City of Monroe Police Department staff may not
respond to an alarm which has not been permitted or the permit revoked.
   (B)   Application. The permit shall be requested on an application form

of this ordinance, the alarm user shall have sixty (60) days from said
effective date within which to file an application.

response to the alarm was in fact necessary or whether the alarm was a false
alarm.
   (B)   Notification. If the police officer at the scene of the activated
alarm system determines the alarm to be false, the officer shall make a report
of the false alarm. An alarm user shall be notified in writing of each false
alarm determination.

requesting a review in writing to the Monroe Chief of Police within ten days of

§ 35.25 SERVICE CHARGE ASSESSMENT FOR FALSE ALARMS, REVOCATION AND
REINSTATEMENT OF ALARM USER PERMITS.
   (A)   Excessive false alarms. It is hereby found and determined that three
(3) or more false alarms within any permit year is excessive, the cost of which
should not be borne by the public. Also, it is further found that fifty dollars
($50.00) per response in excess of three calls to a false alarm represents a
fair determination of the City's cost in making said response.
   (B)   Service charge.
      (1)   The 3rd through the 5th false alarms within a twelve-month period
will be billed a fifty-dollar ($50.00) service charge per occurrence which
shall be considered a bill owed by the alarm user to the City and may be
collected from the alarm user as a civil debt. Each fifty-dollar ($50.00)
service charge incurred for the 3rd through 5th false alarms at the premises
described in the alarm user's permit shall be paid within thirty (30) days from
the date of mailing of the invoice.
      (2)   The 5th false alarm within a twelve-month period or the failure to
pay any service charge within the time prescribed herein shall result in the
revocation of the alarm user's permit in the following manner:
         (a)   The alarm user shall be given ten (10) days' advance written
notification that the alarm user's permit will be revoked. This written notice
shall set forth the reasons for such revocation.
         (b)   The notice shall specify the specific date of revocation and
that the police department will discontinue responding to alarm signals that
occur at the premises described in the revoked permit after the date of
revocation.
         (c)   An alarm user may appeal a permit revocation in writing to the
Monroe Chief of Police within ten days of the date of notice of revocation.
Revocation of the permit shall continue in effect pending final administrative
resolution of the appeal. Upon receipt of written appeal by the alarm use, the
alarm system coordinator shall schedule and conduct a hearing using the same
procedures set out in §
35.24 of this chapter.
         (d)   Reinstatement of both the permit and eligibility for police
response to alarm signals will be made only upon receipt of any prior unpaid
service charges assessed pursuant to this section plus a reinstatement fee of
fifty dollars ($50.00).
   (C)   Permit year. For the purposes of this section, a permit year is a
twelve-month period beginning on the date of the permit's issuance.
   (D)   The above provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent
police response to information received independently of the alarm system for
which the alarm user permit has been revoked.
   (E)   Any notice required pursuant to this chapter shall be made to the
address on the alarm permit provided by the alarm user.

believe that the appellant committed any of the offenses enumerated in this
section:
         (a)   A determination by a judicial official having jurisdiction over
the offense that forms the basis for the exclusion, that probable cause existed
to arrest the person to whom the initial 90-day notice of exclusion was issued
for violation of any of the offenses enumerated in §

person:
         (a)   Is owner, principal, agent or employee of a place of lawful
employment located in the prostitution-exclusion zone; or
         (b)   Is required to perform employment-related services in the
prostitution- exclusion zone.
      (5)   Social services variance. The Chief of Police, or designee, shall
grant a social services variance to an excluded person. A social services
variance allows travel within the prostitution-exclusion zone in accordance
with the terms of the variance if the excluded person:
         (a)   Is in need of social services in the prostitution-exclusion
zone;
         (b)   The social services are sought for reasons relating to the
health or well-being of the excluded person; and

prohibiting the unlawful use and sale of controlled substances by their
clients.
      (6)   Educational variance.
         (a)   The Chief of Police, or designee, shall grant an educational
variance to an excluded person. An educational variance allows travel within

within the prostitution-exclusion zone; or
            2.   To attend school at an educational facility located within the
prostitution- exclusion zone.
         (b)   The Chief of Police, or designee, may grant an educational
variance to an excluded person to allow travel within the prostitution-
exclusion zone in accordance with the terms of the variance if the excluded
person will be enrolled at an educational facility within the prostitution-
exclusion zone if the variance is granted.
   (D)   Revocation or amendment of variances. Variances may be revoked or
amended in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   A variance may be revoked or amended for the following reasons:
         (a)   The excluded person provided false information in order to
obtain the variance;
         (b)   There is probable cause to believe the person has committed any
of the offenses enumerated in §
35.52(A) in the prostitution-exclusion zone subsequent to the issuance of the
variance;
         (c)   If the circumstances giving rise to the issuance of the variance
no longer supports a continuation of the variance or a term thereof; or
         (d)   If the person has new circumstances that would support amending
the variance.
      (2)   Residential variance exception:
         (a)   A residential variance may be revoked only if the applicant
provided false residential information in order to obtain the variance; or
         (b)   If the circumstances giving rise to the issuance of the variance
no longer support the continuation of the variance.
   (E)   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any term of any
variance issued pursuant this section.
   (F)   It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to carry a variance on his
person or to present a variance to a Monroe Police officer or other law

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the City
of Monroe, hereafter referred to as the city, and enables the city to comply
with all applicable state and federal laws including the Clean Water Act (33
United States Code § 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40
CFR, Part 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into any waters of the State or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludges
from the municipal system;
      (4)   To protect both municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage,
sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting
the general public;
      (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation,
maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and
      (6)   To ensure the municipality complies with its NPDES or Non-discharge
Permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other Federal
or State laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the issuance of
permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein. This chapter shall apply to all users of the municipal wastewater
system, as authorized by G.S. § 160A-312 and/or § 153A-275.
   (D)   Except as otherwise provided herein, the Publicly Owned Treatment
Works or POTW Director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions
of this chapter. Any powers granted to or imposed upon the POTW Director may be
delegated by the POTW Director to other city personnel. By discharging
wastewater into the municipal wastewater system, industrial users located
outside the city limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions
established in this chapter, as well as any permits, enforcement actions, or
orders issued hereunder.

SANITARY SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS
§ 52.010 REQUIRED SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Any person owning a building which is used for habitation or occupancy
within the corporate limits, which is accessible to a public sanitary sewer
main, shall connect to the public sewer main, except when the existing building
is already connected to a septic tank which is functioning without the need for
repair in accordance with the requirements of the county health department. For
the purpose of this section, ACCESSIBLE is defined as follows:
      (1)   The public sewer main is either on the lot or abutting any portion
of the lot within a public right-of-way; and
      (2)   The closest distance of the public sewer main to any portion of the
building is 200 feet or less.
   (B)   A sewer connection for service to a building shall be made by the
POTW, or as authorized by the POTW Director, at the expense of the owner/user.
The extension, repair, or replacement of the building sewer from the sewer
connection to the building shall be made under an approved building code permit
in accordance with all applicable codes and at the expense of the owner or
user. The maximum allowable infiltration for a building sewer is 100 gallons
per day/inch-diameter/mile. The POTW may require repairs or replacement of an
existing building sewer in order to meet the same infiltration allowance
requirements as specified for new building sewers and connections.
   (C)   Where no sanitary sewer main is accessible, a property owner or
developer may propose the extension of new sewer mains to serve property which
would then be connected to the existing POTW. Such extensions of public mains
shall be provided in accordance with the city Water and Sewer Extension Policy
as adopted by the City Council and shall meet the applicable technical
requirements of Title 15A: 02H .0200 of the North Carolina Administrative Code,
City of Monroe Sanitary Sewer Design Standards, and City of Monroe Standard
Specifications for Sanitary Sewers.
   (D)   Where no sanitary sewer main is accessible, a septic tank may be
installed, after obtaining all applicable permits. Septic tank installation
shall be in accordance with the standards and requirements of the State
Department of Health, applicable county health regulations, and all building
and plumbing codes.
   (E)   Separate and independent sewer connections shall be provided for every
building with the below exceptions:
      (1)   Where one building stands at the rear of another on the same land
parcel, and no reasonable access to a sewer main is available to the rear
building except under the front building, the building sewer from the front
building may be extended to the rear building and be considered as one building
sewer to one sewer connection so long as all applicable codes are met, and with
the prior approval of the POTW Director.
      (2)   Multiple buildings under single ownership on a single property may
be connected to a private sewer main to which individual building sewers are
connected when approved by the POTW Director in accordance with the city's
Water and Sewer Extension Policy, provided that all permits required by the
N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources are obtained and complied
with. Separate buildings on separate properties found to be connected to the
same service connection may at the discretion of the POTW Director be ordered
to install separate building connections at the owner's expense.
   (F)   An old sewer connection or building sewer may be used to serve a new

GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS
§ 52.020 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   (A)   General Prohibitions. No user shall contribute or cause to be
contributed into the POTW, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater
which causes interference or pass through. These general prohibitions apply to
all users of a POTW whether or not the user is a significant industrial user or
subject to any National, State, or local pretreatment standards or
requirements.
   (B)   Specific Prohibitions. No user shall contribute or cause to be
contributed into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
      (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of
less than 140°F (60°C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
      (2)   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction
of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference (but in no case solids
greater than one-half inch in any dimension).
      (3)   Petroleum fuel or oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through, or
in any amounts discharged from storage or containment areas which are separate
from process use.
      (4)   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 12.0, or
wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage to the
POTW or equipment.
      (5)   Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen-demanding
pollutants, (BOD, etc) in sufficient quantity, (flow or concentration) either
singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to cause interference with the
POTW.
      (6)   Any wastewater having a temperature greater than 150°F (66°C) or
which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in
interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the
introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104°F (40°C).
      (7)   Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems.

      (9)   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to
prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
      (10)   Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case,
shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal regulations or permits issued under Section 405 of
the Act; the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances
Control Act, or State criteria applicable to the sludge management method being
used.
      (11)   Any wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, including, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions, which consequently imparts sufficient color to the treatment
plant's effluent thereby violating the POTW's NPDES permit. Color (in
combination with turbidity) shall not cause the treatment plant effluent to
render the waters injurious to public health or secondary recreation or to
aquatic life and wildlife or to adversely affect the palatability of fish or
aesthetic quality or impair the receiving waters for any designated uses.
      (12)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes
except as specifically approved by the POTW Director in compliance with
applicable State or Federal regulations.

meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the
system) be more than 5% nor any single reading over 10% of the lower explosive
limit (LEL) of the meter.
   (C)   Pollutants, substances, wastewater, or other wastes prohibited by this
section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be
discharged to the municipal wastewater system. All floor drains located in
process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's
pretreatment facility before connecting with the system.
   (D)   When the POTW Director determines that a user(s) is contributing to
the POTW, any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts which may
cause or contribute to interference of POTW operation or pass through, the POTW
Director shall:

§ 52.026 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this chapter and wastewater permits issued under §
52.051 and shall achieve compliance with all National categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
52.020 of this chapter within the time limitations as specified by the EPA, the
State, or the POTW Director whichever is more stringent. Any facilities
necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be
approved by the POTW Director before construction of the facility. The review
of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from
the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall
be reported to and be acceptable by the POTW Director prior to the user's
initiation of the changes.
   (B)   Additional Pretreatment Measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the POTW Director may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The POTW Director may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   The POTW Director may require grease, oil, and/or grit interceptors
to be installed when required under subdivision (a) below, or when they are
necessary for compliance with oil and grease limits under §
52.022(A) of this chapter or to prevent grit from entering the sewer system in
quantities which require regular maintenance, or potentially cause reduction in
sewer pipe capacity or blockages; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and
capacity approved by the POTW Director and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be cleaned, and
repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at the user's expense.
         (a)   Users operating commercial food preparation, processing, or
serving facilities shall install and maintain at the user's expense an approved
oil and grease interceptor through which the wastewater from this area of the
facility shall pass before being discharged to the public sewer. Such
interceptor shall be constructed in accordance with city standard details or in
accordance with a submitted design by a professional engineer who certifies to
the city under professional seal that the design will achieve oil and grease
removals required by the city's ordinance at specified maximum operating
conditions of the user with proper and specified operation and maintenance. Oil
and grease interceptors for commercial food facilities shall be serviced and
emptied of their waste content as often as required to prevent release of any
oil and grease initially contained by the interceptor, and such wastes removed
by the emptying of the interceptor shall not be discharged to the public sewer.
The user shall maintain a written record for three years of history of each
date that the interceptor is serviced along with the quantity of waste removed,
and the waste hauler performing the service. The user shall also post
information regarding best management practices for keeping oil and grease from
entering the city system and train employees to comply with such practices.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

   (A)   The POTW Director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial
user needs a plan or other action to control and prevent slug discharges and
accidental discharges as defined in §
52.002 Slug Load or Discharge. All SIUs must be evaluated within one year of
being designated an SIU. The POTW Director may require any user to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan or other specific action.
Alternatively, the POTW Director may develop such a plan for any user.
   (B)   All SIUs are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at
its facility affecting the potential for spills and other accidental discharge,
discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge,
or a slug load. Also see §§
52.064 and
52.065.
   (C)   An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum,
the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW Director of any
accidental or slug discharges, as required by §
52.065; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impacts from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency

   (A)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (B)   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as
required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary
to be representative of the user’s discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for
additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90-day compliance
reports. Additionally, the POTW Director may allow collection of multiple grabs
during a 24-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under
40 CFR 136.
   (C)   Composite Samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected
with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a
discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow
proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Director. When
authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be
representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 52.080 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The city requires the user to provide and operate at the user’s own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the city.

§ 52.081 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The city will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city, approval authority and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval
authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user’s property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city,
approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the city’s,
approval authority’s, or EPA’s access to the user’s premises shall be a
violation of this chapter. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access.

   (A)   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
52.020(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
52.020(B)(2), (3), (5) - (7), and (9) - (23) if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change

its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW Director may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) of
this section.
      (2)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after

ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.120 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of Noncompliance. Whenever the POTW Director finds that
any industrial user has been in noncompliance or is noncompliant with this
chapter, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements
contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may
serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the
noncompliance. Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an explanation for
the noncompliance and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be
submitted to the city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the
discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the notice of noncompliance.
   (B)   Consent Orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to §
52.120(D).
   (C)   Show Cause Hearing.
      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this chapter or is in
noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW Director
determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be
made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §
52.999 nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director under this
section subject to an administrative appeal under §
52.051(I).
   (D)   Administrative Orders. When the POTW Director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter, permits or orders
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may
issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons
in noncompliance to do any of the following:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
the order;
      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation;
      (4)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (E)   Emergency Suspensions.
      (1)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/
or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the POTW Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW Director
shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon
proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user
shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the
POTW Director prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination Of Permit Or Permission To Discharge.
      (1)   The POTW Director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or
permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the
following reasons:
         (a)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his discharge;
         (b)   Failure to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
         (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring; or,
         (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to
discharge, conditions of this chapter, or any applicable State and Federal
regulations.
      (2)   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to
show cause under §
52.120(C) why the proposed action should not be taken.

§ 56.08 WATER SUPPLY SHORTAGE RATES AND SURCHARGES.
   (A)   During a declared water supply shortage it shall be necessary to
impose temporary water rate increases to ensure adequate operating revenue and
to encourage conservation. The following table shows the magnitude of rate
increase to be imposed, above the prevailing fee schedule, for the volumetric
usage charge per 1,000 gallons. This shall apply to all customer classes.
Monthly customer charges shall not be increased by these percentages. Increases
shall be prorated over the billing period based on the effective date of the
water shortage declaration.
 
Water Shortage Stage % Increase
Stage 1              None
Stage 2 and 2A      5%
Stage 3              15%
Stage 4              30%
Stage 5              50%
   (B)   During a declared water supply shortage it shall also be necessary to
impose additional fees for excessive water use. For residential accounts the
allowable use shall be based on a fixed monthly allowable volume as shown
below. For residential accounts having both a domestic and irrigation metered
service, allowable use shall be based on the consumption for both meters. Fines
for unauthorized taking of water as defined in
Chapter 53 of this Code, shall be doubled during any declared water shortage.
For non-residential accounts, allowable use shall be based on a required
percentage reduction from their average usage during the most recent 12 months
in which no water shortage declaration was in effect. For example, a 10%
reduction will result in an allowable use of 90% of previously demonstrated
usage from the previous 12-month period. If no meter readings are available for
a customer's billing period, an average of similar users will be established
for the customer by the Water Resources Director. Such customers shall include
governmental, commercial, industrial, institutional, public, multi-family, and
all other such users. The following table shows the allowable usage quantities
and the excessive usage charge.
 
Water Shortage Stage Allowable Use Quantity Excessive Use Fee
                     Residential Commercial (Per 1,000 Gallons)
Stage 1              N/A         N/A        None
Stage 2 and 2A      N/A         N/A        None
Stage 3              6,000 Gal   90%        5 Times Existing Rate
Stage 4              5,000 Gal   75%        5 Times Existing Rate
Stage 5              4,000 Gal   50%        10 Times Existing Rate
   (C)   It is the primary responsibility of each non-residential customer to
meet its mandated water use reduction by utilizing whatever means necessary,
including limitation of operating hours, days, etc. Each customer shall provide
access to City personnel for the purpose of meter reading and monitoring
compliance with this ordinance. If the mandated reduction in water use cannot
be obtained without threatening health or safety, or if there has been a
significant change in the customer's circumstances, the customer may apply to
the City Manager or his or her designee, for a variance to this mandate.

   (C)    Accumulation of violations. Violations shall be accumulated by all
customers so long as this ordinance, in any of its Stages, is continuously in
effect and until no Stage of this ordinance has been in effect for a period of
one calendar year. Violations of any of the mandatory restrictions of any Stage
shall accumulate with violations of other Stages. Should a customer move, or
cease and renew service, during the period described herein, the customer's
violations shall continue to accumulate as if such move or cessation had not
occurred.
   (D)   Civil penalties for excessive water use. Excessive use water rates
imposed upon users by Stages 3, 4 and 5 constitute the sole monetary penalty
for such excessive use. Other violations by such users shall be subject to the
civil penalties and other enforcement measures set out herein. Other
enforcement procedures shall apply to such users for excessive use and other
violations.

person who violates the provisions of this chapter, the rules or orders adopted
or issued pursuant hereto, or the terms, conditions or provisions of a permit
issued under the authority of this chapter. A stop work order may be enforced
by any of the means provided by the section.
   (C)   The Water Resources Director may assess a civil penalty of not more
than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) against any person who is
required but fails to apply for or to secure a permit or who violates or fails
to act in accordance with the terms, conditions, or requirements of a permit,
or otherwise violates this chapter. If any action or failure to act for which a
penalty may be assessed under this chapter is continuous, the Water Resources
Director may assess a penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000.00) per day for so long as the violation continues. Penalties up to
the maximum authorized may be based on any one of or a combination of the
following factors:
      (1)   The degree and extent of harm to the natural resources of the
state, to the public health, or to private property resulting from the
violation;
      (2)   The duration and gravity of the violation;
      (3)   The effect on ground or surface water quantity or on air quality;

   The Water Resources Director shall serve each person assessed a civil
penalty with a notice of the assessment and the specific reasons therefore by
registered or certified mail, or by any means authorized by G.S. IA-1, Rule 4.
The penalty shall be due thirty-five (35) days after the date of the notice.
   (D)   Consistent with the limitations in subsection (C), requests to remit a
civil penalty may be resolved by the City Manager. Requests for remission of
civil penalties shall be served on the Water Resources Director. Remission
requests shall not be considered unless served within thirty (30) days of the
date of service of the notice of assessment of civil penalty. Remission
requests must be accompanied by a waiver of the right to an administrative
review hearing of the penalty and a stipulation of the facts on which the
assessment was based. In determining whether a remission request will be
approved, the City Manager shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   Whether one or more of the civil penalty assessment factors in
subsection (C) was wrongly applied to the detriment of the petitioner;
      (2)   Whether the violator promptly abated continuing environmental
damage resulting from the violation;
      (3)   Whether the violation was inadvertent or a result of an accident;
      (4)   Whether the violator had been assessed civil penalties for any
previous violations; or

remaining necessary remedial actions.
   The City Manager may remit the entire amount of the penalty only when
neither the commission nor any other entity, in its capacity of administering a
general permit program pursuant to G.S. § 143-215.1(1), has assessed the
violator a civil penalty for a previous violation, and when payment of the
civil penalty will prevent payment for the remaining necessary remedial
actions.
   (E)   The City Manager is authorized to seek equitable relief, including
injunctive relief, to prevent violations of the terms of a permit or of this
chapter. The City Manager is authorized to commence civil actions to collect
civil penalties or to seek equitable relief in any appropriate division of the
general courtof justice in any appropriate county. To the extent allowed by
law, the procedures and remedies of civil penalties and actions, including
equitable relief, may be used in combination or singly. The City Manager shall
not commence a civil action to collect a civil penalty until the administrative
review has been completed or the time period for requesting administrative
review has past with no request.
   (F)   Pursuant to N.C. G.S. § 160A-175 and in addition to other remedies
provided by law, violations of this ordinance shall be subject to criminal
sanctions as set out in Chapter 10 §
10.99(A) of the Monroe Code of Ordinances.
   (G)   The Water Resources Director or a local health director shall have the

57.04(C). Any person entitled to administrative review pursuant to this
subsection shall serve a demand for administrative review to the Water
Resources Director within thirty (30) days of the date of service of the notice
of the action complained of, or the administrative review shall be deemed
waived. The following information must be included in the demand, or the
administrative review shall be deemed waived.
      (1)   For the administrative review to consider the denial of a permit,
the applicant must identify separately each reason for denying the permit that
the applicant contends to be improper and every basis for such contention.
      (2)   For the administrative review to consider a permit granted subject
to unacceptable conditions, the applicant must identify separately each
unacceptable condition and every basis for such contention.
      (3)   For the administrative review to consider the modification or
revocation of a permit, the permittee must state separately each reason for
modifying or revoking the permit that the permittee contends to be improper and
every basis for such contention.
      (4)   For the administrative review to consider a civil penalty
assessment, the person to whom such penalty was assessed must state separately
each reason why such penalty should not be assessed, or if the person contends
that the civil penalty was assessed in an improper amount, each reason why the
amount of the penalty is improper.
   The person seeking review shall be deemed to have waived the right to raise
any reason, basis, or allegedly improper condition that is required to be
stated in the demand for review unless it is specified in the demand.
   (B)   The administrative review shall include a hearing conducted by the
City Manager or some other unbiased person designated by the City Manager ("the
hearing officer"). The person seeking review may appear personally and through
representatives and may arrange for person with pertinent knowledge to provide
information to the hearing officer. The hearing shall be held and a decision

written demand for administrative review. If the hearing is to consider the
suspension, modification, or revocation of a permit, the hearing officer shall
attempt to hold the hearing and issue a decision within thirty (30) days of the
receipt of the written demand for a hearing. The hearing officer may affirm,
reverse, or modify the action appealed from and shall serve notice of the
decision on the person who sought the administrative review and if said person
is dissatisfied with the decision and desires to preserve the right to judicial
review, then such person mustserve the hearing officer within ten (10) days of
the date of the decision with a "notice of dissatisfaction and request for
findings". Within fifteen (15) days of the service of said notice of
dissatisfaction, the hearing officer shall prepare and shall serve on said
person, findings with respect to the decision. The hearing officer's decision,
including findings, if any, shall constitute the final decision of the City for
purposes of administrative review.
   (C)   The hearing officer may, and, if requested by the person seeking
review, shall provide for any part of the hearing to be recorded. The hearing
officer may select audio, video, or writing as the means of recording. A
transcript of any hearing, or part thereof, which is recorded, need not be
prepared unless requested. If the person seeking review requests that a
transcript be prepared, the City Manager shall arrange for the preparation, and
the person seeking review shall bear the preparation cost. If a transcript is
prepared, a licensed court reporter shall prepare the transcript, unless all
parties and the City Manager agree otherwise. The City Manager shall require
the person seeking review to post an advance deposit sufficient to defray said
cost. If the person seeks judicial review pursuant to subsection (D), said
person shall provide the original transcript to the City Manager at no cost to
the City.
   (D)   Any person who had a right to administrative review pursuant to
subsection (A) may petition for judicial review, if and only if, such person
exhausted administrative review, including giving a "notice of dissatisfaction
and request for findings."
   For purposes of the right to petition for judicial review, making a
remission request pursuant to §
57.04(C) shall not be considered part of administrative review. If the person
made a request for remission of a civil penalty there shall be no judicial
review of the civil penalty. Judicial review shall be obtained by filing a
written petition within thirty (30) days after the service of the hearing
officer's findings regarding the action complained of, but not thereafter, with
the Superior Court of Union County. The petition shall specifically, and with
particularity, state the grounds for claiming that the decision of the hearing
officer is contrary to law. If not previously requested, said person shall
request in writing, at or before the date of filing the petition with the
Superior Court that a transcript be prepared for every part of the
administrative hearing that was recorded. A copy of the petition shall be
served on the City in the manner required by law. Within thirty (30) days after
service of a copy of the petition upon the City, or such other time as may be
ordered by the court, the City shall prepare and transmit to the court either
the original or a certified copy of the official record of the hearing as
hereinafter set forth. Unless the City Manager and the persons seeking judicial
review agree otherwise, the official record of the administrative hearing shall
include:
      (1)   The documents presented by the petitioner at the administrative
hearing;
      (2)   The documents considered by the hearing officer in reaching the
decision complained of;
      (3)   The decision and findings of the hearing officer; and
      (4)   The transcript of each part of the hearing that was recorded, if
available at the time the remaining portion of the official record is
transmitted to the court. If the transcript is not available at that time, it
shall be transmitted to the court as soon as reasonably possible after the
transcript has been prepared.
   Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the judicial review shall be
limited to contentions properly raised in the administrative review. The City
Manager shall have the authority to settle and compromise, on behalf of the
City, any of said proceedings filed in the Superior Court.

§ 58.01 TITLE.
   This Ordinance shall be known as "The Stormwater Utility Ordinance,"
hereinafter as "Ordinance," and may be so cited.
(Ord. O-2008-46, passed 11-18-08)
§ 58.02 AUTHORITY, PURPOSE, JURISDICTION.
   (A)   Authority. Pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 16, the City of
Monroe is authorized to create a stormwater utility and enterprise fund and in
so doing establish a schedule of rents, rates, fees, charges, and penalties for
the use of or the services furnished by such public enterprise.
   (B)   Purpose.  It is the purpose of this section to establish a stormwater
utility as an identified fiscal and accounting fund for the purpose of
comprehensively addressing the stormwater management needs of the city through
a program designed to improve, maintain, operate and repair stormwater
conveyance systems and to protect and manage water quality and quantity by
controlling the level of pollutants in stormwater runoff, and the quantity and
rate of stormwater received and conveyed by structural and natural stormwater
and drainage systems of all types. It provides a schedule of rents, rates,
fees, charges and penalties necessary to assure that all aspects of the
stormwater program are managed in accordance with Federal, State and Local
laws, rules, and regulations.
   (C)   Jurisdiction. The boundaries and jurisdiction of the stormwater
utility shall extend to the corporate limits of the City, including all areas
hereafter annexed thereto.
(Ord. O-2008-46, passed 11-18-08)
§ 58.03 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Stormwater poses a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare
because if unmanaged, it floods properties, erodes watercourses and channels,
and pollutes streams and rivers.
   (B)   By mapping, planning, constructing, operating, cleaning, regulating
and maintaining the natural and constructed stormwater management system, the
City reduces the adverse effects of stormwater and improves the quality of
groundwater, streams, rivers, and lakes in and around the City.
   (C)   Providing a stable source of funding for stormwater services, as
hereafter defined, can best be accomplished through stormwater management
utility funds. Such a utility will benefit owners and occupants of developed
land in the City and Monroe citizens.
   (D)   The amount of impervious surface on a property is the single most

(Ord. O-2008-46, passed 11-18-08)
§ 58.06 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   All developed land in the City, whether public or private, shall be
subject to a stormwater management service charge. Exemptions shall not be
allowed based on age, tax exemption, or other status of an individual or
organization. Stormwater management service charges may be subject to a credit
reduction in charges as further provided herein.
   (B)   Stormwater management service charges on developed land shall be based
on a schedule of rates, charges, tiers, and late fees fixed and established
from time to time by the City Council and maintained on file in the offices of
the Finance Director and Director of Engineering. Stormwater management service
charges will be determined and modified from time to time by the City Council,
so that the total revenues generated by said charges will be used to pay the
principal and the interest on the debt incurred for stormwater purposes, and
such expenses as are reasonably necessary for providing stormwater services
within the City of Monroe.
   (C)   Computation of stormwater management service charges.
      (1)   For single-family developed residential land, the monthly
stormwater management service charges shall be based on the median amount of
impervious surface on a single-family residential lot in the city, which is
known as an ERU. There shall be a tier system for single-family developed
properties, based on the amount of impervious surface of single-family
properties, as set forth in the City of Monroe fee schedule.
      (2)   For other residential developed land, including townhouses,
apartments, condominiums, and other multiunit residential development, the
monthly stormwater management service charges shall be as set forth in the City
of Monroe fee schedule for other residential unit.
      (3)   For nonresidential land, the monthly stormwater management service
charges on developed land is calculated by dividing the total impervious
surface area of the property divided by one (1) ERU, rounded to the nearest
tenth, multiplied by the established monthly single-family equivalent unit rate
as fixed by City Council.
      (4)   For developments with common property, containing impervious
surfaces, such as townhouse developments, cluster unit developments, or
condominiums, each dwelling unit shall be responsible for its equal pro rata
share of the total impervious surfaces area of the common areas of the
development not served by City of Monroe water or sewer or both unless other
arrangements are made pursuant to §
58.07(D).
   (D)   The following exemptions from stormwater management service charges
are allowed:
      (1)   Undeveloped land.
      (2)   Improved public transportation ways, including public streets,
roads, greenways and trails, airport runways, and internal roads within public
facilities, which have been conveyed to the North Carolina Department of
Transportation or City of Monroe and which are used by the general public for
motor vehicle transportation, and private streets constructed in accordance
with the City of Monroe Code of Ordinances and the City of Monroe Standard
Specifications and Detail Manual.
      (3)   Railroad tracks. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings
or other developed land shall not be exempted from stormwater management
service charges.
      (4)   Developed land with less than four hundred (400) total square feet
of impervious surface area per individual lot.
(Ord. O-2008-46, passed 11-18-08)
§ 58.07 BILLING METHOD, RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.
   (A)   Bills for stormwater management service shall be sent at regular
periodic intervals. Stormwater management service charges may be billed on a
combined utility bill that also contains charges for electric, gas, water and
sewer service and/or solid/waste management service.
   (B)   Stormwater management service charges for a property that receives
water, sewer service or combined sewer and water service will be sent to the
customer receiving such service. However, where multiple water and sewer
accounts exist for a single parcel, the bill for stormwater management service
charges may for good cause shown at the discretion of the City be sent to the
property owner.
   (C)   In cases where a master meter is used for water service to a property
with multiple tenants, Owners of the property may, with the consent of the
City, designate each occupant of the property as the party to receive the bill
for stormwater management service charges by completing and properly executing
a form provided by the City. Such designation shall fairly allocate the
impervious surfaces actually used by the billed party, and it shall be binding
for the period of time specified by the City. No occupant may be designated as
the party to receive the bill for stormwater management service charge unless
the occupant is also receiving a utility bill for another city service such as
electric, gas and or solid/waste. The applicant shall provide notice of the
application to each effected utility customer. The City shall approve the per
account billing for the parcel unless the billing plan:
      (1)   Will result in a charge of less than one (1) ERU for one or more
accounts, and/or
      (2)   Does not equitably allocate the fee between accounts.
      Such transfer does not relieve either the owner or occupant from
liability for stormwater management service charges if they are not paid by the
party billed. The approval of per account billing pursuant to this subsection
does not relieve the owner from liability for stormwater management service
fees if they are not paid by the party billed. The property owner is ultimately
responsible for payment of the stormwater management service charge for
property for which the party billed has not paid the stormwater management
service charge.
   (D)   All other aspects of billing shall be handled as set forth in the City
Council adopted Customer Service Policy unless specifically described in this
section, or the section immediately following.
(Ord. O-2008-46, passed 11-18-08)
§ 58.08 PAYMENT PROVISION; UTILITY TERMINATION.
   (A)   Where stormwater management service charges appear on a combined
utility bill or a master summary bill, and a customer does not pay the service
charges for all the utilities on the bill, the partial payment will be applied
to the respective service charges in the following order: delinquent stormwater
management service charges and then to all other City utility service.
   (B)   Stormwater management service charges are due at the collection office
in City Hall within the time period stated on the bill. Bills not paid within
this time shall be charged a late fee as set forth in the adopted fee schedule.
   (C)   In the event that the stormwater management service charges and
delinquent fee are not paid on or before the final due date, city utility
services shall be discontinued on the order established in the City Customer
Service Policy adopted by the City Council.
   (D)   Customers with complaints about the accuracy of stormwater management
service charges are entitled to a review as provided in §
58.11. No charge will be retroactively adjusted to resolve customer complaints
for a period of more than one year prior to the date the City received the
complaint. Any bill charges requiring adjustment must be applied through the
utility billing system.
   (E)   If property is under-billed, or not billed, or a bill is sent to the
wrong party, the City may back bill up to a one-year period.
(Ord. O-2008-46, passed 11-18-08)
§ 58.09 ADJUSTMENT AND CREDIT APPLICABLE TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE
CHARGE.
   (A)   Adjustment due to error or oversight. Request for adjustment of the
stormwater service charge shall be submitted to the City in accordance with the
policy adopted by City Council. Adjustments can also be made by the City should
the City identify an error or oversight as long as the City notifies the
customer in advance of the adjustment. Adjustments may be requested for errors
or omissions on the customer's stormwater service charge. All requests shall be
judged on the basis of the number of dwelling units or amount of impervious
area on the property.
   (B)   Credits.
      (1)   The City may provide a system of credits to reduce stormwater
management service charges for properties on which stormwater control measures
substantially mitigates the peak discharge or runoff pollution flowing from
such properties or substantially decreases the City's cost of maintaining the
stormwater management system. The Engineering Department will develop written
policies to implement the credit system. No credit will be authorized until the
City Council approves written policies to implement the system of credits; a
copy of the approved policies shall be on file with the Engineering Department.
The City's policies may make credits retroactive to the date stormwater
management service charges were initiated. Any bill charges requiring
adjustments must be applied through the utility billing system but no credit
will be granted for more than one (1) past year. Credits cannot exceed the
stormwater utility charge for the customer. Nothing shall prevent the City
Council from modifying the adopted system of credits, and such modifications
may apply to holders of existing credits.
      (2)   Each credit allowed against the stormwater management service
charge is conditioned on the continuing operation and functioning of the
stormwater control measure as designed; credited stormwater control measures
must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, and credits
may be rescinded for noncompliance with these standards.
      (3)   Each credit for which a customer applies shall be subject to review
and approval by the Director of Engineering or his designee. The Director of
Engineering may approve or reject any application for a credit in whole or in
part.
      (4)   Credits shall only be applied to developed lands containing the
credited stormwater control measure. For developments with common property
containing credited stormwater control measures such as townhouse developments,
cluster unit developments, or condominiums, each dwelling unit shall be
eligible for its equal pro rata share of the credit unless other arrangements
for billing the stormwater management service charge are made pursuant to §
58.07(E).
(Ord. O-2008-46, passed 11-18-08)
§ 58.10 RESERVED.
§ 58.11 APPEALS.
   Any customer who believes the provisions of this chapter have been applied
in error may appeal in the following manner:
   (A)   An appeal must be filed in writing with the Director of Engineering.
At the discretion of the Director of Engineering, the appeal may be required to
include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor and such other
information that show the total property area, the impervious surface area, and
any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the
property to the stormwater events.
   (B)   Using the information provided, the Director of Engineering shall
conduct a technical review pursuant to good engineering practices. The Director
of Engineering may adjust the stormwater service management charge so long as
the adjustment is in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this
chapter. The Director of Engineering may take the appeal to the Environment and
Water Resources Committee for their review and/or comment. At the conclusion of
the review, the Director of Engineering shall issue a written determination
stating whether an adjustment to the stormwater management charge is
appropriate, and if so, the percentage of such adjustment. Any approved
adjustments must be communicated in writing to the appropriate utility billing
staff.
   (C)   An appeal may be taken from any decision of the Director of
Engineering which is adverse to the customer by giving notice of appeal to the
Board of Adjustment within thirty (30) days after service of the Director of
Engineering's written decision on the customer. Notice of appeal shall be given
by the customer by delivery of a written statement to the Board of Adjustment
stating the grounds for the appeal and providing the Board of Adjustment with a
copy of the written decision of the Director of Engineering. The Director of
Engineering shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment and the customer all
documents constituting the record upon which the Director of Engineering's
decision was made.
   (D)   All decisions of the Director of Engineering and Board of Adjustment
shall be served on the customer personally or by registered or certified mail.
Mailing shall be based upon the billing address of the customer.
   (E)   When an appeal is from a decision authorizing an adjustment to the
customer's bill, the Director of Engineering's decision shall remain in effect
until and unless reversed or otherwise modified. No adjustment to a customer's
bill shall be made which is for more than the one-year period immediately
preceding the date that the customer's request is first received by the City.

§ 58.12 LIMITATION OF RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   The City shall be responsible only for the portions of the drainage
system which are on city property including city-maintained street rights-of-
way and permanent storm drainage easements conveyed to and accepted by the
city. Repairs and improvements to the drainage system shall be in accordance
with established standards, policies, and schedules.
   (B)   The City's acquisition of storm drainage easements and/or the
construction or repair by the City of stormwater control measures and drainage
facilities does not constitute a warranty against stormwater hazards,
including, but not limited to, flooding, erosion, or standing water.

used and such terms and light shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
      (1)   Green alone or “go.”
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through
or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn.
But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield
the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
      (2)   Yellow alone or “caution” when shown following the green or “go”
signal.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering
the nearest crosswalk at the intersection, but if such stop cannot be made in
safety, a vehicle may be driven cautiously through the intersection.
         (b)   The provisions of division (A)(2)(a) of this section shall not
be construed as a license to a driver of a motor vehicle approaching an
intersection at an unlawful rate of speed to proceed through the intersection.
Any driver of a motor vehicle driving such vehicle at an unlawful rate of speed
at the time of his approach to an intersection shall forfeit all rights to
enter and proceed into and across such intersection under the “caution” signal
as provided.
         (c)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until

the green or “go” is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedes-trian
“walk” signal.

         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
         (b)   No pedestrian facing-such signal shall enter the roadway until
the green or “go” is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian
“walk” signal.
   (B)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking

any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
('84 Code, § 16-16)
§ 70.25 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.

in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the
drivers of all vehicles.

such crosswalk unless and until such entry can be made with safety to other
persons and property as such place.

with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers or operators of vehicles may proceed
through such intersections or past such signal only with caution.

device, sign or signal.
   (B)   No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any

shall be towed only after notice to the registered owner or person entitled to
possession of the vehicle. In the case of a hazardous vehicle or a junked motor
vehicle, if the names and mailing addresses of the registered owner or person
entitled to the possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee, or occupant of
the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be ascertained in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given by first class

the name(s) and address(es) to which mailed, and the date mailed. If such names
and addresses cannot be ascertained or if the vehicle to be removed is an

days after the notice is affixed). The notice shall state that the vehicle will
be removed by the city on a specified date, no sooner than seven days after the

vehicles and junked motor vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if
the registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the
vehicle but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is abandoned,
a hazardous vehicle, or in the case of a junked motor vehicle, that the
aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, such appeal
shall be made to the City Council in writing, heard at the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the City Council, and further proceedings to remove the

      (2)   Other abandoned or hazardous vehicles. With respect to abandoned or
hazardous vehicles left on city-owned property other than the streets and
highways and on private property, such vehicles may be removed without giving
prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing official finds a
special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health,
safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation, such
circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing entrances or exits to
businesses and residences; vehicles parked in such a location or manner as to
pose a traffic hazard; and vehicles causing damage to public or private
property.

GRAFFITI
§ 93.20 GRAFFITI ORDINANCE - PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Monroe City Council is enacting this article to help prevent the spread
of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti
from public and private property. The Council is authorized to enact this
article pursuant to its police powers, in order to promote health, safety and
welfare of its citizens, under the Charter of the City of Monroe and G.S. §
160A-174. The Council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and dangerous to
the public safety and welfare. Graffiti is destructive of the rights and values
of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the City acts to
remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain.
Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods
are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the
detriment of the City and its citizens. The City Council intends, through the
adoption of this ordinance, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect
public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement. The
Council does not intend for this ordinance to conflict with any existing anti-
graffiti federal or state laws and to the extent of any such conflict, the
provisions of the federal or state law shall control.

      (1)   Any person applying graffiti on public or private property shall
remove such graffiti or cause such graffiti to be removed within seventy-two

§ 95.03 OFFENSES.
   Except as provided by §
95.04, the following offenses constitute a violation of this chapter:
   (A)   A juvenile commits an offense by being present in or remaining in any
public place or on the premises of any establishment within the city during the
restricted hours.
   (B)   A parent or guardian of a juvenile commits an offense if he or she
knowingly permits, or by insufficient control, allows the juvenile to remain in
any public place or on the premises of any establishment within the city during
the restricted hours where the exceptions of §
95.04 do not apply. The term “knowingly” include knowledge that a parent should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile in that
parent's legal custody. This requirement is intended to hold neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such juvenile.
   (C)   The owner, operator, or any employee of an establishment commits an
offense if he knowingly allows a juvenile to remain upon the premises of the
establishment during the restricted hours where the exceptions of §
95.04 do not apply. The term “knowingly” includes knowledge that an operator or
employer should reasonably be expected to have concerning the patrons of an
establishment. The standard for “knowingly” shall be applied through an
objective test; whether a reasonable person in the operator's or employee's
position should have known that a patron was a juvenile in violation of this
chapter.
   (D)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person 16 years of age
or older to aid or abet a juvenile in the violation of division (A).
   (E)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for a parent or guardian to
refuse to take custody during the restricted hours of a juvenile for whom the
parent or guardian is responsible.
   (F)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for any juvenile, whether
accompanied by a parent or guardian or not, to engage in Halloween trick-or-
treating activities after the hour of 9:00 p.m.
(Ord. O-1998-22, passed 7-7-98; Am. Ord. O-2004-36, passed 10-5-04)
§ 95.04 EXCEPTIONS.
   A juvenile who is in a public place or establishment during the restricted
hours shall not be in violation of this chapter if the juvenile is:
   (A)   Accompanied by his parent or guardian.
   (B)   Accompanied by an adult 18 years of age or older authorized by the
parent or guardian of such juvenile to take the parent or guardian's place in
accompanying the juvenile for a designated period of time and purpose within a
specified area.
   (C)   On an errand, using a direct route, at the direction of the juvenile's

   (I)   Exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech, and the
right of assembly.
   (J)   Married or emancipated.
   (K)   When authorized, by special permit from the Chief of Public Safety or
his designee carried on the person of the juvenile thus authorized, as follows.
When necessary nighttime activities of a juvenile may be inadequately provided
for by other provisions of this chapter, then recourse may be had to the Chief
of Public Safety, or his designee, either for a regulation as provided in
division (L) or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant. Upon the
findings of reasonable necessity for the use of a public place to the extent
warranted by a written application signed by a juvenile, and by a parent of the
juvenile, if feasible, stating (1) the name, age and address of the juvenile;
(2) the name, address, and telephone number of a parent thereof; (3) the
height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics
of the juvenile; (4) the necessity that requires the juvenile to remain upon a
public place during the restricted hours otherwise applicable; (5) the public
place; and (6) the beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date
and hour, the Chief of Public Safety or his designee may grant a permit in
writing for the juvenile's use if a public place at such hours as in the
opinion of the Chief of Public Safety of his designee may grant a permit in
writing for the juvenile's use of a public place at such hours as in the
opinion of the Chief of Public Safety may reasonably be necessary and
consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
   (L)   When authorized, by regulation issued by the Chief of Public Safety or
his designee in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled
as set forth in division (K) but adapted to reasonably necessary nighttime
activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an individual
special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Chief of Public Safety or
his designee permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in
advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other
agencies such as schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use
of the public places permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more
than one hour beyond the period of termination of this activity, and the reason
for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with
the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. O-1998-22, passed 7-7-98)
§ 95.05 DEFENSE.
   It is a defense to prosecution under §
95.03(C) that the owner, operator, or employee of an establishment promptly
notify the Public Safety Department that a juvenile was present on the premises
of the establishment during the restricted hours and refused to leave.
(Ord. O-1998-22, passed 7-7-98)

Safety Officer shall ask the apparent offender's age and reason for being in
the public place or establishment during the restricted hours.

citation, or make an arrest under this chapter unless the officer reasonably
believes that an offense has occurred and that, based on any response and other
circumstances, no exception or defense in § 95.05 is present.
(Ord. O-1998-22, passed 7-7-98)
§ 95.07 PENALTIES.
   (A)   A juvenile who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
being adjudicated delinquent. The court may, in its discretion, impose any
dispositional alternative(s) that are provided in the North Carolina Juvenile
Code for any juvenile who is delinquent.

chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine not to
exceed $100, and imprisonment at the discretion of the court in accordance with
N.C.G.S. § 1-4.
(Ord. O-1998-22, passed 7-7-98)
§ 95.08 SEVERABILITY.
   In any section, subsection, sentence, term, or exception of the Chapter, or
any application thereof to any person or circumstance is adjudged to be
unconstitutional or invalid, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of
any remaining portion of this chapter or its application to any other person or
circumstance. The City Council does not intend a result through the enforcement
of this chapter that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.
Council intends that the chapter be held inapplicable in such cases, if any,
whether its application would be unconstitutional under the Constitution of the
State of North Carolina or under the Constitution of the United States of
America.

§ 110.01 GENERAL.
   (A)   Definitions. When used in this chapter (unless the context requires a
different meaning):
   BUSINESS. Includes each trade, occupation, profession, business, and
franchise taxed under this chapter.
   PERSON. Includes any individual, trustee, executor, other fiduciary,
corporation, unincorporated association, partnership, sole proprietorship,
company, firm, or other legal entity.
   SEASONAL. A business is SEASONAL in nature when it is conducted for profit
six months out of the year or less.
   (B)   Construction of this chapter. This chapter is enacted for revenue
purposes only. Therefore, it should be construed to require payment of the
maximum tax permitted under its terms. In addition issuance of a license in
accordance with this chapter does not excuse a licensee from compliance with
any other applicable ordinance or statue. This chapter does not prevent the
City Council from imposing license taxes on additional businesses, from
increasing or decreasing the amount of any license tax, or from regulating any
business taxed.
(Ord. O-1998-29, passed 6-16-98)
§ 110.02 LEVY.
   (A)   Levy of tax. An annual privilege license tax is hereby levied on each
business conducted within the City of Monroe.
   (B)   Who must pay tax. Each person who conducts a business within the City
of Monroe is subject to this chapter. A person “conducts business” when he
engages in one act of business taxed under this chapter. He conducts the
business “within the city” if he maintains a business location within the city;
or if either personally or through agents, he (1) solicits business within the
city limits or (2) picks up or delivers goods or services within the city
limits.
   (C)   Period of license: due date.
      (1)   Annual licenses. Unless the section of this chapter levying the
privilege license tax applicable to a particular business provides otherwise, a
license issued in accordance with this chapter is good for the 12-month period
beginning July 1 and ending June 30. The tax is due on July 1 of each year.
However, if a person begins a business after July 1 of a year, the tax for that
year is due before the business is begun.
      (2)   Licenses for periods shorter than one year. If the section of this
chapter levying the privilege license tax applicable to a particular business
so provides, a license may be issued for a period of one day, one week, or some
comparable period of less than a full license year. A person may not commence a
business conducted within the city and taxed under such a provision until the
privilege license tax due is paid and may not continue such a business beyond
the period for which the license is issued.
   (D)   Proration of tax. If a business is begun after January 31 and before
July 1, the amount of tax due is half the amount otherwise due. If a business
is seasonable in nature and if the amount of tax is not based on gross
receipts, the amount of tax due is half the amount otherwise due.
   (E)   Refunds. If for any reason a licensee discontinues his or her business
during the license year, he or she is not entitled to a refund.
   (F)   Separate businesses. A separate license is required and a separate
privilege license tax must be paid for each place of business unless two or
more places of business under common ownership are contiguous to each other,
communicate directly with and open into each other, and are operated as a unit.
In addition, a separate privilege license tax must be paid for each business
taxable under this chapter conducted by the taxpayer at any one location;
however, the tax collector may issue a single license for all taxable business
conducted at one location by a single taxpayer.
   (G)   Official schedule of privilege license taxes. Taxes shall be levied
and collected on any business set out in the official schedule of privilege
license taxes, hereby made a part hereof, which is one file in the city hall.
   (H)   License tax where amount not specifically provided. In any case not
specifically provided for in the chapter, the privilege license tax due and
payable to the city shall be such license tax as may be charged by the city
under any applicable section of state law.
   (I)   Computation of tax based on gross receipts.
      (1)   Whenever this chapter levies a privilege license tax computed on
the basis of gross receipts, “gross receipts” means the amount reported as
gross receipts on a business's state income tax return, or on the federal
income tax return filed with the state income tax return if the state return
does not separately state gross receipts for the most recently completed tax
year.
      (2)   If a business has not been in operation long enough for the
information required in subsection (1) of this division to be available, the
tax collector shall estimate gross receipts for the business on the basis of
gross receipts of comparable businesses, or any other information that the tax
collector considers useful. In the case of any new business, tax shall be as
set out in the official schedule of license taxes.
   Each licensee who paid the tax for the past license year based on estimated
gross receipts shall submit to the tax collector a sworn final report showing
the amount of gross receipts for the license year by May 1. A penalty shall be
due for the late filing of this report as set out in the official schedule of
privilege license taxes which is on file in the city hall. If the amount shown
is more than estimated gross receipts, the licensee shall pay the amount of
additional tax that would have been due had the estimate been accurate. If the
amount shown is less than estimated gross receipts, the city shall refund to
the licensee the difference between the actual tax paid and the amount of tax
that would have been due had the estimate been accurate.
   (J)   Exemptions.
      (1)   Generally, except as otherwise provided in this section or by state
law, no person is exempt from the payment of a privilege license tax levied by
this chapter.
      (2)   Charitable organizations. A person who operates a business for a
religious, educational, civic, patriotic, charitable, or fraternal purpose,
when the entire gross income of the business is used for such a purpose, is
exempt from paying any privilege license tax levied by this chapter.
      (3)   Blind persons and members of the armed forces and merchant marine.
Blind persons and persons who serve in the United States armed forces for the
merchant marine are exempt from paying any privilege license tax levied by this
chapter to the extent provided by G.S. 105-249 and 105-249.1. A license may be
granted without the payment of the requisite license tax to a disabled veteran
for peddling, when such peddling is done on foot and not from any vehicle, or
to such poor and infirm persons as the City Manager may deem worthy of
exemption. In such case, the City Manager shall issue a special order to the
tax collector authorizing such exemption.
      (4)   Must obtain license. A person exempt from paying a privilege
license tax levied by this chapter shall nevertheless obtain a license from the
tax collector. The license shall state that the licensee is exempt from paying
the privilege license tax.
(Ord. O-1998-29, passed 6-16-98)
§ 110.03 LICENSES.
   (A)   Application. A person shall apply to the tax collector for each
license required by this chapter no less than 30 days before the date the tax

      (6)   Any other information the tax collector determines to be necessary
to compute the amount of tax due.
   (B)   Reasons for refusal or revocation of a license. The tax collector

following reasons:
      (1)   The applicants misrepresents a fact relevant to the amount of tax
due or his or her qualifications for a license.
      (2)   The applicant refuses to provide information necessary to compute
the amount of tax due.
   (C)   Unqualified applicants; right to a conference.
      (1)   After receipt of the completed application, if the tax collector

section, the tax collector shall refuse to accept payment of the tax and shall
not issue the license. At the applicant's request, the tax collector shall, in
accordance with division (L) of this section, give the applicant a written
statement of the reason for refusing the license. The applicant may, within ten
days after the day the statement is received, request a conference to discuss
the refusal. In the request the applicant shall specify why the application for
a license should not be refused. The tax collector shall arrange the conference
within a reasonable time.
      (2)   If the tax collector refuses to issue a license, the applicant may
reapply for a license at any time thereafter. If the reason for which the
application was refused no longer exists, and if no other reason exists for
refusing to issue a license, the tax collector shall issue the license in
compliance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   Tax Collector to issue license; payment of tax a prerequisite. After
receipt of the completed application, if the tax collector believes that no
reason exists for refusal of a license under division (B) of this section, the
tax collector shall determine the amount of tax due and notify the applicant of
that amount. The tax collector shall not issue a license until the tax is paid.
   (E)   Amount of tax disputed. If dispute arise over the amount the tax
collector determines to be due, the applicant may either refuse to pay and
request a conference with the tax collector to discuss the determination or pay
the amount and request a conference to discuss the right to a refund. If a
conference is requested, the tax collector shall arrange it within a reasonable
time.
   (F)   Revocation.
      (1)   The tax collector shall revoke a license if a reason exists to
revoke it as set forth in division (B) of this chapter. Before revoking a
license, the tax collector shall give the licensee written notice of the
grounds for revocation, in accordance with division (L) of section. The
licensee may, within ten days after the day on which notice is served, request
a conference with the tax collector in writing. The request shall specify the
reasons why the license should not be revoked. The tax collector shall arrange
the conference within a reasonable time.
      (2)   If the licensee fails to request a conference within ten days after
the day on which notice is served, the tax collector shall revoke the license.
If the licensee requests a conference, the tax collector may not revoke the
license until after the conference.
      (3)   If the tax collector revokes a license, the former licensee may
apply for a new license at any time thereafter. If the reason for which the
license was revoked no longer exists and if no other reason exists for refusing
to issue a license, the tax collector shall issue the license in accordance
with division (D) of this chapter.
   (G)   Form and contents of license. A license shall show the name of the
person licensed, the place where the business is conducted (if it is to be
conducted at one place), the nature of the business licensed, the period for
which the license is issued, and the amount of tax paid. In addition, if a
machine is licensed, the license shall show the serial number of the machine.
The tax collector shall keep a copy of each license issued.
   (H)   Assignment. A license may be assigned if (1) a business licensed under
this chapter and carried on at a fixed place is sold as a unit to a person, and
(2) the purchaser is to carry on the same business at the same place. Such a
change shall be reported to the tax collector in accordance with division (I)
of this section. Otherwise, each license issued under this chapter is a
personal privilege and is not assignable.
   (I)   Changes in the business conducted by licensee during the tax year. A
licensee or an assignee shall report a change in the information contained in
the license application to the tax collector within ten days after the change
occurs. If information shown on the license itself is affected, the licensee or
assignee shall surrender the license to the tax collector when reporting the
change.
      (1)   Changes affecting the amount of tax due. If there are no reasons
for revoking the license under division (B) of this section and the change
results in the imposition of a separate or additional tax, the tax collector
shall reissue a license reflecting the change upon payment of the separate or
additional tax.
      (2)   Changes not affecting the amount of tax due. If there are no
reasons for revoking the license under division (B) of this section and the
change does not result in an imposition of a separate or additional tax, the
tax collector shall reissue a license reflecting the change upon payment of a
fee as set out in the official schedule of privilege license taxes.
      (3)   Change requiring refusal of a license. If there is reason for
revoking the license under division (B) of this section, the tax collector

license has been lost or destroyed, the tax collector shall furnish a duplicate
for a fee as set out in the official schedule of privilege license taxes.

years a record of each conference held in accordance with this article. The

conference, and a brief statement of the issues discussed and the result
reached. After three years, the tax collector shall dispose of the record in
accordance with G.S. 121-5.
   (L)   Providing notice to an applicant or licensee. Whenever this chapter
requires the tax collector to give a written statement or notice to an
applicant or a licensee, the tax collector may do so in one of three ways:
      (1)   By personally delivering the statement or notice to the applicant
or licensee;
      (2)   By mailing the statement or notice by registered or certified mail
and returning the receipt requested to the address specified for that purpose
in the license application; or
      (3)   By causing the statement or notice to be served on the applicant or
licensee in accordance with the procedures for service of process under Rule 4,
North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
(Ord. O-1998-29, passed 6-16-98)
§ 110.04 ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION.
   (A)   Duty to determine whether tax due. Each person has the duty to
determine whether the business he or she conducts is taxed under this chapter
and if so, whether that tax has been paid for the current tax year.
   (B)   Tax collector to investigate. If the tax collector has reason to
believe that a person is conducting a business in the city in violation of the
chapter, the tax collector shall conduct an investigation to determine the
person's tax liability.
   (C)   Duty to keep books. Each person who conducts a business taxed under
this chapter shall keep all records and books necessary to compute the tax
liability. If a person fails to keep books and records as required, the tax
collector shall make a determination of that person's tax liability from the
information available.
   (D)   Duty to permit inspection. Each person who conducts business in the
city shall permit the tax collector to inspect the business premises during
normal business hours to determine the nature of the business conducted there
and to examine the books and records to determine the nature and amount of
business transacted.
   (E)   Duty to post license. A licensee shall post the license or licenses
conspicuously in the place of business licensed. If the licensee has no regular
place of business, the license must be kept where it may be inspected at all
times by the proper city officials. If a machine is licensed, the license shall
be affixed to the machine.
   (F)   Notice of deficiency. If the tax collector determines that a person
has not paid the full amount of tax due under this chapter, either for the
current license year or for a prior license year, the tax collector shall give
the person written notice of the deficiency, in accordance with division (L) of
§
110.03. The notice of deficiency shall specify the total amount of tax due; the
section of this chapter upon which the tax is based; the amount of tax paid;
any interest due; the balance owed; the manner and time period in which the
person may respond to the notice of the deficiency; and the consequences of
failing to respond as specified.
   (G)   Request for a conference. The person may, within ten days after the
day on which notice is served, request a conference in writing. The request
shall specify the person's objections to the notice of deficiency. By way of
illustration but not limitation, a person who receives notice of a deficiency
may object on the following grounds:
      (1)   That the tax due has already been paid;
      (2)   That the tax collector miscalculated the amount of tax due;
      (3)   That the tax collector based his calculation on incorrect or
insufficient information concerning either the nature or the amount of business
conducted; or
      (4)   That the tax collector based the determination on an erroneous
interpretation of a section of this chapter that establishes a category of
business subject to a particular tax.
   (H)   Deficiency to become final. If the taxpayer fails to request a
conference under division (G) of this section, the deficiency becomes final and
the tax collector shall proceed to collect the deficiency.
   (I)   Conference held. If the taxpayer requests a conference, the tax
collector shall not proceed to collect the deficiency until hearing the
taxpayer's objections and determining that the deficiency should become final.
The tax collector shall maintain a record of each conference held for three
years in accordance with division (G) of this section. The record shall contain
the name of the taxpayer, the date of the conference, a brief statement of the
issues discussed, and the results of the discussion. After three years, the tax
collector shall dispose of the record in compliance with G.S. 121-5.
   (J)      Collection of deficiency.
      (1)   The tax collector may use any of the following methods to collect a
deficiency:
         (a)   Criminal prosecution in accordance with division (K)(1) of this
section;
         (b)   Equitable relief in accordance with division (K)(2) of this
section;
         (c)   The remedies of levy, sale, attachment and garnishment in
accordance with G.S. 160A-207; or
         (d)   The remedies of levy and sale of real and personal property of
the taxpayer within the city in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 105-109.
      (2)   Any person who commences or continues to conduct a business taxed
under this chapter without payment of the tax is liable for the additional tax
of 5% every 30 days as imposed by G.S. 105-109. No license shall be granted
until the tax plus the percentage penalty has been paid.
   (K)   Enforcement of chapter.
      (1)   Criminal remedies. Conducting business within the city without
having paid the privilege license tax imposed by the chapter, or without a
valid license issued in accordance with this chapter, or without posting a
license in compliance with division (E) of this section is a misdemeanor,
punishable as provided in G.S. 105-109. Each day that a person conducts
business in violation of this chapter is a separate offense. Payment of a fine
imposed in criminal proceedings in accordance with this section does not
relieve a person of the liability for taxes imposed under this section.
      (2)   Equitable remedies. In addition to the criminal remedies set forth
in subsection (1) of this division and in compliance with G.S. 160A-175(d), the
city may seek an injunction against any person who conducts a business in
violation of this chapter.

         (a)   Adult live entertainment must not occur in any other area of the
business establishment other than the area designated for such activity in the
diagram required in division (B)(1); and

are present in that area without payment of any charge other than the charge,
if any, for entry into the premises, such as a cover charge or membership fee.
      (3)   No alteration in the configuration of the areas where adult live
entertainment may occur designated in the diagram required by subsection (B)(1)
of this section may be made without first obtaining an amendment to the permit
by submitting and receiving approval of a new diagram.
      (4)   Adult live entertainment may occur only:
         (a)   In the presence of and visually observable by an employee who is
not an adult live entertainer;

patron;

specified sexual activities as defined in §
112.02 subsections (B) and (C) of Specified Sexual Activities above in any area
where adult live entertainment occurs.

the premises to ensure that adult live entertainment is not performed in the
presence of patrons in violation of subsections (B)(4) and (C) of this section.
It shall be unlawful for any such operator or owner to knowingly fail to
fulfill that duty.

to the Monroe Police Department. Pawnbrokers, pawnshops, cash converters,
secondary metals recyclers, and precious metals dealers are independently
responsible for meeting all statutory requirements. Reliance on the entity or
the electronic system designated by the Police Department for fulfillment of
any statutory requirement other than the electronic transfer of information to
the Police Department is at the pawnbrokers’, cash converters’, precious metals
dealers’, and secondary metals recyclers’ own risk.

§ 115.04 GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Grant.
      (1)   Grant. In the event that City shall grant to the Grantee a
nonexclusive, revocable Franchise to construct, operate, and maintain a cable
television system within the City to provide cable television service, said
Franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the
services of a cable television system as regulated by the provisions of this
Ordinance and the Franchise.
      (2)   Event of conflict. The Franchise shall be granted under the terms
and conditions contained herein, consistent with the City's Charter and/or
other applicable statutory requirements. In the event of conflict between the
terms and conditions of this Ordinance, the Franchise, or the terms and
conditions on which the City can grant a Franchise, the Charter and/or
statutory requirements shall control.
      (3)   General City Ordinances. Any Franchise granted by the City is
hereby made subject to the general ordinance provisions now in effect and
hereafter made effective. Nothing in the Franchise shall be deemed to waive the
requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the City regarding permits,
fees to be paid, or manner of construction.
   (B)   Franchise area. The Franchise area shall be the entire City, or
portions thereof, for which a Franchise is granted.

under, upon, across and along the public streets and ways within the City such
wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers,
appliances, pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are
necessary to the operation of the cable television systems, provided, however,
that Grantee complies with all design, construction, safety, and performance
provisions contained in this Ordinance, the Franchise, and other applicable
local ordinances.
   (D)   Franchise required. No cable television system shall be allowed to
occupy or use the streets of the City or be allowed to operate without a
Franchise.
   (E)   Term of franchise. The term of any Franchise granted pursuant to this
Ordinance shall be stated in the Franchise.
   (F)   Franchise nonexclusive. Any Franchise granted pursuant to this
Ordinance shall be nonexclusive. The City specifically reserves the right to
grant at any time during the term of this Franchise or renewal thereof, if any,
such additional Franchises for a cable television system as it deems
appropriate. The City shall notify the Franchise of such Franchise grant in a
timely manner. If any additional cable television franchise granted by the City
shall contain terms and conditions, when taken as a whole, more favorable and/
or less burdensome than this franchise, the City shall amend the Franchise,
upon written request of the Franchisee, to incorporate the more favorable or
less burdensome provisions. The Grantee must make any such request within
ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the Franchisor and the City shall
act in a timely manner so amending the Grantee(s) Franchise pursuant to this
section. Franchisee agrees to indemnify the City and to hold the City harmless
from all claims against it by third parties arising out of its compliance with
this section to the extent that such claims are not barred by Section 635A of
the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992
(Limitation of Franchise Authority Liability), or by any other provision of
law.
   (G)   Time is of the essence to this agreement. Whenever the agreement shall
set forth any time for an act to be performed by or on behalf of the Grantee,
such time shall be deemed of the essence and any failure of the Grantee to
perform within the time allotted shall always be sufficient ground for the city
to invoke an appropriate penalty including possible revocation of the
Franchise.
   (H)   Law governs. In any controversy or dispute under this Ordinance, the
law of the State of North Carolina shall apply.
   (I)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or
portion of this Ordinance or the Franchise is for any reason held invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, or by any Federal,
State, or Local statute or regulation, such portion shall be deemed a separate,
distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions thereof.
   (J)   Transfer of ownership or control.
      (1)   Transfer of Franchise. Any Franchise granted hereunder shall not be
sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including but not limited
to, transfer by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or
other means, nor shall the control of the Grantee be changed, without the prior
consent of the City, and then only under such conditions reasonably related to
the qualifications of the transferee as the City may establish.
      (2)   Transfer threshold. The Grantee shall promptly notify the City of
any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other
party of, control of the Grantee. The word “control” as used herein is not
limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever
manner exercised. A transfer of ownership requiring approval shall arise upon
the disposal by the Grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment,
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of twenty-five percent
(25%) or more at one time of the ownership or controlling interest in the
system, or forty-five percent (45%) cumulatively over the term of the Franchise
of such interests to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or
association, or person or group of persons acting in concert. Provided however,

ownership or control to a person under common control with Grantee, provided
that prior to such transfer, Grantee provides to the City verifiable
information to establish that such transferee under common control has the
financial, legal and technical ability to fully perform all obligations of the
Franchise.
      (3)   City approval. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of
the Grantee shall make the Franchise subject to cancellation unless and until
the City, for those transactions requiring City approval, shall have consented
thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of
determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition
of control, the City may inquire into the legal, financial, character,
technical qualifications, the experience in cable operation, and other relevant
qualifications of the prospective controlling or ownership entity, and the
Grantee shall assist the City in any such inquiry. Failure to provide all
material information requested by the City as part of said inquiry may, at the
discretion of the City Council, be grounds for denial of the proposed change,
transfer or acquisition of control.
      (4)   Assumption of control. The City agrees that any financial
institution having a pledge of the Franchise or its assets for the advancement
of money for the construction and/or operation of the Franchise shall have the
right to notify the City that it or its designees satisfactory to the City will
take control and operate the cable television system. Further, said financial
institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will insure
continued service and compliance with all Franchise obligations during the term
the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial
institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding
one year, unless extended by the City at its discretion and during said period
of time it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the Franchise to
another Grantee. If the City finds that such transfer, after considering the
legal financial, character, technical qualifications and the experience in
cable operation of the applicant are satisfactory, the City will transfer and
assign the rights and obligations of such Franchise as determined in the public
interest. The consent of the City to such transfer shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
      (5)   No waiver of property rights. The consent or approval of the City
to any transfer of the Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the
rights of the City in and to the streets and any other City property, and any
transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions
of this Ordinance and the Franchise.
      (6)   Transfer time periods. In the absence of extraordinary
circumstances, the City will not approve any transfer or assignment of the
Franchise prior to initial completion of construction of the proposed system.
      (7)   Signatory requirement. Any approval by the City of transfer of
ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective controlling party
becoming a signatory to the Franchise.
      (8)   Time frame for city review. As required by Federal law, the City
shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or
transfer that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in
accordance with FCC regulations and by the City. In accordance with FCC
regulations, if the City fails to render a final decision on the request within
120 days, such request shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and
the City agree to an extension of time.
   (K)   Franchise renewal. Upon completion of the term of any Franchise
granted under this Ordinance, the City may grant or deny renewal of the
Franchise of the Grantee in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act.
The Grantee shall own the cable television system, but shall have no property
right in the public rights of way upon the completion of the Franchise term.
   (L)   Police powers.
      (1)   Police powers. In accepting the Franchise, the Grantee acknowledges
that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the City to adopt
and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the
public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances
enacted by the City pursuant to such power.
      (2)   Conflicts. Any conflict between the provisions of this Ordinance or
the Franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the City's
police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter.
   (M)   Franchise fees.
      (1)   Because the City believes that:
         (a)   The streets of the City to be used by the Grantee in the
operation of its system within the boundaries of the Franchise area are
valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the City at great expense
to its taxpayers.
         (b)   The grant to the Grantee of the use of the said streets is a
valuable property right without which the Grantee would be required to invest
substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions.
         (c)   The administration of this Ordinance and the Franchise imposes
upon the City additional regulatory responsibility and expense.
         (d)   A Grantee of any Franchise hereunder shall pay to the City a
Franchise fee in an amount as designated in the Franchise, but in no event less
than five percent (5%) of the gross annual revenues, or the maximum amount
permitted under applicable Federal, State, or local law, if such maximum is
greater than five percent (5%). The annual Franchise payment shall be in
addition to any other fee and shall commence as of the effective date of the
Franchise. The City shall be furnished a statement of said payment by a chief
financial officer of the Division operating the system in the City, reflecting
the total amounts of annual gross revenues, a break down by type of revenue,
and the above charges and computations for the period covered by the payment.
      (2)   Franchise fee in addition to other tax or payment. This payment
shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the Governments or
other taxing jurisdiction by the Grantee. Payment of the Franchise fee made by
Grantee to the City shall not be considered in the nature of a tax, but shall
be in addition to any and all taxes which are now or may be required hereafter
to be paid by any Federal, State, or Local law.
      (3)   Acceptance by the City. No acceptance of any payment by the City
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim
the City may have for further or additional sums payable as a Franchise fee
under this Ordinance or for the performance of any other obligation of the
Grantee.
      (4)   Failure to make required payment. In the event that any Franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified
herein, Grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge,
computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime
interest rate of the City primary depository bank during the period that such
unpaid amount is owed.
      (5)   Payments to be made quarterly. The Franchise fee and any other cost
or damage assessed against the Grantee shall be payable quarterly to the City
of Monroe. The Grantee shall file a complete and accurate statement of all
gross revenues within the Franchise area during the period for which said
quarterly payment is made, and said payment shall be made to the City no later
than forty-five (45) days following the end of each calendar quarter. Quarterly
computation dates are the last day in the months of March, June, September and
December.
      (6)   The City's right of inspection. The City shall have the right to
inspect the Grantee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute
any amounts determined to be payable under this Ordinance. Audits shall be at
the expense of the City unless the audit reveals an underpayment of more than
five percent (5%) in the amount of the Franchise fee due to the City, in which
event the actual out-of-pocket cost of the audit shall be borne by the Grantee.
Any additional amount due the City as a result of the audit shall be paid
within thirty (30) days following written notice to the Grantee by the City
which notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
   (N)   Forfeiture or revocation.
      (1)   Grounds for revocation. The City reserves the right to revoke any
Franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated
with the Franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall
represent a default and breach under this ordinance and the Franchise grant:
         (a)   If the Grantee shall default in the performance of any of the
material obligations under this Ordinance or under such documents contracts and
other terms and provisions entered into by and between the City and the
Grantee.
         (b)   If the Grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force
and effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond
as required herein.
         (c)   If the Grantee shall violate any orders or rulings of any
regulatory body having jurisdiction over the Grantee relative to this Ordinance
or the Franchise.
         (d)   If the Grantee evades any of the provisions of this Ordinance or
the Franchise or practices any fraud or deceit upon the City or cable
subscribers.
         (e)   The Grantee's construction schedule is delayed later than the
schedule contained in the Franchise or beyond any extended date set by the
City.

         (j)   Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or
negotiation of the Franchise or any extension or renewal thereof.
         (k)   If the Grantee ceases to provide services for any reason within
the control of the Grantee over the cable television system.
      (2)   Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. The Grantee
shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any
provision of this Ordinance in any case, in which performance of any such
provision is prevented or delayed for reasons beyond the Grantee's control. A
fault shall not be deemed to be beyond the Grantee's control if committed by a
corporation or other business entity in which the Grantee holds a controlling
interest whether held directly or indirectly.
      (3)   Effect of pending litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to
any regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over the Grantee shall not
excuse the Grantee from the performance of its obligations under this Ordinance
or the Franchise unless a stay is granted by a regulatory body or a court of
competent jurisdiction. Failure of the Grantee to perform such obligations
because of pending litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or
revocation pursuant to the provisions of this section.
      (4)   Procedure prior to revocation.
         (a)   The City shall make written demand that the Grantee do so comply
with any such requirement, limitation, term condition, rule or regulation or
correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or
neglect of the Grantee continues for a period of sixty (60) days following such
written demand, the City shall place its request for termination of the
Franchise upon a regular Council meeting agenda. The City shall cause to be
served upon such Grantee at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of such
Council meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination,
and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by
the City Clerk at least once, thirty (30) days before such meeting in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City. The time for the Grantee to
correct any alleged violation shall be extended by the City, if the necessary
action to correct the alleged violation is of such a nature or character to
require more than thirty (30) days within which to perform, provided the
Grantee provides a plan acceptable to the City and the Grantee commences the
corrective action within the thirty (30) day period and thereafter uses all
reasonable efforts to correct the violation.
         (b)   The Council shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall
determine whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by the Grantee was
with just cause.
         (c)   If such failure, refusal or neglect by the Grantee was with just
cause, as defined by the City, the Council shall direct the Grantee to comply
within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are
reasonable.
         (d)   If the Council shall determine such failure, refusal, or neglect
by the Grantee was without just cause, then the Council shall, by resolution,
declare that the Franchise of the Grantee shall be terminated and the
performance bond forfeited unless there is compliance by the Grantee within a
specified period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days.

shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good a
condition or better as that prevailing prior to the Grantee's removal of its
equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical or telephone cable
wires or attachments. The City shall inspect and approve the condition of the
public ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments, and poles after
removal. The liability, indemnity, insurance and performance bond as provided
herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and
until full compliance by the Grantee with the terms and conditions of this
paragraph, this Ordinance and the Franchise.
      (7)   Restoration by city; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a
failure by the Grantee to complete any work required by Sections
115.04(C) and (E) and/or (6) above, or any other work required by City law or
ordinance within the time as may be established and to the satisfaction of the
City, the City may, after affording Grantee notice and a reasonable opportunity
to cure, cause such work to be done and the Grantee shall reimburse the City
the cost thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of
such costs or the City may recover such costs through the performance bond
provided by Grantee. The City shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable
relief to enforce the provisions of this Section.
      (8)   Extended operation. Upon either the expiration or revocation of a
Franchise, the City may require the Grantee to continue to operate the system
for a period of six (6) months from the date of such expiration or revocation,
or until such time as is mutually agreed upon. The Grantee shall, as trustee
for its successor in interest, continue to operate the cable television system
under the terms and conditions of this Ordinance and the Franchise and to
provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may
be provided at the time. The City shall be permitted to seek legal and
equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this Section.
   (O)   Receivership and foreclosure.
      (1)   Termination by insolvency. The Franchise granted hereunder shall,
at the option of the City, cease and terminate one hundred twenty (120) days
after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take
over and conduct the business of the Grantee whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such
receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of
said one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless:
         (a)   Such receivers or trustees shall have, within one hundred twenty
(120) days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the
terms and provisions of this Ordinance and the Franchise granted pursuant
hereto, and the receivers or trustees within said one hundred twenty (120) days
shall have remedied all defaults under the Franchise; and

granted.
      (2)   Termination by judicial action. In the case of a foreclosure or
other judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the Grantee or any
part thereof, including or excluding the Franchise, the City may serve notice
of termination upon the Grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in

   (R)   Failure of city to enforce this franchise, no waiver of the terms
thereof. The Grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the terms
and conditions of this Ordinance or the Franchise by any failure of the City
upon any one or more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any
such terms or conditions.
   (S)   Rights reserved to the grantor.
      (1)   Rights upon denial. If a renewal of the Franchise held by the
Grantee is denied and the franchising authority acquires ownership of the cable
system or effects a transfer of ownership of the system to another person, any
such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the
basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated
to the Franchise itself.
      (2)   Rights upon termination. If the Franchise held by the Grantee is
revoked for cause and the franchising authority acquires ownership of the cable
system or effects a transfer of ownership of the system to another person, any
such acquisition or transfer shall be at an equitable price.
      (3)   Right of inspection of records. The City shall have the right to
inspect all books, records, reports, maps, plans, financial statements, and

required by public necessity from all streets and public ways within the City.
      (8)   Expense reimbursement to City. At the time of an initial Franchise

connection with preparation of this Ordinance and the Franchise including, but
not limited to, consultant fees, attorneys' fees, publication fees, travel
expenses and all other direct costs; provided, however, that the City shall
submit a detailed schedule of all such costs. Such payment shall be made within
thirty (30) days after the City furnishes the Grantee with a written statement
of such expenses.

relief, the Grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City or its
officials, boards, commissions, agents, or employees for any loss, cost,

any extensions and renewals thereof, at its cost and expense, and file with the
City, a corporate surety bond in an amount specified in the Franchise to

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 PURPOSE.
   The historical heritage of Union County is one of its most valued and
important assets. Conservation of historic districts and landmarks will
stabilize and increase the values in their areas and strengthen the overall
economy of the county and state. By means of listing, regulation and
acquisition of historic districts and landmarks, Union County, Monroe,
Marshville, and Wingate seek within their respective zoning jurisdictions:
   (A)   To safeguard its heritage by preserving any district or landmark
therein that embodies elements of its culture, history, architectural history
or prehistory; and
   (B)   To promote the use and conservation of such district or landmark for
the education, pleasure, and enrichment of the residents of the county and
state as a whole.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION
§ 152.010 CREATION.
   (A)   There is hereby established by authority of G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 19,
Part 3C, the Union County Joint Historic Preservation Commission, hereafter
referred to as the Historic Preservation Commission or Commission, to consist
of up to 13 members with four appointed by the Union County Commissioners,
three appointed by the Monroe City Council, and one appointed by the Town
Councils of each of Marshville and Wingate.
   (B)   The Historic Preservation Commission members shall serve without
monetary compensation. In establishing the Historic Preservation Commission and
making appointments to it, the above-named Board and Councils may seek the
advice of such State or local historical agencies, societies, or organizations
as it may deem necessary.

§ 152.011 JOINT ORDINANCE.
   (A)   Pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 160A-400.7, Union County, the City
of Monroe, and the Towns of Marshville and Wingate do hereby adopt this
ordinance as a joint ordinance. It is the intent of this ordinance that Union
County and each city or town subscribing to this ordinance shall have complete
control of all historic districts or landmarks located within its incorporated
municipal limits, at the present and in the future, except to the extent that
any functions are specifically delegated to the Historic Preservation
Commission. Any references in this ordinance to all of the subscribing parties
shall be construed to be in the disjunctive rather than the conjunctive, it not
being the intent of this ordinance that any governmental entity have any
authority beyond its municipal limits. At the present time, the City of Monroe,
and the Towns of Stallings, Waxhaw and Weddington exercise zoning jurisdiction
independent of Union County. The Towns of Indian Trail, Marshville and Wingate
do not exercise independent zoning jurisdiction, with all zoning matters within
those towns being administered by Union County. To the extent that this
ordinance requires acts to be performed incident to a zoning ordinance, Union
County shall perform those functions on behalf of Indian Trail, Marshville, and
Wingate, until such time as those towns shall adopted their own zoning
ordinances. It is the intent of this ordinance that upon the adoption of zoning
ordinances by Indian Trail, Marshville, and Wingate that those towns would
assume full authority as to all acts required under this ordinance.
   (B)   To the extent that any prior ordinances adopted by any governmental
entity is inconsistent with this ordinance, then such prior ordinances are
hereby repeated.

Union County and each shall reside within the jurisdiction of the Board or
Council appointing them representative. A majority of the members shall have
demonstrated special interest, experience or education in history,
architecture, archaeology, or related fields.
(Ord. O-2002-46, passed 8-5-02)
§ 152.013 TENURE.
   Members of the Historic Preservation Commission shall serve overlapping
terms of four years. Initially, two appointees by the county, and one appointee
each from Monroe and Marshville, and shall be for two years. Thereafter, all
appointments shall be for a term of four years. A member may be reappointed for
a second consecutive term, but after two consecutive terms a member shall be
ineligible for reappointment until one calendar year has elapsed from the date
of termination of his or her second term. Appointments to any vacancy shall be
for the remainder of the term of the vacant position for which the appointment
is made. For purposes of reappointment to the Historic Preservation Commission,
an initial two-year term, or serving the balance of an unexpired term of two
years or less shall not be considered to be one of the two consecutive terms,

DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC DISTRICTS
§ 152.030 ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE OF DESIGNATION OF AN HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   Upon compliance with the procedures set out in §
152.032 of this ordinance, the Union County Board of Commissioners, the Monroe
City Council, or the Marshville or Wingate Town Councils may as part of a
zoning or other ordinance enacted or amended pursuant to this ordinance
designate and from time-to-time amend one or more historic districts within the
area subject to the ordinance. The ordinance may treat historic districts

other zoning districts. Where historic districts are designated as separate use
districts, the zoning ordinance may include as uses by right or as conditional
or special uses those uses found by the Historic Preservation Commission to
have existed during the period sought to be restored or preserved, or to be
compatible with the restoration or preservation of the district.

and/or culture, and to possess integrity of design, setting, materials, feeling
and association.
(Ord. O-2002-46, passed 8-5-02)

      (2)   The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State
Historic Preservation Officer or his or her designee, shall have made an
analysis of and recommendations concerning such report and description of
proposed boundaries. Failure of the department to submit its written analysis
and recommendations to the governing board within 30 calendar days after a
written request for such analysis has been received by the Department of
Cultural Resources shall relieve the governing board of any responsibility for
awaiting such analysis, and said board may at any time thereafter take any
necessary action to adopt or amend its zoning ordinance.
   (B)   The governing board may also, in its discretion, refer the report and
the proposed boundaries to any other interested body for its recommendation
prior to taking action to amend the zoning ordinance. With respect to any
changes in the boundaries of such district subsequent to its initial
establishment, or the creation of additional districts within the jurisdiction,
the investigative studies and reports required by division (A)(1) of this
section shall be prepared by the Commission and shall be referred to the local
planning agency for its review and comments according to procedures set forth
in the zoning ordinance. Changes in the boundaries of an initial district or
proposal for additional districts shall also be submitted to the Department of
Cultural Resources in accordance with the provisions of division (A)(2) of this
section.
   (C)   On receipt of these reports and recommendations, the governing board

   (B)   The ordinance shall describe each property designated in the
ordinance, the name or names of the owner or owners of the property, those
elements of the property that are integral to its historical, architectural, or
prehistorical value, including the land areas of the property so designated and
any other information the governing board deems necessary. For each building,
structure, site, area or object so designated as a historic landmark, the

Department of Cultural Resources.
   (C)   The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State
Historic Preservation Officer, shall either upon request of the department or
at the initiative of the Historical Preservation Commission be given an
opportunity to review and comment upon the substance and effect of the
designation of any landmark. Comments shall be provided in writing within 30

amendments thereto shall be filed by the Historic Preservation Commission in
the office of the Register of Deeds for Union County. Each designated landmark
shall be indexed according to the name of the owner of the property in the
grantee and grantor indexes in the Register of Deeds office. The Historic
Preservation Commission shall pay a reasonable fee for filing and indexing. In
case of any property lying in Union County, a second copy of the ordinance and
all amendments thereto shall be kept on file in the office of the Union County

§ 152.050 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   From and after the designation of a landmark or a historic district,
no exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry
walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant
features), nor any above-ground utility structures, nor any type of outdoor

§ 152.058 REVIEW CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   It is the intent of these criteria, and the design guidelines, to
insure, insofar as possible, that changes to a designated landmark (or
structures in a historic district) shall be in harmony with the reasons for
designation.
   (B)   When considering a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Historic
Preservation Commission shall take into account the historic or architectural
significance of the structure under consideration and the exterior form and
appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that structure, as
well as the effect of such change or additions upon other structures in the
vicinity. In a historic district, it is not the intention of these criteria or
the guidelines to require the reconstruction or restoration of individual or
original buildings or prohibit the demolition or removal of same or to impose
architectural styles from particular historic period. In considering new
construction in a historic district, the Historic Preservation Commission shall
encourage contemporary design which is harmonious with the character of the
district.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be considered, when relevant, along with
companion design guidelines and the guidelines of the Secretary of the Interior
in reviewing for a Certificate of Appropriateness:
      (1)   Lot coverage, defined as the percentage of lot area covered by
primary structures;

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 FINDINGS; PURPOSE; AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1201 of the General Statutes of North
Carolina, it is hereby found and declared that there exist in the city planning
and development regulation jurisdiction dwellings which are unfit for human
habitation due to dilapidation, defects increasing the hazards of fire,
accidents and other calamities, lack of ventilation, light and sanitary
facilities, and other conditions rendering such dwellings unsafe and
unsanitary, and dangerous and detrimental to the health, safety and morals, and
otherwise inimical to the welfare of the residents of the city planning and
development regulation jurisdiction.
   (B)   In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of
the city planning and development regulation jurisdiction, as authorized by
G.S. Chapter 160D, Article 12, it is the purpose of this chapter to establish
minimum standards of fitness for the initial and continued occupancy of all
buildings used for human habitation, as expressly authorized by G.S. §§ 160D-
1201 and 160A-193.
   (C)   In addition, it is hereby found and declared, under the authority of
G.S. § l60A-174, that there exist in the city dwellings which, although not
meeting the classification as unfit for human habitation, fail to fully comply
with all the minimum standards for housing fitness as established herein and
therefore have present one or more conditions which are inimical to the public
health, safety and general welfare. Such conditions, if not corrected can lead
to deterioration and dilapidation of dwellings which render them unfit for
human habitation.
   (D)   This chapter is hereby declared to be remedial and shall be construed
to secure the beneficial interests and purposes thereof, which are public
health, safety, and general welfare, through structural strength, stability,
sanitation, adequate light and ventilation and safety to life and property from
fire and other hazards incident to the construction, alteration, repair,
removal, demolition, use and occupancy of dwellings, apartment houses, rooming
houses or buildings, structures or premises used or intended for use as such.

§ 153.02 SCOPE.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all dwellings or
dwelling units within the city planning and development regulation jurisdiction
regardless of when such units were constructed, altered, repaired or improved.
Portable, mobile or demountable buildings or structures, including trailers,
when used or intended for use for housing within the jurisdiction, shall be
subject to the applicable provisions of this chapter. This chapter establishes
minimum requirements for the initial and continued occupancy of all buildings
used for human habitation and does not replace or modify requirements otherwise
established for the construction, repair, alteration or use of buildings,
equipment or facilities, except as provided in this chapter.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter shall also apply, as authorized by G.S.
§ 160D-1201(b), to abandoned structures which are found by the city to be a
health or safety hazard as a result of the attraction of insects or rodents,
conditions creating a fire hazard, dangerous conditions constituting a threat
to children or frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the absence of
sanitary conditions.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 153.50 OFFICE OF CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER CREATED; POWERS.
   (A)   For the purposes of administering and enforcing the provisions of this
chapter the office of Code Enforcement Officer is hereby created.
   (B)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall be appointed by the City Manager,
shall take and subscribe to the oath of office administered by the Mayor, and
shall have such powers as may be necessary or convenient to carry out and
effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter, including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in addition to others herein granted,
the following powers:
      (1)   To investigate the dwelling and building conditions and to inspect
dwellings, dwelling units and buildings in the city in order to determine which
dwellings therein are unfit for human habitation, being guided in such
examination of dwellings and buildings by the requirements set forth in this
chapter;
      (2)   To administer oaths and affirmations and to examine witnesses and
receive evidence;
      (3)   To enter upon and within premises and dwellings for the purpose of
making examinations and investigations; provided, that such entries shall be
made in such a manner as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the
persons in possession;
      (4)   To delegate any of his functions and powers under this chapter to
such officers and agents as he may designate;
      (5)   To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents and
employees as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter;
and
      (6)   To obtain administrative inspection warrants, issue civil citations
and to take such other actions as may be necessary to carry out the enforcement
procedures of this chapter. When permission to inspect a dwelling or its
premises is denied, the Code Enforcement Officer must obtain an administrative
inspection warrant to inspect. When faced with a situation where permission to
inspect is denied, the Code Enforcement Officer is advised to seek the advice
of the city attorney. NOTE: G.S. § 15-27.2 provides for the issuance of
warrants to conduct of inspections authorized by law. The N.C. Court of
Appeals, In Re Dwelling, 24 N.C. App. 17 (1974), has held that the consent of
the tenant-occupant who was in actual possession and control of the premises
was sufficient to authorize an inspection without a warrant, notwithstanding
the fact that the owner had objected to the warrantless search.

chapter or with any lawful order issued pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter.

§ 153.57 PROCEDURE AFTER HEARING; ORDER.
   (A)   If, after notice and hearing, the Code Enforcement Officer determines
that the dwelling under consideration is unfit for human habitation, he shall
state in writing his findings of fact in support of that determination and
shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing
and requiring the owner to repair, alter and improve such dwelling unit to
comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this chapter within
the time specified in the order as follows:
      (1)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling can be
made at a reasonable cost of less than 50% of the value of the dwelling, the
order shall require the owner, within the time specified, to repair, alter or
improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation or to
vacate and close the dwelling as a human habitation; or
      (2)   If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling cannot be
made at a reasonable cost of less than 50% of the value of the dwelling, the
order shall require the owner, within the time specified in the order, to
remove or demolish such dwelling.
   (B)   If, after notice and hearing the Code Enforcement Officer determines
that the dwelling under consideration is not unfit for human habitation but is
not in full compliance with one or more standards of dwelling fitness as set
forth above, he may proceed with the enforcement procedures of §§ 10.19 and
10.99.
   (C)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the condition of the
dwelling would require removal or demolition under division (A)(2) of this
section and the dwelling is located in a historic district of the city and the
historic district commission determines, after an administrative hearing as
provided by the ordinance, that the dwelling is of particular significance or
value toward maintaining the character of the district, and the dwelling has
not been condemned as unsafe, the order may require that the dwelling be
vacated and closed consistent with G. S. § 160D-949.
   (D)   The Code Enforcement Officer's order shall also provide that the
housing to which it applies shall not be occupied if it is vacant as of the
date of the order or becomes vacant before the required repair, alteration or
improvement has been made, unless the owner obtains from the Code Enforcement
Officer a certificate of fitness for occupancy, which shall be issued upon a
finding by the administrator that the housing subject to the order is not unfit
for human habitation.

§ 153.58 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ORDER.
   (A)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve
or to vacate and close the dwelling, the Code Enforcement Officer shall:
      (1)   Cause to be posted on the main entrance of any such dwelling, a
placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation;
the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and
unlawful." Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.
      (2)   Cause the dwelling to be repaired, altered or improved or to be
vacated and closed.
   (B)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the
dwelling, the Code Enforcement Officer shall:
      (1)   Cause to be posted on the main entrance of any such dwelling, a
placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation;
the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and
unlawful." Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.
      (2)   Cause such dwelling to be vacated and removed or demolished.
   (C)   The duties of the Code Enforcement Officer set forth in divisions (A)
and (B) shall not be exercised until the City Council shall have by ordinance
ordered the Code Enforcement Officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of
this chapter with respect to the particular property or properties which the
Code Enforcement Officer shall have found to be unfit for human habitation and
which property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. No such
ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a dwelling until the owner
has first been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with
this chapter. For the purposes of this division a period of 90 days following
the date of the Code Enforcement Officer's order shall constitute a reasonable
opportunity. This chapter shall be recorded in the Office of the Register of
Deeds in the county wherein the property or properties are located and shall be
indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index as provided by
G.S. § 160D-1203(4).
   (D)   (RESERVED).
   (E)   As provided by G.S. 160D-1203(7), the amount of the cost of repairs,
alterations or improvements, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition
by the Code Enforcement Officer shall be a lien against the real property upon
which the cost was incurred, which lien shall be filed against the real
property, have the same priority, and be collected as the lien for special
assessment provided in G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 10. If the dwelling is removed or
demolished by the Code Enforcement Officer, he shall sell the materials of the
dwelling, and any personal property, fixtures or appurtenances found in or
attached to the dwelling, and shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the
cost of the removal or demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited
in the Superior Court by the Code Enforcement Officer, shall be secured in a
manner directed by the Court, and shall be disbursed by the Court to the
persons found to be entitled thereto by final order of the decree of the Court.
   (F)   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling,
the Code Enforcement Officer may file a civil action in the name of the city to
remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature
of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as
party-defendants any persons occupying such dwelling. The Clerk of Superior
Court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a
magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten (10) days from
the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint
shall be served as provided in G.S. § 42-29. The summons shall be returned
according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly
served, and if at the hearing the Code Enforcement Officer produces a certified
copy of an ordinance adopted by the City Council pursuant to division (C) of
this section authorizing the Code Enforcement Officer to proceed to vacate the
occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the
premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The judgement ordering
that the dwelling be vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the
judgment for summary ejectment entered under G. S. § 42-30. An appeal from any
judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. §
7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. §
7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the
owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to
this division unless such occupant was served with notice at least thirty (30)
days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the City
Council has ordered the Code Enforcement Officer to proceed to exercise his
duties under divisions (A), (B) and (C) of this section to vacate and close or
remove and demolish the dwelling.
   (G)   Whenever a determination is made pursuant to division (A) or (B) of
this section that a dwelling must be vacated and closed or removed or
demolished under the provisions of this section, notice of the order shall be
given by first class mail to any organization involved in providing or
restoring dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for
such notices. A minimum period of forty-five (45) days from the mailing of such
notice shall be given before removal or demolition by action of the Code
Enforcement Officer, to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate
with the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase the property for the purpose
of providing affordable housing. The Code Enforcement Officer shall certify the
mailing of the notices, and the certification shall be conclusive in the
absence of fraud. Only an organization that has filed a written request for
such notices may raise the issue of failure to mail such notices, and the sole
remedy and the sole remedy shall be an order requiring the public officer to
wait 45 days before causing removal or demolition.
   (H)   If the City Council shall have adopted an ordinance, or the Code
Enforcement Officer shall have issued an order, ordering a dwelling to be
repaired or vacated and closed, as provided in §
153.57, and if the owner has vacated and closed such dwelling and kept such
dwelling vacated and closed for a period of one year pursuant to the ordinance
or order, then if the City Council shall find that the owner has abandoned the
intent and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the dwelling in order to render
it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the dwelling in its
vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, moral, and
welfare of the city in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would
create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants,
would attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute
to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area, and would
render unavailable property and a dwelling which might otherwise have been made
available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable housing in
the city, then in such circumstances, the City Council may, after the
expiration of such one year period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance
on the owner, setting forth the following:
      (1)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding fifty percent
(50%) of the then current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require
that the owner either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90
days; or
      (2)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding fifty percent
(50%) of the then current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require
the owner to demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
   (I)   This chapter shall be recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds
in the county wherein the property or properties are located and shall be
indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index as provided by
G.S. 160D-1203(4). If the owner fails to comply with this chapter, the Housing
Inspector shall effect the purpose of the ordinance.

§ 153.59 SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)   Complaints or orders issued by the Code Enforcement Officer pursuant
to this chapter, except those being issued under §§
10.19 and
10.99, shall be served upon persons either personally or certified mail. When
service is made by certified mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also be
sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the certified mail
is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post
office within ten (10) days after the mailing. If regular mail is used, a
notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
premises affected.
   (B)   If the identities or whereabouts of any owners arc unknown and cannot
be ascertained by the Code Enforcement Officer in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, or, if the owners are known but have refused to accept service by
certified mail, and the Code Enforcement Officer makes an affidavit to that
effect, then the serving of the complaint or order upon the unknown owners or
other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general
circulation in the city at least once no later than the time at which personal
service would be required under the provisions of this chapter. When service is
made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises thereby affected.

§ 153.60 APPEALS.
   (A)   As provided by G. S. § 160D-305, the Board of Adjustment is hereby
appointed as the Housing Appeals Board to which appeals from any decision or
order of the Code Enforcement Officer may be taken. Except where this chapter
provides for different rules or procedures, the Board of Adjustment acting as
the Housing Appeals Board shall follow its rules of procedure, which may be
amended to provide specifically for this function.
   (B)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Code Enforcement Officer
is a quasi-judicial matter and may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby or
by any officer, board or commission of the city. Any appeal from the Code
Enforcement Officer shall be taken within ten days from the service of the
order by filing with the Code Enforcement Officer and with the Board of
Adjustment a notice of appeal that shall specify the grounds upon which the
appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the papers
constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an
appeal is from a decision of the Code Enforcement Officer refusing to allow the
person aggrieved thereby to do any such act, his decision shall remain in force
until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the Code
Enforcement Officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal
shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the
Board of Adjustment, unless the Code Enforcement Officer certifies to the Board
of Adjustment after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that because of
facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the
appellant), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life
or property. In that case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a
restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than
one (1) day's written notice to the Code Enforcement Officer, the Board of
Adjustment, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to division (E)
of this section.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing
appeals, shall give due notice to the parties, and shall render its decision
within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
may modify the decision or order appealed from and may make any decision and
order that in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it
shall have all the powers of the Code Enforcement Officer, but the concurring
vote of four-fifths of the members of the Board of Adjustment shall be
necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Code Enforcement
Officer. The Board of Adjustment shall have power also in passing upon appeals,
when practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying
out the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the
ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the
ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial
justice done.
   (D)   Every decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be subject to review
by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within fifteen (15) days
of the decision of the Board.
   (E)   Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the Code Enforcement
Officer, or a decision rendered by the Board of Adjustment may petition the
Superior Court for an injunction, restraining the Code Enforcement Officer from
carrying out the order or decision and the Court may uphold such petition,
issue a temporary injunction restraining the Code Enforcement Officer pending a
final disposition of the cause. The petition shall be filed within thirty (30)
days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision. Hearings shall
be had by the Court on a petition within twenty (20) days and shall be given
preference over other matters on the Court’s calendar. The Court shall hear and
determine the issues raised and shall enter such final order or decree as law
and justice may require. It shall not be necessary to file bond in any amount
before obtaining a temporary injunction under this section.

§ 153.61 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter nor any of its provisions shall be construed
to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare
nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or
otherwise, nor shall enforcement of one remedy provided herein prevent the
enforcement of any other remedy or remedies provided herein or in other
ordinances or laws. In addition to the remedies provided for herein, any
violations of the terms of this chapter shall subject the violator to the
penalties and remedies, either criminal or civil or both, as set forth in §§
10.19 and 10.99. A violation of this Code shall not constitute a misdemeanor
pursuant to G.S. § 14-4.
   (B)   No dwelling shall be hereafter erected, altered, moved, or changed in
use without a certificate of occupancy. In any case where the Code Enforcement
Officer, after notice and hearing as required herein, finds that a dwelling or
dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, he shall withhold issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for such dwelling or dwelling unit until such time
that he determines that it is fit for human habitation. In addition, in any
case where the Code Enforcement Officer, after preliminary investigation as
provided for herein, concludes, based upon that investigation, that a dwelling
or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation and believes that the occupancy
of such dwelling or dwelling unit could cause imminent peril to life or
property from fire or other hazards, he shall withhold issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for such dwelling or dwelling unit until such time
that he determines that it is fit for human habitation.
   (C)   If any dwelling is erected, constructed, altered, repaired, converted,
maintained, or used in violation of this chapter or of any valid order or
decision of the Code Enforcement Officer or Board of Adjustment made pursuant
to any ordinance or code adopted under authority of this chapter, the Code
Enforcement Officer or Board of Adjustment may institute any appropriate action
or proceedings to prevent the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration or use, to restrain, correct or abate the violation, to prevent the
occupancy of the dwellings, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct or use in or
about the premises of the dwelling.

§ 153.62 CONFLICT WITH OTHER PROVISIONS.
   In the event any provision, standard or requirement of this chapter is found

§ 154.01 FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF NECESSITY.
   (A)   Findings. Housing in the city consists of owner occupied and tenant
occupied properties and the two types of housing are in general parity. A
substantial number of complaints about and violations of the code provisions
adopted to assure minimum adequate housing arise from tenant occupied property.
State law and this code impose the responsibility to provide minimally adequate
housing for tenants on the property owner. The substantial majority of such
complaints arise at single family dwellings, duplexes, and apartment houses.
These properties are the subject of numerous complaints of minimum housing and
building code violations, public health nuisances, junk motor vehicle
violations, overcrowding by tenants, increased criminal activities create
nuisances and generally degrade the livability of neighborhoods surrounding
rental properties with a history of chronic violations. Existing remedial
measures in the code are insufficient to achieve prompt code compliance
resulting in significant adverse impacts on the public health, safety, and
welfare of the city, its citizens and neighborhoods including the quality of
life for tenants. To expedite compliance with the code at such properties and
thereby assure better quality housing for tenants and the neighborhoods, the
Council finds it necessary to adopt additional remedial measures including
permitting and monitoring of problem properties for more effective compliance
with the code at such properties, and to the extent circumstances demonstrate,
on a case-by-case basis the need for application of the remedial measures to
attain and maintain code compliance for protection of the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the city.
   (B)   Declaration of necessity. It is deemed necessary in order to promote
public health, welfare, good order and safety of the city and its residents
that persons renting residential properties where there exist certain unsafe
building, minimum housing, zoning or nuisance code violations in addition to
certain criminal violations should be subject to a permitting system to allow
for increased oversight and inspection by the city for compliance. Permitting
will:
      (1)   Reduce the likelihood that certain residential housing
accommodations with chronic code violations will become public nuisances in
violation of G.S. § 19-l(b);
      (2)   Promote responsible management of rental housing accommodations;
      (3)   Assist in providing a safe habitat for residents and neighbors of
rental housing;
      (4)   Safeguard property values and provide suitable safe rental housing
stock;
      (5)   Reduce the likelihood that housing accommodations where such
problems most frequently have arisen and which are unfit for human habitation,
dangerous, or injurious to the public will exist or be occupied;
      (6)   Expedite repair of residential housing accommodations where such
problems arise.

§ 154.03 PERMITTING OF PROBATIONARY RESIDENTIAL RENTAL DWELLINGS.
   (A)   Unless compliance with this article is deemed pursuant to §
154.05 of this chapter, it shall be unlawful for an owner to rent, to receive
rental income from, or to offer for rent, any probationary rental residential
dwelling required to be permitted under this part without first obtaining a
permit for the dwelling under this part or when the permit issued under this
part is revoked. The owner of a probationary rental residential dwelling shall
hold a permit under this part for each probationary rental residential dwelling
and shall abide by the Standards in §
154.04 of this chapter in order to be eligible to retain the permit. Each
probationary rental residential dwelling is a separate dwelling for fee
purposes and for the requirement to be permitted. When an apartment house or
other structure consisting of multiple dwelling units is required to have a
probationary rental occupancy permit as a result of a violation which applies
to the building as a whole, a single permit will be required for the building
as a whole and the permit will be issued to the owner of the building. However
each dwelling unit within the building which separately qualifies as a
probationary rental residential dwelling shall be subject to separate permit
fees and the requirement to be permitted. The Department of Inspections shall
assign violations in common areas of an apartment complex to the apartment
building or structure nearest to the common area where the violation occurred.
   (B)   Every application for the probationary rental occupancy permit
prescribed herein, or a permit amendment to add another probationary rental
residential dwelling to the permit, shall be upon a form approved by the
Director of the Inspections Department and shall be filed with the Inspections
Department. Every application shall be made under oath and shall contain the
information required to show the owner is eligible for a permit under this
article and sufficient information to enable the Inspections Department to
determine that the standards of §
154.04 are being, or will be, met at any probationary rental residential
dwelling to be permitted. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete
application and a non-refundable application fee of fifty dollars ($50), the
Inspections Department shall review each application and determine whether the
application should be approved. The Inspections Department shall deny any
application which does not satisfy the minimum requirements of this article and
any application submitted by an owner during a period of permit revocation.
   (C)   Any person required to have a probationary rental occupancy permit
shall be permitted for two (2) years. If a violation of the permit occurs, the
permit requirement is extended for the probationary rental residential dwelling
covered by the permit for two (2) years following the date of the violation. To
be released from the requirement for a probationary rental occupancy permit,
the owner must have had no violation of any of the code provisions listed in §
154.02 and the standards in §
154.04 for the two (2) year period immediately before the permit period ends
and the dwelling must be approved as compliant with the code in a final
inspection. Final inspections will be conducted only upon the request of the
owner. When the owner fails to request an inspection within fifteen (15) days
after the date the permit requirement was due to expire, the Department of
Inspections, after written notice to the owner and tenant, shall inspect the
permitted dwelling for compliance with the code provisions listed in §
154.02 of this chapter and the standards in §
154.04 of this chapter.
   (D)   The permit fee shall be one hundred fifty dollars ($150) for each year
of the two year requirement. If an additional two years is added to the permit,
the fee shall be increased to three hundred dollars ($300) for each year. Such
fee shall be due and payable when the permit issues with annual fees for
subsequent years due and payable annually.
   (E)   Any person taking title to a probationary rental residential dwelling
not previously holding a permit shall apply for a probationary rental occupancy
permit. Any person taking title to a permitted probationary rental residential
dwelling shall be the holder of a temporary probationary rental permit and
shall apply for a permit in the new owners name within thirty (30) days of
taking title to the dwelling. The new owner of the dwelling, who is not a prior
owner or related by marriage or within the fifth degree of kinship to the
seller, may request that the Director of the Inspections Department remove the
requirement that the dwelling have a probationary rental occupancy permit. For
the request to be eligible for consideration, the new owner must:
      (1)   Have paid all outstanding fees and civil penalties for the
dwelling;
      (2)   Have no violations or pending violations of this article issued to
the new owner;
      (3)   Obtain from the Inspections Department a determination that the
dwelling complies with the standards in §
154.04 of this chapter; and
      (4)   Submit an affidavit which shows proof of title transfer, that the
new owner is not a prior owner, not related by marriage or within the fifth
degree of kinship to the seller, is not a business affiliate of the prior
owner, and that the lease for the dwelling includes a provision making
violations of the code by the tenant grounds for eviction.
   (F)   An application shall be accompanied by a notarized statement
identifying and appointing a process service agent for receipt of a notice of
violation or order from the city for all violations at the dwelling or other
notices required pursuant to this chapter. The refusal of service by the
process service agent of a notice of violation or order, or a notice of
violation or orders returned undelivered, shall be grounds to revoke the
permit. Failure by the owner to maintain a duly appointed process service
agent, or to appoint a process service agent within thirty (30) days of being
so ordered, shall be grounds to deny or revoke the Probationary Rental
Occupancy Permit.
   (G)   The Inspections Department shall maintain a list of all dwellings and
dwelling units which are probationary rental residential dwellings and subject
to the permit requirements of this article. The Inspections Department shall
send a copy of the list of probationary rental residential dwellings, which
shows whether each listed dwelling is permitted, to the Office of the City
Clerk, for public inspection, at least once every thirty (30) days. The
Inspections Department shall use other reasonable means to make the list
publicly available including the information systems for public access to City
information.
(Ord. O-2009-24, passed 7-21-09)
§ 154.04 STANDARDS.
   (A)   The permittee shall respond to the department making contact, either
in person or by telephone within two (2) business days after being contacted at
the telephone number provided in the application, to the Monroe Police
Department, the Fire Department, Planning and Development Department, or the
Inspections Department. If the permittee is required to submit documents to a
City Department, the permittee shall submit all required documents to the
department making the contact within three (3) days of the response. The
permittee may designate, and agency accept, a licensed rental agency as the
person responsible for responding to calls for assistance from the Monroe
Police Department, the Fire Department, or the Inspections Department. The
designated agency must have at least one agent located in the city or within
twenty-five (25) miles of the City's planning jurisdiction who is authorized by
it to respond to calls.
   (B)   The permittee shall maintain the dwelling so that it does not violate
any applicable provision of the Zoning Code, minimum housing code, or other
code provision or criminal law listed in the definition of probationary rental
residential dwelling at §
154.02 of this chapter.
   (C)   The permittee shall maintain a current list of occupants. Upon
request, by City inspectors, police, and fire and emergency response personnel
investigating violations or potential violations of this article, the permittee
shall present the list of occupants to the investigating personnel.
   (D)   The permittee shall obtain a Certificate of Code Compliance issued by
the Inspection Department before a vacant probationary rental residential
dwelling with a revoked permit or with an outstanding unresolved notice of
violation of the code is occupied by another tenant.
   (E)   The permittee shall comply with the requirements of this article.
(Ord. O-2009-24, passed 7-21-09)
§ 154.05 COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Within thirty (30) days of the designation of a dwelling as
probationary residential rental dwelling, the owner shall deliver a written
notification, using the form approved by the Department of Inspections, to each
tenant that the dwelling is a probationary rental residential dwelling. Prior
to entering into a rental agreement, whether oral or written, the permittee
shall provide written notification, using the form approved by the Department
of Inspections, to each prospective tenant that the dwelling is a probationary
rental residential dwelling. The permittee shall provide proof of the delivery
to the Inspections Department along with a copy of the notification within ten
(10) days of receipt of proof of delivery.
   (B)   The Monroe utility departments shall not provide city utilities
including water, sewer, electricity or gas service to a vacant probationary
rental residential dwelling which has no permit due to failure to comply with §
154.03 or revocation until a Certificate of Code Compliance has been issued for
the dwelling pursuant to Subsection (D) above unless the City Manager, or
designee, determines such service is necessary for public health reasons and
will not be used by occupants of the dwelling for residential purposes.
   (C)   Any person required by this article to have a permit for a
probationary rental residential dwelling who files a complete application for
any required permit within ten (10) days following notice from the Inspections
Department that this article applies to the dwelling shall be deemed compliant
with this article unless and until the application is denied.
   (D)   It shall be unlawful to rent, to receive rental income from, or to
offer for rent a dwelling subject to the permit requirements of this article
beginning ten (10) days after service of notice by the Inspections Department
that a permit is required under this part unless a complete application for a §
154.03(A) permit has been submitted for the dwelling.
   (E)   Any person who holds a privilege license pursuant to state law as a
rental agency and is not the record owner of the probationary rental
residential dwelling shall be deemed compliant with this article upon filing
with the Inspections Department an affidavit or other notarized statement that
the agency relationship has been terminated and that the failure to comply with
the noticed violations was caused by the record owner’s refusal to comply with
the article.
   (F)   Any person who has been designated as a process service agent and is
not the record owner of the probationary rental residential dwelling shall be
deemed compliant with this article upon promptly notifying the Inspections
Department that the notice or order delivered for service cannot be delivered
to the owner and upon filing with the Inspections Department an affidavit or
other notarized statement that the agency relationship has been terminated and
that all prior notices and orders were delivered to the owner.
   (G)   If the activities, violations or abatements which individually or
cumulatively could cause a property or dwelling to be deemed a probationary
rental residential dwelling under §
154.02 are the result of tenant behavior or actions, an owner shall be entitled
to relief from any such violation(s) (i.e., the violation(s) shall not be
counted as a strike against the owner) by evicting or removing the tenant, so
long as the owner can show that the tenant behavior or action is the basis of
the eviction or removal of the tenant. No owner may obtain relief for more than
two (2) violations in any three (3) year period per dwelling under this
subsection. Any owner who evicted or removed the tenant as a result of the
tenant causing such violation(s), whether such removal is the result of a
tenant voluntarily vacating the dwelling or as a result of court action, shall
be deemed compliant with this Article upon filing with the Inspections
Department an affidavit or other notarized statement stating that :
      (1)   The tenant cited for the violation no longer resides at the
dwelling; or
      (2)   The attached complaint was filed to evict the tenant and listing
the actions showing diligence in effecting the eviction and attaching a copy of
the signed lease with the required right to evict. An owner shall also be
entitled to relief from any subsequent violation(s) that occur while the action
to evict the tenant is pending upon a similar showing to the Inspections
Department.
      (3)   If the court has denied the owner's diligent pursuit to evict the
tenant, it shall be sufficient if the owner does not renew the tenant's lease
at the end of the then current term and instead terminates the lease. When an
owner shows an inability to access a dwelling for purposes of effecting
remedial activity as ordered by the Inspections Department due to a court order
in an eviction proceeding, the failure to complete the required remedial
activity as previously ordered by the Inspections Department is not a violation
for purposes of determining whether the dwelling is a probationary rental
residential dwelling until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the court
order banning access or within such additional time for compliance as is
provided by the Inspections Department.
(Ord. O-2009-24, passed 7-21-09)
§ 154.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   Enforcement may be by any one (1) or a combination of the following methods,
and the institution of an action under any of these methods shall not relieve
any party from any civil proceeding prescribed for violations of this article.
When a violation continues from day to day without interruption, a new and
separate violation occurs when the violation continues after service of the
notice or order of the immediately preceding violation for the unlawful
activity.
   (A)   Civil penalties.
      (1)    Any person who shall rent, or offer for rent, a probationary
rental residential dwelling without first applying for and obtaining a permit

rental residential dwelling permitted under this article in violation of this

1.1.7. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   In the interpretation and application of this Ordinance, all provisions
shall be considered as minimum requirements and shall not be deemed to limit or
repeal any other powers or authority granted under the North Carolina General
Statutes.
1.1.8. REVIEW OF PRIVATE AGREEMENTS.
   The City may review private agreements, such as those related to maintenance
of private common open space, shared parking, or cross access easements, but
the City is not responsible for monitoring or enforcing private covenants and
restrictions.
1.1.9. PERMIT CHOICE AND VESTED RIGHTS.
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to conform to G.S. § 160D-108
and G .S. § 160D-108.1, recognize that local government approval of development
typically follows significant investment in site evaluation, planning,
development costs, consultant fees, and related expense and to establish
certain vested rights in order to ensure reasonable certainty, stability, and
fairness in the development regulation process, to secure the reasonable
expectations of landowners, and to foster cooperation between the public and
private sectors in land-use planning and development regulation.
   B.   Permit Choice. If a land development regulation is amended between the
time a development permit application was submitted and a development permit
decision is made or if a land development regulation is amended after a
development permit has been challenged and found to be wrongfully denied or
illegal, G.S. § 143-755 applies. The applicant may choose which version of the
development regulation will apply to the application. If the development permit
applicant chooses the version of the rule or ordinance applicable at the time
of the permit application, development permit applicant shall not be required
to await the outcome of the amendment to the rule, map or ordinance prior to
acting on the development permit.
      1.   Development Projects that Require Multiple Permits to Complete a
Development Project. the development permit applicant may choose the version of
each of the land development regulation applicable to the project upon
submittal of the application for the initial development permit. This Section
is applicable only for those subsequent development permit applications filed
within eighteen (18) months of the date following the approval of an initial
permit. This Section does not limit or affect the duration of any vested rights
established. For purposes of the vesting protections of this Section, an
erosion control and sedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an
initial development permit.
   C.   Vested rights shield prior-approved development from the requirement to
comply with changes in this UDO or other City requirements. Vested rights are
applied in accordance with G.S. § 160D-108 and G.S. § 160D-108.1.
   D.   Prior Vesting. Amendments, supplements, repeals, or other changes in
zoning regulations and zoning boundaries shall not be applicable or enforceable
without the consent of the landowner with regard to lots for which building
permits, multi-phased development approvals, or vested rights have been
established (pursuant to State law) prior to the enactment of this UDO making
the change(s), so long as the vested rights remain valid and unexpired. The
following shall apply to prior vesting:
      1.   Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development
permit application has been submitted and subsequently issued in accordance
with G.S. § 143-755.
      2.   Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application
authorizing the subdivision has been submitted and subsequently issued in
accordance with G.S. § 143-755.
      3.   A site-specific vesting plan pursuant to G.S. § 160D-108.l.
      4.   A multi-phased development pursuant to G.S. § 160D-108(f).
      5.   A vested right established by the terms of a development agreement.
   E.   Development Approvals.
      1.   Except for building permits, site-specific vesting plans,
development agreements, and multi-phased developments, any development approval
under this UDO shall be vested from changes in this UDO for a period of one (1)
year from the date of approval, provided the development subject to the
approval complies with all applicable terms and conditions. Development
approvals include, but are not limited to, zoning permits, site plan approvals,
special use permits, variances and certificate of appropriateness, and the
like.
      2.   A valid development approval shall not expire if work on the project
has substantially commenced within the initial validity period. Substantial
commencement of work shall be determined by the Director of Planning based on
the following:
         a.   The development has received and maintained a valid erosion and
sedimentation control permit and conducted grading activity on a continuous
basis and not discontinued it for more than thirty (30) days;
         b.   The development has installed substantial on-site infrastructure;
or
         c.   The development has received and maintained a valid building
permit for the construction and approval of a building foundation.
      3.   Once vesting rights have been established, development permits
expire for an uncompleted development project if development work is
intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than
twenty-four (24) consecutive months.
   F.   Building Permit. The issuance of a building permit establishes a vested
right to the development for a period of six (6) months, as long as the
building permit complies with the terms and conditions of approval of that
building permit. If after commencement, the work is discontinued for a period
of twelve (12) months, the permit shall expire.
   G.   Site-Specific Vesting Plan.
      1.   Development approvals identified by this UDO as site-specific
vesting plans shall be granted a vested right to develop for a maximum period
of two (2) years from the date of the approval, provided the development
subject to the approval complies with all applicable terms and conditions.
      2.   The following types of development approvals shall be considered
site-specific vesting plans:
         a.   Concept plans associated with a conditional rezoning approved in
accordance with Section
3.4.6., Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning);
         b.   Major subdivision final plat approved in accordance with Section
3.4.16., Major Subdivision Final Plat;
         c.   Planned developments approved in accordance with Section
3.4.7., Planned Developments;
         d.   Major subdivision preliminary plat approved in accordance with
Section
3.4.15., Major Subdivision Preliminary Plat;
         e.   Site and development plan (Site Plan) approved in accordance with
Section
3.4.17., Site and Development Plan;
         f.   Special use permit approved in accordance with Section
3.4.9., Special Use Permits.
      3.   Site-specific vesting plans meeting the definition of multi-phase
development shall be vested in accordance with Section
1.1.9(H).
      4.   Approved site-specific vesting plans may receive a vesting period
exceeding two (2) years upon approval of a vested right certificate in
accordance with Section
3.4.8, Vested Rights Certificate, not to exceed a total of three (3) years.
   H.   Multi-Phase Development.
      1.   A multi-phase development plan that occupies at least twenty-five
(25) acres of land area is subject to a master plan that depicts the types and
intensities of all uses as part of the approval and includes more than one
phase shall be considered as a multi-phase development plan that is granted a
vested right to develop for a period of seven (7) years from the date of
approval of the first site plan associated with development.
      2.   Vesting shall commence upon approval of the site plan for the first
phase of the development.
      3.   The vested right shall remain in affect provided the development
does not expire and provided it complies with all the applicable terms and
conditions of the approval.
   I.   Vested Rights Certificate. Site-specific vesting plans that do not
qualify for a multi-phase development may have a vesting period that exceed two
(2) years upon approval of a vested right certificate in accordance with
Section
3.4.8., Vested Rights Certificate, not to exceed a total of three (3) years.
   J.   Validity after Development Discontinuation. As outlined in G.S. § 160D-
108(d), after a development has substantially commenced work, statutory vested
rights "expire for an uncompleted development project if development work is
intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than
twenty-four (24) consecutive months."
   K.   Limits of Site-Specific Vesting Plans.
      1.   Even with the establishment of a site-specific vesting plan, the
property owner must meet all standards and conditions of the development
approval. Nothing in this code shall prohibit the revocation of the original
approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and
conditions of the approval or the Unified Development Code according to G.S. §
160D-403(t). The development remains subject to subsequent review and approvals
to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval as
provided for in the original approval or by applicable regulations.
      2.   The establishment of a vested right pursuant to the Unified
Development Ordinance shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning that
imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or
intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and
are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the City of
Monroe, including, but not limited, to building, fire, plumbing, electrical,
and mechanical codes.
      3.   New and amended zoning regulations that would be applicable to
certain property but for the establishment of a vested right shall become
effective upon the expiration or termination of the vested rights period
provided for in this chapter.
      4.   Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions of
G.S. §§ 160D-1111 and 160D-1115 apply, except that a building permit shall not
expire or be revoked because of the running time while a zoning vested right
under this section is outstanding.
      5.   Any vested rights for a site-specific vesting plan are subject to
the exceptions specified in G.S. § 160D-108.l.
      6.   Modifications to Site-Specific Vesting Plans. An approved site-
specific vesting plan and its conditions may be modified with the approval of
the owner and the local government in accordance with Section 3.4.6., Zoning
Map Amendments (Rezoning) subsection D.4: Conditional Zoning for minor and
major modifications.
   L.   Revocation of Development Approvals and Site-Specific Vesting Rights.
Development approvals shall be revoked for the following:
      1.   Any substantial departure from the approved application, plans or
specifications;
      2.   Refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of any applicable
local development regulation or any State law delegated to the City for
enforcement purposes in lieu of the State;
      3.   False statements or misrepresentations made in securing the
approval.
      4.   Any development approval mistakenly issued in violation of an
applicable State or local law may also be revoked.
         a.   If at any time the Director of Planning and Development
determines a development approval or vested right shall be revoked, the
developer will be notified in writing stating the reasons with evidence
supporting the finding and determination.
         b.   The revocation of a development approval by staff may be appealed
in accordance to Section
3.4.11., Appeals.
         c.   If a development approval or vested rights is revoked, then the
underlying vesting document is also revoked.
   M.   Common Law Vesting. A common law vested right is established only when
the following can be demonstrated by the landowner:
      1.   There is an affirmative governmental act by the City in the form of
an approval of a permit or development approval under this Unified Development
Ordinance (UDO); and
      2.   The landowner relies on this affirmative governmental act in good
faith and makes substantial expenditures to develop the land; and
      3.   It would be inequitable to prevent the landowner from proceeding to
develop the land consistent with the terms and conditions of the permit or
development approval relied upon.

1.1.10. SEVERABILITY.
   The legislative intent of the City Council in adopting this Ordinance is
that all provisions shall regulate development in accordance with the existing
and future needs of the City as established in this Ordinance, and promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare of the landowners and residents of
Monroe. If any section, subsection, sentence, boundary, or clause of this
Ordinance is for any reason held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions
of the Ordinance. The City Council hereby declares that it would have passed
this Ordinance and any section, subsection, sentence, boundary, clause, and
phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections,
subsections, sentences, boundaries, clauses, or phrases are declared invalid.
1.1.11. PROCEDURES UPON DISCOVERY OF VIOLATIONS.
   A.   If the Planning Director finds that any provision of this chapter is
being violated, he or she shall send a written notice to the person responsible
for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the
action necessary to correct it. Additional written notices may be sent at the
Planning Director’s discretion.
   B.   The final written notice (and the initial written notice may be the
final notice) shall state what action the Administrator intends to take if the
violation is not corrected and shall advise that the Administrator’s decision
or order may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
   C.   Violations of this chapter will be handled in pursuant to §§ 10.19 and
10.99 of the City of Monroe Code of Ordinances.
1.2. ZONING MAP
1.2.1. OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   A.   The boundaries and locations established by this Ordinance shall be
designated on a map or maps entitled Official Zoning Map(s) of the City of
Monroe. The Official Zoning Map, as amended, is hereby incorporated by
reference herein and made part of this Ordinance.
   B.   No changes shall be made in the Official Zoning Map except in
conformity with the procedures set forth in this UDO.
   C.   The Official Zoning Map is the final authority as to zoning status of
all lands and waters in the City.
   D.   In accordance with G.S. § 160D-105, the Official Zoning Map shall be
maintained in a digital format and paper copies shall be kept on file in the
Planning and Development Department and are available for public inspection
during normal business hours.
   E.   The digital version of the Official Zoning Map maintained in the
offices of the Planning and Development Department shall be the final authority
as to the status of the current zoning district classification of land in the
City’s jurisdiction.
   F.   In the event that any uncertainty exists with regards to intended
boundaries as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the Planning and Development
Director is authorized to interpret the boundaries. The following rules shall
apply:
      1.   For boundaries shown as approximately following a street, highway
alley, road, right-of-way, parkway, utility line, railroad, stream, or
watercourse, the boundary shall be deemed to be the centerline of such feature.
      2.   If a street, alley, railroad, or utility easement forming the
boundary between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from
dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as following the
centerline of the abandoned or vacated roadbed or utility easement.
      3.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, shall be
construed as following the lot line as it existed when the boundary was
established; provided, however, that, where such boundaries are adjacent to a
street or alley and the zoning status of the street or alley is not indicated,
the boundaries shall be construed as running to the middle of the street or
alley. If a subsequent minor adjustment (such as from settlement of boundary
dispute or overlap) results in the lot line moving ten (10) feet or less, the
zoning boundary shall be interpreted as moving with the lot line.
      4.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the boundary of the
City limits shall be construed as following the boundary of Municipal
Corporation.
      5.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following a river, stream,
canal, lake or other watercourse shall be interpreted as following the
centerline of the watercourse as it actually exists, and as moving with that
centerline to the extent the watercourse moves as a result of natural resources
(flooding, erosion, sedimentation, etc.).
      6.   Boundaries indicated as following physical features other than those
mentioned in subsections of this Section shall be construed as following such
physical features, except where variation of the actual location from the
mapped location would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, and in such
case the boundary shall be interpreted in such manner as to avoid changing the
zoning status of any lot or parcel.
      7.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in subsections of this Section shall be construed as being parallel
to or extensions of such feature.
      8.   Wherever a single lot is located within two or more different zoning
districts, each portion of the lot shall be subject to all the regulations
applicable to the zoning district where it is located.
      9.   Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map
shall be determined by the scale of the map.
1.3. ZONING DISTRICTS
1.3.1. ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   A.   Purpose. For this purpose of this UDO, the City of Monroe is hereby
divided into traditional zoning districts, mixed-use districts, overlays, and
conditional districts. Land zoned under the previous UDO shall be reclassified
to one of the zoning district classifications in this UDO, as set forth in
Sections 4-6.
   B.   Intent. It is the intent of this Section to list all zoning districts
(traditional and mixed use).
      1.   Section 4 of this UDO establishes all standards for traditional
zoning districts.
      2.   Section 5 establishes all standards for mixed-use districts. The
location of mixed-use zoning districts shall be consistent with the mixed-use
nodes recognized in the City’s Land Use Plan, Forward Monroe.
      3.   Section 6 establishes all standards for overlays.
      4.   Conditional districts shall follow the standards set forth in
Section 3 and Section
4.6 of this UDO.
   C.   Transition to New Zoning Districts. As of the effective date of this
UDO, land zoned with a zoning district classification from the previous UDO
shall be translated or reclassified to one of the zoning district
classifications in this UDO as set forth in Sections 4-6.
Table 1.3.1 below shows the translation or reclassification of the former
zoning districts used in the previous UDO to the corresponding new zoning
districts under this UDO. If a use was a lawfully established permitted use
before the effective date of this UDO, and is subsequently made a special use
in
Table 7.1 Table of Permissible Uses, the use shall be considered a lawfully
established special use. Previously approved conditional districts are
recognized as conforming and shall continue under the provisions of the adopted
conditional district ordinance. Unless prohibited by City Council as part of
the original approval, a conditional rezoning approved before the effective
date of this UDO may include minor changes from the approved conditions in
accordance with the standards for site and development plan reviews in Section
3.4.17. To the extent a landowner proposes development that is not allowed by a
conditional zoning approved before effective date of this UDO, it must be
amended in accordance with the standards for a zoning map amendment (rezoning)
consistent with Section
3.4.6.

community’s vision, identifies the community’s values, and outline the plans,
programs, policies, and projects that will fulfill the vision over time.

regulations is the next step toward achieving that goal. The land development
regulations have been updated to the Unified Development Ordinance and contain.

considered as minor modifications or major modifications, in accordance with
the following:

architectural character and remains consistent with design parameters
established in the approval; and
               6.   Changes to the arrangement or location of buildings
provided there is no increase in the number of buildings, size or amount of
impervious surface.

         b.   Major Modifications Considered Amendments.
            i.   Changes that materially affect the basic configuration of the
development, basic parameters of conditions of approval, or that exceed the
scope of minor modifications are considered major modifications or amendments.

               1.   Increase in building height;
               2.   Changes in proposed use types;
               3.   Increase in lot count or change in intensity;

must be reviewed and considered in accordance with the procedures and standards
established for the original approval of the conditional rezoning application.

IMAGES/0-0-0-8429.png]
   A.   Applicability. Approval of a planned development and a corresponding
planned development master plan (PDMP) is required for a Planned Commerce
Development PCD) and Planned Unit Development (PUD). Standards specific to
planned developments are defined in Section
4.5: Planned Districts.
   B.   Purpose.
      1.   Planned Commerce Developments (PCD) and Planned Unit Developments
(PUD) also referred to as “planned developments”) are intended to provide
uniform means for amending the Official Zoning Map to establish a PCD or PUD
zoning district.
         a.   The planned development districts provide an orderly, master plan
style development with a mix of land uses and intensities for master planned
commercial and residential developments.
         b.   Planned development districts are developed under unified control
in accordance with flexibility for innovative design and procedures that are
conducive to creating mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented development that makes
efficient use of land.
      2.   Planned developments allow for creation of customized, planned
development standards and deviations from design standards requirements set
forth in this UDO, but not from permissible uses. In return for a higher
quality of development with more amenities than might otherwise result from a
strict application of standards in the Ordinance.
      3.   A planned development must be approved along with a Planned
Development Master Plan (PDMP). A planned development may only be obtained
through an amendment (rezoning) and is required to go through the amendment
process set forth in this UDO. Planned developments allow for modification of
standards found in this UDO, as per this Section.
   C.   Deviation Standards.
      1.   Except as noted in this Section, development in a planned
development must conform to all applicable provisions of this UDO.
      2.   In no circumstance may a PCD or a PUD request to deviate from
process or administrative related requirement as set forth in this UDO.
      3.   According to NC General State Statutes, deviations from the Unified
Development Ordinance (UDO) may be requested a part of the Planned Development
Master Plan.
      4.   Any proposed deviations shall be accompanied by a narrative
explanation demonstrating that the modification is necessary and how potential
adverse impacts shall be mitigated.
   D.   Application Requirements. All PCDs and PUDs shall be required to submit
a Planned Development Master Plan (PDMP). If the application submitted does not
conform to all applicable regulations, the applicant shall resubmit the plans
to the Planning and Development Department for redistribution and review. A
PDMP may be separated into multiple pages and maps and shall contain, at
minimum:
      1.   Proof of unified control; PCDs and PUDs shall be planned and
developed as a whole in a single development operation or approved programmed
phases of development;
      2.   Existing conditions map;
      3.   General layout map showing boundaries of the planned development
district, density/intensity of land uses in built areas, landscaped areas,
buffers, vehicular use areas, parking areas, street network and street types,
and pedestrian and multimodal systems;
      4.   Proposed location of all buildings. The building locations, to allow
for a level of flexibility, do not need to show exact layout and configuration,
but shall show at minimum areas where proposed buildings shall be located and
the minimum setbacks proposed;
      5.   Maximum square footage of non-residential uses;
      6.   Maximum number of dwelling units (if applicable) and housing types;
      7.   Parking plan;
      8.   Utilities plan;
      9.   Tree conservation plan;
      10.   Stormwater plan;
      11.   Phasing plan (if applicable);
      12.   Traffic impact study;
      13.   Master sign plan;
      14.   Indicate height of all proposed structures;
      15.   Development standards must be clearly defined and include all
proposed uses, setback requirements for structures, lot dimensions, maximum
height, parking, lighting, and landscaping;
      16.   Any proposed standards to be modified (as allowed per this Section)
as part of the approval process. If a standard is not listed as being modified,
the standard set forth in the UDO shall apply.
   E.   Approval Process. PCDs and PUDs (which require a rezoning) shall follow
the approval process for a rezoning as defined in Section
3.4.6: Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning).
   F.   Administrative Changes to a Planned Development. The Director may
administratively approve minor modifications to approved planned development
master plans. Subsequent plans and permits for development within an approved
planned development may include minor modifications to the conditions of
approval, provided the development continues to meet the minimum requirements
of the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO). Minor modifications are limited to
changes that have no material effect on the character of the development or
changes that address technical considerations that could not reasonably be
anticipated at the time of the planned development approval. The following
minor modifications may be approved by the Director of Planning and
Development:
      1.   Changes to the location of entrances or driveways, the rearrangement
of internal streets, drives or access restriction;
      2.   Changes to the configuration of parking areas including the number
of parking spaces provided the changes are within ten percent (10%) of approved
parking spaces;
      3.   Changes to the configuration or location to open space or placement
of required amenities, provided the amount of open space (whether active or
passive) is unchanged;
      4.   Changes to the configuration of landscape yards, including the types
of materials, provided minimum width and planting requirements are met;
      5.   Changes to the proposed building elevation or façade including
materials, provided that the change retains the same general architectural
character and remains consistent with design parameters established in the
approval; and
      6.   Changes to the arrangement or location of buildings provided there
is no increase in the number of buildings size or amount of impervious surface.
   G.   Amendment Changes to a Planned Development. Changes that materially
affect the basic configuration of the development, basic parameters of
conditions of approval, or that exceed the scope of minor modifications are
considered major modifications. Major modifications to approved Planned
Developments shall be treated as an amendment that is required to be reviewed
and considered in accordance with the procedures and standards established for
original planned development approval. Major modifications include, but are not
limited to:
      1.   Increase in building height;
      2.   Change in proposed use types;
      3.   Increase in lot count or change in intensity;
      4.   Decrease in open space; and
      5.   Substantial changes in the location of street (particularly if
streets are to be deleted or access points to the development moved so traffic
flows both inside and outside the development are affected).

following criteria:
         a.   The proposed use does not materially endanger the public health
or safety;
         b.   The proposed use meets all required conditions and specifications
of the UDO;
         c.   The proposed use will not substantially injure the value of
adjoining property unless the proposed use is a public necessity; and
         d.   The propose use will be in harmony with the area in which it is
located and otherwise be in general conformity with the City of Monroe’s
adopted plans.
      3.   The BOA shall determine whether the criteria above has been met
based upon the evidence submitted, and either approve the special use permit or
deny the special use permit, through a simple majority vote.
   E.   Additional Requirements.
      1.   The BOA may impose reasonable and appropriate conditions and
safeguards as a condition of approval but may not waive or reduce any
applicable standards set forth in this UDO if the modification or adjustment
meets the intent of the Forward Monroe Plan and provides a development of equal
or great quality.
   F.   Effect. A special use permit is binding and runs with the property
unless amended or modified. A special use permit shall expire if construction
has not begun within two years from the date of the special use permit approval

3.4.10. VARIANCE.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/bb584a2e60202eb6a05ed658ca416fbd6625d525/
IMAGES/0-0-0-8435.png]
   A.   Purpose. Variances allow certain provisions of this UDO (such as
height, setback, lot coverage, sign area, or other similar numerical standards)
when a hardship can be demonstrated by the landowner. The hardship should be
due to special circumstances or conditions (such as unique lot configuration or
topographical difficulties) making the typical application of standards an
undue hardship to the landowner. The BOA may grant the variance request if it
concludes that strict enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary
hardships for the applicant and that by granting the variance, the intent of
the particular ordinance provision shall be observed.
   B.   Application.
      1.   Variance applications shall be submitted to the Planning and
Development Department.
      2.   Variances shall only be granted on the basis of hardships, i.e. that
strict application of the UDO would cause unnecessary hardship on the property
owner.
      3.   Variances shall only be permitted for numerical standards of this
UDO and may not be sought for density or to allow a use not permissible in a
certain zoning district.
   C.   Review Process.
      1.   The application shall be reviewed by Planning and Development
Department for consistency with the regulations of this UDO and any other
relevant City ordinances and adopted plans. No variance shall be approved which
constitutes a danger to the general welfare of the public. A report shall be
provided to the BOA to use in their review. The report shall state the
variance’s departure with the typical numerical standard within the UDO, as
well as any staff recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by
the BOA.
      2.   The BOA shall review the variance application and hold an
evidentiary hearing.
   D.   Board of Adjustment Evidentiary Hearing.
      1.   Burden of Presenting Evidence. The burden of presenting a complete
application is upon the applicant and the hearing shall be quasi-judicial in
nature.
      2.   The BOA will review the proposed variance request and may vary any
of the provisions of the UDO upon a showing of all of the following:
         a.   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
         b.   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance,
         c.   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant
or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
         d.   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose,
and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and
substantial justice is achieved.
      3.   The BOA may also consider whether the variance is the minimum
necessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or
structure.
      4.   The BOA shall vote whether the criteria above has been met based
upon the evidence submitted, and either approve the request or deny the
request, through a four-fifths majority. The BOA may add additional
requirements but may not waive or reduce any applicable standards set forth in
this UDO.
   E.   Effect. Approval of a variance request allows for relief only from the
approved portion of the UDO. All other provisions of this UDO shall be met. A
variance shall not expire.
3.4.11. APPEALS.

IMAGES/0-0-0-8437.png]
   A.   Purpose. The BOA shall hear and decide appeals of UDO decisions of
administrative officials in compliance with G.S. § 160D-405. The appeal process
shall allow for a predictable procedure for persons aggrieved by an official
decision in the interpretation of this UDO by a review authority. Any person
who has standing under G.S. § 160D-1402(c) or the City may appeal an
administrative decision. The applicant shall have 30 days from receipt of a
written notice of a determination within which to file an appeal.
   B.   Application. A complete application shall be submitted to the Planning
and Development Director along with copies of any related plans or documents,
and written copy of the decision rendered by the administrative official.
   C.   Review Process.
      1.   The Director shall review the request for an appeal and forward a
report to the BOA.
   D.   Board of Adjustment Hearing. The BOA shall hold an evidentiary hearing
that shall be quasi-judicial in nature. The BOA, after the hearing, may grant
approval of an appeal request, grant approval of a revised request, or deny an
application for an appeal through a simple majority.
      1.   Criteria. The BOA is limited to whether the review authority erred
in the interpretation of the UDO and shall not hear evidence based on hardships
shall be addressed through the variance process).
   E.   Effect. An appeal approval shall not expire and may not be amended.

advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished until
after an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) has been
approved by the Historic District Commission (HDC) in compliance with the most
recently adopted Historic District Design standards. A COA is required to be
issued by the HDC prior the issuance of a building permit or other permit
granted for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving or demolishing
structures. A COA shall be required whether or not a building or other permit
is requested. The City and all public utility companies shall be required to

The action on an application for a COA shall be approval, approval with
modification, or denial by the HDC. Prior to any final action on an
application, the review criteria in § 152.058 shall be used to make findings of
fact indicating the extent to which the application for a COA is or is not
congruous with the historic aspects of the district or landmark. As part of its
review procedure, the HDC may view the premises and seek the advice of the
Department of Cultural Resources or other such experts as it may deem necessary
under the circumstances.
         g.   Review Criteria for Certificates of Appropriateness. When
considering a COA, the HDC shall take into account compliance with the Monroe
Historic District Design standards, architectural significance of the
structure, as well as the effect of such change or additions upon other
structures in the vicinity. In a historic district, it is not the intention of
these criteria or the standards to require the reconstruction or restoration of
individual or original buildings or prohibit the demolition or removal of same
or to impose architectural styles from particular historic period. In
considering new construction in a historic district, the HDC shall encourage
contemporary design which is harmonious with the character of the district. The
following criteria shall be considered, when relevant, along with companion
design standards and the standards of the Secretary of the Interior in
reviewing for a Certificate of Appropriateness.
            i.   Lot coverage, defined as the percentage of lot area covered by
primary structures;
            ii.   Setback, defined as the distance from the lot lines the
building;
            iii.   Building height;
            iv.   Spacing of buildings, defined as the distance between
adjacent buildings;

            xi.   Expression of architectural detailing, such as lintels,
cornices, brick bond, and decorative elements;
            xii.   Orientation of the building to the street;
            xiii.   Scale, determined by the size of the units of construction
and architectural details in relation to the human scale and also by the
relationship of the building mass to adjoining open space and nearby buildings
and structures;
            xiv.   Proportion of width to height of the total building facade;
            xv.   Archaeological sites and resources associated with standing
structures;
            xvi.   Major landscaping efforts that would impact known
archaeological sites;

construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior
architectural feature of a historic landmark or in a historic district which
does not involve a change in design, materials, or outer appearance. Nothing
herein shall be construed to prevent a property owner from making any use of
this property that is not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances, or
regulations. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the
maintenance or in the event of an emergency, the immediate restoration of any
existing aboveground utility structure without approval by the HDC.

the HDC must be heard by the BOA. Any appeal from the BOA’s decision shall be
heard by the Superior Court of Union County.
      7.   Submission of New Applications. If a COA is denied, anew application
affecting the same property may not be submitted within one (1) year from the
date of denial if the plans are substantially the same. If substantial change
is made in plans for the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration,
restoration or moving, a new application may be submitted.
      8.   Delay of Effective Date. An application for a COA authorizing the
demolition of a building or structure within a district may not be denied.
However, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for a period
of up to 365 days from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay
authorized by this Section shall be reduced by the HDC where it finds that the
owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all
beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During
such period the HDC may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in
an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the HDC finds that the
building has no particular significance or value toward maintaining the
character of a district, it shall waive all or part of such period and
authorize earlier demolition of removal.
      9.   Expiration. A COA shall expire twelve (12) months after the date of
issuance if the work authorized by the COA has not been commenced. If after
commencement the work is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued or a period

   C.   Forward Monroe Plan. The traditional zoning districts are intended to
implement the Land Use Character Areas identified in the City’s adopted Land
Use Plan, Forward Monroe. The Forward Monroe plan identifies ten (10) character
areas which are used broadly to describe the shape and form of future
development intended for each area. Emphasis is placed on density, scale,
compatibility of uses, and the way in which these choices shape the surrounding
area. The traditional zoning districts implement the Suburban, Rural,
Manufacturing, Logistics and Aerospace, Traditional Development, and portions
of the Community Corridor character areas defined in the Forward Monroe plan.
   D.   Groupings. The traditional zoning districts are categorized into four
groupings residential, business, industrial, and planned). Within the four
groupings exist zoning districts which implement the character areas as defined
in the Forward Monroe plan. The standards for each zoning district are defined
and enumerated in the Section
4.1.2: Grouping of Districts, below.
4.1.2. GROUPING OF DISTRICTS.
   A.   Residential. Where the phrases “all residential districts”,
“residential districts”, “zoned residentially”, and “residentially zoned” are
used in this UDO, the phrases shall be construed to include:       
      1.   RR— Residential, Rural.
      2.   RLD— Residential, Low Density.
      3.   RMD— Residential, Medium Density.
      4.   RHD— Residential, High Density.
   B.   Commercial. Where the phrases “all commercial districts”, “office and
commerce districts”, and “commercially zoned” are used in this UDO, the phrases
shall be construed to include:
      1.   OM — Office/Medical.
      2.   NB— Neighborhood Business.
      3.   GB — General Business.
   C.   Industrial. Where the phrases “all industrial districts”, “industrially
zoned”, and “zoned industrial” are used in this UDO, the phrases shall be
construed to include:
      1.   GI— Industrial, General.
      2.   HI — Industrial, Heavy.
   D.   Planned. Where the phrases “all planned districts”, “planned
districts”, and “planned developments” are used in this UDO, the phrases shall
be construed to include:
      1.   PCD— Planned Commerce Development.
      2.   PUD— Planned Unit Development.
   E.   Conditional. Where the phrases “all conditional districts”, “zoned
conditional”, and conditionally zoned” are used in this UDO, the phrases shall
be construed to include:
      1.   C-R— Conditional, Residential.
      2.   C-O— Conditional, Office.
      3.   C-C— Conditional, Commercial.
      4.   C-1— Conditional, Industrial.
   F.   Districts Distinguished. The City allows for different groupings of
traditional base zoning districts, planned districts, and conditional districts
which may be approved through a zoning map amendment (rezoning), subject to
Section
3.4.6: Zoning Map Amendment, of this UDO.
      1.   Residential, Commercial and Industrial. The Traditional Residential,
Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts are base zoning districts which
subject future development in the district to all required development
standards and regulations applicable to that district, as required in this UDO.
These standards are defined in Section
4.2: Residential Zoning Districts, Section
4.3: Commercial Zoning Districts, and Section
4.4: Industrial Zoning Districts.
      2.   Planned. The Planned Districts reclassify land to a planned district
(PCD or PUD). A planned district requires a Planned Development Master Plan
pursuant to Section
3.4.7: Planned Developments. The Planned Development Master Plan is a binding
site plan and all future development must comply with the applicable
development standards set forth in the Planned Development Master Plan. Planned
Districts allow for more flexibility of development standards through
customized planned development standards and deviations from design standards
requirements set forth in this UDO, but not from permissible uses.
      3.   Conditional. Consistent with G.S. § 160D-703, the Conditional
Districts reclassify land to a conditional district that is parallel to the
base traditional zoning district. As part of a reclassification to a
conditional district, future development is subjected to the same development
standards as the base district, except as modified by conditions that are
agreed to by the owner. These may also include and incorporate proposed
modifications to permitted uses or development standards. Conditions and site-
specific standards imposed in a conditional district shall be limited to those
that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to this
UDO, the City’s plans, or the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by
the development or use of the site. Conditional districts are further defined
in Section
4.6: Conditional Districts.
4.2. RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
   A.   Purpose and Intent. The residential zoning districts are intended to
provide a safe and healthy environment for residents to live. Uses which are
detrimental to the residential nature of these districts are discouraged. More
specifically, the residential zoning districts intend to:
      1.   Implement the residential and suburban land use character areas
identified in the Forward Monroe plan;
      2.   Permit a variety of residential uses, public and institutional uses,
and other supporting uses;
      3.   Promote open space and recreational opportunities for residents;
      4.   Offer a range of densities and housing stock to allow for a
sustainable mix of residential development, diversity and affordability;
      5.   Ensure adequate light. air, and privacy for all dwellings;
      6.   Preserve existing community character while providing for new infill
development consistent with the Forward Monroe plan; and
      7.   Discourage uses that would substantially interfere or would be
unsupportive of the character of the district. Compatible uses may be permitted
per Section
7: Permissible Uses and Standards. The three (3) residential zoning districts
are listed in Table 4.2, and their standards enumerated, in the Sections below.
   B.   Uses. The residential zoning districts permit residential uses and
compatible public and institutional uses. The residential districts allow for a
diverse range of housing stock and compatible uses across three (3) residential
districts: Residential, Low Density (RLD), Residential, Medium Density (RMD),
and Residential, High Density (RHO).

permitted if an applicant consents in writing to the single-family design
guidelines as defined in Section
8.7.2., Single Family Design Guidelines. Cluster development shall be a minimum
five (5) acres in size. Cluster development allows an applicant to qualify for
reduced minimum lot sizes per Table
4.2.3.1. and an increase in permitted density to a maximum of four (4) dwelling
units per acre. In accordance with Section
3.4.15., Major Subdivision Preliminary Plat, cluster developments shall meet
all requirements for a subdivision site plan and all other applicable City
ordinances and this UDO. A cluster development shall be reviewed as a
Conditional Rezoning as outlined in Section
4.6., “Conditional Zoning” following the Zoning Map Amendment process outlined
in Section
3.4.6., "Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning)."
      1.   Open Space. Cluster developments shall designate at least 30% of the
site for contiguous open space as defined in Section
8.8.E. The locations of the open space shall be reviewed at the time of
rezoning and be dependent upon the internal layout of the project and the
adjacent uses. Where properties do not require rezoning, open space shall be
reviewed as part of the subdivision preliminary plat. Internally located open
space may be needed to compliment a conservation subdivision form, while
perimeter open space may be needed to provide a transition or separation from
an adjacent lower density residential or agricultural use. Open space areas may
be used for the buffering required in Section
4.2.3.D.4 of this UDO.
      2.   Connectivity. Neighborhoods are to be interconnected and connect to
adjacent neighborhood. Flexibility for connections shall be provided to
preserve on-site environmental resources and preservation areas. Internal
connections shall occur through streets and multimodal connections.
      3.   Mixture of Housing (Lot) Types. Each cluster development shall
contain at least three (3) different housing types from
Table 4.2.3.1. No less than 20% and no more than 60% should be provided of one
housing type or lot size out of the housing types to be provided:

4.4. INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. The industrial zoning districts are intended to
provide a range of industrial uses and implement the manufacturing, logistics
and aerospace land use characteristic area as defined in the Forward Monroe
plan. More specifically, the industrial zoning districts intend to:
      1.   Provide employment opportunities;
      2.   Strengthen the economic base of the City of Monroe; and
      3.   Limit the potential impacts of incompatible industrial uses on
commercial and residential zoning districts.
   B.   Uses. The industrial zoning districts permit industrial uses that range
in intensities from small-scale, light industrial and manufacturing
establishments to large heavy industrial developments. Certain commercial and
office/medical uses relating to the character of the district and supporting
its activities and employees are also permitted. The two industrial zoning
districts are listed in
Table 4.4., and their standards defined in Section
4.4.1 and
4.4.2 below.
   C.   Design Standards. Industrial uses within the industrial zoning
districts must comply with the design standards provided for in Section
8.7: Design Standards, of this UDO.

4.5. PLANNED DISTRICTS.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. The City recognizes the need for innovative designs
that may require alternative development design standards and be developed
under a master plan approach. The City has two (2) planned development
districts to address the variations in project development, Planned Commerce
Development (PCD) and Planned Unit Development (PUD). Specifically, the planned
districts intend to:
      1.   Allow for creation of customized, planned development standards and
deviations from development standards set forth in this UDO, but not from
permissible uses;
      2.   Establish planned development districts which provide an orderly,
master plan style development with a mixture of land uses and intensities for
master planned commercial and residential developments;
      3.   Allow more efficient and creative use of land which utilize more
condensed developments areas, thereby lowering development costs of land;
      4.   Promote high quality design through the development of customized
standards; and
      5.   Allow for greater flexibility in development standards.
   B.   Requirements and Approval. Planned districts shall adhere to all
district standards and application requirements defined in Section
3.4.7: Planned Developments, of this UDO.

8.7: Design Standards, of this UDO.
   D.   Size. Shall be ten (10) acres or greater in size.
   E.   Intensity. Intensity shall not exceed 1.0 FAR.
   F.   Permissible Uses. As part of a PCD or PUD, permissible uses are defined
in the Table of Permissible Uses, Section
7.1.1: Traditional Districts Table of Permissible Uses. A PCD or PUD may not
modify permissible uses; only the permissible uses identified in the Table of
Permissible Uses may be permitted in the PCD or PUD zoning districts.
   G.   Open Space. In accordance with Section
8.8: Open Space Standards, of this UDO, a PCD shall require a minimum of 25% of
the gross land area to be reserved for common recreation and open space, and a
PUD shall require a minimum of 35% of the gross land area to be reserved for
common recreation and open space.
   H.   Percentage of Uses. Percentage of uses permitted shall be defined in

4.6. CONDITIONAL ZONING.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. This Section and Section
3.4.6: Zoning Map Amendment, of this UDO, establish the options and procedures
for conditional zoning within the City of Monroe. Conditional zoning,
consistent with G.S. § 160D-102, is defined as a legislative zoning map
amendment with site-specific conditions incorporated into the zoning map
amendment. Conditional zoning is intended to:
      1.   Provide an alternative to general zoning districts when a general
zoning district may allow a range of uses that could have adverse impacts on
public facilities or surrounding lands;
      2.   Create more flexibility in addressing the standards of this UDO to
accommodate unique site-specific conditions or contexts;
      3.   Allow a landowner to propose, and the City Council to consider,
additional conditions or restrictions on the range of allowable uses, use-
specific standards, development intensities, development standards, and other
applicable regulations; and
      4.   Allow a landowner to propose, and the City Council to consider, a
reduction in some development standards that would otherwise apply.
   B.   Standards.
      1.   Site Plan. A site plan shall be approved as part of a conditional
zoning in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section
3.4.6: Zoning Map Amendment, of this UDO. A site plan is part of the
legislative decision made by City Council.
      2.   Conditions. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a
conditional district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of
the development and use of the site to this UDO, the City’s plans, or the
impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the
site.
      3.   Minor Modifications. Consistent with G.S. § 160D-403(d), changes
after a conditional district can be permitted with written approval of proposed
changes by the Planning Director. Minor modifications to a conditional
district, for the purpose of this Section, are defined as all modifications
that do not involve a change in permitted uses or an increase in the density or
intensity of an overall development. Such minor modifications can be submitted,
reviewed, and approved or denied administratively by the Director. Any other
modification of the conditions and standards in a conditional district (major
modification) shall follow the same process as outlined in Section
3.4.6: Zoning Map Amendment.
      4.   Multiple Parcels. In accordance with G.S. § 160D-703, if multiple
parcels of land are subject to a conditional zoning, the owners of individual
parcels may apply for modification of the conditions so long as the
modification would not result in other properties failing to meet the terms of
the conditions. Any modifications approved shall only be applicable to those
properties who owners petition for the modification.
   C.   Process. Conditional districts shall follow the amendment process as
outlined in Section
3.4.6: Zoning Map Amendment.
   D.   Limitations on Conditions. While conditional districts provide
flexibility in addressing the standards of this UDO, in no instance shall any
of the following standards of this UDO be waived or reduced as part of a
conditional rezoning:
      1.   Any overlay district standards, as defined in Section 6: Overlays;
      2.   Maximum permitted density within a zoning district, unless
clustering or density incentives are permitted;
      3.   Required access standards for development, as defined in Section
8.1.7.E.5: Access;
      4.   Sign standards, as defined in Section
8.2: Signs;
      5.   Street yard buffers, as defined in Section
8.3.7: Street Yard Buffers;
      6.   Design standards for single family and duplex, multifamily, non-
residential and industrial buildings and development, as defined in Section
8.7: Design Standards;
      7.   Open space standards, as defined in Section
8.8: Open Space;
      8.   Mixed-Use zoning district standards, as defined in Section 5: Mixed-
Use Zoning Districts.
   E.   Conditional Residential (C-R) District Standards.
      1.   Intent. The Conditional Residential (C-R) district is established to
allow for residential developments that choose to go through the conditional
rezoning process defined in Section
3.4.6: Zoning Map Amendment.
      2.   Standards. All development within the C-R zoning district shall
comply with the standards of this UDO unless an applicant requests that, and
consents in writing to, additional or alternative requirements and standards,
per G.S. § 160D-703(b). An applicant may also request reduced levels of certain
standards in this UDO, subject to 4.6.D: Limitations on Conditions. If a
specific request is not made regarding applicable standards or regulations, the
standards defined in Section
4.2.2: RMD, in addition to all other applicable standards of this UDO, shall
apply.
   F.   Conditional Office (C-O) District Standards.
      1.   Intent. The Conditional Office (C-O) district is established to
allow for office and institutional developments that choose to go through the
conditional rezoning process defined in Section
3.4.6: Zoning Map Amendment.
      2.   Standards. All development within the C-O zoning district shall
comply with the standards of this UDO unless an applicant requests that, and
consents in writing to, additional or alternative requirements and standards,
per G.S. § 160D-703(b). An applicant may also request reduced levels of certain
standards in this UDO, subject to 4.6.D: Limitations on Conditions. If a
specific request is not made regarding applicable standards or regulations, the
standards defined in Section

specific request is not made regarding applicable standards or regulations, the
standards defined in Section
4.4.1: GI, in addition to all other applicable standards of this UDO, shall
apply.
SECTION 5: MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICTS
5.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
   A.   Intent. The City’s approved land use plan, Forward Monroe, designates
character areas and mixed-use centers on the Future Land Use Map (FLUM). Mixed-
use zoning districts, as defined in this Section, and their respective
development standards, are intended to implement these character areas, as
defined in Forward Monroe. Mixed-use zoning districts provide high-quality and
predictable designs within the public and private realm. Each implementing
mixed-use zoning district shall act as its own zoning district, with its own
specific standards of development and permissible uses. The mixed-use zoning
districts, their boundaries, and their respective standards shall be consistent
with Forward Monroe and other approved City plans. The Mixed-use zoning
districts intend to establish mixed-use development and redevelopment that is
pedestrian oriented at key locations throughout the City. These zoning
districts seek to enable the development of higher intensity mixed-use centers
with a mixture of new housing, shopping, working, and recreational options in
close proximity to one another. The mixture and proximity of uses enable
residents to meet some of their day to day needs without use of a vehicle.
   B.   Density. Character areas, as designated on the FLUM, are defined by a
variety of residential densities (density) and intensities. Density is measured
by dwelling units per net acre. All residential densities denoted in the
adopted Forward Monroe plan are not guaranteed by right. The appropriate
allocation of density shall encourage a sustainable development. Subdivision,
zoning, and site plan review criteria shall ensure that density assigned to new
development is consistent with established residential development patterns and
provides equitable use of the land.
      1.   Each mixed-use zoning district shall allow for residential density
and implement their respective character area as identified within the Future
Land Use Map defined in Forward Monroe. Due to the unique nature of mixed-use
districts, density greater than ten (10) dwelling units per acre may be
permitted.
      2.   Each mixed-use zoning district shall define its permitted density in
its respective district standards development table.

   A.   Implementing Map. Each mixed-use district is defined and delineated by
an implementing map that addresses the specific development vision of the
mixed-use district. The implementing map is keyed to specific development
standards (defined in each district’s development standards table) that
designates the appropriate form, scale and character of development and
redevelopment, rather than only distinctions in land uses.
   B.   District Development Standards Table. District development standards
are defined for each mixed-use district via a district development standards
table. The district development standards table shall apply to all properties
within the respective mixed-use district.
      1.   The development standards will have specific measurement
requirements that are specific to each mixed-use district.
      2.   Standards are provided relative to building height, density,
building placement, lot size configuration, frontage, parking, priority land
uses, incentives, open space, and architectural standards.
   C.   Table of Permissible Uses. Section
7.1.2: Mixed-Use Districts Table of Permissible Uses, identifies which uses may
be permitted as a principal use.
      1.   Each mixed-use district has its own column in the Mixed-Use
Districts Table of Permissible Uses.
      2.   Permissible uses are appropriate for each mixed-use district’s
purpose and are consistent with the goals and objectives of Forward Monroe,
this UDO, and all approved City Plans.

5.9. MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICT PARKING STANDARDS
   A.   Generally. Parking requirements for mixed-use districts shall refer to
the parking requirements defined in Section
8.4: Parking and Loading. In addition to the parking requirements in Section
8.4 the following shall apply to mixed-use districts:
      1.   Placement. Parking placement shall require parking be placed either
in the front, rear, or side of a property within mixed-use zoning districts, or
may allow any type of “off-street” parking placement.
      2.   Shared Parking Ratio. The mixture of uses within a building and the
provision of on-street parking, public parking lots, or similar parking
facilities allows for an overall decrease in parking demand. To support a
decrease in the need for parking, the parking requirements contained in Section
8.4: Parking, may be reduced by fifteen percent (15%) within the mixed-use
districts. Within the DCMX and DG-MX districts, parking may be reduced by
twenty percent (20%). This percentage may be modified through an Alternative
Parking Plan (APP) as identified in Section
8.4: Parking and Loading.
      3.   Structures. Accessory parking structures may be allowed as permitted
in each district standards development table.
(Am. Ord. O-2022-70, passed 11-8-22)
5.10. MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICT INCENTIVES
   A.   Generally. To promote development and redevelopment of mixed-use zoning
districts, incentives may be applied to buildings and developments which
qualify based upon the criteria of this Section. To encourage certain public
benefits and create a more dynamic public realm, density bonuses may be
permitted for the items defined below. Each mixed-use zoning district
development standards table shall define the maximum permitted density which
may be achieved through incentives. Providing 3 out of the 6 incentive
categories listed in this Section shall permit development at fifty percent
(50%) of the maximum density bonus through incentives. Providing 4 out of the 6
incentive categories listed in this Section shall permit development at one
hundred percent (100%) of the maximum density bonus through incentives. For
example, a mixed-use project in the DC-MX district that provides: 1.) Adaptive
reuse of an existing building, 2.) Streetscape enhancements, and 3.) Additional
greenspace in the form of a public plaza, would be able to develop at 12.5
dwelling units/acre.
   B.   Priority Land Use Incentives.
      1.   Priority land uses are recognized from previously adopted City plans
(i.e., Forward Monroe and the Downtown Master Plan) and represent a community
vision for a desired land use within a mixed-use zoning district. A mixed-use
zoning district may recognize priority land uses and offer density incentives
to implement priority land uses within a vertical or horizontal mixture of uses
in a building or development. To qualify for this incentive, each building or
development must include at least two (2) priority land uses each of which
shall be at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total.

District        Priority Land Use
DC-MX and DG-MX Multifamily, Commercial, Civic, Medical
CC-MX1          Multifamily, Commercial, Civic, Office, Medical
CC-MX2          Multifamily, Commercial, Civic, Office, Medical
RC-MX           Multifamily, Commercial, Civic, Office, Medical
MD-MX           Student/Medical Housing, Commercial, Civic, Office, Medical
 
   C.   Adaptive Reuse.
      1.   Adaptive reuse refers to the repurposing of an existing structure
for new use. For example, converting an old church into a restaurant, an old
train station into an office space, or an old mall into multifamily apartments.
Adaptive reuse includes structures that contain architectural or cultural value
as determined by the Director of Planning and Development.
      2.   Any development request for adaptive reuse of a building must be
stated on applicable City permits.
   D.   Streetscape Enhancements.
      1.   Incentives for streetscape enhancements shall be limited to the DC-
MX and DG-MX districts. Streetscape enhancements shall be defined as items
which increase the design quality of the street and its visual character by
implementing the Downtown Master Plan Section
5.4: Urban Design, including a continuation of sidewalks with large trees and
landscaping, wider planting strip (eight (8) feet to ten (10) feet), uniform
lighting with decorative lamps and other street furniture.
   E.   Additional Greenspace.
      l.   Additional Greenspace shall be defined as publicly accessible
greenspace that exceeds the required open space for the respective mixed-use
zoning district development, as defined in Section
8.8., Open Space. For example, a minimum of ten percent (10%) of open space is
required within the DG-MX district. To receive the bonus the project would need
to include fifteen percent (15%) of open space.
         a.   Required additional greenspace.
            i.   DC-MX and DG-MX: five percent (5%).
            ii.   All other Mixed-Use Districts: ten percent (10%).
         b.   Additional green space shall be in the form(s) as defined in
Section
8.8.3., Open Space Standards.
   F.   Building Configuration.
      1.   Incentives for building configuration shall include a minimum of two
(2) types listed below:
         a.   Compliance with the multi-family residential design standards in
Section
8.7.3., Multifamily Design Standards, for single-family attached.
         b.   Construction of principal structure in accordance with Barrier

from the building's first floor primary façade plane by six (6) feet or more.
   G.   Sustainable Development.
      1.   Incentives are an effort to encourage sustainable development
practices as a means of addressing climate change and the need for more
resilient development practices, the protection of natural resources, and
ensuring a high quality of life for future City residents. Development shall
include a minimum of three (3) from
Type A and a minimum of four (4) from Type B of sustainable development

standards of the applicable base zoning district, the standards in this Section
shall control; and
      3.   In cases where the standards of this Section conflict with standards
in the City’s Code of Ordinances, the standards in this Section shall control.
   E.   Area. The following portions of the Concord Avenue Master Plan are
hereby adopted and incorporated by reference into the CA-O District standards:
      1.   The study area boundary which identifies the CA-O District boundary;
      2.   The land use program, which identifies the general range of
allowable uses (but not the required locations of uses) in the CA-O District;
and
      3.   The Comprehensive Master Plan which identifies the street patterns
and general guidance for site configuration in the CA-O District.
   F.   Modifications to CA-O District Boundary. Applications to expand,
modify, remove, or revise the CA-O District boundary may only be filed by the
City’s Planning Board or City Council.
      1.   Applications to modify a sub-district boundary in the CA-O District

Official Zoning Map and shall be reviewed and decided in accordance with
Section
3.4.6. of this UDO, and the adopted Concord Avenue Master Plan. Lots intended
for designation to a new sub-district shall comply with the applicable minimum
dimensional requirements in 6.3.2.2: CA-O Dimensional Standards, in the CA-
O District.
      2.   In no instance shall an amendment to establish a conditional zoning
district or planned unit development within the area subject to the CA-
O standards include conditions that seek to waive or reduce the requirements of
the CA-O District.
      3.   In the event a roadway or other feature that serves as a boundary of
the CA-O district is moved or otherwise relocated, the CA-O district boundary
and corresponding sub-district boundaries shall likewise be moved or relocated.
   G.   Modifications to CA-O District Standards. Minor modifications or
deviations of up to 10 percent of any numerical requirement applicable in the
CA-O District may be approved by the Director if the Director determines that:
      1.   The modification is consistent with the character of development on
surrounding land, and results in development that is compatible with
surrounding land uses;
      2.   The modification compensates for some unusual aspect of the site or
the proposed development that is not shared by landowners in general or
supports an objective or goal from the purpose and intent statements of the
zoning district where it is located;
      3.   The modification will not pose a danger to the public health or
safety;
      4.   Any adverse impacts resulting from the modification will be fully
mitigated; and
      5.   The district standard being modified is not the subject of a
previously approved zoning condition or variance on the same site.
      6.   A modification shall be reviewed and decided prior to the other
applications with which it is submitted. for example, if a modification request
is submitted in conjunction with a site plan application, the modification
shall be reviewed and decided prior to the approval of the site plan
application.

   H.   Tree Removal. Pursuant to G.S § 160A-175, cities have the ability to
impose fines and penalties for ordinance violations. The following section
pertains to all trees in the Historic District measuring 6 inches or greater in
Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) that are removed without proper approval. This
includes, diseased or infested trees and trees that pose an imminent hazard to
persons or property.
      1.   Union County Urban Forester Report. The Union County Urban Forester
(UCUF) or their designee will provide a report for the removed tree determining
if the tree was healthy, diseased or infested, or posed an imminent hazard to
persons or property, along with the DBH of the tree.
         a.   If the report provided by the Union County Urban Forester
determined the tree was diseased or infested, or posed an imminent hazard to
persons or property, the following penalties are waived.
         b.   If the report cannot determine the tree was diseased or infested,
or posed an imminent hazard to persons or property, the penalties will not be
waived (for example, if the stump is removed and there is no documentation of
the above issues through the use of photographs or other materials to show the
DBH measurement).
         c.   If the DBH cannot be determined after the fact, (through the use
of documentation such a photographs to show the DBH measurement), the maximum
penalty below shall apply.
      2.   Penalties. If a healthy tree is removed without prior approval from
the City of Monroe Planning Department, the following penalties shall be issued
per tree removed:
         a.   Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) Penalties:
 
6-10" tree (DBH)    $500/tree
10-14" tree (DBH)   $1,000/tree
14-18" tree (DBH)   $1,500/tree
18-22" tree (DBH)   $2,000/tree
Over 22" tree (DBH) $3,000/tree
 
      3.   Tree Replacement. If a tree is removed, with or without approval, a
3-inch DBH tree of the same or comparable species must be planted; the
replacement tree should be planted in the same location; however, alternative
planting locations may be determined at the discretion of the Planning
Director, Union County Urban Forester or their respective designees due to site
features that may make the location infeasible (ex: overhead/underground
utilities, spacing to house or other structures, etc.).
      4.   Enforcement.
         a.   If the Planning Director finds that any provision of this chapter
is being violated, he/she shall send a written notice to the person responsible
for such tree removal violation, indicating the nature of the violation and
ordering the action necessary to correct it. Additional written notices may be
sent at the Planning Director's discretion. Penalties shall be paid within ten
(10) days of receipt of written notice.
         b.   The final written notice and the initial written notice (which
may be the same) shall state the penalty incurred and requirements for
remedying the violation, such as tree replacement. Supporting documentation
shall be sent with this notice. The Planning Director's decision may be
appealed utilizing the process outlined in section
3.4.11: Appeals. Per G.S. § 160A-175, the city may recover unpaid civil
penalties in the nature of debt.
      5.   Appeal of Union County Arborist. If the party that removed the tree
(s) are not satisfied with the determinations of the Union County Urban
Forester (for example if the UCFU determines the tree was healthy and should
have not been removed), they may appeal the Union County Arborists'
determination by utilizing an alternative certified arborist to prepare a
report. The alternative arborist must be an International Society of
Arboriculture Certified Arborist. The report will be provided to the Union
County Urban Forester, if he/she agrees with the report, the standards outlined
in subsection
6.3.H will apply. If the Union County Urban Forester disagrees with the report,
the decision may be appealed utilizing the process outlined in section
3.4.11.
      6.   Waivers, exemptions, and exceptions.
         a.   The Planning Director or designee, in writing, may waive some or
all requirements of this sub-section for a reasonable time due to an emergency
such as a hurricane, tornado, windstorm, tropical storm, flood, or other
natural disaster.
         b.   The Planning Director or their designee may authorize removal of
a tree without a required permit if it is determined to be in a hazardous
condition that may:
            i.   Immediately endanger the public health, safety, or welfare; or
            ii.   Cause an immediate disruption of public services.
         c.   Utility trimming is recognized to be an important component to
maintain utility service. Tree removal due to utilities is still subject to the
standards above; however, trimming is exempt with proper approval from the
Planning Director or their designee. Utility trimming should be done in a
manner that preserves the existing tree canopy of the district; topping of
trees shall not be conducted on district trees. Utility firms are responsible

6.5. AIRPORT OVER
   A.   Purpose. The Airport Overlay (AO) district is intended to protect the
airspace around and near the Charlotte-Monroe Executive Airport (“Airport”)
from the encroachment of in-compatible land uses, which present hazards to
users of the Airport as well as to persons residing or working in the Airport
vicinity. It is the intent of this section to restrain influences, which are
averse to the airport property and safe conduct of aircraft. This section is
designed to prevent the creation of conditions hazardous to Airport operation,
to prevent conflict with land development, which may result in loss of life and
property and to encourage development that is compatible with the Airport uses
characteristics within the intent and purpose of zoning. To this end, AO
district designation, when overlaid onto a basic zoning district
classification, is intended to coordinate the purpose and intent of this
section with other regulations in the UDO. This section is intended to conform
with Federal Regulation 14 CFR Part 77-Safe, Efficient Use, and Preservation of
the Navigable Airspace.
   B.   Applicability. The AO district applies to designated land in the
vicinity of the Airport. The AO designation specifically applies to the
administration and enforcement of the areas surrounding the Airport by
regulating or restricting the height and location of where structures and trees
may be erected or allowed to grow.
   C.   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms are
generally defined. All other technical terms used in this section will be as
defined in Federal Regulation 14 CFR Part 77.
      1.   Airport. The Charlotte-Monroe Executive Airport.
      2.   Airport Elevation. The highest point of the Airport’s useable
landing area measured in feet above mean sea level (682.6 feet surveyed).
      3.   Height. Value used in determining the impact of an obstruction.
      4.   Nonconformity. Any structure, object of natural growth, or use of
land, which is inconsistent with the provisions of this UDO or any amendment
thereto existing prior to the effective date of this section.
      5.   Obstruction. Any structure, either human-made or of natural growth,
including a mobile object, which exceeds a limiting height set forth in this
section.
      6.   Zoning Administrator. The City of Monroe’s Director of Planning and
Development.
   D.   Airport Zones. In order to carry out the provisions of this section,
all appropriate surfaces (and land underneath said surfaces) defined in Federal
Regulation 14 CFR Part 77 are hereby incorporated by reference and applied to
the Airport. Such surfaces are depicted in Figure 1.

IMAGES/0-0-0-8467.png]
   E.   Airport Zone Height Limitations. No structure shall be erected, altered
or maintained, and no trees shall be allowed to grow, in any zone created by
this section, to a height which projects above the upper surface of any such
zone. An obstruction located in more than one zone is considered to be only in
the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. Nothing in this section
shall be construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any
structure, or growth of any tree, to a height of up to 100 feet above the
surface of the land.
   F.   Use Restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section,
no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this section
in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals
or radio communication between the Airport and aircraft, make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between the Airport lights and others, result in glare in
the eyes of pilots using the Airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the
Airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to
use the Airport.
   G.   Nonconformity. The regulations prescribed by this section shall not be
construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of
any nonconformity, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a
nonconformity. Nothing contained in this section shall require any change in
the construction, alteration or intended use of any nonconformity, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of
this section and is diligently being pursued. No permit provided for in section
I may be issued if it would allow the establishment or creation of an
obstruction, or allow a nonconformity to become a greater hazard to air
navigation than it was on the effective date of this section, or any amendments
thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Whenever the
Zoning Administrator determines that a nonconformity has been abandoned or is
physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit provided for in section k may be
issued if doing so would allow the nonconformity to exceed the applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from the regulations of this section.
Notwithstanding this section, and if specified in a Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) Notice of Determination, the owner of any existing
nonconformity shall install, operate and maintain markers or lights pursuant to
the standards described in FAA Advisory Circular 70-7460-1L indicating to
aircraft operators in the vicinity of the Airport the presence of an
obstruction.
   H.   Permits. Except as specifically provided in (1), (2), and (3)
hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure
shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in the
AO district unless a permit therefore is first issued. Each application for a
permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with
sufficient particularity to allow the City to determine whether the use,
structure or tree would conform to the Federal Regulations referenced in this
section and include the proper documentation as determined by the City. No
permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this section may be issued
unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection I (variances)
below.
      1.   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
100 feet of vertical height above the ground except when, because of terrain,
land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend
above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      2.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 100 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limits prescribed for such approach zones.
      3.   In areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the
perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 100 feet above the ground, except when, such tree or
structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would
extend above the height limits prescribed for such transition zones.
      4.   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration of
any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this section.
   I.   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in compliance
with the regulations prescribed in this section may apply to the Board of
Adjustment (BOA) for a variance from such regulations. The application for a
variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the FAA as to the effect
of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe,
efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances may be allowed where it is
found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result
in unnecessary hardship and relief, if granted, will not be contrary to the
public interest, will not create hazard to air navigation, will do substantial
justice and will be in accordance with the spirit of this section.
Additionally, no application for a variance to the requirements of this section
may be considered by the BOA unless a copy of the application, along with the
FAA Notice of Determination, has been furnished to the Airport Manager for
advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Airport Manager
does not respond within 30 days after receipt, the BOA may act on its own to
grant or deny said application.
   J.   Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted
pursuant to this section may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate
the purpose of this section, and reasonable in light of the circumstances, be
conditioned to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to
install, operate, and maintain, at the owner’s expense, such markings and
lights as may be necessary to comply with the standards described in FAA
Advisory Circular 70-7460-1L.
   K.   Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to
administer and enforce the regulations prescribed in this section. Applications
for permits and variances shall be made to the Zoning Administrator upon a form
published for that purpose. Applications required by this section to be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator shall be promptly considered by the
Zoning Administrator or the BOA.
   L.   Sanitary Landfill. Various studies and observations have concluded that
sanitary landfills typically attract wildlife, specifically birds, which can
create potential hazards to aircraft operations near airports, particularly
during takeoff and landing. In order to mitigate this hazard, the following
regulations shall apply with regard to location of landfills:
      1.   No landfill shall be located within 10,000 feet from a runway of the
Airport.
      2.   Landfills located further than 10,000 feet, but within five miles of
a runway of the Airport will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Airport
Manager, in coordination with the Zoning Administrator. If, in the opinion of
the Airport Manager, the landfill poses a threat to safe aircraft operations,
then the landfill shall be considered an incompatible land use, and shall not
be allowed on the property where it is deemed to pose such a threat.
   M.   Conflicts. In the event of conflict between any AO district regulation
in this section and any other UDO regulation applicable to the same area,
whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures or trees, and
the use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or
requirement shall govern and prevail.

7.2. PERMISSIBLE USE DEFINITIONS AND STANDARDS
7.2.1. PERMISSIBLE USE CATEGORIES.
   A.   Grouping of Uses. Uses have been grouped into residential, public, and
institutional, commercial, office/medical, industrial, and other. To regulate
use, categories of uses (“use categories”) have been established. Use
categories provide a systematic basis for assigning land uses to appropriate
categories or zoning districts with other similar or compatible uses. Use
categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional,
product or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and
amount of activity, the characteristics of customers or residents, how goods or
services are sold or delivered, and certain site factors.
(Am. Ord. O-2024-10, passed 2-13-24)
7.2.2. USE DETERMINATION.
   A.   Definitions.
      1.   For the purpose of this Section, certain terms or words used in this
Section shall be interpreted as follows:
         a.   The word “person” includes a firm, association, organization,
partnership, trust, company or corporation, as well as an individual.
         b.   The word “shall” is mandatory; the word “may” is permissive.
         c.   The words “used or occupied” include the words “intended,
designed or arranged to be used or occupied.”
         d.   The word “lot” includes the words “plot,” “parcel” and “tract.”
         e.   The word “structure” means anything constructed or erected,
exceeding six (6) inches height, the use of which requires more or less a
permanent location on land, or an addition to something having a permanent
attachment to land.
         f.   The word “land” includes the words “water,” “marsh” and “swamp.”
      2.   Any word not specifically defined herein (also see
Section 11 Definition of Terms) shall be interpreted as meaning its most
commonly used definition.
         a.   The names of the use categories start with capital letters
throughout this UDO.
         b.   The following use categories are defined in this division:
            i.   Residential.
            ii.   Public and Institutional.
            iii.   Commercial.
            iv.   Office/Medical.
            v.   Industrial.
            vi.   Other.
(Am. Ord. O-2024-10, passed 2-13-24)
7.2.3. CLASSIFICATION OF USES.
   A.   Considerations.
      1.   Uses are assigned to the category whose description most closely
describes the nature of the primary use. The characteristics subsection of each
use category describes the characteristics of each use category. Developments
may have more than one (1) primary use. Developments may also have one (1) or
more accessory uses. Developments with more than one (1) primary use are
addressed in subsection (b) below. Accessory uses are addressed in subsection
(c) below.
      2.   The following items are considered to determine what use category
the use is in, and whether the activities constitute primary uses or accessory
uses:
         a.   The description of the activities in relationship to the
characteristics of each use category;
         b.   The relative amount of site or floor space and equipment devoted
to the activity;
         c.   Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
         d.   The customer type for each activity;
         e.   The relative number of employees in each activity;
         f.   Hours of operation;
         g.   Building and site arrangement;
         h.   Vehicles used with the activity;
         i.   The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the activity;
         j.   Signs;
         k.   How the use advertises itself; and
         l.   Whether the activity would be likely to be found independent of
the other activities on the site.
   B.   Developments with Multiple Primary Uses. When all the primary uses of a
development fall within one (1) use category, then the development is assigned
to that use category. For example, a development that contains a retail bakery
and a café would be classified in the retail sales and service category because
all of the primary uses are in that category. When the primary uses of a
development fall within different use categories, each primary use is
classified in the applicable category and is subject to the regulations for
that category.
   C.   Accessory Uses and Structures. Accessory uses and/or structures are
allowed by right in conjunction with the primary use and are subject to the
same regulations as the primary use unless otherwise noted in these
regulations. Accessory uses and structures shall comply with the standards in
Section
7.5 Accessory Uses and Accessory Structures except where otherwise noted (i.e.,
Concord Avenue Overlay, Floodplain Regulations).
   D.   Examples. Examples are listed for each definition. Examples are
intended to provide a base for consideration of a similar use (if a similar use
is not listed).
   E.   Unlisted Uses. Uses Not Included are listed to exclude uses which may
be commonly confused with another use. For uses not listed in
Table 7.1, Table of Permissible Uses, not listed as a part of a use category or
use type, and not listed as a prohibited use, the Director shall determine
which use category or use type to which the use belongs in accordance with the
following.
      1.   The Director shall determine whether an unlisted use is similar to a
use identified in
Table 7.1, Table of Permissible Uses, based on consistency with the City's
adopted policy guidance and the following standards:
         a.   The function, product, or physical characteristics of the use;
         b.   The impact on adjacent lands or area businesses created by the
use;
         c.   The type, size, and nature of buildings and structures associated
with the use;
         d.   The type of sales (retail, wholesale), and the size and type of
items sold and displayed on the premises;
         e.   The types of items stored (such as vehicles, inventory,
merchandise, chemicals, construction materials, scrap and junk, and raw
materials including liquids and powders);
         f.   The volume and type of vehicle traffic generated by the use, and
the parking demands of the use;
         g.   Any processing associated with the use, including assembly,
manufacturing, warehousing, shipping, distribution, and whether it occurs
inside or outside a building;
         h.   Any dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials
associated with the use;
         i.   The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises,
including but not limited to noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation,
and fumes; and
         j.   Any prior determinations made by the Director or decisions made
by City Council or appointed City boards.
      2.   The Director's decision and explanation shall be made in writing,
shall state the determination is final and subject to appeal as provided in
Section 3 Administration, and shall be delivered by personal service,
electronic mail, or by first class mail to the applicable parties. A written
determination shall be binding on subsequent decisions by the Director or other
administrative officials in applying the same provision of this Ordinance or
the Official Zoning Map in the same circumstance, unless the determination is
modified in accordance with this section, or the text of this Ordinance is
amended. The Director shall maintain a record of written determinations that
shall be available in the Planning and Development Department for public
inspection, on reasonable request, during normal business hours. After the
Director determines the use category or use type in which the unlisted use is
best classified, then the unlisted use shall be subject to all applicable
requirements of that use category or use type. The Director shall also
determine whether the unlisted use is likely to be common or recur frequently.
      3.   Its omission is likely to lead to uncertainty and confusion. On
determining that the unlisted use is likely to be common and would lead to
confusion if unlisted, the Director shall initiate an application for a text
amendment. Until final action is taken on the text amendment, the Director's
decision shall be binding. If the Director determines that the unlisted. use is
of an unusual or transitory nature, and unlikely to recur frequently, the
determination shall be binding without further action or amendment of this
Ordinance.
      4.   An appeal of the Director's determination with regard to an unlisted
use may be made in accordance with Section
3.4.11: Appeals.
   F.   Use Standards. Use standards for a particular use may be found in the
information in the following sections.

Note: Maximum block lengths may be modified per approval from the TRC so long
as the proposed maximum block length does not inhibit the public safety and
welfare and efficiency of safety services. Reasons to modify maximum block
lengths may be due to topographic conditions, environmental conditions,
utilities installations, and the like. An applicant must provide a written
narrative and an engineered study that modified maximum block length is
appropriate for the proposed uses and will meet the intent of this Section.

8.1.9. CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this Section is to
provide a development option for land in the rural and suburban portions of the
City that provides development flexibility to build on smaller lots when open
space exceeds the minimums of Section
8.8: Open Space. The conservation subdivision shall be designed in a way that
protects natural features on the site and clusters development in a smaller
footprint, providing an alternative to large lot subdivision forms.
Conservation subdivisions intend to:
      1.   Conserve open space, floodplains, wetlands, river and stream
corridors, and areas with unique natural features;
      2.   Promote rural character;
      3.   Protect existing environmental and natural resources;
      4.   Promote scenic views from public roadways;
      5.   Provide development flexibility to cluster homes in a smaller
footprint to enhance open space and natural features; and
      6.   Provide reasonable economic use of land which may have unique
environmental conditions that would otherwise make development undesirable.
   B.   Applicability. Conservation subdivisions shall be limited to
development of single family detached residential dwellings on individual lots.
Conservation subdivisions shall not be available for any other form of
development or dwelling type.
      1.   Permitted Zoning Districts. Single family detached residential
subdivisions of more than five (5) lots in the RLD, RMD, and PUD zoning
districts may be developed as a conservation subdivision, in accordance with
the standards of this Section.

permitted in any other zoning districts.
   C.   Review Procedure. Conservation subdivisions shall be reviewed as a
preliminary plat in accordance with the procedures and standard in Section
3.4.15., Major Subdivision Preliminary Plat, only after approval of a
conservation and development plan as required in this Section.
      1.   Conservation Subdivision Plan. Prior to review of a preliminary plat
application for a conservation subdivision, an applicant shall develop a
conservation subdivision plan for the land. The conservation subdivision plan
shall be reviewed as a Conditional Rezoning as outlined in Section
4.6., "Conditional Zoning", following the Zoning Map Amendment process outlined
in Section
3.4.6., "Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning)."
      2.   Conservation Subdivision Plan Requirements.
         a.   Site Map. The applicant shall prepare a site map that analyzes
existing conditions on the land proposed for the development site. The site map
shall include: Property boundaries, topographic contours, proposed conservation
areas, general plant material characteristics, general soil types, and all
floodplains, wetlands, river and stream corridors and similar natural features.
         b.   Site Inspection. The Director shall schedule a site inspection of
the land with the applicant. The applicant (or designee) shall attend the site
inspection with a City staff member to familiarize staff with site conditions
and natural features of the site. City staff, with the applicant, shall
identify any potential issues for development and discuss development concepts
including the configuration of streets, utilities and structures.
         c.   Final Plan. The applicant shall prepare a final plan for the
conservation subdivision, identifying areas that shall be conserved and areas
that shall be developed. The plan shall provide preliminary site improvements,
proposed site development including utilities, streets and general areas
intended for development. The final plan shall comply with all standards within

of noise, trash, odors, lack of privacy and visual appearances that occur in
higher intensity land uses;
      6.   Safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare; and
      7.   Ensure the appearance and natural beauty of Monroe contributes
positively to its growth and economic prosperity.
8.3.2. APPLICABILITY.
   A.   Existing Structures. Buffers and screening shall be provided as
required in this Section. Structures lawfully existing before the passage of
this UDO may be repaired or modified without providing landscaping buffers
required by this Section, provided there is no increase in floor area or
impervious area on the site greater than twenty percent (20%).
   B.   New Structures. Prior to obtaining a zoning or building permit for a
new principal structure or development, an applicant must submit and receive
approval of a sealed landscape plan from the Department of Planning and
Development. Detail shall be provided on the plan showing the required
landscaping within a one hundred (100) linear foot section of any buffer.

Section unless there is a specific use standard required for landscaping for
the new use, per Section
7.2: Permissible Use Definitions and Standards.
      2.   Single-Family Detached Dwellings. These regulations do not apply to
new single-family detached dwellings constructed on a single lot or parcel not
part of a new subdivision or planned development. New subdivisions or planned
developments shall adhere to these provisions and shall require perimeter
buffers.
      3.   Railroads and Utility Easements. Property lines abutting railroad
rights-of-way and utility easements in excess of sixty (60) feet in width shall
not require landscaping or buffering.
8.3.3. LANDSCAPING STANDARDS AND PERMITTED USES.

8.3.4. REQUIRED BUFFERS.
   A.   Buffer Defined. A buffer is a specified land area located parallel to
and within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel. A buffer shall contain the
required planting, landscaping, berm, fence or wall, or any combination
required as set forth in this UDO. Landscaping and buffer standards provided
for in these regulations are minimum standards and may be increased at the
discretion of the property owner. None of these standards shall be construed as
prohibiting additional plant materials, screening or buffer area in excess of
the required regulations.
8.3.5. PERIMETER BUFFER STANDARDS.
   A.   Generally. Perimeter buffers shall be required per this Section and
meet the following standards:
      1.   Perimeter buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of the
lot, parallel to and extending to the property boundary line of the lot.
      2.   Perimeter buffers may be located wholly or partially within required
yards.
      3.   A required perimeter buffer must be provided along the entire
boundary line of the lot.
      4.   For multiple lot developments, developed as a single entity, a
perimeter buffer is only required around the outer perimeter of the
development.
      5.   A parking area buffer, as provided in Section
8.3.6: Parking Area Buffers and Landscaping, may be credited toward a more
intense perimeter buffer. If the perimeter buffer is more intense than the
parking area buffer, the required components of the parking area buffer are not
required.
      6.   Fences and walls shall comply with the standards of Section
8.3.10: Fences, Walls and Berms. Where a fence or wall is utilized in
buffering, the fence must be positioned interior to the landscaping, except
for:
         a.   Yards along an interior side or rear lot line, where fences must
be positioned exterior to the landscaping.
         b.   Trees may be on both sides of a wall as long as a minimum one
half of required canopy trees are in front.
      7.   Stormwater that includes vegetation may be placed within a perimeter
buffer, provided that the screening function of a perimeter buffer is
maintained. Plant material meeting the minimum requirements of this Section may
be counted in requirements.
   B.   Perimeter Buffer Types. Perimeter buffer types include buffer types 1-
5, each with a varying degree of screening and intensity. Each buffer type may
allow up to three (3) different options to achieve the required level of
buffering, utilizing a mixture of trees, shrubs and fences/walls. The plant
material required is per one-hundred (100) linear feet of property frontage.
Table 8.3.1 lists the different perimeter buffer types with varying degrees of
opacity for each perimeter buffer.
Table 8.3.1 also provides options to achieve each perimeter buffer type.
Figures 8.3.1 through 8.3.5 provide illustrative examples of each perimeter
buffer type. The figures are for illustrative purposes only; the text,
dimensions and standards shall apply in all cases where there is a conflict.
      1.   Perimeter Buffer Type 1. This buffer is intended to function as an
intermittent visual screen. It is intended to partially block visibility
between different uses, but not totally obstruct visual contact from one use to
another.
      2.   Perimeter Buffer Type 2. This buffer is intended to function as a
partially opaque screen. This type of buffer should partially block visual
contact between uses and creates a sense of spatial separation.
      3.   Perimeter Buffer Type 3. This buffer is intended to function as a
semi-opaque screen. This type of buffer prevents visual contact between uses
and creates a sense of spatial separation.
      4.   Perimeter Buffer Type 4. This buffer is intended to function as a
more intense opaque screen than Buffer Type 3, but not as intense of an opaque
screen as created by Buffer Type 5.
      5.   Perimeter Buffer Type 5. This buffer is intended to function as an
opaque screen from the ground to a height of eight (8) feet. This type of
buffer prevents visual and auditory contact between uses and creates a strong
impression of total separation.

   C.   Perimeter Buffer— Required Perimeter Buffer Type by District.
      1.   
Table 8.3.2 shall control the required perimeter buffer type required between
zoning districts. While
Table 8.3.2 is intended to provide for buffers based on zoning district, the
Director may take into consideration existing and proposed uses to achieve the
intent of this Section. For example, a residential use may occur in OM,
requiring a different buffer type to adequately provide buffer and screening.
      2.   Perimeter buffer types, ranging in the intensity of screening they
provide, range from 0 to 5 (0 being no buffer required, 5 being the most
intense buffer required).
      3.   To determine the perimeter buffer type required, identify the zoning
district of the land in which a development is proposed. Using
Table 8.3.2, the intersection of the row associated with the district of the
proposed development and the column associated with the adjacent zoning
district shows the buffer type required.
      4.   Perimeter buffer types required shall comply with the standards
provided in
Table 8.3.1. Options for achieving the required buffer intensity are provided
in
Table 8.3.1.

2.   If the subject property being developed is adjacent to another
jurisdiction, the required buffer type will be chosen by the Planning
Director.
3.   If the subject property being developed is a proposed conditional
district or is adjacent to existing conditional district, the required buffer
type will be chosen by the Planning Director.

8.3.6. PARKING AREA BUFFERS AND LANDSCAPING.
   A.   Applicability.
      1.   Any new construction or reconstruction of a parking lot must comply
with the requirements of this Section.
      2.   Expansion of an existing parking lot must comply with the
requirements of this Section for all newly created parking and access areas.
      3.   Where the expansion increases the amount of parking less than twenty
five (25) percent of the existing parking provided, then only the newly created
parking and access areas shall comply with the requirements of this Section.
   B.   Parking Area Buffer Standards. The following standards shall apply to
the landscaping of off-street parking and vehicle use area (parking area)
buffers:
      1.   Location. Where any parking area abuts a right-of-way or another
development, the parking area must be screened in accordance to these
standards.
         a.   A parking area shall be defined as any surface area used for off-
street parking, storage or display of vehicles, areas for loading and unloading
goods, and service areas and drive-throughs.
         b.   Parking area buffers shall be credited toward the perimeter
buffer requirement along the portion of the lot line parallel to the to the
parking lot perimeter buffer. If the perimeter buffer is equal or more intense
than the parking area buffer, the required components of the parking area
buffer are not required. See
Figure 8.3.6 for an illustrative example of parking area buffers.
      2.   Buffer Type. A parking area buffer shall be in the form of Buffer
Type 1 (unless exempted per Section
8.3.6.8.3), as provided in
Table 8.3.1, and require the additional standards below:
         a.   Fences/Walls. If the required perimeter buffer does not require a
fence or wall, any parking area buffer adjacent to residential use shall
include a fence/wall of at least four (4) feet in height at the perimeter of
the property. Fences/walls shall meet the standards provided in Section
8.3.10.
         b.   Shrubs. Required shrubs shall be grouped with a required tree,
and there shall be no gaps greater than ten (10) feet between required shrubs.
         c.   Plant Material. All required plant material shall be uniformly
distributed along the perimeter of the parking area.
      3.   Exemptions.
         a.   Driveways for single family or two family dwellings shall not be
considered parking areas for purposes of this Section.

IMAGES/0-0-0-8497.png]
   C.   Terminal Islands. The following standard shall apply to all terminal
islands:
      1.   Each row of parking spaces shall end with terminal islands to
separate parking from adjacent drive lanes. See
Figure 8.3.7 for an illustrative example of a terminal island.
      2.   Each terminal island shall measure at least eight (8) feet in width
by eighteen (18) feet in length, measured from the inside of the curb.
      3.   Within terminal islands, one (1) large or medium canopy tree shall
be required for every one-hundred-and-fifty (150) square feet (or fraction
above one half thereof), with a minimum of one (1) large or medium canopy tree
(as provided in
Table 8.3.3) required per terminal island.
      4.   Terminal islands shall be landscaped with shrubs, accent plants,
ornamental grasses, and ground cover, excluding sod, which is planted to
provide one hundred (100) percent coverage within two (2) years.
      5.   Landscaping in islands adjacent to parking spaces shall be set back
a minimum of two (2) feet behind the back of the curb to provide for pedestrian
access to parked vehicles.
      6.   Parking lots or portions of parking lots not visible from the
streets excluding alleys, shall not be required to install terminal islands.
   D.   Interior Islands. The following standard shall apply to all interior
islands:
      1.   If interior islands are utilized in the parking area configuration,
each interior island shall measure at least eight (8) feet in width by eighteen
(18) feet in length, measured from the inside of the curb. See
Figure 8.3.7 for an illustrative example of an interior island.
      2.   The Director may reduce the required width by up to three (3) feet
(minimum width five (5) feet) where existing site constraints (e.g. small site)
make compliance impracticable or where such reduction will allow preservation
of existing trees.
      3.   Interior islands less than five (5) feet in width, measured from the
inside of the curb, shall not be credited towards interior landscaping unless a
design alternative is granted. Within interior islands, one (1) large or medium
canopy tree shall be required for every one-hundred-and-fifty (150) square feet
(or fraction above one half thereof), with a minimum of one (1) large or medium
canopy tree required per interior island.
      4.   Landscaping in islands adjacent to parking spaces shall be set back
a minimum of two (2) feet behind the back of the curb to provide for pedestrian
access to parked vehicles.
   E.   Divider Medians. The following standard shall apply to all divider
medians:
      1.   Landscaped divider medians shall form a continuous landscaped strip
between abutting rows of parking areas or access drives. See
Figure 8.3.7 for an illustrative example of a divider median.
      2.   The minimum width of a divider median shall be a minimum seven (7)
feet, measured from the inside of the curb.
      3.   One (1) large or medium canopy tree or two (2) small under-story
trees shall be required for each thirty (30) linear feet of divider median (or
fraction above one half thereof).
      4.   Shrubs shall be planted in divider medians which separate parking
areas from access drives to form a continuous hedge the full length of the
divider median.
      5.   Pedestrian scale lighting must be provided within divider median(s)
and shall not exceed a maximum height of fifteen (15) feet.
   F.   Tree Placement. Trees shall not be located adjacent to free-standing
sign faces or below wall sign faces where the tree will create a visual
obstruction at the time of planting or in the future.
Figure 8.3.7. Parking Area Landscaping (Illustrative Purpose Only —
   Note: a Divider Median is recommended between each parking area, however is
not required)

(Am. Ord. O-2022-70, passed 11-8-22)
8.3.7. STREET YARD BUFFER.
   A.   Required. Any development that involves the construction of a new
principal building or development along a right-of-way, except for exclusions
listed in this Section, must include the installation of a street yard buffer
(Buffer Type 1) and additional required plant material as follows:
      1.   A minimum of two (2) street trees must be installed on the adjacent
public rights-of-way, excluding any alleys, for each one-hundred (100) feet of
right-of-way frontage.
      2.   Required parking area perimeter buffer may be in the required street
yard buffer.
      3.   All required street trees must be installed before the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy. Street trees must be maintained in a healthy and
growing condition until full maturity, or replaced as necessary by HOA, POA or
similar entity.
      4.   Street tree requirements may be waived or decreased at the
discretion of the Director if there are already the required number of trees
established on the street or if specific locations of curb cuts, utilities, or
other features conflict with the placement of trees. If there are overhead
utilities, the Director may also approve shrubs or small maturing trees instead
of large maturing trees.
      5.   To promote more walkable environments with buildings pushed up to
the sidewalk, the DC-MX and DG-MX mixed-use districts, as defined in Section 5:
Mixed-Use Zoning Districts, do not require street yard buffers but shall
install a minimum of four (4) street trees on the adjacent public rights-of-
way, for each one-hundred (100) feet of right-of-way frontage.
(Am. Ord. O-2022-70, passed 11-8-22)
8.3.8. TREE PRESERVATION, PROTECTION AND STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT
APPLICATIONS, TREE REMOVAL PERMIT.
   A.   Purpose and Intent.
      1.   To recognize the importance of the existing tree canopy and natural
features such as native tree groves and stands of hardwood trees;
      2.   Recognize the importance of existing trees to the visual and natural
environments in the City;
      3.   Protect and retain significant tree masses and specimen trees during
and after development;
      4.   Establish the criteria for removal of a healthy specimen tree;
      5.   Set out the required mitigation of a healthy specimen tree;
      6.   Limit excessive pruning or clear-cutting of existing trees and other
landscaping on properties including those proposed for development and or
redevelopment;
      7.   Provide a uniform standard for the protection and replacement of
trees on all property which require any type of building or zoning permit;
      8.   Existing trees may be counted toward landscaping and buffer
requirements and toward tree preservation standards as stated herein;
      9.   As communities develop and grow, there is a need for the
construction and renovation of buildings, roads, parking lots and other
infrastructure; and
      10.   Tree preservation and tree protection regulations are necessary to
protect desirable trees and plants and are a vital part of sustainable
community growth.
   B.   Applicability. This section shall apply to all developers and/or owners
of real property involved with new development, redevelopment or improvement,
expansions or addition shall comply with the following standards:
      1.   For improvements, expansions and additions of fifty percent (50%) or
less, the standards of this Section shall only apply to the improvement/
expanded area.
      2.   For improvements, expansions and additions of greater than fifty
percent (50%), the standards of this Section shall apply to the entire lot.
   C.   Tree Preservation Standards.
      1.   It is the intent of this subsection 8.3.8 to preserve deciduous and
evergreen trees to the greatest extent possible.
      2.   Trees at least twenty-five (25) inches in circumference within
required buffer and landscaping areas shall be tagged prior to any site
clearance and be preserved. At least ten percent (10%) of all existing tress
shall be preserved.
      3.   In any case where an individual deciduous or evergreen in
circumference is removed from the buffer as identified in below, it shall be
replaced with the corresponding number of trees and diameter(s). The location
which shall be determined by the Director.
 
Table 8.3.8.8 Removal and Replacement Requirements
Tree (inches in Number of replacement trees Replacement Multiplier
circumference)  required
10" to 25"      3 or more                   1.25
25" or greater  4 or more                   1.5
Example: a 30" tree removed should be the equivalent of 1.5 inch
times the diameter of the tree removed, which would require four
(4) or more trees totaling a 45" diameter.
 
      4.   Trees seventy-five (75) inches in circumference must be preserved
and shall not be removed except as identified in subsection f below. Trees
seventy-five (75) inches in circumference or greater shall require a
replacement equivalent or greater number of tree caliper inches of the tree
removed; and the minimum replacement tree size shall be a 3-inch caliper.
      5.   Consistent with G.S. Ch. 160D, the City can deny approval of site
plans, plans or building permits for up to three years if trees are removed
that would have otherwise been protected by these (UDO) standards and up to
five years if such removal proves to be willful.
      6.   Reduction in the Minimum Number of Required Parking Spaces. Up to a
five percent reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required on a
development site shall be allowed if the reduction in the amount of required
pavement will preserve the root zones of existing healthy specimen trees. The
amount of reduction can be determined only after taking into consideration any
unique site conditions and the impact of the reduction on parking needs for the
use, and must be agreed upon by both the applicant and the Director.
Alternative paving materials may be required in cases where required parking
areas encroach upon critical root zones.
   D.   Pre-Application Meeting (Optional).
      1.   Prior to plan development and submittal, the applicant is
recommended to meet with the City and provide the City with a graphic depiction
on an aerial map illustrating the existing tree canopy and potential areas for
preservation of existing healthy trees with good form. Knowing the location and
size of significant trees on the development site facilitates a common
understanding of what options and incentives are available to preserve trees
and improve the appearance of the proposed development while meeting the
development goals of the applicant.
      2.   The applicant shall also provide information on the location and
species of any trees having a DBH of ten (10) to twenty-five (25) inches in
circumference.
      3.   Trees meeting the standards in B above should be identified on a
plan and discussed during the Pre-Application meeting along with potential
opportunities for tree preservation. Tree preservation is to be determined in
conjunction with the City’s input.
      4.   Once determined, the applicant shall indicate the location of the
tree protection zones on the development plans. Tree protection areas based on
the trees’ critical root zones shall be noted and drawn to scale on demolition,
grading and erosion control, and landscaping plans. The general type, size and
nature of the existing trees to be saved and credited toward landscaping
requirements shall be included as a table, as well as being graphically
illustrated.
      5.   Tree save areas must be described by metes and bounds on the
recorded plat, individual recorded deeds, and all property association
documents for land held in common.
   E.   Coordination with Other Plans.
      1.   Coordination with Stormwater Requirements. When required stormwater
management facilities are enhanced as a site amenity they may qualify as a
portion of the required open space. Determination of credit shall be at the
discretion of the Director in accordance with the provisions of the UDO.
      2.   Coordination with Site Lighting. Coordination is required so that
site lighting is located an appropriate distance from trees to minimize future
conflict.
   F.   Critical Root Zone. Critical to the tree’s survival is protection of
the critical root zone. The critical root zone is the minimum area beneath a
tree that must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass
to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. The critical root zone is
generally 18 to 24 inches deep and typically represented by a concentric circle
centering on the tree trunk with a radius of at least one foot for every inch
of trunk diameter taken at four and one-half feet above grade (DBH).
Approximately 50 percent of a tree’s root system is in the top 12 inches of
soil with 90-95 percent of the root system within the top three feet. For
example, a ten-inch diameter tree requires a protective barrier with a minimum
ten-foot radius. Proposed buildings shall not be located within ten feet of the
critical root zone of any existing tree proposed to be preserved (see
Figure 8.3.8.
Figure 8.3.8. Critical Root Zone Protection Standards

IMAGES/0-0-0-8501.png]
   G.   Tree Removal Permits. No Tree Removal Permit shall be granted where the
Applicant has failed to implement the principles of avoidance and then
minimization of adverse impacts to Trees. Applications, applicants, property
owners or similar removing trees in violation of this section shall be subject
to the standards of Section
8.3.8.B.5.
      1.   No Tree Removal Permit shall be granted unless the development
application or proposed activity is consistent with the permitted use of the
property under the UDO, as may be amended.
      2.   Failure to obtain a Permit prior to tree removal, or to abide by its
conditions, including damage to any tree in a tree save area, or damage to any
tree in a tree protection zone established as part of an approved plan and or
permit is a violation of this UDO and subject to the remedies and penalties in
this UDO and or applicable City ordinances. In addition, trees damaged or
unlawfully removed shall be replaced with one or more replacement trees
consistent with Subsection B.5 above. The replacement trees shall be replanted
within 12 months of the notice.
      3.   Exemptions. The following activities are exempt from the
requirements of obtaining a Tree Removal Permit:
         i.   Trees pose a safety hazard to people, buildings, structures,
vehicles or other improvements.
         ii.   The City-initiated or approved removal of any vegetation which
is in an unsafe condition, constitutes a nuisance or noxious weed, or which by
its nature is injurious to sanitary sewers, electrical power lines, gas lines,
water lines, stream or conveyance channels, or other public improvements, or
vegetation which is infected with any injurious fungus, insect, or other pest.
         iii.   One and two single-family residential dwellings including
existing developed lots.
         iv.   Normal forestry activities taking place on property which is
taxed under the present-use value standard or conducted pursuant to a forestry
management plan prepared or approved by a forester registered pursuant to
Chapter 89B of the North Carolina General Statutes.
         v.   The removal of vegetation on property located within an approved
residential subdivision which is zoned for single-family use, and provided such
vegetation is not a portion of a required streetscape or other landscaping
buffer.
         vi.   If the Applicant can clearly demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Director during permit review, or the Council on appeal, respectively, that
setting aside the space necessary to protect a said tree(s) would unreasonably
prevent the development of a lot or parcel of land.
         vii.   Except as otherwise preempted by applicable state standards,
State or local regulations require fill to the extent that Trees cannot be
saved and the required elevations are certified by the project engineer; or
         viii.   Trees are diseased or are weakened by age, storm, fire, or
other injury, or as a result of suppression by other Trees or vines, or site
conditions, to the extent that they have lost most of their function and value,
or pose a danger to Persons, property, utilities, sidewalks, streets, sewers,
other facilities, improvements or other Trees, if so determined by the
Director, or by the Council on appeal, respectively. No permit shall be granted
for the removal of any Tree if the hazard can be abated by any other reasonable
means.
         ix.   No permit shall be granted for the removal of any Tree if the
hazard can be abated by any other reasonable means.
      4.   Dead Trees. If a Tree dies after a Tree Removal Permit has been
issued and prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or certificate
of completion, the Applicant shall notify the Director and request an
inspection, prior to the removal of the dead Tree(s). An inspection by City
staff will be made within a reasonable time frame upon notification by the
Applicant. Failure to notify the Director prior to the removal of any dead Tree
constitutes a violation of this article. If the Tree death can be attributed to
anthropogenic (man-caused) activities, as determined by the Director, Tree
mitigation shall be required.
      5.   Final Inspections. All Tree Removal Permits will require, as a
general condition, a final inspection to ensure compliance with the provisions
of this article. Final inspections shall be scheduled by the Applicant after
the final grade is complete. Final inspections will be completed by staff
within a reasonable timeframe upon notification by the Applicant.
   H.   Preservation Plan. A tree preservation plan shall be required as part
of any landscaping plan submitted to the Department of Planning and Development
and meet the following standards:
      1.   The plan must show there will be no disturbance within a preserved
tree’s critical root zone.
      2.   A preserved tree’s critical root zone shall be protected from
encroachment and damage.
      3.   The preferred method is to restrict access by installing a barrier
to keep materials, people, or equipment out of the critical root zone.
      4.   Barriers shall be accompanied by temporary signs labeling the
critical root zone.
      5.   The critical root zone area shall remain free of all building
materials and debris.
   I.   Additional Remedies, Violations and Penalties. Failure to comply with
the provisions of Section
8.3.8 shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance, and shall subject an
offending party to a series of actions, including the payment of fines, delay
in development plan approval or building permit issuance, and the requirement
to double the amount of required vegetation as would typically be required
during the development plan review and approval process.

8.4. PARKING AND LOADING
8.4.1. PURPOSE, INTENT AND APPLICABILITY.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Section is to ensure the City
is served by adequate parking and loading facilities proportional to market
demands and generalized need for parking and loading. This Section intends to:
      1.   Provide for adequate parking, loading and unloading, and safe
movement of vehicles and pedestrians through off-street parking areas;
      2.   Recognize parking and loading demands of permitted uses and provide
a flexible range of adequate parking and loading, receptive to market demand;
      3.   Allow for alternative parking options in certain defined
circumstances;
      4.   Reduce the aesthetic impacts of parking areas;
      5.   Avoid excessive areas of impervious surfaces dedicated to parking;
      6.   Provide for compatibility between uses; and
      7.   Provide for high quality, safe designs that will add to the
aesthetic well-being of the City.
   B.   Applicability. Parking must be provided in accordance with this UDO.
Off-street parking shall be maintained and continued. No permit for
construction or addition may be permitted until the parking requirements of
this UDO have been met. Off-street parking shall be located on the same plot or
parcel of land it is intended to serve, unless specifically permitted
otherwise.
   C.   Renovations and Repairs. A building or site may be renovated or
repaired without providing additional parking, providing there is no increase
in floor area unless the addition in area meets the requirements set forth in
this UDO. If there is an increase in floor area, the requisite number of
parking spaces shall be provided per requirements of this Section. If
additional parking cannot be provided consistent with this Section, the
Planning and Development Director may request an Alternative Parking Plan (see
Sec.8.4.2.H: Alternative Parking Plan).
   D.   Change in Uses. A change in use in a building shall meet the parking
requirements for that new use. If the parking requirements of this UDO cannot
be met for the new use, the Planning and Development Director may make a
determination as to whether or not the current parking can sustain the new
proposed use. The Planning and Development Director may request additional
information regarding the proposed use, but if such a determination cannot be
made with the information provided, the Planning and Development Director may
request an Alternative Parking Plan (see Sec.8.4.2.H: Alternative Parking
Plan).
   E.   Unlisted Uses. In those situations where a proposed use is not
identified in
Table 8.4.1, the Planning and Development Director may apply an alternative
off-street parking standard based on the use determined to be the most similar
to the proposed use. A parking study or similar analysis prepared by a
Professional Engineer or Certified Land Use Planner with experience in parking
studies may be provided to the Planning and Development Director which can be
used in applying an alternative parking standard.
8.4.2. PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Required Parking. Parking shall be provided in accordance with
Table 8.4.1: Parking Requirements. Where a use is not specifically listed, the
Planning and Development Director is responsible for applying the requirement
for the most similar use.
   B.   Minimum and Maximum. Parking requirements provide the minimum and
maximum standards to meet the parking needs generated by the various uses
permitted by Forward Monroe and the UDO. This is done by providing a range of
acceptable parking that is responsive to the market conditions and individual
project needs.
   C.   Parking Requirements. Requirements for parking are set forth in
Table 8.4.1: Parking Requirements. The minimum parking required, and maximum
parking allowed, are defined using a ratio requirement. For example, under the
“Minimum Required” column, “1.0/Dwelling Unit” shall be understood to mean at
minimum one parking space per dwelling unit is required. Under the “Maximum
Allowed” column, “2.0/Dwelling Unit” shall be understood to mean two parking
spaces per dwelling unit are allowed as a maximum.
      a.   Mixed-Use Zoning District Parking Requirements. The parking
requirements defined in
Table 8.4.1 shall differ for mixed-use districts. Section
5.9: Mixed-Use Zoning District Parking Standards shall be used to calculate
parking requirements within mixed-use zoning districts.
   D.   Standard. Parking standards are to be calculated per 1,000 SF (square
feet) of gross floor area of a use, unless otherwise noted. For example, a
restaurant has a minimum required 2.0 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of
gross floor area. Fractional calculations shall round to the nearest whole
number per Section
8.4.2.E: Fractional Measurements.
   E.   Fractional Measurements. When units or measurements determining the
number of required parking spaces result in the requirement of a fractional
space, then such fraction equal to or greater than one-half shall require a
full off-street parking space.
   F.   Measurement of Floor Area in Computation of Required Parking. Floor
area shall mean the gross floor area as defined in Section 11: Definition of
Terms, of this UDO.
   G.   Reduction in Parking. A reduction in parking may be permitted by the
Director where necessary to preserve critical tree preservation areas as
identified in Section
8.3.8.B.6.
   H.   Exceeding Maximum Allowed Parking. If proposed parking exceeds the
maximum allowed, an Alternative Parking Plan (APP) shall be required.
   I.   Alternative Parking Plan (APP). The parking requirements set forth in
this Section (
Table 8.4.1) may be modified through an APP. The Planning and Development
Director may accept an APP in place of the parking requirement for a use if the
below requirements are met:
      1.   A parking study must be submitted that is prepared by a registered
Professional Engineer or Certified Land Use Planner.
      2.   The study must include the size, type, and use(s) of the
development; anticipated peak parking; anticipated normal parking amounts; and
a narrative and data as to why the parking requirements of the UDO do not
accurately reflect the needs of the proposed development.
      3.   The APP may include provisions for satellite parking if the number
of off-street parking spaces required cannot reasonably be provided on the same
lot where the principal use is located. Such satellite parking spaces shall
comply with Section
8.4.2.1: Satellite Parking (Off-Site), below.
      4.   An APP maybe requested concurrently with a site and development
plan, as defined in Section
3.4.17: Site and Development Plan.
   J.   Satellite Parking (Off-Site). Required parking spaces may be located on
a separate plot or property from the subject site in which the principal use is
located if the satellite parking complies with the following:
      a.   Any satellite parking area shall be under the same ownership (i.e.
common ownership) as the principal use or a satellite parking area may be
leased for a lease of no less than the term of any lease for the principal use.
      b.   All necessary legal instruments shall be executed and recorded in
the Register of Deeds Office. Copies of the recorded documents shall be
provided to the Planning and Development Director and City Engineer prior to
the issuance of certificates of occupancy. Legal instruments may include
ownership documents, lease documents, granted easements, or other information
deemed necessary by the Planning and Development Director to sufficiently prove
the satellite parking area meets the intent of this subsection.
      c.   All renewal agreements pertaining to satellite parking area leases
shall be provided to the Planning and Development Director prior to the
expiration of the lease term.
      d.   The location of satellite parking shall comply with the distance
requirements in
Figure 8.4.1.
      e.   Satellite parking lots shall abide by all parking design and
construction standards set forth in the UDO.
      f.   No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of parking space requirements
may be provided by a satellite parking location.
      g.   Satellite parking shall not consist of any required parking of
another use unless a shared parking arrangement exists. Any shared parking
arrangement shall be provided to the Planning and Development Director and
identify uses existing or proposed, identify the peak parking demands of the
uses, and provided calculations and a narrative explaining how the shared
parking arrangement will meet the provisions of this Section.
      h.   A sidewalk or paved pedestrian walkway shall be provided to the
satellite parking area from the subject use.
      i.   Satellite parking plans shall be submitted to the Planning and
Development Director, including copies of the ownership documentation, lease or
similar; identification of the number of parking spaces required for the use
and also the number of parking spaces (total) on the satellite lot. The plan
shall be on a designated form or application determined appropriate by the
Planning and Development Director.

8.4.3. PARKING DESIGN STANDARDS.
   A.   General Design Standards.
      1.   Parking Plans. A Parking Plan shall be required for all development
and redevelopment with the exception of single family residential uses. Parking
plans shall be reviewed in compliance with Section
3.4.21., Parking Plan. Parking Plans shall include at minimum all items
required in Section
3.4.21., Parking Plan, and dimensional standards of parking including but not
limited to those in Section
8.4.3.C., Dimensional Standards.
      2.   Arrangement. Off-street parking shall be arranged so that vehicles
may be parked/unparked without moving other vehicles, except for parking
structures which may be designed to allow tandem parking and/or valet services.
      3.   Encroachment. No parking space may be designed in such a way to
encroach, hinder or otherwise block a public or private roadway, alley or
sidewalk. Parking spaces may be allowed in a setback or build-to-zone (BTZ) as
permitted in this UDO.
      4.   Overhang. Where parking spaces are located such that the parked
vehicle will overhang a sidewalk, a minimum clear width shall be provided equal
to the minimum sidewalk width required.
      5.   Driveways. Driveways, drive aisles, and joint access easements shall
not be used for parking vehicles except for single family and two-family
residential.
      6.   Wheel Stops. Wheel stops shall be prefabricated, concrete or
recycled plastic product manufactured specifically for this use. The use of
railroad ties or other non-traditional wheel stops shall not be permitted.
Facilities shall have curbs or motor vehicle stops or similar devices so as to
prevent vehicles from overhanging on or into adjacent property, or from
encroaching into required landscaped areas.
      7.   Landscaped Parking Islands. Parking areas shall be visually and
functionally segmented using landscaped islands and canopy trees and meet the
requirements of Section 8.3.6., Parking Area Buffers of this UDO. All landscape
requirements for parking areas shall be met.
      8.   Drainage. Parking areas shall be drained so as not to cause any
nuisance on adjoining or nearby properties.
      9.   Access and Maneuvering. Parking areas shall be arranged for
convenient access, maneuvering and safety of pedestrians and vehicles. Parking
areas shall be arranged so that no vehicle shall be required to back up from
such facilities directly onto designated arterial or collector streets. Parking
areas shall be designed, maintained and regulated so that no parking or
maneuvering incidental to parking shall be on any public street, sidewalk, or
alley.
      10.   Marking of Spaces. All off-street parking area spaces shall be
marked.
   B.   Paving.
      1.   Applicability. Paving shall be required per the standards of this
Section for:
         a.   All new parking, loading, driveways and drive aisles, serving new
construction, including expansions to existing uses;
         b.   All parking, loading, and driveways and drive aisles, existing

8.4.4. LOADING AND UNLOADING AREAS.
   A.   Generally. Whenever the normal operation of any development requires
that goods, merchandise, or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from
that development, a sufficient off-street loading and unloading area must be
provided to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and
convenient manner.
   B.   Loading Areas Design Standards. Loading and unloading areas shall be so
located and designed as follows:
      1.   So that vehicles can maneuver safely and conveniently to and from a
public right-of-way.
      2.   So that vehicles can complete the loading and unloading operations
without obstructing or interfering with any public right-of-way or any parking
space or parking lot drive aisle.
      3.   Loading areas shall be located outside of a public right-of-way when
practicable and be indicated through signage.
      4.   The size of loading areas shall be based upon the needs of the use
in a building. The minimum size of a loading area shall be the same size as the
minimum parking space. For uses that require commercial delivery trucks or
semi-trailers, loading areas shall be made to accommodate the typical
commercial delivery vehicle.
      5.   A minimum of one (1) loading space per development is required,
however, loading spaces shall be provided and maintained in sufficient numbers
to adequately handle the needs of a nonresidential use. Every application for a
site and development plan shall demonstrate sufficient numbers of loading
spaces is provided.
      6.   Loading areas that serve commercial delivery trucks, semi-trailers
and similar vehicles shall be designed to include screen walls, landscaping, or
other treatments to limit visibility of the loading area.
   C.   Area Requirements. No area allocated to loading and unloading may be
used to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any
portion of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements
for loading and unloading facilities.
   D.   Compliance. For lots with existing structures predating the effective
date of this UDO, and for a change in use that does not involve any enlargement
of a structure, the loading area requirements of this Section need only comply
to the extent practicable.
8.4.5. STACKING REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Stacking. Whenever a structure or use provides for the off-loading of
passengers or involves a drive-through (i.e. allows for a use without exiting
the vehicle), stacking spaces shall be provided for and marked on the site. The
following requirements shall be met:
      1.   A stacking space shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet by twenty (20)
feet.
      2.   Stacking spaces shall not obstruct, endanger, or interfere with on-
site or off-site access, maneuvering, or traffic patterns.

8.7. DESIGN STANDARDS
8.7.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this Section is to
provide minimum requirements for the design and configuration of single family
(detached and attached) and duplex, multifamily (including triplexes and
quadplexes), and industrial buildings and developments. These standards are
intended to provide the City’s expectations for the quality and appearance of
certain development through the use of architectural designs, building
features, exterior materials and colors, desirable design elements, and
detailing. This Section is intended to provide flexibility in the development
of compatible mixed uses and other non-residential areas (i.e. Planned Commerce
District). These standards are intended:
      1.   To encourage clustering of commercial (non-residential), multifamily
and industrial activities within specifically designed areas and to discourage
strip commercial development along major thoroughfares and non-commercial
areas;
      2.   Provide for orderly development of commercial activities so that
adverse impacts on adjacent property(s) and traffic flow can be limited; and
      3.   Encourage an orderly and systematic development design providing
rational placement of activities, parking, circulation, landscaping, pedestrian
circulation, loading, and access. All provided figures, images, and rendered
photographs are for illustrative purposes only; the text, dimensions and
standards shall apply in all cases where there is a conflict.
   B.   Applicability. This Section is applicable to:
      1.   New non-residential buildings;
      2.   New multifamily dwelling developments;
      3.   New single family developments and duplexes that provide voluntary
consent; and
      4.   New industrial developments.
   C.   Timing of Review. All buildings subject to the standards of this
Section shall be reviewed for compliance during the site and development plan
process, as provided in Section
3.4.17: Site and Development Plan. Artistic renderings or elevation drawings
shall be provided to ensure compliance.
   D.   Mixed-Use Zoning Districts. Mixed-Use zoning district standards, as
provided in Section 5: Mixed-Use Zoning Districts, may have unique or stricter
design standards and requirements.
      1.   Where a conflict arises in design or architectural standards, the
stricter provision shall apply, with the exception of the side and rear build-
to zone BTZ); this is due to the nature of these developments and the specific
standards as to parking placement and peripheral buffer.
      2.   When required by this UDO, the BTZ within a multiple building
development may be achieved along an internal private street or driveway. In
these instances, the private street shall connect to one or more public
streets.
   E.   Existing Development and Redevelopment. Development existing prior to
the adopted date of this UDO, as well as redevelopment of buildings commenced
prior to the adopted date of this UDO, are encouraged, but not required, to
comply with these standards.
(Am. Ord. O-2022-70, passed 11-8-22; Am. Ord. O-2023-18, passed 5-9-23)
8.7.2. SINGLE FAMILY DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   A.   Intent and Applicability. The standards in Section
8.7.2 are additional and voluntary design standards for single family
structures (detached and attached) and duplexes. These standards are intended
to supplement the required zoning district development standards and specific
use standards provided in Section
7.2: Permissible Use Definitions and Standards. In accordance with G.S. § 160D-
702, the standards in this Section
8.7.2 are only applicable when the owner of the property subject to the
proposed development voluntary consents through a submitted consent statement.
These design guidelines are intended to:
      1.   Ensure that single family and duplex homes feature high quality
design;
      2.   Maintain consistent materials and architectural elements; and
      3.   Provide variability in home design to avoid repeated and monotonous
developments where dwellings appear identical or very similar.
   B.   Exemptions. The following single family and duplex developments are
encouraged, but not required, to comply with the standards in this Section
8.7.2.
      1.   Single family and duplex developments that do not voluntarily
consent to the standards of this Section
8.7.2.
   C.   Consent.
      1.   Voluntary Consent. In accordance with G.S. § 160D-702, the standards
of this Section
8.7.2 that regulate “building design elements” (as defined in the statute) do
not apply to any single family or duplex structures unless voluntarily
consented to by the owners of all the property on which such structure are
located during the process for seeking and obtaining a zoning amendment or a
zoning, subdivision, or development approval.
      2.   Consent Statement. If an applicant chooses to comply with the
standards of this Section
8.7.2, the applicant shall include the following note on any required
application/permit and on the final plat that is signed by the owner of the
subject property:
         “The development depicted herein is subject to the City of Monroe
Single family and Duplex Design Guidelines. I voluntarily consent to the
application of these guidelines for all development herein, the acceptance of
which shall run with the land regardless of changes in ownership. I recognize
that failure to comply with the applicable guidelines following approval is a
violation of the City of Monroe Unified Development Ordinance.”

percent maximum of the facade);
      3.   Smooth-faced concrete block; and
      4.   Pre-fabricated steel/metal panels (except where used as an accent
material, up to five percent (5%) maximum of the facade).
   G.   Architectural Variability. The standards below are intended to prevent
and avoid repeated and monotonous developments where dwellings appear identical
or very similar. A row (i.e. two (2) or more dwellings in a row, including
attached townhomes) of identical or near-identical buildings along a block or
across the street along a block are prohibited. Buildings shall have varied and
distinctly different facades within any phase of development. Single family
dwellings and duplexes may qualify as distinctly different if two (2) of the
following standards are met:
      1.   Variation of color and not a variation of hue shall be required and
may count toward meeting the requirement of distinctly different facades;
      2.   Variation in exterior materials and utilization of materials on
facades may count toward meeting the requirement of distinctly different

8.7.4.2. PARKING PLACEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION.
   A.   Generally. The purpose of this Section
8.7.4.2. is to regulate the placement of parking lots within a non- residential
development. Parking lots should be distributed around large buildings in order
to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks and to reduce
the overall scale of the paved surface. If buildings are located closer to
streets, the scale of the complex is reduced, pedestrian traffic is encouraged,
and architectural details should be emphasized.
   B.   Parking Placement. No more than sixty percent (60%) of the off-street
parking area for the entire property shall be located between the front facade
within the front yard of the principal building(s) and the primary abutting
street unless the principal building(s) and parking lots are screened from view
by outparcel buildings and development.
8.7.4.3. ROOFS.
   A.   Generally. The purpose of this Section
8.7.4.3 is to regulate the aesthetics of roofs for non- residential
development. The intent is to interrupt expanses of pitched roofs and minimize
or prevent the visibility of flat roofs. No part of this Section
8.7.4.3 shall be construed to prevent the installation of solar panels or any
other type of renewable energy collection or storage method, provided the
installation follows the standards of this UDO. Building rooflines that face a
street shall not exceed a linear distance of thirty-five (35) feet without the
introduction of a physical articulation of no less than one (1) foot in the
vertical direction, including but not limited to parapets, gable roofs, hip
roofs, or dormers, which should also be used to conceal flat roofs and roof top
equipment from public view. Roofline changes, with aligned wall offset facade
material changes, are encouraged.
   B.   Design Standards. The following design standards are required:
      1.   Flat Roofs. Flat roofs shall be concealed from view by using pitched
roof features such as gable, hip, shed or mansard roofs, parapets, or a mixture
thereof. Where only one (1) elevation has this condition, the parapet or other
feature should continue four (4) feet along the adjacent elevation. Minimum
roof slope for pitched roofs is 6' (v): 12' (h).
      2.   Equipment. Publicly visible mechanical equipment or stacks shall be
colored to match the roofing material and screened from public view.
      3.   Parapets. Where a parapet intersects with a pitched roof clement,
there shall be no apparent breaks in the parapet wall.
      4.   Roof Treatments. Roofs shall have architecturally significant roof
treatments including, but not limited to, cornices, brackets, roof overhangs,
textured materials, and compatible color materials.
      5.   Awnings. Awnings or canopies which are illuminated from within must
be covered or finished with fully opaque material.
      6.   Additions. The roof treatments and design shall be the same for
additions as for the existing design.
8.7.4.4. MATERIALS.
   A.   Permitted Exterior Building Materials. All non-residential buildings
must be constructed with a consistent set of brick, stone, stucco or synthetic
stucco, fiber cement or similar materials.
   B.   Prohibited Exterior Building Materials. Except where a building’s
original finish included such materials, the following materials are
prohibited:
      1.   Textured plywood;
      2.   Vinyl;
      3.   Smooth-faced concrete block;
      4.   Pre-fabricated steel/metal panels (except where used as an accent
material); and
      5.   Mirrorized glass. Reflective tint glass is acceptable up to thirty
percent (30%) tint.
   C.   Permitted Roof Materials. All roof materials shall be tile, slate,
standing seam metal and manufactured shingles, which give appearance of
shingles or other simulated natural material.
   D.   Prohibited Roof Materials. Membrane, fiberglass, asphalt shingle and
all other roof materials not permitted in Section
8.7.5.1 are prohibited.
8.7.4.5. BUILDING COLORS.
   A.   Generally. The purpose of this Section
8.7.4.5. is to prevent inordinately bright facades and primary color ranges for
non- residential developments. All new construction elements are subject to
color requirements, except pavement markings and signage.
   B.   Uniformity. Colors used for site walls, site lighting and any other
outside construction elements (excluding signage) shall be uniform in
appearance.
   C.   Facade Colors. Facade colors shall be low reflectance earth tone,
muted, subtle, or neutral colors. Building trim and accent areas may feature
brighter colors, as approved during the site plan review process. Traditional
and standard franchise colors shall also comply with this Section
8.7.4.5.
   D.   Roofing Colors. Roofing materials should complement the color and
texture of the building facade. Roofing colors should be muted earth tones or a
color that is darker than the facade. Stripes and patterns on the roof are
strongly discouraged.
8.7.4.6. PEDESTRIAN CONSIDERATIONS.
   A.   Intent. The design of buildings and pedestrian walkways shall support a
safe and attractive pedestrian environment for all non- residential
developments. All applicable developments shall ensure a direct pedestrian
connection between the street and buildings on the site, and between buildings
and other activities within the site. In addition, they provide for connections
between adjacent sites, where feasible. Pedestrian circulation should clearly
articulate pedestrian connections and provide connections to public gathering
spaces.
   B.   Building Entrances. The following requirements for building entrances
shall be required:
      1.   A primary facade and main building entry shall face the right-of-
way, and additional entrances are encouraged facing local streets, parking
lots, plazas, and adjacent buildings. Vehicular openings, such as those for
garages, shall not constitute a public entrance.
      2.   Every primary entrance for a building shall include two of the
following elements:
         a.   Awning or covered entry;
         b.   Variation in building height;

8.8. OPEN SPACE STANDARDS
8.8.1. PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Section is to require open
space that encourages preservation of natural features and provides for
recreational opportunities for the residents of the City of Monroe. Open space
adds to the visual character of a development and provides active and passive
recreational opportunities for residents, visitors, and users alike. Open space
is an asset to the community and it is the intent of this Section to:
      1.   Define standards in which residential zoning districts, mixed-use
zoning districts, commercial zoning districts, and planned districts shall
dedicate a portion of area as open space;
      2.   Designate open space sizes, open space types, open space percentage
requirements, and open space design standards; and
      3.   Define the minimum maintenance and ownership requirements for open
spaces.
8.8.2. APPLICABILITY.
   A.   Applicability. Unless explicitly exempted, the standards in this
Section shall apply to all new development and redevelopment in the City of
Monroe. Individual single family dwellings not part of a new subdivision as
defined in Section
8.1: Subdivision Regulations, are exempted from providing open space.
8.8.3. OPEN SPACE STANDARDS.
   A.   Generally. Open space shall be provided in compliance with this
Section. Open space shall be categorized by Open Space Sizes (Section
8.8.3.B.) and by Open Space Types (Section
8.8.3.C.) and is subject to Open Space Percentage Requirements (Section
8.8.3.D.) and Open Space Design Standards (Section
8.8.3.E.).
   B.   Open Space Sizes. Open space may consist of a variety of different
sizes. For the purpose of this Section, open space sizes shall be defined as
small, medium, and large. The acreage of open space sizes for each open space
size is defined in
Table 8.8.1.
 
Table 8.8.1. Open Space Sizes
Open Space Size Acreage (Range)
Small           500 SF - 1.0 Acres
Medium          1.0 - 2.5 Acres
Large           2.5 Acres Or More
 
   C.   Open Space Types. In addition to different sizes, open space may take
different forms, dependent upon both the nature of the development and the land
in which it is established. Because of their nature, open space types may be
considered more than a single open space size (i.e., an open space type may be
considered both a small and medium open space size). Open space includes the
following open space types, as defined below:
      1.   Pocket Park. Pocket parks are defined as a small open space. Pocket
parks are primarily intended to provide small active or passive recreation
opportunities and act as a gathering space for residents or customers. Features
shall include a combination of small shade structures, gazebos, seating areas,
multi-purpose lawn space, playgrounds, community gardens, dog parks, trails, or
natural elements such as a stream or pond.

      2.   Amenity Center. Amenity centers are defined as small or medium open
spaces and include a combination of enclosed and open areas. Amenity centers
provide recreational opportunities and are typically included in residential
developments. Amenity centers shall include a combination of features such as
pools, splash pads, areas devoted to water play for kids, clubhouse, small
scale recreational facilities such as pickleball, soccer, or shuffleboard, and
pavilions. Pavilions associated with an amenity center are open air structures
that typically allow for shade outdoor concerts, exhibits, and other activities
commonly associated with neighborhood events. Designs of amenity centers and
pavilions should be similar in architecture and material as the residential
development.

      5.   Square. Squares are defined as small or medium open spaces. Squares
serve as a more formal open space type for gathering for civic, social, and
commercial purposes. Squares are typically rectilinear in shape and are
bordered on all sides by a vehicular right-of-way (public and private), which,
together with building frontages, creates a definition and boundary. Features
shall include a combination of seating areas, pedestrian facilities, play
areas, shade structures, gazebos, seating areas, playgrounds, public art,
statues and monuments.

      6.   Linear Park. Linear parks are defined as medium or large open
spaces. Linear parks may be formalized based on function (i.e., provide
multimodal or connectivity opportunities). Linear parks typically take
advantage of scenic environmental attributes and follow a natural feature
including but not limited to a stream, wetland system, or man-made natural
feature. Features shall include a combination of natural environmental features
such as streams, benches, picnic tables, lawn games, and shade structures.

      8.   Stormwater. A maximum twenty percent (20%) of total required open
space may be stormwater facilities. Only wet stormwater facilities may be
counted toward this requirement. Dry pond facilities shall not be counted
toward this requirement. Any stormwater facility used toward such requirement
shall be treated as a site amenity. In order to be considered a site amenity
that is credited towards open space requirements, the stormwater facility shall
be publicly accessible and must be a public edge, through improved or primitive
trails; provide gentle slopes of three-to-one (3:1) or less; include pedestrian
elements such as paths, benches and similar aspects to and around the facility;
and vegetation whether planted or retained. For the purposes of this Section,
improved and primitive trails are defined below:
         a.   Improved Trail. An improved trail shall be defined as a clearly
marked, paved, impervious trail.
         b.   Primitive Trail. A primitive trail shall be defined as an
unpaved, pervious trail that consists of mulch, crushed stone or similar
material.

percent (20%) of total required open space may be environmentally sensitive
lands such as wetlands, protected stream buffers, and floodplains.
      10.   Ponds and Lakes. A maximum of five percent (5%) of total required
open space may be ponds and lakes not associated with stormwater retention if
at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the shoreline is a public edge. Public
access shall be provided that is equivalent to the access provided to private
landowners around the lake.
      11.   Multi-Phased Developments. In multi-phased developments open space
shall be provided for each phase in an amount sufficient to satisfy the open
space requirements for the subject phase of development and all preceding
phases of development.
      12.   Landscape Section. Any landscaping of open spaces shall be in
accordance with Section
8.3., Landscaping, Buffering, Fences and Walls.
   F.   Greenways. Greenways preserve and create open space, encourage physical
fitness, provide alternative means of transportation, create opportunities for
outdoor recreation, and provide connectivity between open spaces, schools,
cultural sites, neighborhoods, and other commuter destinations. Where land is
designated as part of the City's adopted greenway/bikeway system, development
shall comply with the City's adopted Greenway/Bikeway Master Plan. Optionally,
new development may also provide additional greenways and connections to
greenways in accordance with the standards of this Section.
      l.   Greenway Design. All greenways shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet
wide within a dedicated right-of-way or public easement of at least twenty (20)
feet. Greenway connectors shall be a minimum of six (6) feet wide.

The Planning Director may approve a design alternative for portions of a
greenway to be primitive trails, provided a written narrative and illustration
of the proposed design alternative is submitted for review.
      5.   Public Access. All greenways and greenway connectors shall be
maintained for public access, whether by easement or by public dedication.
      6.   Amenities. For land designated as part of the City's adopted
greenway/bikeway system, greenways shall provide basic amenities for targeted
users. Such greenways shall provide at least three (3) of the following:
drinking fountains, restrooms, trash receptacles, benches, bicycle racks, and
shade structures. Way station facilities may also be considered for greenways.
These facilities may also include small buildings/kiosks containing exhibits
and minor food provisions. Land not designated as part of the City's adopted
greenway/bikeway system is not required to meet this requirement.
      7.   Open Space Considerations. Land area dedicated as a greenway shall
be credited towards applicable open space percentage requirements in this
Section. Greenways are considered to be a passive feature.
   G.   Ownership of Open Space. Open space is intended to remain under private
ownership (i.e. not under City ownership) while still being available for
public use by residents and users of a development. Ownership of open space
shall remain with the owner of the land unless one of the following
circumstances exist:
      1.   Homeowners Association (HOA)/Property Owners Association (POA). Open
spaces may be owned in common by the owners of a development through a
recognized owners association (or similar ownership association).
      2.   Nonprofit. Open spaces may be conveyed to a nonprofit organization
(i.e., a conservation group, land trust, and the like) for management. The
nonprofit shall be required to manage and maintain the open space.
   H.   Maintenance of Open Space. The owner of open space shall be required to
maintain the open space. This shall include regular maintenance of vegetation
as well as infrastructure components (stormwater facilities paths, impervious
surfaces, amenities, and the like). Failure to maintain the open space in a
good and safe condition (i.e. meeting the standards for maintenance of
landscaping in Section
8.3., Landscaping, Buffering, Fences and Walls), shall result in potential
penalty by the City, pursuant to Section
1.1.10 of this UDO.
   I.   Conservation Subdivisions. For developments that exceed the minimum
requirements of this Section, this UDO allows for the design and implementation
of conservation subdivisions, as defined in Section 8.1., Subdivision
Regulations. Conservation subdivisions are configured to protect and preserve
floodways, wetlands, woodlands and existing open space. Because of their unique
nature, conservation subdivisions may allow for development flexibility to
build on smaller lots when open space is provided that exceeds the minimum
standards of this Section. Conservation subdivisions may only be permitted in
compliance with the standards of Section
8.1.2.D., Conservation Subdivision.
(Am. Ord. O-2023-31, passed 7-18-23)
8.9. LIGHTING
   A.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Section is to regulate the
intensity of exterior lighting and establish standards to minimize the adverse
impacts of excessive light intensity. The intent of these standards is to:
      1.   Prevent light from non-residential and multifamily developments from
excessively illuminating other properties and street rights-of-way;
      2.   Permit exterior lighting at the minimum levels necessary for public
safety;
      3.   Provide for safety of motor vehicles and pedestrians; and
      4.   Prevent light pollution into the night sky.
   B.   Applicability. The standards of this Section shall apply for non-
residential, multifamily and industrial buildings/developments, including off-
street parking facilities and loading/unloading areas.
   C.   Exemptions. The following are exempted from the standards of this
Section:
      1.   Lighting exempt under state or federal law;
      2.   FAA required lighting for telecommunication devices or buildings;
      3.   Temporary lighting used by emergency services;
      4.   Security lighting, which is controlled by activity centers, so long
the duration is fifteen (15) minutes or less;
      5.   Lighting used underwater for swimming pools, fountains or spas; and
      6.   Temporary residential lighting used in decoration.
   D.   Height.
      1.   Light fixtures shall be a maximum thirty (30) feet for the lighting
of vehicle use areas (such as parking lots and streets).
      2.   Light fixtures shall be twelve (12) to fifteen (15) feet in height
for pedestrian oriented areas such as sidewalks, pathways, plazas, and public
gathering places.
Figure 8.9.1: Light Fixture Height, below, illustrates the maximum allowed
height of lighting within a vehicle use area as compared to the maximum allowed
height of lighting in pedestrian-oriented areas.

   E.   Lighting Location. Lighting fixtures shall be located within landscaped
areas when practical, may not impede pedestrian flows, and be placed to ensure
a consistent patterns of light.
      1.   Parking Area Lighting Location. The height of light fixtures within
a parking area shall be arranged so that the tallest fixtures are in the center
of the parking area, and the lowest heights are at the perimeter of the parking
area.
      2.   Light fixtures height shall not exceed thirty (30) feet within the
center of a parking area and shall decrease height to twelve (12) to fifteen
(15) feet at the boundary of the parking area.
      3.   To avoid conflict in layout, parking lot lighting must be
coordinated with the parking lot’s landscaping. Lighting design shall be
coordinated with the landscape plan to ensure that vegetation growth will not
substantially impair the intended illumination.
Figure 8.9.2: Parking Area Lighting, illustrates a typical arrangement of
parking area lighting with the tallest light fixtures decreasing toward the
edge of property.

   F.   Lighting Intensity Standards.
Figure 8.9.3: Specific Lighting Standards, defines specific standards for
lighting intensity based upon the land use involved. Values are presented in
allowable foot-candles (fc) maintained (measured horizontally) at grade and are
to be averaged throughout the site to avoid hot spots and ensure minimum values
at the edge of the development area.

   G.   Lighting Standards for Unique Uses.
      1.   Sports Fields. Lighting for sports fields and outdoor courts is
generally in excess of general outdoor lighting levels. Recreation lighting
levels established by Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA)
are to be used as the standard. Higher lighting levels for tournament or high
league play are sometimes required and must be approved by the Planning and
Development Director or designee. All sports fields or tennis/basketball courts
must meet the following minimum standards:
         a.   Fixtures must be fitted with manufacturer’s glare control
package.
         b.   Lighting shall be extinguished no later than one hour after the
event ends.
         c.   Fixtures must be designed with a sharp cutoff and aimed so that
their beams fall within the primary playing area and the immediate
surroundings, so that off-site direct illumination is significantly restricted.
         d.   Sports fields may have lighting fixtures a maximum eighty (80)
feet in height.
      2.   Convenience Store with Fuel Pumps. For convenience stores with fuel
pumps (i.e. gas station), all light fixtures mounted on the lower surface of
canopies must be fully shielded in and of themselves (canopy edges do not
qualify as shielding). Light fixtures mounted on canopies may be recessed so
that lens cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the
canopy or shielded by the fixture or the edge of the canopy so that light is
restrained to seventy degrees (70°) or less from vertical.
         a.   The light source shall be metal halide, low pressure sodium or
high-pressure sodium (maximum of 150 watts).
         b.   Lighting levels shall be no greater than twenty lumens (20.0 fc)
under the canopy.
         c.   Areas outside service station pump island canopy shall be
illuminated so that the maximum horizontal luminance at grade level is no more
than ten lumens (10.0 fc).
8.10. STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT
8.10.1. DENSITY AND INTENSITY.
   A.   Residential Density. The City has defined ten (10) character areas in
the adopted land Use Plan, Forward Monroe, which are defined by a variety of
residential densities density) and intensities.
   B.   Calculation of Density. Residential density shall be measured by
dwelling units per net acre (du/ac).
      1.   All residential densities denoted in the adopted Forward Monroe plan
are not guaranteed by right. The appropriate allocation of density shall
encourage sustainable development.
      2.   Subdivision, zoning, and site plan review criteria and procedures
shall assure that density is consistent with established residential
development patterns and provides equitable use of the land.
      3.   Residential Density is calculated as net density. Density is not
transferable across state roads. Existing and proposed street right-of-way,
stream buffers, flood plain, and utility easements shall not be used to
calculate maximum site density.
   C.   Non-Residential Intensity Defined. Floor Area Ratio (FAR). Non-
Residential Development (“Intensity”) is measured in Floor Area Ratio (FAR).
FAR is calculated by dividing the total size of the building/structure (in
square feet) by the total size (in square feet) of the lot on which the
building is located. For example, a 5,000-square foot building on a 10,000
square foot lot equals an FAR of 0.5.

8.10.2. STANDARDS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY.
   Standards of general applicability shall include the subsections below.
These standards shall be defined and make up the requirements of each
district’s development standards table.
   A.   Building Height. Building Height shall be defined by stories rather
than a specific height expressed in feet; however each story shall have maximum
height limitations expressed in feet. The measurement of a “story” shall be
defined in Section
4.1.4.A. 2 below. Height is limited to a maximum story allowance in each
district’s standard development table.

      2.   Measurement of Story. For the purpose of calculating heights of a
story, the ground floor (i.e. first story) of a structure shall be a maximum of
fifteen (15) feet. Additional stories shall be a maximum of twelve (12) feet
for each individual story. Building heights are limited through the district
development standards table for each district. To allow for a wide variety of
building designs, requests to modify the allowable height of stories, so long
as the maximum permitted height of the structure is not exceeded, may be
permitted via a design alternative.
         a.   Habitable Space. Stories are understood to also include the
habitable space of a building excluding rooflines, architectural features or
similar. If there is habitable space on the rooftop of a structure (i.e. an
active eating area, pool, or rooftop lounge), it is understood this shall
constitute a story as defined in this UDO. Non-habitable rooftop elements, such
as cornices, porch roofs, turrets, towers, or dormers, are limited to ten (10)
feet in height. Non-habitable rooftop structures, such as structures used for
sheltering mechanical and electrical equipment, tanks, elevators and related
machinery, shall be limited to fifteen (15) feet in height, not including base

measured from the nearest part of the applicable building, structure or sign,
measured perpendicularly to the lot line or street right-of-way line. Setbacks
are designated by a front setback requirement, side setback requirements, and a
rear setback requirement. Provisions for setbacks for accessory structures are
made in each respective district below, or in Section 7: Permissible Uses and
Standards, of the UDO for each respective use. It is understood, for the
purpose of calculating setback requirements and yards, three configuration of
lots exist: interior lots, corner lots, and through lots. A lot which abuts a
cul-de-sac street design, featuring a radial primary street yard, shall measure
its primary street setback at the point in which the side and front lot lines
would have met without rounding.
      1.   Interior Lot. A lot bounded by a street on only one side. For the
purpose of setbacks and yards, the street yard shall be recognized as the
primary (i.e. front) yard. An interior lot shall have one primary front yard,
two side yards, and one rear yard. Orientation of the home, driveway and
entrances shall be required respective of the primary front yard.

§ 158.00 PREAMBLE.
   The sedimentation of streams, lakes and other waters of this state
constitute a major pollution problem. Sedimentation occurs from the erosion or
depositing of soil and other materials into the waters, principally from
construction sites and road maintenance. The continued development of this City
will result in an intensification of pollution through sedimentation unless
timely and appropriate action is taken. Control of erosion and sedimentation is
deemed vital to the public interest and necessary to the public health and
welfare, and expenditures of funds for erosion and sedimentation control
programs shall be deemed for a public purpose. It is the purpose of this
Article to provide for the creation, administration, and enforcement of a
program and for the adoption of minimal mandatory standards which will permit
development of this City to continue with the least detrimental effects from
pollution by sedimentation.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.01 PURPOSE.

    (A)   Regulating certain land-disturbing activity to control accelerated
erosion and sedimentation in order to prevent the pollution of water and other
damage to lakes, watercourses, and other public and private property by
sedimentation; and
   (B)   Establishing procedures through which these purposes can be fulfilled.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.02 JURISDICTION.

(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02; Am. Ord. O-2019-14, passed 4-2-19)
§ 158.05 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Plan required.  No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity
which uncovers more than 12,000 square feet of land for commercial, industrial,
or subdivision development without having a plan approved by the City of Monroe
Erosion Control Specialist. Land-disturbing activities resulting from single-
family residential development on an individual lot which disturbs one acre of
land or less are excluded from plan submittal and approval, provided that
erosion control devices are installed in accordance with the details for
residential lot development found in the City of Monroe Standard Specifications
and Detail Manual. Single-family residential development exceeding one (1) acre
of land disturbed will be required to submit for plan approval. Land-disturbing
activities resulting from single-family residential development on multiple
contiguous lots which disturb a total of one (1) acre of land or less may
conductsuch activity with a single approved plan encompassing all the lots or
with separate approved ESC Installation and Maintenance Agreements for each
lot.   (B)   ESC Installation and Maintenance Agreement required.  No person
shall initiate any land-disturbing activity for the purpose of new single-
family residential development on an individual lot to a maximum of one (1)
acre, without having an ESC Installation and Maintenance Agreement approved by
the City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist.   (C)   Protection of property.
Persons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures
to protect all public and private property from damage caused by such
activity.   (D)   Basic control objectives. A plan may be disapproved pursuant
to §
158.16 of this ordinance if the plan fails to address the following control
objectives:      (1)   Identify critical areas. On-site areas which are subject
to severe erosion, and offsite areas which are especially vulnerable to damage
from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special
attention.      (2)   Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activity is
to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible
time.      (3)   Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be
planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one
time.      (4)   Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating
upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment
loss during the period of exposure.      (5)   Control sedimentation. All land-
disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site
sedimentation damage.      (6)   Manage storm water runoff.  When the increase
in the velocity of storm water runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity
is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans
are to include measures to control the velocity to the point of discharge so as
to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the
stream.(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02; Am. Ord. O-2003-33, passed 6-17-03)
§ 158.06 MANDATORY STANDARDS FOR LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITIES.
   No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this ordinance shall
be undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standard:
   (A)   Buffer zone.
      (1)   No land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or
improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural
watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the
watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25% of
the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity.
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided, the width of the buffer zone begins and
is measured landward from the normal pool elevation of impounded structures
(lakes) to the nearest edge of the disturbed area and/ or five feet from the
edge of the top of the bank of streams or rivers to the nearest edge of the
disturbed area. Natural or artificial means of confining visible siltation must
be placed, constructed or installed outside the undisturbed buffer zone.
      (3)   For any watercourse, where more than one stream buffer width is
imposed by City of Monroe Code of Ordinance or other local, state or federal
law(s), rule(s), or regulation(s), the greater buffer width stipulated shall
apply.
   (B)   Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall
be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other
adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left
exposed will, within 14 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading, be
planted or otherwise be provided with ground cover, devices, or structures
sufficient to restrain erosion.
   (C)   Ground cover. Whenever more than 12,000 square feet of land is
uncovered or new residential development on an individual lot is initiated, the
person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation
and erosion control devices and practices as are sufficient to retain the
sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the
tract during construction upon and development of said tract, and shall plant
or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion
after completion of construction or development. Provisions for a ground cover
sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished within 15 working days or
60 calendar days, which is shorter following completion of construction or
development.
   (D)   Prior plan approval. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing
activity on a tract if more than 12,000 square feet of land is to be uncovered,
excluding single-family residential development in accordance with §
158.05(B), unless, 30 or more days prior to initiating the activity, a plan is
filed with and approved by the City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist. The
Erosion Control Specialist shall forward to the North Carolina Director of the
Division of Water Quality a copy of each plan for a land-disturbing activity
that involves the utilization of ditches for the purpose of dewatering or
lowering the water table of the tract.
   (E)   Zoning permits. Any person requesting a grading permit in association
with a land-disturbing activity on a tract which involves the uncovering of
more than twelve thousand (12,000) square feet of land or new residential
development on an individual lot, shall be required to have an approved Erosion
and Sedimentation Control Plan or ESC Installation and Maintenance Agreement in
accordance with this ordinance.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02; Am. Ord. O-2003-33, passed 6-17-03; Am. Ord. O-
2011-12, passed 6-7-11)
§ 158.07 DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be
so planned, designed, and constructed as to provide protection from the
calculated maximum peak rate of storm water runoff from the ten-year storm.
Storm water runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA,
Natural Resources Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for
Conservation Practices," or other acceptable calculation procedures.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.08 STORMWATER OUTLET PROTECTION.
   (A)   Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post-
construction velocity of the ten- year storm runoff in the receiving
watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:
      (1)   The velocity established in Table 158.08-1 of this section; or
      (2)   The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving
watercourse prior to the land-disturbing activity.
   (B)   If the conditions of division (A) cannot be met, then the receiving
watercourse to and including the discharge point shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds
the "prior to land-disturbing activity" velocity by 10%.
   (C)   Acceptable management measures. Measures applied alone or in
combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are
no objectionable secondary consequences. The City recognizes that the
management of storm water runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and
bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will
be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce
successful results. Some alternatives are to:
      (1)   Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including
measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas
rendered impervious.
      (2)   Avoid increases in storm water runoff discharge velocities by using
vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high
velocity paved sections.
      (3)   Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities
to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge. These may range from
simple rip-rapped sections to complex structures.
      (4)   Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving
cross sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining.
   (D)   Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated
that storm water discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the
receiving watercourse.
   (E)   Maximum permissible velocity for storm water discharges shall be
regulated in accordance with Table 158.08-1 below.

§ 158.09 BORROW AND WASTE AREAS.
   When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person
conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, areas from which borrow is
obtained and which are not regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of
1971, and waste areas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by
the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources' Division of
Solid Waste Management, shall be considered as part of the land-disturbing
activity where the borrow material is being used or from which the waste
material originated. When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is
not the person obtaining the borrow and/or disposing of the waste, these areas
shall be considered a separate land-disturbing activity.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.10 ACCESS AND HAUL ROADS.
   Temporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or
used in connection with any land-disturbing activity shall be considered a part
of such activity.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.11 OPERATIONS IN LAKES OR NATURAL WATERCOURSES.
   Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or
under a lake or natural watercourse shall be planned and conducted in such a
manner as to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream
channel. The relocation of a lake, stream or other watercourse where relocation
is an essential part of the proposed activity, shall be planned and executed so
as to minimize changes in the lake, stream or other watercourse flow
characteristics, except when justification acceptable to the City for
significant alteration to flow characteristic is provided.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.12 RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
   During the development of a site, the person conducting the land-disturbing
activity shall install and maintain all temporary and permanent erosion and
sedimentation control measures as required by the approved plan or any
provision of this ordinance or the Act, or any order adopted pursuant to this
ordinance or the Act. After site development, the landowner or person in
possession of the land shall install and/or maintain all necessary permanent
erosion and sediment control measures, except those measures installed within a
road or street right-of-way or easement accepted for maintenance by a
governmental agency.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.13 ADDITIONAL MEASURES.
   Whenever the City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist determines that
significant sedimentation is occurring as a result of land-disturbing activity,
despite application and maintenance of protective practices, the person
conducting the land-disturbing activity will be required to and shall take
additional protective action.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.14 EXISTING UNCOVERED AREAS.
   (A)   All uncovered areas existing on the effective date of this ordinance
which resulted from land-disturbing activity which exceed one acre of land,
that are subject to continued accelerated erosion and are causing off-site
damage from sedimentation, shall be provided with a ground cover or other
protective measures, structures, or devices sufficient to restrain accelerated
erosion and control off-site sedimentation.
   (B)   The City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist will serve upon the
landowner or other person in possession or control of that land a written
notice of violation by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,
or other means reasonably calculated to give actual notice. The notice will set
forth the measures needed to comply, and will state the time within which such
measures must be completed. In determining the measures required and the time
allowed for compliance, the Erosion Control Specialist shall take into
consideration the economic feasibility, technology, and quantity of work
required,and shall set reasonable and attainable time limits of compliance.
   (C)   The City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist reserves the right to
require preparation and approval of a plan in any instance where extensive
control measures are required.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.15 PERMITS.
   (A)   No person shall undertake any land-disturbing activity subject to this
ordinance without having first obtained a Plan Certificate and Letter of
Approval or ESC Installation and Maintenance Agreement Approval from the City
of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist, except that no Plan Certificate and
Letter of Approval or ESC Installation and Maintenance Agreement Approval shall
be required for any land-disturbing activity:
      (1)   For the purpose of fighting fires;
      (2)   For the stock piling of raw or processed sand, stone, or gravel in
material processing plants and storage yards, provided that sediment control
measures have been utilized to protect against off-site damage; or
      (3)   That does not disturb more than 12,000 square feet in surface area.
In determining the area, lands under one or diverse ownership being developed
as a unit will be aggregated.
   (B)   Although a Plan Certificate and Letter of Approval is not required for
land-disturbing activity comprising less than twelve thousand (12,000) square
feet of land or less than one (1) acre for residential projects, such activity
shall be subject to all other requirements of this ordinance and any other
applicable standards or ordinances adopted by the City of Monroe.
   (C)   Submittals for erosion and sediment control plan approval and erosion
control inspections shall be subject to any and all relevant fees as adopted by
the City Council and prescribed in the City of Monroe Code of Ordinances. Fees
shall accompany plan submittals, otherwise the submittal shall be determined
incomplete and shall be returned to the applicant.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02; Am. Ord. O-2003-33, passed 6-17-03)
§ 158.16 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PLANS.
   (A)   Persons conducting land-disturbing activity shall be responsible for
preparing a plan for all land-disturbing activities subject to this ordinance
whenever the proposed activity is to be undertaken on a tract disturbing more
than 12,000 square feet of land, excluding single-family residential
development addressed in §
158.05(B).
   (B)   Seven complete copies of the plan shall be filed with the City of
Monroe Erosion Control Specialist in the office of the City of Monroe
Engineering Department at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the
proposed activity. A fee, made payable to the City of Monroe, shall be charged
for each plan review. Such fee shall be in accordance with a fee schedule
adopted by the City of Monroe City Council. No plan shall be considered
complete unless accompanied by such fee and a performance bond in the form of a
certified check, cash or irrevocable letter of credit, in an amount deemed
sufficient by the Engineering Department to cover all costs of protection or
other improvements required to establish protective cover on the site in
conformity with this ordinance. The performance bond shall remain effective
until work has been completed, inspected and approved by the Engineering
Department.
   (C)   One complete set shall be transmitted to the Union Soil and Water
Conservation District (SWCD) for their review. The SWCD shall be given up to
twenty (20) days to make comment on the plan. Failure of the SWCD to submit its
comments to the City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist within such time
period shall not delay final action on the proposed plan by the City of Monroe
Erosion Control Specialist.
   (D)   The City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist shall render a decision
on a plan within 30 days of submittal. The City of Monroe Erosion Control
Specialist shall condition approval of a draft plan upon the applicants'
compliance with local, state and federal water quality laws, regulations,
ordinances and rules. Such decision shall be approval, approval with
modifications, approval with performance reservations, or disapproval. Failure
to approve, approve with modifications or performance reservations, or
disapprove a complete plan within 30 days of receipt shall be deemed approval.
   (E)   Any final decision made pertaining to the proposed plan shall be filed
in the City of Monroe Engineering Department (or as otherwise designated by the
City) and sent to the applicant by first class mail.
   (F)   Denial of a plan or a revised plan must specifically state in writing
the reasons for disapproval. The City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist must
approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised plan within 15
days of receipt, or it is deemed to be approved.
   (G)   Plan approval shall expire three years following the date of approval,
if no land-disturbing activity has been undertaken. If, following commencement
of a land-disturbing activity pursuant to an approved plan, the City of Monroe
Erosion Control Specialist determines that the plan is inadequate to meet the
requirements of this section, the Erosion Control Specialist may require any
revision of the plan that is necessary to comply with this section.
   (H)   Persons conducting land-disturbing activities which are addressed by §
158.16 shall have secured a Plan Certificate and Letter of Approval (in
accordance with procedures described herein) before any land-disturbing
activities commence. A copy of the approved plan and the Certificate of Plan
Approval shall be maintained at the job site by the persons conducting the
land-disturbing activity. After approving the plan, if the City of Monroe
Erosion Control Specialist, either upon review of such plan or on inspection of
the job site, determines that a significant risk of accelerated erosion or off-
site sedimentation exists, the Specialist may require that a revised plan be
submitted. Pending the preparation and approval of the revised plan, work shall
cease or shall continue under conditions outlined by the Erosion Control
Specialist.
   (I)   A plan may be disapproved unless accompanied by an authorized
statement of financial responsibility and ownership. This statement shall be
signed by the person financially responsible for the land-disturbing activity
or their attorney-in-fact. The statement shall include the mailing and street
addresses of the principal place of business of the person financially
responsible and of the owner of the land or their registered agents. If the
person financially responsible is not a resident of North Carolina, a North
Carolina agent must be designated in the statement for the purpose of receiving
notice of compliance or non-compliance with the plan, the Act, this ordinance,
or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this ordinance. If the
applicant is not the owner of the land to be disturbed, the draft erosion and
sedimentation control plan must include the owner's written consent for the
applicant to submit a draft erosion and sedimentation control plan and to
conduct the anticipated land disturbing activity.
   (J)   The person submitting a plan to the City of Monroe Erosion Control
Specialist is, prior to submission of the plan, solely and exclusively
responsible for determining whether the proposed land-disturbing activities
require any form of state or federal environmental certification or
documentation. Any plan submitted for a land-disturbing activity for which an
environmental document is required by the North Carolina Environmental Policy
Act (G.S. § 113A-1 et seq.) shall be deemed incomplete until a complete
environmental document is available for City review. The City of Monroe Erosion
Control Specialist, upon discovery that an environmental certification or
documentation is required but was not obtained, shall promptly notify the
person submitting the plan that the 30 day time limit for review of the plan
pursuant to §
158.16(D) of this ordinance shall not begin until a complete environmental
document or certificate is available for review by the City of Monroe Erosion
Control Specialist. However, no term or condition in the ordinance shall be
interpreted to place the burden for determining the necessity for an
environmental certificate or documentation upon the City of Monroe Erosion
Control Specialist, and the person submitting the plan, as well as any other
persons specified by law, rule or regulation, shall remain solely and
exclusively responsible for such determination.
   (K)   The plan required by this section shall contain architectural and
engineering drawings, maps, assumptions, calculations, and narrative statements
as needed to adequately describe the proposed development of the tract and the
measures planned to comply with the requirements of this ordinance. Any erosion
and sediment control measures and/or devices must be drawn to scale and contour
when deemed applicable by the City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist. Plan
content may vary to meet the needs of specific site requirements. Detailed
guidelines for plan preparation shall be found in the City of Monroe Standard
Specifications and Detail Manual. The Erosion Control Specialist shall
automatically disapprove a plan if it is determined that implementation of the
plan would result in a violation of rules adopted by the Environmental
Management Commission to protect riparian buffers along surface waters.
   (L)   A plan may be disapproved upon a finding that an applicant, or a
parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of the applicant:
      (1)   Is conducting or has conducted land-disturbing activity without an
approved plan, or has received notice of violation of a plan previously
approved by the NCSCC or the City pursuant to the Act and has not complied with
the notice within the time specified in the notice;
      (2)   Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to the Act or a
local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act by the time the payment is due;
      (3)   Has been convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. § 113A-64(b)
or any criminal provision of a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act; or
      (4)   Has failed to substantially comply with applicable local, state or
federal laws, regulations, rules or ordinances adopted pursuant to the Act. For
purposes of this subsection (L), an applicant's record may be considered for
only the two years prior to the application date.
   (M)   Applications for amendment of a plan in written and/or graphic form
maybe made at any time under the same format as the original application. Until
such time as said amendment is approved by City of Monroe Erosion Control
Specialist, land-disturbing activity shall not proceed except in accordance
with the plan as originally approved.
   (N)   Any person engaged in land-disturbing activity who fails to file a
plan in accordance with this ordinance, or who conducts a land-disturbing
activity except in accordance with provisions of an approved plan shall be
deemed in violation of this ordinance.

2011-12, passed 6-7-11; Am. Ord. O-2019-14, passed 4-2-19)
§ 158.17 INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS.
   (A)   The City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist will periodically
inspect land-disturbing activities to ensure compliance with the Act, this
ordinance, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this ordinance, and
to determine whether the measures required in the plan are effective in
controlling erosion and sediment resulting from land-disturbing activity.
Notice of the right to inspect shall be included in the certificate of approval
of each plan. The landowner, the financially responsible party, or the
landowner's or the financially responsible party's agent shall perform an
inspection of the area covered by the plan after each phase of the plan has
been completed and after establishment of temporary ground cover in accordance
with §
158.06 (B). The person who performs the inspection shall maintain and make
available a record of the inspection at the site of the land-disturbing
activity. The record shall set out any significant deviation from the approved
erosion control plan, identify any measures that may be required to correct the
deviation, and document the completion of those measures. The record shall be
maintained until permanent ground cover has been established as required by the
approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.
   (B)   No person shall willfully resist, delay, or obstruct the City of
Monroe Erosion Control Specialist, while inspecting or attempting to inspect a
land-disturbing activity under this section.
   (C)   If it is determined that a person engaged in the land-disturbing
activity has failed to comply with the Act, this ordinance, or rules, or orders
adopted or issued pursuant to this ordinance, or has failed to comply with an
approved plan, a notice of violation shall be served upon that person. The
notice shall be served by registered or certified mail or by any means
authorized under G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 4. The notice of violation shall specify a
date by which, or a cure period within which, the person must comply with this
ordinance, and inform the person of the actions that need to be taken to comply
with this ordinance. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to
achieve compliance with the plan, specify a reasonable time period within which
such measures shall be completed, and warn that failure to correct the
violation within the time period stated is subject to a civil penalty and other
enforcement actions. However, no time period for compliance need be given for
failure to submit a plan for approval, for obstructing, hampering or
interfering with an authorized representative while in the process of carrying
out his or her official duties, or for the penalty that may be assessed
pursuant to this ordinance for the day the violation is assessed by the City of
Monroe Erosion Control Specialist. Any person who fails to comply within the
time specified in the notice is subject to additional civil and criminal
penalties for a continuing violation as provided in this ordinance.
   (D)   The City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist shall have the power to
conduct such investigation as may be reasonably deemed necessary to carry out
duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at
reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of
investigating and inspecting the sites of any land-disturbing activity. No
person shall refuse entry or access to the City of Monroe Erosion Control
Specialist who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents
appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, or interfere
with any such representative while in the process of carrying out their
official duties as provided in this ordinance.
   (E)   The City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist shall also have the
power to require written statements, or the filing of reports under oath, with
respect to pertinent questions relating to land-disturbing activity.
   (F)   On any tract on which five or more acres are disturbed, the person
conducting land-disturbing activity will be responsible for self inspection of
erosion and sedimentation control facilities at least once every seven days or
within 24 hours of a storm event of greater than 0.5 inches of rain per 24-hour
period.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02; Am. Ord. O-2003-33, passed 6-17-03; Am. Ord. O-
2011-12, passed 6-7-11)
§ 158.18 PENALTIES.
   (A)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any person who violates any of the provisions of the applicable
State, Federal or local laws, rules, regulations or ordinances, including this
Ordinance, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to applicable State,
Federal or local laws, rules, regulations or ordinances, including this
Ordinance, or who initiates or continues a land-disturbing activity for which a
plan is required except in accordance with the terms, conditions, and
provisions of an approved plan, is subject to a civil penalty. A person may be
immediately assessed a maximum civil penalty of up to $5,000 on the date any
violation is first assessed by the City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist.
An additional maximum civil penalty of up to $5,000 per day may be assessed by
the City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist from the day following the date
of initial assessment of a violation if the cure period provided in the Notice
of Violation is not met. If a civil penalty is not assessed immediately on the
date of assessment of a violation the City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist
is not precluded from later assessing a penalty for that date in addition to
other penalties (if any). Penalties are due and payable immediately upon
assessment unless a cure period has been provided in which case the penalties
attributed to any uncured actions (or failures to act) covered by the cure
period are due and payable immediately following failure to cure and lapse of
the cure period. Penalties continue to accrue until the applicable violations
are corrected. When the person has not been assessed any civil penalty under
this subsection for any previous violation, and that person abated continuing
environmental damage resulting from the violation within 180 days from the date
of the notice of violation, the maximum cumulative total civil penalty assessed
under this subsection for all violations associated with the land-disturbing
activity for which the erosion and sedimentation control plan is required is
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).
      (2)   The City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist shall determine the
amount of the civil penalty within established guidelines and shall notify the
person who is assessed the civil penalty of the amount of the penalty and the
reason for assessing the penalty. The notice of assessment shall be served by
any means authorized under G.S. §lA-1, Rule 4, and shall direct the violator to
either pay the assessment or contest the assessment as provided in this
Ordinance or file a request with the Sedimentation Control Commission for
remission of the assessment within 60 days of receipt of the notice. A
remission request must be accompanied by a waiver of the right to a contested
case hearing pursuant to Chapter 150B of the North Carolina General Statutes
and a stipulation of the facts on which the assessment was based. If a violator
does not pay a civil penalty assessed by the City of Monroe Erosion Control
Specialist within 60 days after it is due, the Specialist may institute a civil
action to recover the amount of the assessment. The civil action may be brought
in the General Court of Justice of any county where the violation occurred or
the violator's residence or principal place of business is located. A civil
action must be filed within three years of the date the assessment was due. An
assessment that is not contested is due immediately when the violator is served
with a notice of assessment. An assessment that is contested by the recipient
continues to accrue pending appeal, so long as the violation continues.
      (3)   The maximum civil penalty for a violation is $5,000 per day. The
notice of violation shall describe the violation with reasonable particularity,
specify a permitted cure period within which the violation is to be corrected,
and warn that failure to correct the violation within the prescribed cure
period may result in the assessment of a civil penalty(ies) (or assessment of
additional civil penalties, as the case may be) and other available enforcement
action(s). Permitted cure periods for violations begin the day following the
initial date such violation is first assessed. If, after the cure period has
expired, the violator has not completed the prescribed corrective action, a
civil penalty(ies) may be retroactively assessed on a daily basis, from and
including the date the violation was assessed. Each day of continuing violation
shall constitute a separate violation.
      (4)   No cure period for compliance need be given for any violation
(including without limitation, a failure to submit a plan for approval or for
obstructing, hampering or interfering with an authorized representative while
in the process of carrying out his or her official duties) prior to assessment
of an initial civil penalty for the day the violation is detected, up to the
maximum amount permitted per day.
      (5)   In determining the amount of the penalty, items which may be
considered are the degree and extent of harm caused by the violation, the cost
of rectifying the damage, the amount of money the violator saved by non-
compliance, whether the violation was committed willfully and the prior record
of the violator in complying with or failing to comply with this ordinance.
      (6)   Civil penalties collected by a local government under this
subsection shall be remitted to the Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund in
accordance with G.S. 115C-457.2. Penalties collected by the City of Monroe may
be diminished only by the actual costs of collection. The collection cost
percentage to be used shall be established and approved by the North Carolina
Office of State Budget and Management on an annual basis, based upon the
computation of actual collection costs by The City of Monroe for the prior
fiscal year. The cost percentage shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of
penalties collected.
   (B)   Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any
provision of this ordinance, or rule, regulation or order adopted or issued
pursuant to this ordinance, or who knowingly or willfully initiates or
continues a land-disturbing activity for which a plan is required, except in
accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan,
shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor which may include a fine not to exceed
$5,000.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02; Am. Ord. O-2019-14, passed 4-2-19)
§ 158.19 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   (A)   Whenever the City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist has reasonable
cause to believe that any person is violating or threatening to violate this
ordinance or any term, condition, or provision of an approved plan, he or she
may, either before or after the institution of any other action or proceeding
authorized by this ordinance, institute a civil action for injunctive relief to
restrain the violation or threatened violation. The action shall be brought in
the General Court of Justice of Union County.
   (B)   Upon determination by a court that an alleged violation is occurring
or is threatened, the court shall enter any order of judgment that is necessary
to abate the violation, to ensure that restoration is performed, or to prevent
the threatened violation. The institution of an action for injunctive relief
under this section shall not relieve any party to the proceedings from any
civil or criminal penalty prescribed for violations of this ordinance.
(Ord. O-2002-18, passed 4-2-02)
§ 158.20 RESTORATION OF AREAS AFFECTED BY FAILURE TO COMPLY.
   The City of Monroe Erosion Control Specialist may require a person who
engaged in a land-disturbing activity and failed to retain sediment generated
by the activity as required by §
158.17(B) to restore the waters and land affected by the failure so as to
minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting pollution by sedimentation.
This authority is in addition to any other civil or criminal penalty or
injunctive relief authorized under this ordinance.

(Ord. O-2007-24, passed 9-18-07)
§ 159.103 FINDINGS.
   (A)   It is hereby determined that:
      (1)   Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of
local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding,
soil erosion, stream channel erosion, non-point and point source pollution, and
sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
      (2)   These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are
harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and
      (3)   These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper
design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development
sites.
      (4)   Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean
Water Act") and federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well
as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated
in response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas,
including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those
included in this Ordinance.
   (B)   Therefore, the City Council establishes this set of water quality and
quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law
regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge.
(Ord. O-2007-24, passed 9-18-07)
§ 159.104 PURPOSE.
   (A)   General. The purpose of this Ordinance is to protect, maintain and
enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by
establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects
of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point and point source
pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit
discharges into municipal stormwater systems. It has been determined that
proper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater
runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure;
safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and protect water and
aquatic resources.
   (B)   Specific. This Ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose through the
following specific objectives and means:
      (1)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect
the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
      (2)   Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as
practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, stream bank
erosion, non-point and point source pollution and increases in stream
temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic
habitats;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)    Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the
minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices,
such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of
greenspace, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent
practicable;
      (6)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they
continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no
threat to public safety;
      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of
approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.
      (8)   Coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural
areas with the Unified Development Ordinance.
      (9)   Controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate
stormwater system.
      (10)   Controlling erosion and sedimentation from construction activities
in conjunction with the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance.

§ 159.307 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Any person may petition the City of Monroe for a variance granting
permission to use the person's land in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
Ordinance. To qualify for a variance, the petitioner must show all of the
following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardships would result from strict application of this
Ordinance.
      (2)   The hardships result from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as the location, size, or topography of the property.
      (3)   The hardships did not result from actions taken by the petitioner.

(Ord. O-2007-24, passed 9-18-07)
§ 159.308 ADDITIONAL WATER QUANTITY CONTROL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to the following type developments
or redevelopments:
      (1)   All non-residential sites containing new development and/or
redevelopment including road construction, grading, paving, gravel placement,
and construction of buildings and other structures, which include the creation
of 20,000 square feet or more of new impervious area, within the corporate
limits and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Monroe. Impervious
areas in existence prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall not be
included in the computation of impervious area; and
      (2)   All new residential development and/or redevelopment meeting the
following requirements:
         (a)   Exceeds 1 dwelling units per acre;
         (b)   Provides for private or public street/driveway construction for
access to multiple lots;
         (c)   Requires engineered stormwater control structures as outlined by
this Ordinance.
      (3)   Properties that directly abut regulated floodways as designated by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall be considered exempt from
requirements of this section.
   (B)   General requirements.
      (1)   The engineer or landscape architect of record shall conduct
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering studies for the site for both pre-
development and post-development conditions. The engineer or landscape
architect of record shall provide a certification that the development or
redevelopment will not cause increased off-site flooding, drainage, or erosion
problems.
      (2)   Where it is determined that the development of the site does
increase the peak discharge rate, stormwater quantity control improvements must
be implemented. The stormwater quantity control improvements must limit the
two-year and ten-year post-development peak discharge rates to pre-development
peak discharge rates, to minimize flooding, drainage, and erosion problems.
These improvements may consist of nonstructural approaches such as natural
swales, depressions in the land and other natural approaches, or structural
approaches such as detention structures (wet and dry basins), extended
detention facilities and alternative best management practices (BMPs) with
provisions for stormwater quantity control. A combination of nonstructural and
structural approaches is encouraged.
      (3)   For stormwater management improvements proposed to achieve
compliance with quantity control requirements of this section, a hydrologic-
hydraulic analysis of the site drainage system in the pre-development condition
and the post-development condition shall be performed. The analysis should be
included with the stormwater management plan and should demonstrate that the
quantity control requirements stated in this section will be achieved by the
proposed improvements. These improvements shall be subject to review and
approval by the Stormwater Administrator.
      (4)   If site characteristics indicate that complying with the minimum
stormwater management requirements of this section will not provide adequate
engineering designs or protection for local residents, and downstream property,
it shall be the site designer's responsibility to exceed the minimum
requirements as necessary.

   (A)   In general.  
      (1)   Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to
be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this Ordinance, and prior to issuance
of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP
pursuant to this Ordinance, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an
operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent
owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the
structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served
by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary
responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement.
      (2)   The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or
owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP,
and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the
structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the City of Monroe a right of
entry in the event that the Stormwater Administrator has reason to believe it
has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the
structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer
an obligation on the City of Monroe to assume responsibility for the structural
BMP.
      (3)   The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the
Stormwater Administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on
the final plat and shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds upon

of Monroe, in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such
instances the City of Monroe shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account.
Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment removal,
structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and
reconstruction of the structural BMPs, upon written notification to the City of
Monroe.
      (3)   Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the
escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits,
whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an
amount equal to fifteen (15) percent of the initial construction cost of the
structural BMPs. Two-thirds (2/3) of the total amount of sinking fund budget
shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five (5) years and
the full amount shall be deposited within ten (10) years following initial
construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into
the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association
shall include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from
the escrow account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of
anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget.
      (4)   The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund
the escrow account may be varied upon approval by the Monroe City Council based
upon good cause shown.

shall constitute a breach of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, the City
of Monroe shall thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the
association and its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby
authorized by the agreement against the property, or both. Interest, collection
costs, and attorney fees shall be added to the recovery.
      (7)   A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the City of
Monroe to maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the City of Monroe shall
not be liable to any person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs.
      (8)   A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish,
limit, or restrict the right of the City of Monroe to enforce any of its
Ordinances as authorized by law.
      (9)   A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the City of Monroe
for any costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP,
unless the City of Monroe has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance
responsibility for the BMP and has accepted dedication of any and all rights
necessary to carry out that maintenance.
      (10)   A provision that a financial statement shall be provided and
included as part of the annual inspection report documenting the available
funding established in the escrow account for operation and maintenance of the

the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BUILT-UPON AREA (BUA). That portion of a development project that is covered
by impervious or partially impervious surface including, but not limited to,
buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots, and paths;
and recreation facilities such as tennis courts. BUILT-UPON AREA does not
include a wooden slatted deck, the water area of a swimming pool, or pervious
or partially pervious paving material to the extent that the paving material
absorbs water or allows water to infiltrate through the paving material.
   DEPARTMENT. The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural
Resources.
   DESIGN MANUAL. The stormwater design manual approved for use in Phase II
jurisdictions by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural
Resources for the proper implementation of the requirements of the Federal
Phase II if stormwater program. All references herein to the DESIGN MANUAL are
to the latest published edition or revision. The DESIGN MANUAL is not part of
the City of Monroe Standard Specifications and Detail Manual.
   DEVELOPMENT.  Any land-disturbing activity that increases the amount of
built-upon area or that otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation
into the soil.
   DIVISION. The Division of Water Quality in the Department.

North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program in the Division of Emergency
Management.
   LARGER COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT OR SALE. Any area where multiple separate
and distinct construction or land-disturbing activities will occur under one
plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not
limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan
application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design)
or physical demarcation (including but not limited to boundary signs, lot
stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur
on a specific plot.
   ONE-YEAR, TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR STORM. The surface runoff resulting from a 24-
hour rainfall of an intensity expected to be equaled or exceeded, on average,
once in 12 months and with a duration of 24 hours.
   OWNER.  The legal or beneficial owner of land, including but not limited to
a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, or long-term
or commercial lessee, or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights
in the property or having legal power of management and control of the
property. OWNER shall include long-term commercial tenants; management
entities, such as those charged with or engaged in the management of properties
for profit; and every person or entity having joint ownership of the property.
A secured lender not in possession of the property does not constitute an
OWNER, unless the secured lender is included within the meaning of OWNER under
another description in this definition, such as a management entity.
   REDEVELOPMENT. Any development on previously-developed land, other than a
rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and
provides equal or greater stormwater control than the previous development.
   STRUCTURAL BMP. A physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter
pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff
velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-
development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of
these goals. STRUCTURAL BMP includes physical practices such as constructed
wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, gassed swales, and other methods
installed or created on real property. STRUCTURAL BMP is pynonymous with
"structural practice," "stormwater control facility," "stormwater control
practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater management practice,"
“stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater treatment systems," and
similar terms used in this Ordinance.
   SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS. For the purposes of determining whether sufficient
progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following
construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan
shall occur: obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a
continuous basis and not discontinued for more than thirty (30) days; or
installation and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building
permit for the construction and approval of a building foundation. SUBSTANTIAL
PROGRESS for purposes of determining whether an approval plan is null and void
is not necessarily the same as "substantial expenditures" used for determining
vested rights pursuant to applicable law.

Carolina has in G.S. Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Article 6 of Chapter
153A; Article 8 of Chapter 160A; and Article 7, 9, and 11 of Chapter 160D
(Effective July 1, 2021), delegated to local governmental units the authority
to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)   Findings of fact.
         (a)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Monroe are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
         (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities
and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other
hazards.
      (3)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to
promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions
designed to:
         (a)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging
increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
         (b)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
         (c)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
flood waters;
         (d)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development
that may increase erosion or flood damage; and
         (e)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
      (4)   Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are to:
         (a)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
         (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
         (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         (d)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
         (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
         (f)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
         (g)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the
National Flood Insurance Program;
         (h)   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
         (i)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas; and
         (j)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a
special flood hazard area.
      (5)   Severability. It is hereby declared by the intention of the council
that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, and phrases of this
ordinance are severable, and if any such section, paragraph, sentence, clause,
or phrase is declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of
competent jurisdiction in a valid judgment or decree, such unconstitutionality
or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining sections, paragraphs,
sentences, clauses, or phrases of this ordinance since the same would have been
enacted without the incorporation into this ordinance of such unconstitutional
or invalid section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase.

on technical data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as
being in the floodplain but is actually on natural high ground above the base
flood elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
and establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure
is not located in a special flood hazard area.
         (b)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical
data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, special flood
hazard area boundaries and floodway delineations, and other planimetric
features.

that provides guidance concerning the building performance standards of the
NFIP, which are contained in Title 44 of the U. S. Code of Federal Regulations
at Section 60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily
by State and local officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP
regulations and by members of the development community, such as design
professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing
bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create
regulations; rather they provide specific guidance for complying with the
minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations. It should be noted that
Technical Bulletins and Technical Fact Sheets provide guidance on the minimum
requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or community requirements that
exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design professionals should contact

determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
            2.    Functionally dependent facilities if determined to meet the
definition as stated in (B) definitions of this ordinance, provided provisions
of (D)(5) administration, variance procedures have been satisfied, and such
facilities are protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety; or
            3.   Any other type of development, provided it meets the
requirements of this section.
         (d)   In passing upon variances, the appeal board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this ordinance, and:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as
defined under division (B) of this ordinance as a functionally dependent
facility, where applicable;
            6.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         (e)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
         (f)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes
of this ordinance, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of
this ordinance.
         (g)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the Base Flood Elevation (BFE)
and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such
construction below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per $100 of insurance
coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance.
         (h)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the State of North Carolina upon request.
         (i)   Conditions for variances:

variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
            4.   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval.
            5.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
               a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
               b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and
               c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         (j)   A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities or
sites, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical
storage facilities that are located in special flood hazard areas provided that
all of the following conditions are met.
            1.   The use serves a critical need in the community.
            2.   No feasible location exists for the use outside the special
flood hazard area.
            3.   The reference level of any structure is elevated or
floodproofed to at least the regulatory flood protection elevation.
            4.   The use complies with all other applicable federal, state and

floodway, non- encroachment area, or stream setback, provided there is no
additional encroachment below the regulatory flood protection elevation in the
floodway, non-encroachment area, or stream setback, and provided that such
repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of
this ordinance.
         (i)   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in (D)(5)(j) administration,
variance procedures, above. A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage
incidental to an allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or
wastewater treatment facility may be located in a special flood hazard area
only if the structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least
the regulatory flood protection elevation and certified in accordance with the
provisions of (D)(2)(c) administration, requirements, certification
requirements above.
         (j)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
         (k)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water

have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
         (m)   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which
approval is required by Federal or State law, including Section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334.
         (n)   When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard
area, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
         (o)   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in
a flood hazard risk zone with multiple Base Flood Elevations (BFEs), the
provisions for the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest BFE
shall apply.
         (p)   Buildings and structures that are located in more than one flood
hazard area shall comply with the provisions associated with the most
restrictive flood hazard area.
      (2)   Specific standards. In all special flood hazard areas where Base
Flood Elevation (BFE) data have been provided, as set forth per (C)(2) general
provisions, special flood hazard areas above or (D)(4) administration,
corrective procedures, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions
of (E)(1) provisions for flood hazard reduction, general standards above, are
required:
         (a)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall
have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in this section.
         (b)    Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in (B) definitions, of this
section. Structures located in A, AE, AO, and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed
to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with division (E)(6)(b). A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the floodproofing standards of this
subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator as set forth (D)(2)(c) administration, requirements,
certification requirements above, along with the operational plan and the
inspection and maintenance plan.
         (c)   Manufactured homes.
            1.   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so
that the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in this section.
            2.    Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement, either by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance
with the most current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for
Manufactured Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to North
Carolina G.S. § 143-143.15. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an
elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the
chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When
the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering
certification is required.
            3.   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet
the requirements of (E)(2)(d) provisions for flood hazard reduction, specific
standards, elevated buildings.
            4.   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
         (d)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
            1.   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall
only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
            2.   Shall not be temperature-controlled or conditioned.
            3.   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at
least to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
            4.   Shall include flood openings to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by
a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum
design criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
               b.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least
one square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
               c.   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each
enclosed area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically
enter and exit;
               d.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no
higher than one foot above the adjacent grade;
               e.    Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions; and
               f.    Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
            5.   Release of restrictive covenant. If a property which is bound
by a non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed areas below BFE,
then the owner may request release of restrictive covenant after staff
inspection and submittal of confirming documentation.
         (e)   Additions/imp rovements.
            1.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
               a.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more non-conforming than the existing structure.
               b.   A substantial improvement, with modifications/
rehabilitations/imp rovements to the existing structure or the common wall is
structurally modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing
structure and the addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
            2.   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require
only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
            3.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
               a.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction.
               b.   A substantial improvement, the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
            4.   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a ten-
year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market
value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply
with the standards for new construction.
   For each building or structure, the ten-year period begins on the date of
the first improvement or repair of that building or structure subsequent to the
effective date of this ordinance. Substantial damage also means flood-related
damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on
the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any
repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The requirement does not, however, include either:
               a.   Any project for improvement of a building required to
correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the
building official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living
conditions.
               b.   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
         (f)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
            1.   Temporary placement: Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive
days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently
attached additions); or meet all the requirements for new construction.
            2.   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet
the limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
         (g)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
            1.   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
            2.   The name, address, and phone number of the individual
responsible for the removal of the temporary structure;
            3.   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
            4.   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the
entity responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
            5.    Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location
outside the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be
moved.
         (h)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, etc.) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the
following criteria shall be met:
            1.   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);

hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection
elevation in conformance with the provisions of (E)(2)(d)4. provisions for
flood hazard reduction, specific standards, elevated buildings, above;
            8.   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square
feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation
or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with division (D)(2)
(c);
            9.   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square
feet or that is a minimal investment of $3,000 or less and satisfies the
criteria outlined above is not required to meet the elevation or floodproofing
standards of (E)(2)(b) provisions for Flood hazard reduction, specific
standards, non-residential construction above. Elevation or floodproofing
certifications are required for all other accessory structures in accordance
with (D)(2)(c) administration, requirements, certification requirements above.

supporting structures shall meet the foundation requirements of the applicable
flood hazard area;
            3.   Above ground tanks, not elevated. Above-ground tanks that do
not meet the elevation requirements of this ordinance shall be permitted in
flood hazard areas provided the tanks are designed, constructed, installed, and
anchored to resist all flood-related and other loads, including the effects of
buoyancy, during conditions of the design flood and without release of contents
in the floodwaters or infiltration by floodwaters into the tanks. Tanks shall
be designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist the potential
buoyant and other flood forces acting on an empty tank during design flood
conditions;
            4.   Tanks, inlets and vents. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets
and vents shall be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or
fitted with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of

elevations. Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Approximate
Zone A and established in (C)(2) general provisions, special flood hazard areas
above, where no Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data have been provided by FEMA, the
following provisions, in addition to the provisions of (E)(1) provisions for
flood hazard reduction, general standards above, shall apply:
         (a)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet
each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is
greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a licensed
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
         (b)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria:
            1.   When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data are available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in (E)(1) provisions for
flood hazard reduction, general standards and (E)(2) specific standards above.
            2.   When floodway or non-encroachment data are available from a
federal, state, or other source, all new construction and substantial
improvements within floodway and non-encroachment areas shall also comply with
the requirements of (E)(2) provisions for flood hazard reduction, specific
standards above and (E)(6) standards for areas of shallow flooding (Zone AO)
below.
            3.   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development
proposals shall provide Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such
BFE data shall be adopted by reference per (C)(2) general provisions, special
flood hazard areas above and utilized in implementing this ordinance.
            4.   When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data are not available from a
federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be
elevated or floodproofed (non residential) to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in (B) definitions. All other applicable
provisions of division (E)(2) provisions for flood hazard reduction, specific
standards above shall also apply.
      (5)   Standards for riverine floodplains with base flood elevations but
without established floodways or non-encroachment areas. Along rivers and
streams where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is provided by FEMA or is
available from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas
are identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS
report, the following requirements shall apply to all development within such
areas:
         (a)   Standards of (E)(1) provisions for flood hazard reduction,
general standards and (E)(2) specific standards above; and
         (b)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is
designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless certification
with supporting technical data by a licensed professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the community.
      (6)   Floodways and non-encroachment areas. Areas, designated as
floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the special flood hazard
areas established per (C)(2) general provisions, special flood hazard areas
above. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to the
standards outlined in (E)(1) provisions for flood hazard reduction, general
standards and (E)(2) specific standards, shall apply to all development within
such areas:
         (a)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
            1.   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit; or
            2.   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management. A Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed
encroachment.
         (b)   If (E)(6) provisions for flood hazard reduction, standards for
areas of shallow flooding (Zone AO) below is satisfied, all development shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this ordinance.
         (c)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
provided the following provisions are met:
            1.   The anchoring and the elevation standards of (E)(2)(c)
provisions for flood hazard reduction, specific standards, manufactured homes
below; and
            2.   The no encroachment standard of (E)(6)(c) provisions for flood
hazard reduction, standards for areas of shallow flooding (Zone AO), below.
      (7)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (Zone AO). Located within
the special flood hazard areas established in (C)(2) general provisions,
special flood hazard areas above, are areas designated as shallow flooding
areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths
of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to
division (E)(1) provisions for flood hazard reduction, general standards and
(E)(2) specific standards above, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall meet the following requirements:
         (a)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the
depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map(FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
         (b)    Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in (a) above so that the structure,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that level shall
be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required per (D)
(2)(c) administration, requirements, certification requirements and (E)(2)(b)
provisions for flood hazard reduction, specific standards, non-residential
construction above.
         (c)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
      (8)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (Zone AH). Within the
special flood hazard areas established in (C)(2) general provisions, special
flood hazard areas above are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These
areas are subject to inundation by 1%-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually
areas of ponding) where average depths are one to three feet. Base Flood
Elevations are derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone.
In addition to §
159.805(A) Boundaries of Floodplain and Floodway Districts, Boundaries, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following
requirements:
         (a)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
   (F)   Legal status provisions.
      (1)   Effect on rights and liabilities under the existing Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance. This ordinance in part comes forward by re-enactment of
some of the provisions of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance enacted
December 16, 2003 as amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather
to re-enact and continue to enforce without interruption of such existing
provisions, so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are
reserved and may be enforced. The enactment of this ordinance shall not affect
any action, suit or proceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the
Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of the City of Monroe enacted on December 16,
2003, as amended, which are not reenacted herein are repealed. The date of the
initial Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance for Union County is December 16,
2003.
      (2)   Effect upon outstanding floodplain development permits. Nothing
herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size, or
designated use of any development or any part thereof for which a floodplain
development permit has been granted by the Floodplain Administrator or his or
her authorized agents before the time of passage of this ordinance; provided,
however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding permit
within a period of six months subsequent to the date of issuance of the
outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this ordinance.
      (3)   Severability. If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of the
ordinance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the
remaining portions of this ordinance.
      (4)   Effective date. This ordinance shall become effective upon
adoption.

§ 159.804 FLOODPLAIN SUBDIVISION PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Notice. An applicant for a planned district authorizing a major
subdivision and an applicant for minor subdivision final plat approval shall be
informed by the planning department of the use and construction restrictions of
any portion of the land to be subdivided if it lies within a floodway or
floodplain.
   (B)   Plat. Final plat approval for any subdivision containing land that
lies within a floodway or floodplain may not be given unless the plat shows the

§ 159.805 BOUNDARIES OF FLOODPLAIN AND FLOODWAY DISTRICTS.
   Boundaries. As used in this subsection, the terms floodplain and floodway
refer in the first instance to certain areas whose boundaries are determined
and can be located on the ground by reference to the specific fluvial
characteristics set forth the definition of these terms. These terms also refer
to overlay zoning districts whose boundaries are established on the map, which
boundaries are intended to correspond to the actual physical location of
floodways and floodplains. These overlay districts thus differ from other
zoning districts whose boundaries are established solely according to planning
or policy, rather than physical criteria. Therefore, the administrator is
authorized to make necessary interpretations as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the floodways or floodplains if there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. Such interpretations,
like other decisions of the administrator, may be appealed to the Board of
Adjustment in accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 157 Unified
Development Ordinance. The Flood Insurance Rate Map numbers of properties
within the corporate limits and extra territorial jurisdiction of the City of
Monroe are as follows: 37179C1ND0C, 37105415001, 37105416001, 37105417001,
37105422001, 37105424001, 3710542500J, 3710542600J, 3710542700J, 37105428001,

of the stream bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of
the bank or 35 feet on each side, whichever is greater.
(Ord. O-2022-73, passed 11-8-22)
§ 159.807 BUFFER REQUIREMENTS.
   Buffers.
   (A)   A 35 foot undisturbed vegetated buffer is required along all perennial
and intermittent stream channels.
   (B)   The buffer shall begin at the most landward limit of the top of bank
or the most landward limit of the normal ponded water level and extend landward
on perpendicularly.
   (C)   Diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the riparian buffer to
the extent practicable.
   (D)   Existing and ongoing uses shall be exempt.
