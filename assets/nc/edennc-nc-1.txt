in any way affect this code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering
system of this code and printed for inclusion in it. When subsequent ordinances
repeal any chapter, section or subsection or any portion thereof, such repealed
portions may be excluded from the code by omission from reprinted pages. The
subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of
repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such
time that this code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted
as a new code by the City Council.
   (B)   Amendments to any of the provisions of this code shall be made by
amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this
code in the following language: “Section ________ of the Code of the City of
Eden, North Carolina, is hereby amended to read as follows: . . . .” The new
provisions shall then be set out in full as desired.
   (C)   If a new section is to be added to the code, the following language
shall be used: “The Code of the City of Eden, North Carolina, is hereby amended
by adding a section, to be numbered ________ which section reads as follows:. .

§ 1-13 SUPPLEMENTATION OF CODE.
   (A)   By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this code shall be
prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the City Council. A
supplement to the code shall include all substantive permanent and general
parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all
changes made thereby in the code. The pages of a supplement shall be so
numbered that they will fit properly into the code and will, where necessary,
replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new
pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the code will be
current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in
the supplement.
   (B)   In preparing a supplement to this code, all portions of the code which
have been repealed shall be excluded from the code by the omission thereof from
reprinted pages.
   (C)   When preparing a supplement to this code, the codifier, meaning the
person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement, may make
formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included
in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a
unified code. For example, the codifier may:
      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
      (2)   Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections
and other subdivisions of the code printed in the supplement, and make changes
in such catchlines, headings and titles;
      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be
inserted in the code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change
existing section or other subdivision numbers;
      (4)   Change the words “this ordinance” or words of the same meaning to
“this chapter,” “this article,” “this division,” etc., as the case may be, or
to “sections _________ through _________,” inserting section numbers to
indicate the sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the
ordinance incorporated into the code; and
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the code, but in no case
shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.

combination of such remedies.
   (B)   The power to enforce an ordinance shall include the power to secure
preliminary injunctions, temporary restraining orders, mandatory injunctions or
prohibitory injunctions, orders of abatement and any other appropriate
equitable remedy issuing from the appropriate division of the North Carolina
General Court of Justice to the full extent that the city is empowered to use
such remedy by the North Carolina General Statutes and the laws of the State of
North Carolina. Legal and equitable action to enforce the ordinance shall be
governed by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings including G.S. §
160A-175(e) and the Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (C)   It shall not be a defense to an application by the city for equitable
relief that it may have an adequate remedy at law.
(Ord. passed 6-20-96)
§ 1-16.1 GENERAL PENALTY FOR VIOLATIONS OF ORDINANCES, PENALTIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   (A)   Any violation of an ordinance that specifically designates the penalty
as a misdemeanor shall be a Class 3 misdemeanor and any person convicted of the
violation shall be subject to punishment in accordance with G.S. § 14-4. Unless
a violation is specifically designated as a misdemeanor, the violation shall
not constitute a misdemeanor or infraction punishable under G.S. § 14-4, but
instead shall be subject to civil penalties and remedies in accordance with
this Article and G.S. § 160A-175.
   (B)   This section shall not be deemed to be the exclusive penalty for
violation of a city ordinance nor shall it in any way be deemed to limit any
legal or equitable remedy or power the city may be empowered to use to enforce
its ordinances.
   (C)   Each act that violates this ordinance and each day upon which a
violation of this ordinance shall occur shall constitute a separate offense
except as may be otherwise specifically provided.
(Ord. passed 6-20-96)
§ 1-16.2 ENFORCEMENT OF ORDINANCES BY CIVIL PENALTIES, NONEXCLUSIVE.
   (A)   In addition to the general penalty provided for in §
1-16.1 of the City Code, an ordinance may provide that a violation of the
ordinance shall subject the offender to a civil penalty.
   (B)   In the event an ordinance provides that a violation thereof shall
subject the offender to a civil penalty, the civil penalty shall be recovered
by the city in a civil action in the nature of a debt if the offender does not
pay the penalty within 15 days after the offender has been served with a
citation for a violation of the ordinance.
   (C)   Upon determination of a violation of any section of this code, the
penalty for which is a civil penalty, the appropriate official of the city
shall report such violation to the City Manager and request approval to proceed
with the civil citation procedure. Approval of the request to proceed by the
City Manager shall empower the appropriate city official to proceed to issue a
warning citation and, if necessary, a penalty citation. The warning citation
and the citation shall set out the nature of the violation, the section
violated, the date of the violation, and shall contain an order to immediately
cease the violation. If the violation is one for which an order of abatement
would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be
stated in which the violation must be abated. The warning citation shall be
served by delivering a copy to the violator or by mailing a copy to the
violator by first class mail by depositing it enclosed in a postpaid, properly
addressed wrapper in a post office or official depository under the exclusive
care and custody of the United States Postal Service.
   (D)   Where the official determines that the period of time stated in the
original warning citation is not sufficient for abatement based upon the work
required or based upon a schedule agreed upon with the violator for abatement,
the official may amend the warning citation to provide for additional time. The
warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil
penalty, together with costs, and attorney fees.
   (E)   Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation, a civil
citation shall be issued by the official and either served personally on the
violator, or the violator’s duly designated agent, or registered agent if a
corporation, or by depositing a copy in the post office for mailing by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the
violator at the violator’s dwelling house or usual place of abode. The citation
shall direct the violator to pay the citation to the Finance Department within
15 days of the date of service of the citation. The violation for which the
citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid,
otherwise further citations shall be issued.
   (F)   Appeals from a citation for a violation of the zoning ordinance shall
be made to the Board of Adjustment and the violator must file written notice of
such appeal with the Board of Adjustment within ten days from the date of the
service of the citation. Except in any case where the ordinance which is
violated specifically grants to the Board of Adjustment other powers in
considering appeals and such appeal is applied for, the Board of Adjustment in
considering appeals of a citation shall have power only in the manner of
administrative review and interpretation where it is alleged that the official
has made an error in the application of this code, in the factual situation as
it relates to the application of the code, or both.
   (G)   Except for appeals from citations for violations of the zoning
ordinance, appeals shall be made to the City Manager and the violator must file
written notice of such appeal with the City Manager within ten days from the
date of the service of the citation.
   (H)   Unless the terms of an ordinance exempt it from the operation of this
section, each day upon which a violation of the ordinance shall continue or
occur shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.

to the State Bureau of Investigation Criminal Information and Identification
Section for verification that the CHRI record belongs to the individual.

individual, the applicable clerk of court shall be contacted to obtain the
record. The City of Eden shall pay the cost of obtaining a criminal history
record check; and other than for employment or volunteer purposes, the subject
individual shall reimburse the City for said cost.

justifiable excuse molest, torture, torment, deprive of necessary sustenance,
cruelly beat, mutilate or kill, wound, injure, poison, abandon or subject to
conditions detrimental to its health or general welfare any animal or to cause
or procure such action. The words “torture,” “torment” or “cruelly” shall be
held to include every act, omission or neglect whereby unjustifiable physical
pain, suffering or death is caused or permitted, but such shall not be
construed to prohibit an animal control officer or veterinarian from destroying
dangerous, unwanted or injured animals in a humane manner or from destroying
impounded animals as provided in §§
3-67 et seq.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep animals under unsanitary

sick, diseased or injured animals, as well as adequate inoculation against

   (C) Tethering: It shall be unlawful for any person to tether a dog in a
manner as to cause injury, strangulation or entanglement of the animal on
fences, trees, or other manmade or natural obstacles; or to a fixed-point; or
that is under four (4) months of age; or that is sick or injured. It shall be
unlawful to fail to provide any dog with adequate space. “Adequate space” means
sufficient space to allow each dog to easily stand, sit, lie, turnabout, and
make all other normal body movements in a comfortable, normal position for the
dog and interact safely with other animals in the enclosure.
      When a dog is tethered, “adequate space” means a tether that permits the
above actions and is appropriate to the age and size of the dog. The tether
must be attached to the dog by a properly applied collar, halter, or harness
configured so as to protect the dog from injury and prevent the dog or the
tether from becoming entangled with other objects or animals, or from extending
over an object or edge that could result in the strangulation or injury of the
dog.
   Fixed. Tethered dogs must be attached to a swiveled ground anchor by a
coated cable wire at least fifteen (15) feet in length and of sufficient
strength to restrain the dog without breaking Chains, ropes, twine, cords and
non-cable wire are not acceptable types of tethers. All tethers must have
swivels attached at both ends to prevent twisting. The area shall be free of
garbage and other debris that can harm the dog. There shall be no fences or
objects within the radius of the tether that the dog can get hung upon. The
tether must be arranged so as to be free from obstacles that may limit the
movable length of the tether. Tethers must be attached to a safe and secure
harness or collar. Under no circumstances shall the tether be placed directly
around the dog’s neck. Tethers are never to be used in conjunction with
training collars such as choke or pinch prong style collars. Shelter and water
must be present and always within reach of a tethered dog. If a tethered dog
cannot reach its shelter or water due to a tangled or shortened tether or if
the tether does not meet the requirements of this section, the owner or keeper
of the dog is considered to be in violation.
   Running cable line or “trolley system.” A running cable line (minimum of
fifteen (15) feet in length) must be firmly secured to fixed anchor points
(i.e. posts, trees or fences) and attached at least four (4) feet but not more
than seven (7) feet above ground. The tether shall be attached to the running
cable line and must have a swivel at both ends to prevent entanglement and must
have a stopper device attached near each end of the running cable line to
prevent the cable wire tether from entangling around the anchor points. The
running cable line must be of sufficient strength to support the tether cable
wire and restrain the dog without breaking. Tethers must be attached to a safe
and secure harness or collar. Under no circumstances shall the tether be placed
directly around the dog’s neck. Tethers are never to be used in conjunction
with training collars such as choke or pinch style collars. Only one (1) animal
may be tethered to a single running cable line or trolley system. Shelter and
water must be present and always within reach of the tethered dog. If the
tethered dog cannot reach the shelter or water due to a tangled or shortened
tether, or if the running cable line or trolley system does not meet the
requirements of this section, the owner or keeper of the dog is considered to
be in violation.
   (D)   Adequate Shelter: No person owning or responsible for any animal shall
fail to provide the animal with proper shelter, protection from the weather or
humanely clean conditions as prescribed in this section.
   Adequate shelter means provision of and access to shelter that is suitable
for the species, age, condition, size, and type of each animal; provides
adequate space for each animal; is safe and protects each animal from injury,
rain, sleet, snow, hail, direct sunlight, the adverse effects of heat or cold,
physical suffering, and impairment of health; is properly cleaned; enables each
animal to be clean and dry, except when detrimental to the species; and, for
dogs and cats provides a solid surface, level resting platform, pad, floor mat,
or similar device that is large enough for the dog or cat to lie on in a normal
manner and can be maintained in a sanitary manner. Adequate shelters for a dog
or cat should consist of (3) walls, a top and a floor. Under this chapter,
shelters whose wire, grid, or slat floor (i) permit the animal’s feet to pass
through the openings, (ii) sag under the animal’s weight, or (iii) otherwise do
not protect the animal’s feet or toes from injury are not adequate shelter.
Crawl spaces under building/decks, under or in a vehicle, made from materials
easily degraded by the elements, carriers or crates designed for temporary
housing are not defined as adequate shelter. When sunlight is likely to cause
heat exhaustion of an animal tied or confined outside, sufficient shade by
natural or artificial means shall be provided to protect the animal from direct
sunlight.
   (E)   Adequate Food & Water.
   Adequate food: The provision at suitable intervals, of a quantity of
wholesome foodstuff suitable for the species and age, sufficient to maintain a
reasonable level of nutrition in each animal. Such foodstuff shall be served in
a receptacle, dish, or container that is physically clean.
   Adequate water - Means provision of and access to clean, fresh, potable
water of a drinkable temperature which is provided in a suitable manner, in
sufficient volume, and a suitable intervals, to maintain normal hydration for
the age, species, condition, size and type of each animal; and is provided in
clean, durable receptacles which are accessible to each animal and are placed
so as to minimize contamination of the water by excrement and pests or an
alternative source of hydration consistent with generally accepted husbandry
practices.
   (F)   Properly fitted collars required. An owner of a dog or cat shall not
permit injury or inflict pain upon such animal from an improperly fitting or
embedded collar.
   (G)   Any act in which an animal found to have been treated in a manner
inconsistent with this Article is made unlawful by this section and may be
taken up and impounded by the Animal Control Officer. Redemption of such animal
may be made by the owner thereof upon compliance with the requirements of § 3-
68; provided, however, that the Animal Control Officer may impose such other
requirements for redemption as are appropriate to ensure treatment of such
animal dog that complies with this section.

§ 7-218 PAWNBROKER TRANSACTIONS.
   In every pawn transaction:
   (A)   The original pawn contract shall have a maturity date of not less than
30 days, provided that nothing herein shall prevent the pledgor from redeeming
the property before the maturity date;
   (B)   Any personal property pledged to a pawnbroker in this state is subject
to sale or disposal when there has been no payment made on the account for a
period of 60 days past maturity date of the original contract; provided that
the contract between the pledgor and the pawnbroker is renewable if renewal is
agreed upon by both the parties;
   (C)   Every pawn ticket or receipt for such pawn shall have printed thereon
the provisions of division (A) of this section which shall constitute notice of
such sale or disposal; notice of intention to sell or dispose of the property
without further notice; and consent to such sale or disposal. The pledgor
thereby forfeits all right, title and interest of, in, and to such pawned
property to the pawnbroker who thereby acquires absolute title to the same,
whereupon the debt is satisfied and the pawnbroker may sell or dispose of the
unredeemed pledges as his own property. Any sale or disposal of property under
this section terminates all liability of the pawnbroker and vests in the
purchaser the right, title, and interest of the borrower and the pawnbroker;
   (D)   If the borrower loses his pawn ticket he shall not thereby forfeit his
right to redeem, but may, before the lapse of the redemption period, make an
affidavit with indemnification for such loss. The affidavit shall describe the
property pawned and shall take the place of the lost pawn ticket unless the
pawned property has already been redeemed with the original pawn ticket; and
   (E)   A pledgor is not obligated to redeem pledged goods or make any payment
on a pawn transaction.

connection with a pawn transaction;
   (C) Accept any waiver, in writing or otherwise, of any right or protection
accorded a pledgor under this article;
   (D) Fail to exercise reasonable care to protect pledged goods from loss or
damage;
   (E)   Fail to return pledged goods to a pledgor upon payment of the full
amount due the pawnbroker on the pawn transaction. In the event such pledged
goods are lost or damaged while in the possession of the pawnbroker, it shall
be the responsibility of the pawnbroker to replace the lost or damaged goods
with merchandise of like kind and equivalent value. In the event the pledgor
and pawnbroker cannot agree as to replacement, the pawnbroker shall reimburse
the pledgor in the amount of the value agreed upon pursuant to §
7-216(B);
   (F)   Take any article in pawn, pledge, or as security from any person,
which is known to such pawnbroker to be stolen, unless there is a written
agreement with local or state police;
   (G)   Sell, exchange, barter, or remove from the pawnshop any goods pledged,
pawned, or purchased earlier than 48 hours after the transaction, except in
case of redemption by pledgor or items purchased for resale from wholesalers;
   (H)   Operate more than one pawnshop under one license, and such shop must
be at a permanent place of business; or
   (I)   Take as pledged goods any manufactured mobile home, recreational
vehicle, or motor vehicle other than a motorcycle.

conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. If the violation

violation is knowingly committed by the owner, major stockholder, or managing
partner of the pawnshop, then the license of the pawnshop may be suspended at
the discretion of the court.
   (B)   The provision of division (A) of this section shall not apply to
violations of §
7-219(F) which shall be prosecuted under the state criminal statutes.

provision of this article, except as a result of accidental or bona fide error
of computation, shall be void, and the licensee shall have no right to collect,

a red light. When the stoplight is emitting a steady green light, vehicles may
proceed subject to the rights of pedestrians and other vehicles as may

§ 10-3.2 ADMINISTRATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The City Manager or designee shall be responsible for the
administration and maintenance of the pay plan. All employees covered by the
pay plan shall be paid at a rate listed within the salary range established for
the respective position classification, except for employees in trainee status
or employees whose existing salaries are above the established maximum rate
following transition to a new pay plan.
   (B)   The pay plan is intended to provide equitable compensation for all
positions, reflecting differences in the duties and responsibilities, the
comparable rates of pay for positions in private and public employment in the
area, changes in the cost of living, the financial conditions of the city, and
other factors. To this end, from time to time the City Manager or designee
shall make comparative studies of all factors affecting the level of salary
ranges. When major adjustments encompassing numerous positions are needed, or
when a general adjustment is needed to the pay plan, the City Manager shall
recommend such changes in salary ranges as appear to be warranted to the City
Council. The City Council shall adopt the “Assignment of Classes to Grades and
Ranges,” including any minor adjustments made by the City Manager during the
previous budget year, annually as part of the budget process.
   (C)   The City Manager shall have the right to make minor individual salary
adjustments to various job classifications and individuals based upon job
performance or comparable data for similar positions in similarly sized
communities subject to the appropriation and availability of funds for this
purpose in the annual operating budget. A minor adjustment in salary shall not
exceed more than 8% in a given fiscal year; and any adjustment in salary in
excess of 8% shall be approved by the City Council.

   (A)   Applicants being considered for employment or city employees who do
not meet all of the requirements for the position for which they are being
considered may be hired, promoted, demoted, or transferred by the City Manager
to a “trainee” status. In such cases, a plan for training, including a time
schedule, must be prepared by the department head. Trainee salaries may be no
more than two grades below the minimum salary established for the position for
which the person is being trained. A new employee designated as “trainee” shall
be regarded as a probationary employee.
   (B)   If the training is not successfully completed as planned, the trainee
shall be transferred, demoted, or dismissed. If the training is successfully
completed, the employee shall be paid at least at the minimum rate established
for the position for which the employee was trained.

date. In addition, supervisors or department heads are responsible for informal
evaluation conferences during the course of the year to discuss performance
goals and other issues or concerns addressed in the performance evaluation
conference. All performance evaluations shall be documented in writing and
signed by both supervisor and employee. Employees may be considered for
advancement within the established salary range based on the quality of their
overall work performance. Procedures for determining performance levels and
performance pay increases shall be published in policies developed by the City
Manager, with the approval of the City Council.

for the department head to request an extension for the performance evaluation
review so as to allow adequate time for evaluation of performance.
(Ord. passed 10- -98)
§ 10-3.8 SALARY EFFECT OF PROMOTIONS, DEMOTIONS, TRANSFERS, RECLASSIFICATIONS,
REASSIGNMENTS, SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Promotions.
      (1)   When an employee is promoted, the employee’s salary shall normally
be advanced to the minimum level of the new position, or to a salary which
provides an increase of at least 5% over the employee’s salary before the
promotion, provided, however, that the new salary may not exceed the maximum
rate of the new salary range. The purpose of the promotion pay increase is to
recognize and compensate the employee for taking on increased responsibility.
      (2)   When a city employee bids and receives a position that was
advertised inside or outside the city for a certain starting salary, they
cannot receive any starting pay other than what would be equal to what all
applicants would receive with equal qualifications. In no event shall they make
more than the maximum of that position until the City Council approves the
change.
   (B)   Demotions. When an employee is demoted the salary shall be decreased
by at least 5%.
   (C)   Transfers. The salary of an employee transferred to a position in the
same class or to a position in a different class within the same salary range
shall not be changed by the transfer.
   (D)   Reclassifications. An employee whose position is reclassified to a
class having a higher pay range shall receive a pay increase of 5% or an
increase to the minimum of the new pay range, whichever is higher. If the
position is reclassified to a lower pay range, the employee’s salary shall
remain the same. If the employee’s salary is above the maximum established for
the new range, the salary of that employee shall be maintained at the current
level until the range is increased above the employee’s salary.
   (E)   Reassignment. An employee who is reassigned to a position in a higher
pay range shall receive a pay increase of 5% or an increase to the minimum of
the new pay range, whichever is higher. If the employee is reassigned to a
position in a lower pay range, the employee’s salary may be retained at the
discretion of the City Manager if the current salary is within the new pay
range. In the event the employee’s salary is above the maximum of the new pay
range, the employee’s salary will be decreased to the maximum of the new pay
range.
   (F)   Special assignment. When an employee’s pay is increased to compensate
the employee for additional duties and responsibilities, the employee’s pay
will be accordingly decreased when such employee is relieved of those
additional duties and responsibilities.
   (G)   Certifications. If an employee receives certification from a state or
nationally recognized agency, the employee will receive a 5% increase in
salary. The certification must be approved in writing by the City Manager prior
to the employee seeking certification. A certification shall be deemed
acceptable when the employee provides a copy of the certification to their
respective department head and to the Human Resources Department. Increases in
salaries are subject to §
10-3.10 of this article.

§ 10-3.9 SALARY EFFECT OF SALARY RANGE REVISIONS.
   When a class of positions is assigned to a higher salary range, employees in
that class shall receive a pay increase of at least 5% or to the minimum step
of the new range, whichever is higher. When a class of positions is assigned to
a lower salary range, the salaries of employees in that class will remain
unchanged. If this assignment to a lower salary range results in an employee
being paid at a rate above the maximum step established for the new class, the
salary of that employee shall be maintained at that level until such time as
the employee’s salary range is increased above the employee’s current salary.

§ 10-3.10 EFFECTIVE DATE OF SALARY CHANGES.

become effective at the beginning of the next pay period, or at such specific
date as may be provided by procedures approved by the City Manager.
(Ord. passed 5-17-94)
§ 10-3.11 OVERTIME PAY PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Employees of the city can be requested and may be required to work
overtime hours as necessitated by the needs of the city and determined by the
department head, with the prior approval of the City Manager. The standard
workweek (168 consecutive hours) for the city is Wednesday, 12:01 a.m. to
Tuesday 12:00 midnight. With approval of the City Manager, the standard
workweek may be changed at the request of the department head(s).
   (B)   To the extent that local governmental jurisdictions are so required,
the city will comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The City
Manager, assisted by the personnel specialist, shall determine which jobs are
“non exempt” and are therefore subject to the Act in areas such as hours of
work and work periods, rates of overtime compensation, and other provisions.
Non-exempt employees will be paid at a straight time rate for hours up to the
FLSA established limit for their position (usually 40 hours in a 7-day period;
hours for public safety personnel may be different). Hours worked by non-exempt
employees beyond the FLSA established limit will be compensated in either time
or pay at the appropriate overtime rate. Compensatory time may be granted if
requested by the employee and approved by the Department Head. In no event
shall the amount of compensatory time exceed the maximum accumulation of
compensatory time for each department, except that in emergency and/or special
situations the City Manager may approve additional compensatory time over and
above the maximum allowed. Non-exempt employees who have accumulated the
maximum amount of compensatory time will be paid for all hours worked. Maximum
accumulation of compensatory time shall be set as follows:
 
Personnel              Maximum Accumulation of Compensatory Time
Exempt personnel       60 hours
Non-exempt personnel   80 hours
Public safety - fire   240 hours
Public safety - police 240 hours
 
   (C)   In determining eligibility for overtime in a work period, only hours
actually worked shall be considered; in no event will vacation, sick leave,
compensatory time taken, or holidays be included in the computation of hours
worked for FLSA purposes. Whenever practicable, departments will schedule time
off on an hour for hour basis within the applicable work period for non-exempt
employees, instead of paying overtime. When time off within the work period
cannot be granted, overtime worked will be paid in accordance with the FLSA.
   (D)   In emergency situations, where employees are required to work long and
continuous hours, the City Manager may approve compensation at time and one
half for those hours worked and/or grant time off with pay for rest and
recuperation to ensure safe working conditions.
   (E)   Employees in positions determined to be “exempt” from the FLSA (as
executive, administrative, or professional staff) will not receive pay for
hours worked in excess of their normal work periods. These employees will be
granted compensatory leave by their department heads where the convenience of
the department allows and in accordance with procedures established by the City
Manager. Such compensatory time is not guaranteed to be taken and ends without
compensation upon separation from the organization.

§ 10-3.12 CALL-BACK AND STANDBY PAY.
   The city provides a continuous 24-hour a day, seven-day a week-service to
its customers. Therefore, it is necessary for certain employees to respond to
any reasonable request for duty at any hour of the day or night. One of the
conditions of employment with the city is the acceptance of a share of the
responsibility for continuous service, in accordance with the nature of each
job position. If an employee fails to respond to reasonable calls for emergency
service, either special or routine, the employee shall be subject to
disciplinary actions up to and including dismissal.
   (A)   Call back. Non-exempt full-time employees will be guaranteed a minimum
payment of two hour’s wages for being called back to work outside of normal
working hours. “Call back” provisions do not apply to previously scheduled
overtime work or employees who are called to work while serving in a “on call”
capacity. Hours worked when responding to emergency call-back will be
compensated at time and one-half.
   (B)   On call. Non-exempt full-time employees required to be on “on call”
duty will be paid for eight hours of work for each week (approximately 128
hours, excluding work time) of on call time they serve. On call compensation
for less than one full week shall be determined by the ratio of .062 hours of
pay per one hour of on call time. Hours actually worked while on call are
calculated beginning when the employee reports to the work site and are added
to the regular total of hours worked for the week. On call time is defined as
that time when an employee is required and must remain near an established
telephone or within the restricted beeper range.

prevent them from performing the essential functions of the job.
(Ord. passed 5-17-94; Am. Ord. passed 11-17-98)
§ 10-4.2 IMPLEMENTATION OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY POLICY.
   All personnel responsible for recruitment and employment will continue to
review regularly the implementation of this personnel policy and relevant
practices to assure that equal employment opportunity based on reasonable, job
related job requirements is being actively observed to the end that no employee
or applicant for employment shall suffer discrimination because of age, sex,
race, color, religion, non-job-related handicap, national origin, political
affiliation, or marital status. Notices with regard to equal employment matters
shall be posted in conspicuous places on city premises in places where notices
are customarily posted.
(Ord. passed 5-17-94)
§ 10-4.3 RECRUITMENT, SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT.

division heads shall notify the City Manager or their designee concerning the
number and classification of the position(s) which are to be filled. The
Manager’s Office or his or her designee shall publicize these opportunities for
employment either internally, externally or both, including applicable salary
information and employment qualifications. Information on job openings and
hiring practices for positions open to external candidates shall be provided to
recruitment sources, including organizations and news media available to
minority applicants. In addition, notice of vacancies shall be posted at
designated conspicuous sites within departments. Individuals shall be recruited
from a geographic area as wide as necessary to ensure that well qualified
applicants are obtained for city service. The North Carolina Employment
Security Commission should normally be used as a potential recruitment source
for external job postings.
   (B)   Job advertisements. Employment advertisements (internal job postings
and external job postings) shall contain assurances of equal employment
opportunity and shall comply with federal and state statutes.
   (C)   Application for employment. All persons expressing interest in
employment with the city shall be given the opportunity to file an application
approved by the City Manager for employment for positions which are vacant. As
part of the application process, each person shall provide a criminal history
check under Article IX of Chapter 2. Existing employees who are internal
candidates applying for a different position will not be required to submit an
additional application for employment.
   (D)   Application reserve file. Applications shall be kept in an inactive
reserve file for a period of six months, in accordance with Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission guidelines.
   (E)   Selection. Department/Division heads, in coordination with the Human
Resource Department and the City Manager shall make such investigations and
conduct such examinations as necessary to assess accurately the knowledge,
skills, and experience qualifications required for the position. All selection
devices administered by the city shall be valid measures of job performance.
   (F)   Appointment. Before any commitment is made to an applicant either
internal or external, the department/division head shall make recommendations
to the Director of Finance and Personnel who will verify the accuracy of the

Ordinance. The Director of Finance and Personnel will forward the
recommendation to the City Manager who shall review and approve the
recommendation of the position to be filled, the salary to be paid, and the
reasons for selecting the candidate over other candidates. The City Manager
shall approve appointments and the starting salary for all applicants.

conduct a performance evaluation conference with the employee and discuss
accomplishments, strengths, and needed improvements. A summary of this

without pay. On rare occasions due to training being scheduled on a federal
fiscal year basis, an employee may be required to attend two periods of
training in one calendar year. For this purpose only, an employee shall be
granted an additional ten days of military leave during the same calendar year
without pay. Provided that, if the compensation received while on military
leave is less than the salary that would have been earned during this same
period as a city employee, the employee shall receive partial compensation
equal to the difference the base salary earned during this same period as a
city employee. The effect will be to maintain the employee’s salary at the
normal level during this period. If such duty is required beyond this ten
workdays, the employee shall be eligible to take accumulated leave or be placed
in a leave without pay status, and the provisions of that leave shall apply.
While taking military leave without pay or with partial pay, the employee’s
leave credits and other benefits shall continue to accrue as if the employee
physically remained with the city during this period. Employees who are

military service;
   (B)   Is able to perform the duties of the former position or similar
position; or
   (C)   Is unable to perform the duties of the former position or a similar
position due to disability sustained as a result of military service, but is

this case the employee shall be employed in such other position as will provide

otherwise would have been provided, if available.

§ 10-7.21 CIVIL LEAVE.
   (A)   A city employee called for jury duty or as a court witness for the
federal or state governments, or a subdivision thereof, shall receive leave
with pay for such duty during the required absence without charge to
accumulated leave. The employee may keep fees and travel allowances received
for jury or witness duty in addition to regular compensation; except, that
employees must turn over to the city any witness fees or travel allowance
awarded by that court for court appearances in connection with official duties.
While on civil leave, benefits and leave shall accrue as though on regular
duty.
   (B)   Should a person be scheduled for civil leave on a day when he or she
is on a second or third shift or a night shift schedule, he or she does not
have to report to work for the shift, when the majority of scheduled work hours
occur on the same day as jury duty.

(Ord. passed 5-17-94; Am. Ord. passed 8-29-09)
§ 10-7.23 FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY (FMLA).
   (A)   Employees who have worked for the city for at least 12 months and at
least 1,250 hours during the prior 12-month period may take up to 12 weeks of
unpaid leave (FMLA leave) for the following reasons:
      (1)   Both birth or care of a child of the employee;
      (2)   Placement of a child into the employee’s family by adoption or by a
foster care arrangement;
      (3)   Care of the employee’s spouse, child or parent who has a serious
health condition; or
      (4)   Inability of the employee to perform the functions of the
employee’s position due to a serious health condition.
   (B)   Any employee using sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time for
any FMLA purpose will have that paid leave counted toward their 12 weeks of
FMLA leave.
   (C)   Any FMLA leave taken by an employee during the preceding 12-month
period will be used to determine the amount of available leave pursuant to the
Family and Medical Leave Act.
   (D)   The right to family leave for the birth or placement of a child in an
employee’s family may only be taken within the 12 months after the date of the
birth or placement of the child. In the case of unpaid leave for the birth or
placement of a child, intermittent leave or working a reduced number of hours
is not permitted, unless both the employee and the City Manager agree in
writing. If both spouses are employed by the city, the combined leave shall not
exceed 12 weeks.
   (E)   For purposes of this policy, a serious health condition means an
illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves:
      (1)   Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or
consequent to in-patient care in hospital, hospice or residential medical care
facility;
      (2)   Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work or other
regular daily activities for more than three calendar days that also involves
continuous treatment by or under the supervision of a health care provider;
      (3)   Continuous treatment by or under the supervision of a healthcare
provider for a chronic long-term health condition that is incurable or so
serious that if not treated would result in a period of incapacity of more than
three calendar days; or
      (4)   Prenatal care.
   (F)   In the case of unpaid leave for serious health conditions, the leave
may be taken intermittently or on a reduced hours basis only if such leave is
medically necessary. Where an employee requests intermittent leave or leave on
a reduced hours basis due to a family member’s or the employee’s own serious
health condition, the City Manager has the option, in their sole discretion, to
require the employee to transfer to a temporary alternative job for which the
employee is qualified and which better accommodates the intermittent leave or
reduced hours leave than the employee’s regular job. The temporary position
will have equivalent pay and benefits as the employee’s regular job.
   (G)   In order to be paid employees are required to use their available
sick, vacation or compensatory time during the 12-week family leave period.
That portion of the family leave of absence which is vacation time,
compensatory time or sick time will be in accordance with city pay policies.
The employee will be notified in writing that their vacation, sick and/or
compensatory time will be counted towards the 12 weeks of family leave. If
written notice is not given to the employee by the date of expiration of the
leave, the leave will not be counted towards the employee’s available 12 weeks
of family leave.
   (H)   When the necessity of leave is foreseeable due to the expected birth
or placement of a child, the employee must provide the city with at least 30
days notice of the employee’s intention to take leave. If the date of birth or
placement of a child requires the employee’s leave to begin in less than 30
days, the employee must provide notice as soon as practical. Where the
necessity of leave is due to a family member’s or employee’s own serious health
condition and is foreseeable based on a planned medical treatment, the employee
must:
      (1)   Give at least 30 days notice, or soon as practicable, if treatment
starts in less than 30 days; and
      (2)   Make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to
unduly disrupt the operation of the city, subject to the approval of the health
care provider.
   (I)   Where the need of leave is unforeseeable, the employee must give
notice as soon as practical.
Any leave request based on a family members or employee’s own serious health
condition must be supported by certification from a healthcare provider. The
employee must provide a copy of the certification to the city in a timely
manner. Certification from the healthcare provider must contain the following:
      (1)   The date the serious health condition began;
      (2)   The possible duration of the condition; and
      (3)   The appropriate medical facts regarding the condition.
   (J) If the leave is based on the care of a spouse, child or parent, a
statement that the employee is needed to provide the care and an estimate of
the amount of time that need will continue;
   (K)   If the leave is based on the employee’s own serious health condition,
a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of his/her
job.
   (L)   In the case of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced hours basis
for planned medical treatment, the date the treatment is expected to be given
and the duration of the treatment.
   (M)   During family leave of absence, the city will continue to pay the
health insurance premiums for the employee; the employee must continue to pay
his or her share of the dependent premium. Failure of the employee to pay his
or her share of the health insurance premium may result in loss of dependent
coverage. If the employee does not return to work after the expiration of the
leave, the employee will be required to reimburse the city for payment of
health insurance premiums during family leave, unless the employee does not
return because of the presence of a serious health condition which prevents the
employee from performing his or her job or circumstances beyond the employee’s
control.
   (N)   During unpaid leave, no benefits will be accrued.
   (O)   The city may require an employee on FMLA to report periodically on
his/her status and the intention of the employee to return to work. Also,
periodic recertification of the medical condition may be required. An employee
taking family leave due to the employee’s serious health condition will be
required to provide certification that the employee is able to resume work
prior to returning to work.
   (P)   Employees who return to work from family leave of absence within or on
the business day following the expiration of the 12 weeks are entitled to
return to their job or an equivalent position without loss of pay or benefits.
   (Q)   In the event the employee cannot return to work at the end of the 12
weeks and the employee has exhausted all paid leave, the employee may, at that
time, request a leave without pay. The request will be reviewed by the City
Manager and the employee will be notified as soon as practical if the request
is approved or denied.
   (R)   Applications for family leave of absence must be submitted in writing
and signed by the employee’s immediate supervisor or department head.
Applications should be submitted at least 30 days before the leave is to
commence or as soon as possible if 30 days notice is not possible. Appropriate
forms must be submitted to the Human Resource Department to initiate family
leave or return to work.

§ 10-7.24 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.
   (A)   In the event of a death in an employee’s immediate family, the City
Manager or designee shall provide up to three days bereavement leave. In order
to receive bereavement pay, the employee must attend the funeral of the
relative.
   (B)   IMMEDIATE FAMILY shall be defined as spouse, mother, father, guardian,
children, sister, brother, grandparents, grandchildren, aunt, uncle, nephew,
niece, plus the various combinations of half, step, in-law, and adopted
relationships that can be derived from those named.

prerequisite of continuing membership on the Committee.

laws, ordinances and rules of procedure relating to the Committee as time and
circumstances permit.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of every committee member to avoid even the
appearance of a conflict of interest. Therefore, no member shall vote on,
discuss, debate, advocate, influence, or otherwise participate before the
committee in any matter that would substantially affect, directly or
indirectly, his or her personal interests or the financial interests of a
member of his or her household. This prohibition includes formal or informal
consideration of the matter by the committee, whether conducted in public or
private. This provision does not prohibit participation in advisory decisions
in which the personal interest is so insignificant or remote that it is
unlikely to affect the member’s official action in any way. In applying this
rule the following procedure shall govern:
      (1)   A member who has a conflict of interest shall disqualify himself or
herself and withdraw from participation in the matter. The member shall not sit
with the Committee during the consideration and discussion of that matter;
      (2)   Withdrawal from participation in any matter is necessary only in
those specific cases in which a conflict arises. There shall be no attempt to
exclude entire categories of consideration because of the department/division
with which a member is associated;
      (3)   Any committee member may seek an opinion from the Staff/City
Attorney as to the applicability of this section to a particular decision or
set of facts. The response to such a request shall be made to the member making
the request, and a copy shall be provided to the chairman of the committee and
the City Manager; and
      (4)   If an opinion is received from the Staff/City Attorney that a
member has an impermissible conflict of interest pursuant to a particular
decision or set of facts and the member does not disqualify himself or herself,
the Committee may by majority vote (not considering the vote of the member with
the alleged conflict) disqualify that member from all participation in the
matter involved.
   (D)   Members of the Committee shall not commit themselves on any question
scheduled to be considered by the committee prior to the consideration of the
matter at a duly authorized meeting. Members shall use discretion in discussing
with individuals scheduled agenda items which are later to be voted on by the
Committee.

retraining of existing employees;
      (3)   Inspection and Compliance Subcommittee to make monthly self

   (A)   Containers for single family residents, or commercial uses that are
not required to have a commercial container as required by this article, shall
be as provided by the city. All containers shall be kept in a clean and
sanitary condition by users.
      (1)   Any resident, who believes the automated container assigned to
their residence has been stolen, should first check the area to be sure the
container is not in the general area. The property owner then should contact
the Public Works Department to report the missing container, and to verify the
container identification number if they do not remember it. After this has been
done, the Public Works Department will file a report with the Police Department
that the property has been stolen. The container will be replaced by the city.
Multiple incidents will be investigated further.
      (2)   Containers damaged through misuse by user will be replaced by the
resident/property owner. Examples of misuse include, but are not limited to,
placing hot ashes, toxic or other hazardous waste, demolition or construction
materials, or any types of waste that are restricted for disposal as household
garbage.
      (3)   Containers damaged by vehicle traffic should be reported to the
Police Department immediately, and measures are to be taken by the Police
Department to locate the vehicle and driver. The container will be replaced by
the city.
      (4)   Owners of apartment buildings and commercial establishments are
required to provide containers on their premises and at their expense.
Containers shall be of four-, six-, or eight-cubic yard size, as required by
the Solid Waste Superintendent. Containers shall be serviced privately or
through a city contractor.
   (B)   Commercial waste containers or other large containers for solid waste
storage or disposal are permitted in all commercial and industrial districts,
and in multi-family residential developments; provided all requirements of this
subsection are met, and all necessary permits are obtained. The provisions of
this subsection shall apply to all non-residential development, multi-family
residential developments and/or single family attached residential developments
that do not use roll out containers for curbside solid waste pickup. No
containers shall be permitted in any residential district, except for multi-
family developments or for temporary use.
      (1)   Location. Whenever possible, containers shall be located behind the
front building line of the principal structure. No container shall be placed in
any area where it will block, or partially block, any street, sidewalk, public
parking area or public right-of-way. Dumpsters shall be situated so that they
are closer to the principal structure on the subject property than to any
adjourning property line or public right-of-way.
      (2)   Traffic and visibility. No container shall be placed in any
location that would interfere with visibility or impede normal traffic flow on
any street or public right-of-way, any driveway, or any parking lot.
      (3)   Utility access. No container shall be situated in any location that
would impede or prevent access to water meters, manholes or any other public
utility.
      (4)   Screening. It is recommended that all containers be enclosed on at
least three sides, and screened from public view by means of a solid fence or
wall or a vegetative screen, as per the zoning ordinance.
      (5)   Lids. All containers shall have a lid that remains closed at all
times, except when loading or emptying the container, in order to minimize
potential contamination of storm water runoff, and to prevent items from being
blown from the container.
      (6)   Pads. It is recommended that all containers shall be situated on a
pad constructed of reinforced concrete or equivalent paving material. Drains
must be plugged on all containers at all times.
      (7)   Storm water runoff. All containers shall be located a minimum of
ten feet from any curb inlet, storm drain, creek or ditch, in order to minimize
potential contamination of storm water runoff.
      (8)   Common locations. Wherever possible, effort should be made to
locate multiple containers together in a common location. This would be most
likely in concentrated business areas, such as Business Central districts and
shopping centers.
      (9)   Temporary use. Any container being used for a temporary purpose,
such as construction or demolition, is exempt from the provisions of this
section, except that no container shall be placed in any area where it will
block, or partially block, any street, sidewalk, public parking area or public
right- of-way.
      (10)   Advertising. No signs or advertisements shall be placed on either
the container or the screen.
      (11)   Removal of abandoned containers. Any container not associated with
an operating business or commercial property must be removed from the property
within 90 days of the closing of the business or the cessation of the use. The
owner of the solid waste container shall remove the container.

proceedings taken in closing any street or alley may be asserted, nor shall the
validity of the order be open to question in any court upon any ground
whatever, except in an action or proceeding begun within 30 days after the
order is adopted. The failure to send notice by registered or certified mail
shall not invalidate any ordinance adopted prior to January 1, 1989.

such franchise as are in the public interest. The consent of the city to such
transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.

§ 14-53 EXTENSION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The grantee shall provide service to any new residential dwelling
units or commercial subscribers within the initial service area and any
additional areas annexed to the city where there are at least 30 subscribers
per proposed cable plant mile for residentially zoned areas, and at least 50
subscribers per proposed cable plant mile for commercially zoned areas, except
where served by another cable company.
   (B)   In other areas with less than 30 residential dwelling units or 50
commercial subscribers per proposed cable plant mile, the grantee shall offer a
cost-sharing arrangement with residents. The cost sharing arrangement shall
consist of the following:
      (1)   On the request of five or more potential subscribers desiring
service, the grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost
analysis to determine the cost of plant extension required to provide service
to each subscriber from the closest point where available quality signals
exist.
      (2)   The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following
formula: If a request for extension of service into a residential area requires
the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least 35 potential
subscribers per strand or trench mile, the grantee and subscribers will each
bear their proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if there are
25 subscribers per strand mile or trench mile, the grantee’s share will equal
25/50th or one half of construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared
equally by each subscriber. After completion of the project, should additional
subscribers request cable television service, the pro rata shares shall be
recalculated. Each new subscriber shall pay the new pro rata share, and all
prior subscribers shall receive pro rata refunds. At such time as there are 35
potential subscribers per mile, the subscribers shall receive their pro rata
share of construction costs. In any event, at the end of two years from the
completion of a project, the subscribers are no longer eligible for refunds,
and the amounts paid in construction costs will be credited to the plant
account of the grantee.
      (3)   The average cost of line extension shall be recalculated annually
and based upon then current costs for labor and materials.
      (4)   Subscribers utilizing the cost sharing plan for extensions shall be
reimbursed pro rata for their contribution or a proportional share thereof, if
additional subscribers are connected to the respective network extension.
   (C)   In cases of new construction or property development where utilities
are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall give the
grantee reasonable notice of such construction or development and of the
particular date on which open trenching will be available for the grantee’s
installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided
at the grantee’s expense. The grantee shall also provide specifications as
needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring
service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner.
Except for the notice of the particular date on which trenching will be
available to the grantee, any notice provided to the grantee by the city of a
preliminary plant request shall satisfy the requirement of reasonable notice if
sent to the local general manager or system engineer of the grantee prior to
approval of the preliminary plant request.
(Ord. passed 2-16-93)
§ 14-54 USE OF STREETS.
   (A)   Underground installations. All installations shall be underground in
those areas of the city where public utilities providing telephone and electric
service are underground at the time of installation. In areas where either
telephone or electric utility facilities are above ground at the time of
installation, the grantee may install its device above ground, provided that,
at such time as those facilities are required to be placed underground by the
city or are placed underground, the grantee shall likewise place its services
underground without additional cost to the city or to the individual subscriber
so served. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this
chapter or the franchise agreement, the grantee’s system shall be located
underground at the request of the adjacent property owner, provided that the
excess cost over the aerial location shall be borne by the property owner
making the request. All new cable passing under the roadway shall be installed

deem proper to make;
      (3)   Not interfere with the free and proper use of public streets,
alleys, bridges, easements or other public ways, places or property, except to
the minimum extent possible during actual construction or repair;
      (4)   Not interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of private
property owners, except to the minimum extent possible during actual
construction or repair; and
      (5)   Not obstruct, hinder or interfere with any gas, electric, water or
telephone facilities or other utilities located within the city.
   (C)   Restoration to prior condition. In case of any disturbance of
pavement, sidewalk, driveway or other surfacing, the grantee shall, at its own
cost and expense and in a manner approved by the city, replace and restore all
paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping or surface of any street or alley
disturbed, in as good a condition as, or better than, before said work was
commenced and in a good workmanlike, timely manner in accordance with standards
for such work set by the city. Such restoration shall be undertaken within no
more than ten days after the disturbance is incurred and shall be completed as
soon as possible thereafter.
   (D)   Relocation of the facilities. In the event that at any time during the
period of this franchise the city, county or state shall lawfully elect to

relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes
and the fixtures at its own expense.
   (E)   Cooperation with building movers. The grantee shall, on the request of
any person holding a building moving permit issued by the Codes Inspector,
temporarily raise or lower its wire to permit the moving of buildings. The
expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid
by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall have the authority to
require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than 15
working days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
   (F)   Tree trimming. The grantee shall have the authority, except when in
conflict with existing city ordinance, to trim any trees upon and overhanging
public right-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in
contact with system facilities, except that at the option of the city, such
trimming may be done by it or under its supervision and direction, at the
expense of the grantee.
   (G)   Easements. All necessary easements over and under private property
shall be arranged for by the grantee.
   (H)   Work within rights-of-way. Consistent with the city’s policy for
temporary street closings, the closing of any part of a publicly maintained
street or right-of-way must be approved by the city and shall be prohibited
during peak travel hours, 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. During repairs or improvements, traffic on streets must
be maintained. Where full closing of the street is required, the request for
approval must be submitted to the city at least ten days in advance. Closings

   (A)   No poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the
city with regard to location, height, types and any other pertinent aspect.
However, no location of any pole or wire holding structure of the grantee shall
have rise to a vested interest, and such poles or structures shall be removed
or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the city determines that
the public convenience would be enhanced thereby.
   (B)   Where poles already in existence for use in serving the city are
available for use by the grantee, the city may require the grantee to use such
poles and structures, if it determines that the public convenience would be
enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the grantee are just and
reasonable.
   (C)   Where a public utility serving the city desires to make sure of the
poles or other wire holding structures of the grantee, but agreement thereof
with the grantee cannot be reached, the city may require the grantee to permit
such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the city shall determine
to be just and reasonable, if the city determines that the use would enhance
the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee’s
operation.
(Ord. passed 2-16-93)
§ 14-56 CONSTRUCTION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Within 30 days of the granting of a franchise pursuant to this
chapter, the grantee shall provide the city with a written progress report

DIVISION 5: CONSERVATION
§ 15-81 DEFINITION.
   The following term when used in this division shall have the meaning
ascribed to it in this section except where the context clearly indicates a
different meaning:
   WATER SHORTAGE. Shall be deemed to exist when the ordinary demands and
requirements of water consumers served by the city cannot be satisfied without
depleting the water supply to or below a critical level, the level at which the
continued availability of water for human consumption, sanitation, and fire
protection is jeopardized. Situations also occur that can interrupt the
availability of water supply or its distribution to our customers. This Water
Shortage Response Plan has been developed to allow the City of Eden to adapt to
these situations and continue to supply water to our customer. These situations
can be cause by drought, storms, water line breaks, power failures, or harmful
acts of human beings. This plan will set forth protocol for how the City Water
System will respond to these situations.
(1989 Code, § 16-81) (Ord. passed 8-19-86; Am Ord. passed 5-18-10)
§ 15-82 WATER SHORTAGE RESPONSE PLAN (WSRP).
   Implementation of the WSRP.
   (A)   To avoid further depletion of the city’s water supply during a water
shortage, The City Manager will authorize the implementation of what level of
response is needed based on the criteria set forth in this plan. The current
situation will be communicated to the Mayor and City Council.
   (B)   Whenever the City Manager finds a water shortage exists, he shall
proclaim one or more water conservation stages. The City Manager’s proclamation
shall be based upon a recommendation from the Water Plant Superintendent, the
Distribution ORC, or the Public Works Director, and the Utilities Manager to
the City Manager of what response is required to continue meeting the human
consumption, sanitation and fire protection needs of our customers.
Recommendations of the Water Plant Superintendent or the Distribution ORC shall
be based on a review of factors such as current water supply, stream flow,
drought conditions, presettling impoundment reservoir level, seasonal effect on
water supply, condition of the distribution system, pumping capacity, and
average current consumption rates.
   (C)   In the absence of the City Manager, the Assistant City Manager will be
authorized to implement the required response within the plan.
(1989 Code, § 16-82) (Ord. passed 8-19-86; Am. Ord. passed 11-19-02; Am. Ord.
passed 5-18-10)

   If the City Manager declares one or more stages of water conservation, it
shall be unlawful for any person to use or permit the use of water supplied by
the city in violation of any mandatory restriction instituted pursuant to that
declaration.
(1989 Code, § 16-83) (Ord. passed 8-19-86; Am. Ord. passed 11-19-02; Am. Ord.
passed 5-18-10)
§ 15-85 MEASURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED AT VARIOUS STAGES OF WATER CONSERVATION.
   (A)   Water Conservation will be encouraged at all times. The following
water use habits are to be recommended in an ongoing public information
campaign to reduce wasting of water:
      (1)   Check for leaks in toilets at least once a year by putting a few
drops of food coloring in the storage tank. If the color comes through to the
toilet bowl without flushing, the toilet needs adjustment or repair;
      (2)   Repair leaking faucets whenever they develop;
      (3)   Store water for drinking in the refrigerator to avoid trying to run
it cool at the tap. The storage also eliminates chlorine taste that some
customers find objectionable in drinking water;
      (4)   Use shower for bathing or reduce the depth of water used for tub
bath. Limit the length of each shower;
      (5)   Do not leave faucets running while shaving or rinsing dishes;
      (6)   Install water flow restrictive devices in showerheads;
      (7)   Install water-saving devices such as plastic bottles or commercial
units in toilet tanks, unless you already have a new water-saving type unit;
      (8)   Always wash full loads in clothes washers and dishwashers;
      (9)   Do not use the toilet for a trash basket; make every flush count;
and
      (10)   Commercial and industrial customers should review their water uses
and where feasible install recycle systems. The savings on water and sewer
bills will often pay for the installation in a reasonable period.
   (B)   The following water conservation stages, associated recommendations,
and mandatory measures may be instituted by the City Manager when a water
shortage exists.
      (1)   Stage 1, water supply alert conservation: Continue all
recommendations of continuous water conservation and increase the level of
conservation effort by publicizing the following measures:
         (a)   Limit use of clothes washers and dishwashers and when used,
operate fully loaded;
         (b)   Limit flushing of toilets by multiple usages;
         (c)   Limit lawn watering and only then, when grass shows signs of

         (g)   Use disposable and biodegradable dishes;
         (h)   Commercial and Industrial will reduce water use by 10%;
         (i)   Encourage a goal of 30% reduction in water use by all customers;
and
         (j)   Begin 15% water conservation surcharge on customer water rate.
      (3)   Stage 3, mandatory conservation: Continue all less severe water
conservation stages and increase the level of conservation effort by enforcing
the following measures:

during the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on Saturday;
         (c)   No filling of any swimming pool; no replenishment of any filled
pools except to the minimum essential for operation of chemical feed
equipment.;
         (d)   No nonessential use of water for commercial or public use. The
use of single-service plates and utensils is encouraged and recommended in
restaurants;
         (e)   Do not operate water-cooled air conditioners or other equipment
that does not recycle cooling water, except when health and safety are
adversely affected;
         (f)   Discontinue washing exterior of motor vehicles except where 50%
or more of the water is recycled, or where a private well water system is used;
         (g)   Commercial and Industrial will reduce water use by 30%;
         (h)   Encourage a goal of 50% reduction in water use by all customers;
and
         (i)   Begin 25% water conservation surcharge on customer water rate.
      (4)   Stage 4, emergency conservation (rationing): Continue all less
severe water conservation stages and increase the level of conservation effort
by strictly enforcing the following measures:
         (a)   It will be unlawful to fail to act in accordance with this
section or use water contrary to this section or attempt to evade or avoid such
water rationing restrictions;
         (b)   Fire protection will be maintained, but where possible, tank
trucks shall use raw water;
         (c)   Close all swimming pools;
         (d)   No washing of any motor vehicles, including commercial washing;
         (e)   All industrial uses of water are prohibited; and
         (f)   All other uses of water will be limited to those necessary to
meet minimum health and safety needs of the customers.

   (A)   Triggers in the table above are to be used as guidelines and actual
conditions may dictate some variations from the guidelines listed above. Any
one or more of the trigger guidelines may be sufficient to implement
conservation stages if an immediate situation threatens public health, public
safety, or has potentially severe economical impacts.
   (B)   Triggers for conditions such as operational difficulties at the water
plant, contamination, water line breaks, and power failures may lead to
Emergency Level 3 by the instant severity of the situation creating nearly
instantaneous water shortage.
(Ord. passed 5-18-10)
§ 15-89 RETURN TO NORMAL WATER SUPPLY CONDITIONS.
   When the Water Shortage conditions have abated and the water supply
situation is returning to normal, water conservation measures employed during
the water supply alert conservation, water supply warning conservation,
mandatory conservation and emergency conservation can be decreased in the
reverse order of implementation. Permanent measures directed toward long-term
monitoring and conservation should be implemented or continued.
(Ord. passed 5-18-10)
§ 15-90 VARIANCE FROM WATER CONSERVATION STAGES.
   (A)   Applications to apply for a variance from Various Water Conservation
Stages are available from the Billing and Collections Division. A completed
application will be submitted to the Billing and Collections Division;
questions concerning the application may be directed to the ORC for assistance.
   (B)   Applications will be reviewed and a recommendation will be made by an
appeals committee composed of the Public Works Director, the Utilities Manager,
and the Water Plant Superintendent. Recommendations will be made based on the
following criteria:
      (1)   Impact on the city’s water demand;
      (2)   Essential use of drinking water;
      (3)   How long would a variance be needed;
      (4)   Does an alternative water source exist;
      (5)   Social and economical importance; and
      (6)   Prevention of structural damage
(Ord. passed 5-18-10)
§ 15-91 REVIEW OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WATER CONSERVATION STAGES.
   The effectiveness of conservation stages will be evaluated in a timetable
appropriate to the reason for invoking the conservation stages. For example a
large water main break would be evaluated hours as to how fast elevated storage
is being depleted. In a drought situation, the water source availability would
be evaluated daily versus the service water demand, to see if the conservation
stages are keeping the service water demand less than source availability.

§ 15-164 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   The city prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without
notification to and approval by the POTW Director.
   (A) Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the
POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State Hazardous
Waste Authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance
which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. pt.
261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 C.F.R. pt. 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days before the
discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving
written approval from the city. Any notification under this paragraph need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under §
15-160. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self monitoring requirements of §§
15-156,
15-158, and
15-159.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulation under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW Director, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State Hazardous Waste
Authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective
date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

15-185 et seq.
§ 15-166 GRAB AND COMPOSITE SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   (1)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times.
      (2)   The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge.
   (B)   (1)   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as
required by 40 C.F.R. § 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs
necessary to be representative of the User’s discharge.
      (2)   See 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number
requirements for BMR and 90 Day Compliance Reports. Additionally, the POTW
Director may allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24 hour period which
are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 C.F.R. § 136.
   (C)   (1)   All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a
minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge.
All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional
composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Director.
      (2)   When authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples
must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must
be documented.

§ 15-174 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The city requires the user to provide and operate at the user’s own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s

the purpose of this division is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the city, approval authority and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying or in the performance of any of their duties.
   (B)   The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on
the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities. Denial of the POTW’s. approval authority’s, or EPA’s
access to the user’s premises shall be a violation of this division.
Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access.

15-185 et seq.
§ 15-176 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the city, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with
this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city,

SUBDIVISION H: ENFORCEMENT
§ 15-185 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW Director finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this division, wastewater permit,
or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other
pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the
date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the City by the user.
Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to § 16-185(D), below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this division or is in
noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW Director
determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be
made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.

against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
15-126(A) of this division or the specific prohibitions in §
15-126(B)(9) through (23) of this division if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially

or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) above.
      (2)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after

(Ord. passed 8-22-94)
§ 15-219 RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS.
   The city will receive applications for water and sewer extension from
property owners or their agents upon the following terms and conditions.
   (A)   The development or improvements, when completed, must have an actual
or proposed value sufficient for the city to realize increased revenue from
real property taxes attributable to such development or improvement equal to or
greater than the amount determinable under paragraph (B) of this section.
   (B)   The revenue attributable to the increased real property taxes must be
sufficient for the city to recover an amount equal to or exceeding the
following.
      (1)   Residential. The city will participate in an amount equal to 50% of
the total cost of extension of water and or sewer services for the project. The
city shall realize receipt of additional real property taxes in an amount
sufficient to cover the city’s participation within five consecutive calendar
years from the first day of January next succeeding the date of substantial
completion of the development on the site. This shall apply only to development
projects of ten or more residential units.
      (2)   Commercial. The city will participate in an amount equal to 75% of
the total cost of extension of water and or sewer services for the project. The
city shall realize receipt of additional real property taxes in an amount
sufficient to cover the city’s participation within five consecutive calendar
years from the first day of January next succeeding the date of substantial
completion of the development on the site.
      (3)   Industrial. The city will participate in an amount equal to 100% of
the total cost of extension of water and or sewer services for the project. The
city shall realize receipt of additional real property taxes in an amount
sufficient to cover the city’s participation within five consecutive calendar
years from the first day of January next succeeding the date of substantial
completion of the development on the site.
   (C)   The application must contain the owner’s representation of the
estimated increase in the value of the subject property resulting from the

well as such other information as may be reasonably requested by the city.
   (D)   The applicant shall pay the difference between the cost of the
extension of services and the percentage that will be paid by the city based
upon the formulas set forth in §
15-219(B) of this code. The tax rate for the then current fiscal year of the
city shall be used in the computation of estimated additional real property tax
revenues for the specified period of years. The difference shall be paid by the
applicant prior to the extension of the water and sewer lines or the awarding
of contracts for such extension.
   (E)   The method of calculation of the increase in real property taxes on
the property shall be as follows:
      (1)   A calculation shall be made for the real property taxes that would
have been ordinarily assessed and collected on the property had it remained
unimproved during the number of years specified in §
15-219(B). The value of the unimproved property for this calculation shall be
the value of the real property for Rockingham County real property tax purposes
for the year the project commences as determined on January 1 of such year. The
total amount of taxes that would have been collected had the property remained
unimproved shall be calculated by applying the then current tax rate to the
value of the unimproved property as of January 1 of the year the project
commences and multiplying the resulting amount by the appropriate number of
years as specified in §
15-219(B).
      (2)   A calculation shall be made of the real property taxes that will be
assessed and collected on the improved property during the required number of
years based upon the applicant’s estimate pursuant to §
15-219(C).
      (3)   Adjustment to the sum paid prior to the commencement of the project
or awarding of contracts for such project pursuant to §
15-219(D) shall be made as follows: In the event the added tax value to the
property is determined by the County Tax Department to be less than the
applicant’s estimate, the applicant shall be liable to the city for the
difference between the total of real property taxes that would been payable to
the city over the specified number of years and the actual taxes that would be
collected based on the county’s evaluation. The applicant shall pay the
difference to the city, if any, within the 60 day period immediately following
the date the County Tax Department determines the assessment valuation of such
improvements. In the event such payment is not received within the 60 day
period, the city shall proceed with all remedies available to it under state
law for collection.
