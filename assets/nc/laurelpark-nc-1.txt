§ 33.05 PURCHASING POLICY.
   (A)   Statement of policy. The goals of the town's purchasing program are
(1) to comply with the legal and ethical requirements of public purchasing and
procurement; and (2) to provide town departments the required goods, equipment,
and services at the time and place needed and in the proper quantity and
quality.
   (B)   Purchasing procedures - supplies, materials, equipment, or services.
      (1)   Less than $1,000. Such purchases are normally made at the
Department level. Upon receipt of the item, the invoice must be submitted to
the Finance Officer in a timely manner. Under no circumstances may an order be
split to stay under the $1,000 threshold.
      (2)   $1,000 to $4,999. For all purchases $1,000 and over, a quote and
completed purchase requisition form must be submitted to the Town Manager for
approval (same exceptions apply as stated below for purchase orders). The
person originating the requisition shall be responsible for contacting
competing vendors to obtain the best price for the product to be purchased.
Requisitions must show the account number to which the cost of the purchase
shall be charged.
      (3)   $5,000 and greater.  Departments must follow the procedures above.
Upon receipt of a purchase requisition for $5,000 or greater, a purchase order
will be issued, as detailed below.
   (C)   How a purchase order is issued.
      (1)   A purchase order will be issued by the Finance Officer for all
expenditures exceeding $5,000, usually within one working day following receipt
of a properly approved requisition. All requisitions where the proposed
expenditure exceeds $5,000 shall also be approved by the Finance Officer and
two Council members. If the Finance Officer is unavailable for signature, the
other commissioners or Mayor may approve.
      (2)   A purchase order issued to a local vendor will be returned to the
appropriate Department Head for pick-up. Purchase orders to out-of-town vendors
will be mailed unless the Finance Officer is given different instructions.
   (D)   What should be ordered by purchase orders.
      (1)   With the above statements in mind, there are a variety of
exceptions to the purchase order requirement. If an item is not listed,
Departments should assume the purchase order process applies.
      (2)   Purchases not requiring a purchase order:
         (a)   Professional services (accounting, legal, planning, engineering,
architectural, etc.).
         (b)   Other services provided by a current contract (waste collection,
tank maintenance, etc.).
         (c)   Items or services that are procured from a vendor with whom the
town maintains a limited charge account for purchasing.
         (d)   Advertising (legal ads, etc).
         (e)   Annual dues and memberships.
         (f)   Insurance premiums.
         (g)   Land purchases.
         (h)   Refunds.
         (i)   Utility services.
   (E)   When a purchase order or purchase requisition is not required. When a
procurement can be made without a purchase order or purchase requisition, a
Department Head or his or her designee may purchase the item and obtain an
invoice or statement from the vendor. The approved invoice, including the
Department Head signature and account number to which the purchase is to be
charged, must then be submitted to the Finance Officer for payment.
   (F)   Payment procedure.
      (1)   After receipt of all material or services ordered, the Department
Head will sign one copy of the invoice, and if applicable, receiving report,
and return the item(s) to the Finance Officer. The Finance Officer will attach
the vendor's invoice to the receiving report before payment is made.
      (2)   Except in an emergency or a specific request from the Town Manager,
the Finance Officer will accumulate invoices and issue payment checks on the
10th and 25th of each month for purchases made during the previous month.
Checks are normally signed by the Finance Officer and Town Manager. If either
is unavailable, the Town Clerk or any member of the Council can substitute as
the second signature. Under no circumstances may a check be signed by both the
Town Clerk and Finance Officer, or two Council members.
   (G)   Emergency purchases. In cases of emergencies, the Department Head or
his or her designee may purchase directly from any vendor supplies or services
whose immediate procurement is essential to prevent delays in work which may
affect the life, health, safety, or convenience of town employees or citizens.
The user department shall exercise good judgment and use established vendors
when making emergency purchases. Not anticipating needs does not constitute an
emergency situation. The Town Manager must be notified if a department is
making an emergency purchase and the appropriate documentation must be provided
to the Finance Officer for processing the next business day. The Department
Head must also provide a written explanation of the nature of the emergency.
   (H)   Petty cash expenditures. The Town of Laurel Park does not have a petty
cash fund.
   (I)   Purchase cards. The use of purchasing cards is authorized in order to
reduce or eliminate certain types of paper-based processing, thereby saving
town employees time and effort. The use of the purchasing card (p-card) is not
intended to change what items are purchased-only the method by which they are
purchased. Purchases are regulated by the Town of Laurel Park Electronic
Transactions Policy. All purchases must comply with the purchasing policy,
including the purchase requisition form requirement.
   (J)   Reimbursement of expenditures.
      (1)   Any staff or Council member requesting reimbursement for
expenditures, must be verified by itemized return receipt. No expenditure will
be reimbursed unless the town's budget ordinance includes an appropriation
authorizing such charge.
      (2)   Council members requesting reimbursement for mileage for attending
off-site meetings shall submit the request to the Finance Officer in writing

§ 33.07 CASH MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENTS POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. To establish a policy to effectively manage all funds
available to the Town of Laurel Park for conducting town operations.
   (B)   Statement of policy.
      (1)   The cash management and investments policy objectives are to
increase the amount of idle money invested, thus generating greater amounts of
non tax revenue through increased investment earnings and simultaneously
providing adequate safety and liquidity of the town's money. This plan
addresses five areas: cash receipts, cash mobilization and management of
available resources (deposits/investments), cash disbursements, banking
relations, and monitoring/reporting on the policy.
      (2)   In addition to establishing a cash management and investments
policy, the Finance Officer and Town Manager will implement a series of
internal controls which are designed to prevent the loss of public money
arising from fraud, employee error, misrepresentation by third parties, or
imprudent actions by employees and officers of the town. The Finance Officer
and Town Manager will ensure, whenever possible, separation of duties of the
procedures for handling public funds and other assets.
   (C)   Cash receipts.
      (1)   Deposits. The Finance Officer and Town Manager shall devise and
implement a central depository system for the town. This system shall include
the creation of two types of fund accounts: a cash reserve account and a
payables account. The cash reserve account shall be invested in the North
Carolina Cash Management Trust in one of their interest bearing portfolios or
in collateralized CDs. The payables account shall be a checking account at an
official depository approved by both the State of North Carolina and the Town
Council.
      (2)   The State Treasurer enforces standards of minimum capitalization
for all pooling method financial institutions. The town relies on the State
Treasurer to monitor those financial institutions. The town analyzes the
financial soundness of any financial institution used by the town. The town
complies with the provisions of G.S. § 159-21 when designating official
depositories and verifying that deposits are properly secured.
      (3)   In accordance with G.S. § 159-32, deposits are to be made daily
when money on hand exceeds $500. In any event, a deposit is to be made on the
last business day of the month.
      (4)   For checks received and deposited, which are returned to the
Finance Officer due to insufficient funds, prompt action will be undertaken to
collect good funds. Any fees incurred by the town in the collection of bad
checks will be added to the bill as an additional service fee.
      (5)   Any adjustments or corrections for either overpayment or
underpayment will be made after the money has been deposited. For routine
deposits, checks will rarely be returned because they were made out in the
wrong amount. There should be no delay in depositing money for errors of this
type on a regular basis.
      (6)   All money received from the state shall be received through the
State Treasurer's Electronic Payment System (STEPS). The Finance Officer will
establish an account with the North Carolina Cash Management Trust and execute
a STEPS agreement with the State Treasurer to implement the Town's
participation in this system.
      (7)   Billings. Applications and reports to the state or federal
government for reimbursement or claims are to be filed promptly. Examples of
claims for reimbursement are listed below.
 
Revenue Source                    Due Date for Claim
Powell Bill                       Between July 1 and 21
Refund of State Sales and Use Tax Within six months after June 30
Refund of Local Sales and Use Tax Within six months after June 30
 
   (B)   Cash mobilization and management of available resources (deposits/
investments).
      (1)   Money will be deposited into the cash reserve account by either
electronic transmission using remote deposit capture or by taking the deposit
to the authorized local bank before the end of the banking day. The deposit
shall be made by employees duly authorized to do so, and supervised by the
Finance Officer and/or Town Manager. The Town Manager shall decide which funds
shall be transferred to and from the NCCMT as required.
      (2)   All money received by the town from the state shall be wired
through the State Treasurer's Electronic Payment System (STEPS) in order to
ensure immediate investment on the transfer date.
      (3)   Deposits/investments. Eligible deposits and investments shall be
limited to obligations of the U.S. Government, such as treasury bills, bonds,
and notes; time deposits with any financially sound bank or savings institution
whose principal office is in North Carolina; and the North Carolina Cash
Management Trust.
      (4)   The town limits investments to the provisions of G.S. § 159-30 and
restricts the purchase of securities to the highest possible ratings whenever
particular types of securities are rated.
      (5)   Collateralization. Collateralization for deposits shall be in
accordance with Title 20, Chapter 7 of the North Carolina Administrative Code
(NCAC). All deposits for the town shall be secured by deposit insurance, surety
bonds, eligible collateral securities, or investment securities. The Finance
Officer shall notify the depository when an account is opened that the money
deposited is public funds subject to collateralization and shall file a "Public
Deposit Status Report" with each depository and the State Treasurer promptly
after June 30.
      (6)   Custody.
         (a)   The Finance Officer shall be responsible for custody,
safekeeping, and accuracy of records of securities and deposit certificates
according to G.S. § 159-30(d).
         (b)   The town shall utilize a third party custodial agent for book
entry transactions, all of which shall be a held in the town's name. The
custodial agent shall be a trust department authorized to do trust work in
North Carolina who has an account with the Federal Reserve. Certificated
securities shall be in the custody of the Finance Officer.
      (7)   Diversification/maturity scheduling. The Finance Officer shall
ensure proper diversification of the investment portfolio in order to minimize
the risks brought on by economic and market changes.
      (8)   Projecting cash flows. The Finance Officer and Town Manager shall
prepare a cash flow forecast and update it monthly. The objectives of this
forecast shall be to ensure sufficient funds will be available to meet the
town's commitments and that the timing and amount of excess funds are known so
as to maximize the amount of money available for investment.
   (C)   Cash disbursements.
      (1)   The Finance Officer shall ensure town money is expended pursuant to
G.S. § 159- 28(b).
      (2)   The town shall pay obligations by the due date after first
determining whether early payment to obtain a discount is more beneficial than
payment on the billing's due date. The Finance Officer shall periodically
review the disbursement cycle and changes shall be instituted if necessary.
      (3)   The Finance Officer shall require that all departments consolidate
payments to one vendor. The Finance Officer shall ensure that all departments
using the same vendor(s) receive the same due date and discount date. All
checks shall be mailed in the afternoon provided this afternoon mailing will
not result in missing the discount date or payment due date.
      (4)   Payroll direct deposits for all employees shall be issued bi-weekly
to employees to credit on the Friday pay date. In addition, payroll taxes shall
be submitted on the due date.
   (D)   Banking relations. The Finance Officer and Town Manager shall maintain
an average daily balance in the checking account equal to either one week's
expenditures or an amount sufficient to offset the costs associated with the
account, whichever is greater. The Finance Officer shall periodically review
the activity of the account to determine target balances to accomplish the
objective of bank compensation and expenditure coverage.
   (E)   Monitoring and reporting on the policy.
      (1)   The Finance Officer shall provide reports monthly to the Town
Council concerning the status of investments. The report shall include that
amount of Town money invested and maturities. A loss or potential loss on the
liquidation of investments shall be disclosed at the next Council meeting after
the loss becomes known.
      (2)   The Finance Officer shall provide reports monthly to the Town
Council concerning the actual receipts and disbursements for the month versus
the budgeted receipts and disbursements. Any overages or shortages shall be
explained.
      (3)   The Finance Officer shall semiannually report to the secretary of
the Local Government Commission on January 1 and July 1, the amounts of funds
in custody, the amounts of deposits of such funds in depositories, and a list
of all investment securities and time deposits held, pursuant to G.S. §§ 159-33
and 159-33.1.
(Ord. passed 6-16-2022)
§ 33.08 UNIFORM GUIDANCE PROCUREMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines that
meet or exceed the procurement requirements for purchases of goods (apparatus,
supplies, materials, and equipment), services, and construction or repair
projects when federal funds are being used in whole or in part to pay for the
cost of the contract. To the extent that other sections of procurement policies
and procedures adopted by the Town of Laurel Park are more restrictive that
those contained in this policy, local policies and procedures shall be
followed.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   Application of policy.
         (a)   This policy applies to contracts for purchases, services, and
construction or repair work funded with federal financial assistance (direct or
reimbursed). The requirements of this policy also apply to any subrecipient of
the funds.
         (b)   All federally funded projects, loans, grants, and sub-grants,
whether funded in part or wholly, are subject to the Uniform Administrative
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for federal awards
(Uniform Guidance) codified at 2 C.F.R. Part 200 unless otherwise directed in
writing by the federal agency or state pass-through agency that awarded the
funds.
      (2)   Compliance with federal law. All procurement activities involving
the expenditure of federal funds must be conducted in compliance with the
Procurement Standards codified in 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.317 through 200.326 unless
otherwise directed in writing by the federal agency or state pass-through
agency that awarded the funds. The Town of Laurel Park will follow all
applicable local, state, and federal procurement requirements when expending
federal funds. Should the Town of Laurel Park have more stringent requirements,
the most restrictive requirement shall apply so long as it is consistent with
state and federal law.
      (3)   Contract award.  All contracts shall be awarded only to the lowest
responsive responsible bidder possessing the ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the contract.
      (4)   No evasion. No contract may be divided to bring the cost under bid
thresholds or to evade any requirements under this policy or state and federal
law.
      (5)   Contract requirements. All contracts paid for in whole or in part
with federal funds shall be in writing. The written contract must include or
incorporate by reference the provisions required under 2 C.F.R § 200.326 and as
provided for under 2 C.F.R. Part 200, Appendix II.
      (6)   Contractors' conflict of interest. Designers, suppliers, and
contractors that assist in the development or drafting of specifications,
requirements, statements of work, invitation for bids or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such requirements.
      (7)   Approval and modification. The administrative procedures contained
in this policy are administrative and may be changed as necessary at the staff
level to comply with state and federal law.
   (C)   General procurement standards and procedures. Either the purchasing
department or the requesting department shall procure all contracts in
accordance with the requirements of this section of the policy.
      (1)   Necessity. Purchases must be necessary to perform the scope of work
and must avoid acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. The purchasing
department and/or the requesting department should check with the federal
surplus property agency prior to buying new items when feasible and less
expensive. Strategic sourcing should be considered with other departments and/
or agencies who have similar needs to consolidate procurements and services to
obtain better pricing.
      (2)   Clear specifications. All solicitations must incorporate a clear
and accurate description of the technical requirements for the materials,
products, or services to be procured, and shall include all other requirements
which bidders must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids
or proposals. Technical requirements must not contain features that restrict
competition.
      (3)   Notice of federal funding. All bid solicitations must acknowledge
the use of federal funding for the contract. In addition, all prospective
bidders or offerors must acknowledge that funding is contingent upon compliance
with all terms and conditions of the funding award.
      (4)   Compliance by contractors. All solicitations shall inform
prospective contractors that they must comply with all applicable federal laws,
regulations, executive orders, and terms and conditions of the funding award.
      (5)   Fixed price. Solicitations must state that bidders shall submit
bids on a fixed price basis and that the contract shall be awarded on this
basis unless otherwise provided for in this policy. Cost plus percentage of
cost contracts are prohibited. Time and materials contracts are prohibited in
most circumstances. Time and materials contracts will not be used unless no
other form of contract is suitable and the contract includes a "not to exceed"
amount. A time and materials contract shall not be awarded without express
written permission of the federal agency or state pass-through agency that
awarded the funds.
      (6)   Use of brand names. When possible, performance or functional
specifications are preferred to allow for more competition leaving the
determination of how to reach the required result to the contractor. Brand
names may be used only when it is impractical or uneconomical to write a clear
and accurate description of the requirement(s). When a brand name is listed, it
is used as reference only and "or equal" must be included in the description.
      (7)   Lease versus purchase. Under certain circumstances, it may be
necessary to perform an analysis of lease versus purchase alternatives to
determine the most economical approach.
      (8)   Dividing contract for M/WBE participation. If economically
feasible, procurements may be divided into smaller components to allow maximum
participation of small and minority businesses and women business enterprises.
The procurement cannot be divided to bring the cost under bid thresholds or to
evade any requirements under this policy.
      (9)   Documentation. Documentation must be maintained by the purchasing
department and/or the requesting department detailing the history of all
procurements. The documentation should include the procurement method used,
contract type, basis for contractor selection, price, sources solicited, public
notices, cost analysis, bid documents, addenda, amendments, contractor's
responsiveness, notice of award, copies of notices to unsuccessful bidders or
offerors, record of protests or disputes, bond documents, notice to proceed,
purchase order, and contract. All documentation relating to the award of any
contract must be made available to the granting agency upon request.
      (10)   Cost estimate. For all procurements costing $250,000 or more, the
purchasing department and/or requesting department shall develop an estimate of
the cost of the procurement prior to soliciting bids. Cost estimates may be
developed by reviewing prior contract costs, online review of similar products
or services, or other means by which a good faith cost estimate may be
obtained. Cost estimates for construction and repair contracts may be developed
by the project designer.
      (11)   Contract requirements. The requesting department must prepare a
written contract incorporating the provisions referenced in division (B)(3).
      (12)   Debarment. No contract shall be awarded to a contractor included
on the federally debarred bidder's list.
      (13)   Contractor oversight. The requesting department receiving the
federal funding must maintain oversight of the contract to ensure that
contractor is performing in accordance with the contract terms, conditions, and
specifications.
      (14)   Open competition. Solicitations shall be prepared in a way to be
fair and provide open competition. The procurement process shall not restrict
competition by imposing unreasonable requirements on bidders, including but not
limited to unnecessary supplier experience, excessive or unnecessary bonding,
specifying a brand name without allowing for "or equal" products, or other
unnecessary requirements that have the effect of restricting competition.
      (15)   Geographic preference. No contract shall be awarded on the basis
of a geographic preference.
   (D)   Specific procurement procedures. Either the purchasing department or
the requesting department shall solicit bids in accordance with the
requirements under this section of the policy based on the type and cost of the
contract.
      (1)   Service contracts (except for A/E professional services) and
purchase contracts costing less than $10,000 shall be procured using the
uniform guidance "micro-purchase" procedure (2 C.F.R. § 200.320(a)) as follows:
         (a)   The contract may be awarded without soliciting pricing or bids
if the price of the goods or services is considered to be fair and reasonable.
         (b)   To the extent practicable, purchases must be distributed among
qualified suppliers.
      (2)   Service contracts (except for A/E professional services) and
purchase contracts costing $10,000 up to $90,000 shall be procured using the
uniform guidance "small purchase" procedure (2 C.F.R. § 200.320(b)) as follows:
         (a)   Obtain price or rate quotes from an "adequate number" of
qualified sources (a federal grantor agency might issue guidance interpreting
"adequate number," so the requesting department should review the terms and
conditions of the grant award documents to confirm whether specific guidance
has been issued).
         (b)   Take affirmative steps to solicit price quotes from M/WBE
vendors and suppliers as required under 2 C.F.R. § 200.321.
         (c)   Cost or price analysis is not required prior to soliciting bids.
         (d)   Award the contract on a fixed-price basis (a not-to-exceed basis
is permissible for service contracts where obtaining a fixed price is not
feasible).
         (e)   Award the contract to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder.
      (3)   Service contracts (except for A/E professional services) and
purchase contracts costing $90,000 and above shall be procured using a
combination of the most restrictive requirements of the uniform guidance
"sealed bid" procedure (2 C.F.R. § 200.320(c)) and state formal bidding
procedures (G.S. 143-129) as follows:
         (a)   Cost or price analysis is required prior to soliciting bids.
         (b)   Complete specifications or purchase description must be made
available to all bidders.
         (c)   The bid must be formally advertised in a newspaper of general
circulation for at least seven full days between the date of the advertisement
and the date of the public bid opening. Electronic-only advertising must be
authorized by the governing board. The advertisement must state the date, time,
and location of the public bid opening, indicate where specifications may be
obtained, and reserve to the governing board the right to reject any or all
bids only for "sound documented reasons."
         (d)   Take affirmative steps to solicit price quotes from M/WBE
vendors and suppliers as required under 2 C.F.R. § 200.321.
         (e)   Open bids at the public bid opening on the date, time, and at
the location noticed in the public advertisement. All bids must be submitted
sealed. A minimum of two bids must be received in order to open all bids.
         (f)   Award the contract to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder
on a fixed-price basis. Governing board approval is required for purchase
contracts unless the governing board has delegated award authority to an
individual official or employee. Any and all bids may be rejected only for
"sound documented reasons."
      (4)   Service contracts (except for A/E professional services) costing
$250,000 and above may be procured using the uniform guidance "competitive
proposal" procedure (2 C.F.R. § 200.320(d)) when the "sealed bid" procedure is
not appropriate for the particular type of service being sought. The procedures
are as follows:
         (a)   A request for proposals (RFP) must be publicly advertised.
Formal advertisement in a newspaper is not required so long as the method of
advertisement will solicit proposals from an "adequate number" of qualified
firms.
         (b)   Take affirmative steps to solicit price quotes from M/WBE
vendors and suppliers as provided under 2 C.F.R. § 200.321.
         (c)   Identify evaluation criteria and relative importance of each
criteria (criteria weight) in the RFP.
         (d)   Consider all responses to the publicized RFP to the maximum
extent practical.
         (e)   Must have a written method for conducting technical evaluations
of proposals and selecting the winning firm.
         (f)   Award the contract to the responsible firm with most
advantageous proposal taking into account price and other factors identified in
the RFP. Governing board approval is not required.

of proposals and selecting the best qualified firm.
         (f)   Consider all responses to the publicized RFQ to the maximum
extent practical.
         (g)   Evaluate qualifications of respondents to rank respondents and

of qualified firms to compete for the contract given the nature and size of the
project.

qualified firm.
         (i)   Once the most qualified firm is selected, negotiate fair and
reasonable compensation. If negotiations are not successfully, repeat
negotiations with the second-best qualified firm.
         (j)   Award the contract to best qualified firm with whom fair and

state pass-through agency that awarded the federal funds:
      (1)   Sole source. A contract may be awarded without competitive bidding
when the item is available from only one source. The purchasing department and/
or requesting department shall document the justification for and lack of
available competition for the item. A sole source contract must be approved by
the governing board.
      (2)   Public exigency. A contract may be awarded without competitive
bidding when there is a public exigency. A public exigency exists when there is
an imminent or actual threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and the
need for the item will not permit the delay resulting from a competitive
bidding.
      (3)   Inadequate competition. A contract may be awarded without
competitive bidding when competition is determined to be inadequate after
attempts to solicit bids from a number of sources as required under this policy
does not result in a qualified winning bidder.
      (4)   Federal contract. A contract may be awarded without competitive
bidding when the purchase is made from a federal contract available on the U.S.
General Services Administration schedules of contracts.
      (5)   Awarding agency approval. A contract may be awarded without
competitive bidding with the express written authorization of the federal
agency or state pass-through agency that awarded the federal funds so long as
awarding the contract without competition is consistent with state law.

      (2)   Federal standards.
         (a)   Prohibited conflicts of interest in contracting. Without
limiting any specific prohibition set forth in division (D)(1), a covered
individual may not participate in the selection, award, or administration of a
contract or subaward if such covered individual has a real or apparent conflict
of interest.
            1.   Real conflict of interest. A real conflict of interest shall
exist when the covered individual or any related party has a financial or other
interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a person or entity considered
for a contract or subaward. Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by
reference, provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of (i) financial or other
interests in a firm considered for a contract or subaward; and (ii) tangible
personal benefits from a firm considered for a contract or subaward.
            2.   Apparent conflict of interest. An apparent conflict of
interest shall exist where a real conflict of interest may not exist under
division (D)(2)(a)1., but where a reasonable person with knowledge of the
relevant facts would find that an existing situation or relationship creates
the appearance that a covered individual or any related party has a financial
or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered for
a contract or subaward.
         (b)   Identification and management of conflicts of interest.
            1.   Duty to disclose and disclosure forms.
               a.   Each covered individual expected to be or actually involved
in the selection, award, or administration of a contract or subaward has an
ongoing duty to disclose to the COI point of contact potential real or apparent
conflicts of interest arising under this policy.

COI point of contact shall advise covered individuals expected to be involved
in the selection, award, or administration of the contract or subaward of such
duty.

[250,000], the COI point of contact shall collect a conflict of interest
disclosure form contained in Exhibit C (for Contracts) and Exhibit E (for
Subawards), which are incorporated herein by reference, from each covered
individual and file such conflict of interest disclosure form in records of the
unit.
            2.   Identification prior to award of contract or subaward.

COI point of contact shall complete the appropriate compliance checklist
contained in Exhibit B (for Contracts) and Exhibit D (for Subawards), which are
incorporated herein by reference, and file such compliance checklist in the
records of the unit.
            3.   Management prior to award of contract or subaward.
               a.   If, after completing the compliance checklist, the COI
point of contact identifies a potential real or apparent conflict of interest
relating to a proposed contract or subaward, the COI point of contact shall
disclose such finding in writing to the Town Attorney and to each member of the
Governing Board. If the Governing Board desires to enter into the proposed
contract or subaward despite the identification by the COI point of contact of
a potential real or apparent conflict of interest, it may either:
                  i.   Accept the finding of the COI point of contact and
direct the COI point of contact to obtain authorization to enter into the
contract or subaward from (a) if unit is a recipient of federal financial
assistance, the federal awarding agency with appropriate mitigation measures;
or (b) if unit is a subrecipient of federal financial assistance, from the
pass-through entity that provided a subaward to unit; or
                  ii.   Reject the finding of the COI point of contact and
enter into the contract or subaward. In rejecting any finding of the COI point
of contact, the Governing Board shall in writing document a justification
supporting such rejection.
               b.   If the COI point of contact does not identify a potential
real or apparent conflict of interest relating to a proposed contract or
subaward, the unit may enter into the contract or subaward in accordance with
the unit's purchasing or subaward policy.
            4.   Identification after award of contract or subaward.
               a.   If the COI point of contact discovers that a real or
apparent conflict of interest has arisen after the unit has entered into a
contract or subaward, the COI point of contact shall, as soon as possible,
disclose such finding to the Town Attorney and to each member of the Governing
Board. Upon discovery of such a real or apparent conflict of interest, the unit
shall cease all payments under the relevant contract or subaward until the
conflict of interest has been resolved.
            5.   Management after award of contract or subaward.
               a.   Following the receipt of such disclosure of a potential
real or apparent conflict of interest pursuant to division (D)(2)(b)4., the
Governing Board may reject the finding of the COI point of contact by
documenting in writing a justification supporting such rejection. If the
Governing Board fails to reject the finding of the COI point of contact within
15 days of receipt, the COI point of contact shall:
                  i.   If unit is a recipient of federal financial assistance
funding the contract or subaward, disclose the conflict to the federal awarding
agency providing such federal financial assistance in accordance with 2 C.F.R.
§ 200.112 and/or applicable regulations of the agency; or
                  ii.   If unit is a subrecipient of federal financial
assistance, disclose the conflict to the pass-through entity providing a
subaward to unit in accordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.112 and applicable
regulations of the federal awarding agency and the pass-through entity.
   (E)   Oversight of subrecipient's conflict of interest standards.
      (1)   Subrecipients of unit must adopt conflict of interest policy. Prior
to the unit's execution of any subaward for which the unit serves as a pass-
through entity, the COI point of contact shall ensure that the proposed
subrecipient of federal financial assistance has adopted a conflict of interest
policy that satisfies the requirements of 2 C.F.R. § 200.318(c)(1), 2 C.F.R. §
200.318(c)(2), and all other applicable federal regulations.
      (2)   Obligation to disclose subrecipient conflicts of interest. The COI
point of contact shall ensure that the legal agreement under which the unit
makes a subaward to a subrecipient shall require such subrecipient to disclose
to the COI point of contact any potential real or apparent conflicts of
interest that the subrecipient identifies. Upon receipt of such disclosure, the
COI point of contact shall disclose such information to the federal awarding
agency that funded the subaward in accordance with that agency's disclosure
policy.
   (F)   Gift standards.
      (1)   Federal standard. Subject to the exceptions set forth in division

such gifts to the federal awarding agency or a pass-through entity for which
the unit is a subrecipient.
   (G)   Violations of policy.
      (1)   Disciplinary actions for covered individuals. Any covered
individual that fails to disclose a real, apparent, or potential real or
apparent conflict of interest arising with respect to the covered individual or
related party may be subject to disciplinary action, including, but not limited
to, an employee's termination or suspension of employment with or without pay,
the consideration or adoption of a resolution of censure of a public official
by the Governing Board, or termination of an agent's contract with the unit.

WATER AND SEWER BILLING
§ 50.01 AUTHORITY; SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   G.S. § 160A-312 grants municipalities the power to regulate certain
utilities. The Town of Laurel Park maintains and operates a water distribution
system, and bills for sewer service in certain areas of town. The town
purchases water from the City of Hendersonville which draws and treats water
from the Mills River watershed.
   (B)   The service charges for water and sewer service shall be established
each year as a part of the fee schedule adopted annually by the Town Council.
Laurel Park residents who receive water/sewer service directly from the City of
Hendersonville follow Hendersonville policies and procedures for utility
service.
(Ord. passed 11-17-2015; Ord. passed 11-21-2017)
§ 50.02 NORMAL BILLING CYCLES.
   (A)   The Town of Laurel Park bills for water/sewer services on a bi-monthly
basis. The bi-monthly water/sewer billing cycles end in February, April, June,
August, October, and December. Water meters are read during the last part of
these months. Bills are prepared and mailed no later than the fifth day of the
following month.
   (B)   Payment is due by the last day of the month in which the bill was
mailed, after which an account is considered delinquent and the procedures of §
50.04 apply.
(Ord. passed 11-17-2015; Ord. passed 11-21-2017)
§ 50.03 PAYMENT METHODS.
   The town offers multiple methods for utility bill payment:

§ 50.04 DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   The following procedures apply to delinquent accounts.
      (1)   A late charge is assessed to delinquent accounts the first day
after the due date. Payment is not considered late if postmarked on/before the
due date or placed in the designated Town Hall night deposit location prior to
9:00 a.m. of the next business day after the due date. Customers will be mailed
a notice during the first week of the following month indicating the account is
past due and the date service will be disconnected if payment is not received.
      (2)   Failure to receive the water/sewer bill does not excuse the
customer’s responsibility for timely payment or prevent service disconnection.
      (3)   Prior to disconnecting services for a delinquent account, the town
may attempt to make telephonic contact with the customer (failure to make
contact with the customer will not preclude the town from disconnecting
service).
      (4)   A service disconnect letter is issued for the delinquent account at
the scheduled date and time, with payment due by 12:00 p.m. Payments received
after 12:00 p.m. must include the delinquent fee and all other outstanding
charges and fees.
   (B)   The town assumes no liability for any customer equipment, such as
water heaters, which may be damaged when water is disconnected.
   (C)   The Town Manager is responsible for the enforcement of this
subchapter, but Town Council reserves the right to waive fees/charges due to
justifiable hardships. Any customer’s request for waiver must be submitted in
writing.
(Ord. passed 11-17-2015; Ord. passed 11-21-2017)
§ 50.05 TEMPORARY METER TURN OFF.
   At the customer’s request, the town will provide one meter turn-off and
turn-on at no charge to the customer during the fiscal year (July 1 through

verification from the attorney handling the closing, etc.).
   (B)   All residential non-owners (renters, care takers, etc.) are required
to pay a deposit to the town prior to receiving water/sewer service unless the
water/sewer service remains in the property owner’s name. If the account
remains in the property owner’s name, the property owner is responsible for all
bills for service, reconnections, late fees, etc. for the residence.
   (C)   All commercial customers (restaurants, inns, etc.) are required to pay
a deposit to the town based on an estimated four months usage.
   (D)   Application of deposit: All deposits are refundable upon service
termination, if the account is paid in full. If monies are owed to the town,
such monies will be subtracted from the deposit and the remaining balance will
be refunded to the non-owner. If final payment owed exceeds the deposit amount,
the customer will be responsible for any balance due. No interest will be paid
on the deposit.
(Ord. passed 11-17-2015; Ord. passed 11-21-2017)

basis for service.
(Ord. passed 11-17-2015; Ord. passed 11-21-2017)
§ 50.09 FINAL BILLS.
   (A)   Once a customer requests termination of service out of his or her
name, a final bill is processed.
   (B)   The account of a customer, whose final bill remains delinquent after

presented to the Town Council that the account be written/charged off.
   (C)   Notes of all activity are entered in the customer service comments of
each delinquent account. A record will be maintained on any customer whose
account balance is written/charged off. The customer will be required to pay
that final bill should he or she ever apply for water/sewer service at any
address within the town.
   (D)   Overpayments on final bills are refunded to the customer. If a current
address can not be verified, the balance is to be “written/charged off.”
   (E)   Underpayments of less than $3 on final bills are written/charged off
60 days after the final bill is processed if payment is not received.

UTILITY BILL ADJUSTMENTS
§ 50.20 GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES.
   This subchapter establishes general guidelines and procedures to be used for
water/sewer customers who:
   (A)   Experience a water leak or break due to no reasonable fault of their
own; or
   (B)   Suspect there is inaccuracy with their water meter.
(Ord. passed 4-18-2017)
§ 50.21 LEAK ALLOWANCE.
   (A)   The town will consider an adjustment to a customer’s water utility
bill only if the customer develops a leak or break due to no negligence of the

   (B)   The town purchases its water from the City of Hendersonville and
follows the City of Hendersonville’s leak adjustment policy.
   (C)   Only one leak adjustment may be granted every 24 months per customer/
per account. The adjustment can only be provided if leak has been fixed or
there has been one normal billing cycle showing a leak is no longer occurring.
   (D)   Accounts determined to be eligible for a leak adjustment will follow a
standard formula for determining the amount of relief provided. The amount of
the adjustment will be the difference between the bill(s) in question and the
average consumption of the account. Average consumption shall be calculated
using three normal utility billing records. If there is insufficient usage
history, it may be necessary to wait until additional consumption history is
available before an adjustment can be made.
   (E)   The adjustment must be approved by the City of Hendersonville before
the town adjusts the customer’s bill.

the water meter is not working properly, the resident will receive a new meter
installed at no charge. If the meter is deemed 100% accurate, the resident will
be responsible for a $50 charge for the test, which will be added to his or her
next water bill; the meter will be re-installed.
(Ord. passed 4-18-2017)

WATER OPERATIONS
§ 51.01 GENERAL.
   This subchapter establishes general guidelines and procedures to be used in
the operation,
maintenance and extension of water services to residents of the town.
(Ord. passed - -2016)
§ 51.02 WATER SERVICE.
   (A)   Any new house or multi-family construction or commercial construction
in the town is required to connect to the town’s water system if water is
available to the edge of the property. Each individual residence will be
serviced by a single water meter (shared meters are not allowed on any new
single or multi-family construction).
   (B)   If a house (proposed or existing) does not have water service
available to the edge of the property, then the property owner(s) options are:
      (1)   To install a well on the property to service only the home and
property; and
      (2)    To pay to have the water line extended to the property. The
property owner will be responsible for the full cost of the extension of water
line. The extension must be engineered and constructed to town specifications
and be approved by both the town and state. The town, at its option, may elect
to increase the size of the line and pay for the difference of the cost of
material and labor or the line extension. If the line extension can make water
service available to other properties that do not have water reasonably
available, the town, at its sole option, can initiate a water line project and
assess property owners for the cost, as per G.S. § 160A-216. Note: Laurel Park
residents who have access to water service through the City of Hendersonville
will follow Hendersonville's procedures and policies for water service.
(Ord. passed - -2016)
§ 51.03 WATERLINE UPGRADES/RELOCATIONS.
   (A)   The town may replace or relocate water lines that are located on
private property by easement as needed or as necessary at no expense to
property owners.
   (B)   The town has the option to pay for a new service line connection to
existing houses affected by a water line upgrade or relocation.
(Ord. passed - -2016)
§ 51.04 TAP FEE AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FEE.
   (A)    The Town Council, by resolution, establishes both a tap fee and a
system development fee for connecting to the town’s water system. The tap fee
covers the costs associated with physically being connected to the town’s water
system. The system development fee assists in offsetting the capital costs
required in maintaining the water system. Such capital facilities include, but
are not limited to, water tanks, water lines and pump stations. The town will
not charge a system development fee for building additions requiring a new
water tap or for an additional meter for a yard hydrant.
   (B)   If a customer requests an existing meter be disconnected and removed,
completely terminating service, the current meter reinstallation fee must be
paid to reinstall the meter.
(Ord. passed - -2016)
§ 51.05 LIABILITY.
   (A)    The town assumes no liability for any damages done to private
property due to lack of water service. This includes, but is not limited to,
water outage from town supply tanks, removal of water meter for individual
customer resulting from lack of payment, customer’s request to shut off or pull
meter, natural disasters and the like.
(Ord. passed - -2016)
§ 51.06 ANNEXATION AND WATER LINES.
   (A)   (1)   If the town receives a voluntary annexation request for an area
that is not serviced by water, arrangements for water service and lines will be
agreed upon before the town will favorably consider the annexation.
      (2)   Any extension to the town’s water system must be approved by the
town.
   (B)   (1)   In areas where the City of Hendersonville provides water to the
general area, extensions will be made under Hendersonville’s policies.
      (2)   In annexed areas where service is not clearly defined, arrangements
will be made between the town and Hendersonville to determine who will provide
service.
   (C)   If the town annexes areas currently served by another water service
provider, the customers will remain on that water system and will maintain all
rights of that water service provider.
   (D)   If the town annexes an area where water is provided by a homeowners’
association or private company, the town will take over maintenance, customer
service and title to the water lines; provided:
      (1)   The town has been petitioned to take over water system;
      (2)   The system meets the current water standards of the town; or
      (3)   The town can charge necessary major improvements prior to
dedication and acceptance to the company and/or individuals with ownership of
system.
(Ord. passed - -2016)
WATER SHORTAGE RESPONSE AND CONSERVATION
§ 51.20 AUTHORITY; REGULATIONS.
   G.S. § 160A-312 grants municipalities the power to regulate certain
utilities. The town maintains and operates a purchase water system. The town
purchases water from the City of Hendersonville. In the event of a declaration
of water shortage, the town adheres to the water shortage response regulations
set forth by the City of Hendersonville. Any appeals by the town residents or
businesses for exception to the restrictions below will be coordinated with,
and approved by, the City of Hendersonville following the variances procedures
in §
51.30 of this chapter. The town may also declare a water shortage independent
of the city if water supply of the town water system is low or declining.
(Ord. passed 1-20-2009)
§ 51.21 PURPOSE OF SUBCHAPTER.
   A water shortage shall be deemed to exist when water demand by customers
connected to the City of Hendersonville owned water system or Laurel Park
system reaches the point where continued or increased demand may equal or
exceed the system supply and transmission capabilities. When demand results in
the condition where customers cannot be supplied with water to protect their
health and safety, then the demand must be substantially curtailed to relieve
the water shortage.
(Ord. passed 1-20-2009)
§ 51.22 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   Pursuant to the provisions of G.S. § 162-88 and this subchapter, service
shall be discontinued for willful disregard of this subchapter and a reconnect
fee may be imposed before restoration of service. In the event of continued
non-compliance of this subchapter, the removal of meter or connection of
service at the water main will be deemed proper, service will be discontinued
and all tap fees and deposits will be forfeited. The reconnection of service
shall be made only when all amounts due to the town, including new reconnect
fees and deposits, are paid in full.
(Ord. passed 1-20-2009)
§ 51.23 DECLARATION OF WATER SHORTAGE.
   Upon notification from the City of Hendersonville of a declared water
shortage, the Town Manager shall issue a declaration of the same level for the
Laurel Park water system and all customers. If conditions exist independent of
the Hendersonville water system to cause low or declining water supply in the
Laurel Park system, the Town Manager may declare a water shortage and issue a
stage 1 water shortage advisory. If warranted, the Town Manager may, in
consultation with the Town Council, declare a stage 2 or stage 3 advisory.
(Ord. passed 1-20-2009)
§ 51.24 STAGE I WATER SHORTAGE ADVISORY.
   (A)   Voluntary compliance. If a stage I water shortage condition is
declared, the following guidelines shall apply.
      (1)   A publicity campaign will be initiated using public media and
specialized methods to inform the public of an impending or existing water
shortage.
      (2)   Conservation measures will be encouraged and recommended for all
water customers.
   (B)   Water use guidelines. If a stage I water shortage advisory condition
is declared, the following guidelines shall apply and the public shall be
encouraged to adhere to the following:
      (1)   Limit car washing to the minimum;
      (2)   Limit lawn and garden watering to that which is necessary for
plants to survive;
      (3)   Do not wash down outside areas such as sidewalks, patios, decks,
parking lots, service bays or aprons and the like;
      (4)   Do not leave faucets running while shaving or rinsing dishes;
      (5)   Water shrubbery to the minimum required, reusing household water or
rain water stored in rain barrels when possible;
      (6)   Limit use of clothes washers and dishwashers and, when used,
operate fully loaded;
      (7)   Use showers for bathing rather than bathtubs, and limit showers to
no more than four minutes;
      (8)   Limit flushing of toilets by multiple usages;
      (9)   Use disposable and biodegradable dishes when possible;
      (10)   Use flow restrictive and water saving devices;
      (11)   Limit hours of operation of water-cooled air conditioners; and
      (12)   Delay new landscape work until the water shortage has ended.
(Ord. passed 1-20-2009) Penalty, see §
51.99
§ 51.25 STAGE II WATER SHORTAGE ALERT.
   (A)   Compliance. If the City of Hendersonville or Laurel Park issues a
declaration of a stage II water shortage alert, then it shall be unlawful for
any person to use or permit the use of water from the city/town water system
for any purpose set forth in this section until such time as the declaration of
water shortage has been rescinded. In exercising the authority for declaring a
water shortage alert consideration shall be given to water storage levels and
available sources of supply, available usable storage on hand, drawdown rates,
the projected supply capability, outlook for precipitation, daily water use
patterns and availability of water from other sources.
   (B)   Water use restrictions. If a stage I water shortage advisory is in
effect and usage is not reduced by 10% or more from normal levels, as
determined by authorized representative, then a stage II water shortage alert
may be proclaimed. In addition to the voluntary guidelines already in effect,
it shall be unlawful to use water supplied by the city/town water system in the
following manner:
      (1)   To water lawns, grass, shrubbery, trees and flowers; nurseries that
are registered with the city/town shall be allowed to operate provided they
reduce average consumption by 20% or more. Nurseries that fail to meet this
target will be subject to the same progressive penalties as other users who are
in violation of the terms of this subchapter;
      (2)   To water vegetable gardens in excess of one inch of water per week;
      (3)   To fill newly constructed swimming and/or wading pools or refill
swimming and/or wading pools which have been drained;
      (4)   To wash down outside areas such as streets, driveways, concrete
aprons, parking lots, office buildings, exteriors of existing or newly
constructed homes or apartments, sidewalks, decks or patios, or wash down
building structures or use water for other similar purposes;
      (5)   To use water from public or private fire hydrants for any purpose
other than fire suppression or other public emergency;
      (6)   To wash cars at commercial car washes, except for facilities that
are equipped to recycle water and are registered as such with the city/town or
commercial car washes that do not recycle, but which achieve a 20% reduction as
determined by the Hendersonville Utilities Director. Car washes that fail to
meet this target will be subject to the same progressive penalties as other
users who are in violation of the terms of this subchapter;
      (7)   To operate or induce water into any ornamental fountain, pool or
pond, or other structure making similar use of water, except for facilities
that recycle water through the process;
      (8)   To serve drinking water in restaurants, cafeterias or other food
establishments, except upon request;
      (9)   To operate water-cooled air conditioners or other equipment that
does not recycle cooling water, except when health and safety are adversely
affected; and
      (10)   To use water for any unnecessary purpose or to intentionally waste
water.
   (C)   Suspicion of violation. Whenever the town has reasonable cause to
believe that a person is violating any of the provisions of this section or any
policy or declaration and action plan adopted hereunder, the town shall
immediately notify that person of the violation by affixing a written notice of
violation (NOV) to the property where the violation occurred and/or personally
delivering or mailing such notice to the customer of record and to any other
person known to the town who is responsible for the violation or its
correction. Such notice shall describe the violation, order that it be
corrected, cured or abated immediately or within such specified time as the
Town Manager determines is reasonable under the circumstances, and warn that
more severe measures, such as civil penalties, criminal charges or termination
of water service may be brought, assessed or imposed. If the order is not

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 53.01 AUTHORITY.
   The town is authorized to adopt this chapter pursuant to state law,
including, but not limited to: Art. 14, § 5, of the Constitution of the state;
G.S. § 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the Environmental Management
Commission thereunder; Session Law 2004-163; G.S. Ch. 160A, §§ 174 and 185.
(Ord. passed 1-15-2008)
§ 53.02 FINDINGS.
   (A)   It is hereby determined that:
      (1)   Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of
local watersheds and increases storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding,
soil erosion, stream channel erosion, non-point and point source pollution, and
sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
      (2)   These changes in storm water runoff contribute to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are
harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and
      (3)   These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper
design and well-planned controls to manage storm water runoff from development
sites.
   (B)   Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (“Clean Water
Act”) and federal Phase II storm water rules promulgated under it, as well as
rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in
response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas,
including this jurisdiction, to adopt the minimum storm water controls such as
those included in this chapter.
   (C)   Therefore, the town establishes this set of water quality and quantity
regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control
of storm water runoff and discharge.
(Ord. passed 1-15-2008)
§ 53.03 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the
public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-
development storm water runoff and non-point and point source pollution
associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges
into municipal storm water systems. It has been determined that proper
management of construction-related and post- development storm water runoff
will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure,
safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare, and protect water and
aquatic resources.
   (B)   This chapter seeks to meet its general purpose through the following
specific objectives and means:
      (1)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect
the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
      (2)   Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in the post-development state as nearly as
practicable for the applicable design storm in order to reduce flooding, stream
bank erosion, non-point and point source pollution and increases in stream
temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic
habitats;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development storm water management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of storm water
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function, and use of structural storm water best management practices (BMPs)
that may be used to meet the minimum post-development storm water management
standards;
      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices,
such as the use of vegetated conveyances for storm water and the preservation
of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable;
      (6)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and non-structural storm water BMPs to ensure that
they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately and pose no
threat to public safety;
      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of storm water management plans, for the inspection of
approved projects and for the assurance of long-term maintenance;
      (8)   Controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate storm
water system; and
      (9)   Controlling erosion and sedimentation from construction activities.

by impervious or partially impervious surface including, but not limited to,
buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots and paths; and
recreation facilities such as tennis courts. BUILT-UPON AREA does not include a
wooden slatted deck, the water area of a swimming pool or pervious or partially
pervious paving materials to the extent that the paving material absorbs water
or allows water to infiltrate through the paving material.
   DEPARTMENT. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.
   DESIGN MANUAL. The storm water design manual approved for use in Phase II
jurisdictions by the Department for the proper implementation of the
requirements of the Federal Phase II storm water program. All references herein
to the DESIGN MANUAL are to the latest published edition or revision.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any land disturbing activity which adds to or changes the
amount of impervious or partially pervious cover on a land area or which
otherwise decreases the infiltration or precipitation into the soil, other than
rebuilding activity that does not qualify as redevelopment.
   DIVISION. The Division of Water Quality in the Department.
   HIGH-DENSITY PROJECT. Any project that exceeds the low density threshold for
dwelling units per acre and built-upon area.
   LARGER COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT OR SALE. Anywhere multiple separate and
distinct construction or land disturbing activities will occur under one plan.
A “plan” is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not
limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan
application, drawing, permit application, zoning request or computer design) or
physical demarcation (including, but not limited to, boundary signs, lot stakes
or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur on a
specific plot.
   LOW-DENSITY PROJECT. A project that has no more than two dwelling units per
acre or 24% built-upon area (BUA) for all residential and non-residential
development.
   ONE-YEAR, 24-HOUR STORM. The surface runoff resulting from a 24-hour
rainfall of intensity expected to be equaled or exceeded, on average, once in
12 months with duration of 24 hours.
   OWNER. The legal or beneficial owner of land, including, but not limited to,
a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, long-term or
commercial lessee or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights in
the property or having legal power of management and control of the property.
OWNER shall include long-term commercial tenants; management entities, such as
those charged with or engaged in the management of properties for profit; and
every person or entity having joint ownership of the property. A secured lender
not in possession of the property does not constitute an OWNER, unless the
secured lender is included within the meaning of OWNER under another
description in this definition, such as management entity.
   REDEVELOPMENT. Any rebuilding activity other than a rebuilding activity that
results in no net increase in built-upon area and provides equal or greater
storm water control than the previous development.
   STRUCTURAL BMP. A physical device designed to trap, settle out or filter
pollutants from storm water runoff; to alter or reduce storm water runoff
velocity, amount, timing or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-
development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of
these goals. STRUCTURAL BMP includes physical practices such as constructed
wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales and other methods
installed or created on real property. STRUCTURAL BMP is synonymous with
STRUCTURAL PRACTICE, STORM WATER CONTROL FACILITY, STORM WATER CONTROL
PRACTICE, STORM WATER TREATMENT PRACTICE, STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICE,
STORM WATER CONTROL MEASURES, STRUCTURAL STORM WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM and
similar terms used in this chapter.
   SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS. For the purposes of determining whether sufficient
progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following
construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan
shall occur: obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a
continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; or installation
and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the
construction and approval of a building foundation. SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS for

(Ord. passed 1-15-2008)
§ 53.56 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.
   (A)   In general.
      (1)   Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to
be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this chapter, and prior to issuance
of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP
pursuant to this chapter, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an
operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent
owners of the site, portions of the site and lots or parcels served by the
structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites or lots served by
the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary
responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement.
      (2)   The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or
owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP,
and shall state the terms, conditions and schedule of maintenance for the
structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the town a right of entry in the
event that the Storm Water Administrator has reason to believe it has become
necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair or reconstruct the structural
BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an
obligation on the town to assume responsibility for the structural BMP.
      (3)   The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the
Storm Water Administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on
the final plat and shall be recorded with the county’s Register of Deeds upon
final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be
given to the Storm Water Administrator within 14 days following its
recordation.
   (B)   Special requirement for homeowners and other associations. For all
structural BMPs required pursuant to this chapter and that are to be or are
owned and maintained by a homeowners’ association, property owners’ association
or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance agreement shall
include all of the following provisions:
      (1)   Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and
maintain the storm water control and management facilities;
      (2)   Establishment of an escrow account, which must be spent solely for
sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major
repair or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not
performing adequately or as intended or are not properly maintained, the town,
in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation and in such instances the town
shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent
by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative
replacement, major repair and reconstruction of the structural BMPs; provided
that, the town shall first consent to the expenditure;
      (3)   Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the
escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits,
whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an
amount equal to 15% of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs.
Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into
the escrow account within the first five years and the full amount shall be
deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural
BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of
the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the
escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced
in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking
fund budget;
      (4)   The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund
the escrow account may be varied by the town depending on the design and
materials of the storm water control and management facility;
      (5)   Granting to the town a right of entry to inspect, monitor,
maintain, repair and reconstruct structural BMPs;
      (6)   Allowing the town to recover from the association any and all costs
the town expends to maintain or repair the structural BMPs or to correct any
operational deficiencies. Failure to pay the town all of its expended costs,
after 45 days’ written notice, shall constitute a breach of the agreement. The
town shall thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association
and its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the
agreement against the property, or both, in case of a deficiency. Interest,
collection costs and attorney fees shall be added to the recovery;
      (7)   A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the town to
maintain or repair any structural BMPs and the town shall not be liable to any
person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs;
      (8)   A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish,
limit or restrict the right of the town to enforce any of its ordinances as
authorized by law; and
      (9)   A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the town for any
costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP, unless the
town has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for the BMP
and has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out that
maintenance.

§ 53.58 PERFORMANCE SECURITY FOR INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   May be required. The town may, at its discretion, require the
submittal of a performance security or bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of
credit or other acceptable legal arrangement prior to issuance of a permit in
order to ensure that the structural BMPs are:
      (1)   Installed by the permit holder as required by the approved storm
water management plan; and/or
      (2)   Maintained by the owner as required by the operation and
maintenance agreement.
   (B)   Amount.
      (1)   Installation. The amount of an installation performance security
shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs approved under the
permit, plus 25%.
      (2)   Maintenance. The amount of a maintenance performance security shall
be the present value of an annuity of perpetual duration based on a reasonable
estimate of the annual cost of inspection, operation and maintenance of the
BMPs approved under the permit, at a discount rate that reflects the
jurisdiction’s cost of borrowing minus a reasonable estimate of long term
inflation.
   (C)   Uses of performance security.
      (1)   Forfeiture provisions. The performance security shall contain
forfeiture provisions for failure, after proper notice, to complete work within
the time specified or to initiate or maintain any actions which may be required
of the applicant or owner in accordance with this chapter, approvals issued
pursuant to this chapter, or an operation and maintenance agreement established
pursuant to this chapter.
      (2)   Default. Upon default of the owner to construct, maintain, repair
and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the
applicable permit of operation and maintenance agreement, the Storm Water
Administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of the security to make
necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of
funds shall only be made after requesting the owner to comply with the permit
or maintenance agreement. In the event of a default triggering the use of
installation performance security, the town shall not return any of the unused
deposited cash funds or other security, which shall be retained for
maintenance.
      (3)   Costs in excess of performance security. If the town takes action
upon such failure by the applicant or owner, the town may collect from the
applicant or owner for the difference should the amount of the reasonable cost
of such action exceed the amount of the security held.
      (4)   Refund. Within 60 days of the final approval, the installation
performance security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, with the
exception of any amount attributable to the cost (plus 25%) of landscaping
installation and ongoing maintenance associated with the BMPs covered by the
security. Any such landscaping shall be inspected one year after installation
with replacement for compliance with the approved plans and specifications and,
if in compliance, the portion of the financial security attributable to
landscaping shall be released.
(Ord. passed 1-15-2008)
§ 53.59 NOTICE TO OWNERS.
   (A)   Deed recordation and indications on plat. The applicable operations
and maintenance agreement, conservation easement or dedication and acceptance
into public maintenance, whichever is applicable, pertaining to every
structural BMP shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with
the county’s Register of Deeds upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat
is recorded for the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement,
conservation easement or dedication and acceptance into public maintenance,
whichever is applicable, shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds so
as to appear in the chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under generally
accepted searching principles.

regulate the use of public streets, sidewalks, alleys and other public passages
within its corporate limits. A right-of-way encroachment agreement is required
for the installation of non-standard item(s) within a town-maintained street
right-of-way, sidewalk or parking lot by a private individual, group, business,
or homeowner's/business association. A non-standard item is one not installed
by the Town of Laurel Park Public Works Department in the exercise of its
duties and responsibilities, which conforms to standards in the NC DOT Manual
of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, the Town of Laurel Park Public Utilities
Department, or by utility franchise holders approved by the town. Town approval
of encroachments is necessary to ensure that there is no adverse impact to
public safety or future roadway or utility needs. Encroachment agreements are
required for all new and existing encroachments. If an encroachment agreement
is not obtained, the encroachment is subject to removal.

ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY
§ 151.35 STREET DEDICATIONS.
   All streets offered for dedication and accepted by the town must meet or
exceed the standards of the town for right-of-way width, base course, pavement,
shoulders, slope and storm drainage with erosion prevention and sedimentation
control. The acceptance, development and maintenance of all roads will be
earned out in accordance with the statutes of the state, the town’s policies
and priorities and within the fiscal limits established by the Town Council.
(Ord. passed 5-19-2009)
§ 151.36 DEFINITION.
   (A)   A RIGHT-OF-WAY is the entire width of land offered for dedication and
recorded as such in the county’s Land Records office. This width of land is
provided for a road, storm water drainage facilities and utilities. Once the
right-of-way is accepted by the town, it becomes town property.
   (B)   No person or firm shall place or erect any utility in, over or upon
any existing or proposed right-of-way of any town street, except in accordance
with town policies and procedures for accommodating utilities in street right-
of-way and until the town has given written approval of the location of such
utilities.
   (C)   All improvements to an accepted town right-of-way shall be in
accordance with this subchapter and any other ordinance or town policy.
(Ord. passed 5-19-2009) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.37 ACCEPTANCE OF ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   Road rights-of-way that have been offered for dedication and recorded may be
officially accepted by the town either by maintenance or by formal acceptance
of that right-of-way by the Town Council. All rights-of-way currently
maintained by the town are considered offered for dedication and accepted. Road
rights-of-way that have been offered for dedication, but not accepted by the
town, remain private. Pursuant to G.S. § 160A-374, the approval of a plat does
not constitute or effect the acceptance by the town or the public of the
offering for dedication of any street or other ground, easement, right-of-way,
public utility line or other public facility shown on the plat and shall not be
construed to do so.
(Ord. passed 5-19-2009)
§ 151.38 MAINTENANCE OF ACCEPTED RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   The town may maintain accepted rights-of-way in the condition in which they
currently exist or in an upgraded condition resulting from action taken under §
151.39 of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 5-19-2009)
§ 151.39 IMPROVEMENT OF ACCEPTED RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   In the event an accepted right-of-way is to be upgraded to meet regulations
of §
151.42 of this chapter, the town may contract for such work. In such case the
financing of such upgrading shall be determined following G.S. §§ 160A-216,
160A-217 and 160A-218.
(Ord. passed 5-19-2009)
§ 151.40 ACCEPTANCE OF EXISTING RIGHTS-OF-WAY OFFERED FOR DEDICATION.
   If the town is petitioned to accept an offer for dedication of an unaccepted
right-of-way, it may only be accepted by action of the Town Council. The town
and abutting property owners shall agree on financing and, if the right-of-way
is to be opened as a paved road, all provisions of §
151.42 of this chapter must be met.
(Ord. passed 5-19-2009)
§ 151.41 USE OF OFFERED FOR DEDICATION BUT UNACCEPTED RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   A property owner may use rights-of-way offered for dedication, but
unaccepted to provide access to his or her property, and may make reasonable
improvements to do so. In such cases, all costs are to be borne by the property
owner, builder or developer desiring access to the property; provided, no harm
is done to the abutting properties or the town. The town office must be
notified of any plans before any work is done in order that water line
locations can be checked, and provisions for soil erosion, sedimentation
control and traffic hazard prevention. Until these rights-of-way are accepted,
the town considers them as private rights-of-way; the town has no
responsibility for maintenance or for providing services on these rights-of-
way.
(Ord. passed 5-19-2009)
§ 151.42 PAVED ROAD AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   All paved roads must meet the state’s Department of Transportation and
the town’s specifications as a minimum. In some cases, more stringent
specifications may be set if so recommended by the Town Engineer.
   (B)   These specifications are generally:
      (1)   Six inches of compacted aggregate base course;
      (2)   Two inches of compacted bituminous concrete surface course of type
12 hot mix (pavement);

improvements to dedicated, opened rights-of-way or for dedication of unopened
rights-of-way;
      (4)   Pavement to be a minimum of 18 feet wide for any new subdivision or
development; and
      (5)   Maximum slope of 16% minimum established road right-of-way of 40

   (C)   In addition to the road surface itself:
      (1)   Adequate ditching and drainage with erosion prevention and
sedimentation control shall be included in all plans submitted for approval;
and
      (2)   The removal of encroaching and overhanging trees and vegetation is
required.
   (D)   The paver, owner, builder or developer shall guarantee the workmanship
against defects for a period of one year from the date of acceptance by the
town.

   (A)   Dead end rights-of-way on new plats shall have a cul-de-sac meeting
the state’s Department of Transportation, Division of Highways, Subdivision of
Roads, Minimum Construction Standards, dated January 1999, as amended, so that
maintenance, emergency and service vehicles can easily turn around.
   (B)   On dead end rights-of-way currently platted as unopened rights-of-way,
the same standards for maintenance, emergency and service vehicles will be
considered before the road is accepted. Portions of platted roads should not be
closed if this will result in a dead end right-of-way without turn-around
provisions.

right-of-way improvement meet town requirements before any contracts for the
work are let or before work can start. In some cases, complete engineering
drawings showing road location, slopes, drainage and the like will be required.
      (2)   The requirements for a particular request will be specified by the
town.
      (3)   The right-of-way must meet the provisions §
151.42 of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 5-19-2009)
§ 151.45 PROOF OF COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   Proof of compliance with regards to width, base and surface courses
can be obtained by:
      (1)   Having an inspector selected by and representing the town present
during the paving road preparation and paving operations, cost of the inspector
to be borne by those paying for the pavement; or

practice by a laboratory approved by the town with costs borne by those paying
for the pavement.
   (B)   Proof of compliance for slope requires certification by a state-
licensed surveyor or engineer.

§ 151.61 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   It shall be unlawful for anyone, other than employees or agents of the town
or town-authorized employees of utility companies authorized to operate in the
town in the course of their prescribed duties, to trim any trees in a street
right-of-way or on town property without first having obtained written
permission from the town. This permission must be obtained 14 days before such
trimming is to start unless a utility or public safety emergency exists.
(Ord. passed 10-20-2009) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.62 GENERAL GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The town may remove or cause to be removed any tree or part thereof
within the street right-of-way or on town property if such tree or part is in
an unsafe condition, or is injurious to any utilities or other public
improvements, or is infected with any injurious fungus, insect or other pest.
   (B)   The town shall have the right to cause the removal of any dead or
diseased trees on private property within the town when such trees constitute a
hazard to public safety along town rights-of-way or to town property. Hazards
shall be determined by the Chief of Police in consultation with the Town
Manager. Once a hazard has been determined, the Town Manager will notify the
owners of such trees in writing and the removal shall be done by such owners
within 60 days after the date of receipt of notice (if the hazard creates an
emergent public safety situation, such hazard shall be mitigated immediately).
In the event of failure of owners to comply with such provisions, the town
shall have the authority to remove such trees and if the expense is not paid, a
lien will be placed upon the land or premises where the nuisance occurred.
   (C)   The town will not permit topping of any trees on a road right-of-way
or on town property to prevent blocking a view or to open up a view for a
residence. The town will consider letting the trees be cut down and replaced
with other low-growing vegetation acceptable to the town; provided, the
stability of the soil will not be adversely affected by removing the root
structures of trees on a steep bank. Each case shall be considered on an
individual basis by the Town Manager. The Town Manager may request consultation
from experts regarding the effect of tree removal on road stability and the
type of vegetation that should be planted. The expense of removing the trees,
replacing with low growing vegetation and any consultation required shall be
borne by the property owner or owners who will benefit from the removal. Full
agreement in writing between the property owner and the Town Manager as to what
is to be done shall be reached before written permission is granted.

business, or homeowner's/business association. A non-standard item is one not
installed by the Public Works Department in the exercise of its duties and
responsibilities, which conforms to standards in the NCDOT Manual of Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, the Public Utilities Department, or by utility
franchise holders approved by the town. Town approval of encroachments is
necessary to ensure that there is no adverse impact to public safety or future
roadway or utility needs. Encroachment agreements are required for all new and
existing encroachments. If an encroachment agreement is not obtained, the
encroachment is subject to removal.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
    The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. Ch. 143, Art.
21, Part 6; Ch. 153A, Art. 6; Ch. 160A, Art. 8; and Ch. 160D, Art. 7, 9 and 11,
delegated to local governmental units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(Ord. passed 8-19-2008; Ord. passed 9-20-2022)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)    The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Laurel Park are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 8-19-2008; Ord. passed 9-20-2022)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 8-19-2008; Ord. passed 9-20-2022)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
    The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas
mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that
are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
   (G)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the National
Flood Insurance Program;
   (H)   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
   (I)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
   (J)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.

amended in 1980.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official determination issued by FEMA that
amends or revises an effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance
study. LETTERS OF MAP CHANGE include:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An official amendment, by letter,
to an effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA is based on
technical data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being
in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, special flood hazard
area boundaries and floodway delineations, and other planimetric features.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). A determination that
a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is,
therefore, no longer located within the special flood hazard area. In order to
qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in
accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations.
      (4)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP
requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood
hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or
Flood Insurance Study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built
documentation, a Letter of Map Revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the
effective FIRM.
   LIGHT DUTY TRUCK. Any motor vehicle rated at 8,500 pounds gross vehicular
weight rating or less which has a vehicular curb weight of 6,000 pounds or less
and which has a basic vehicle frontal area of 45 square feet or less as defined
in 40 CFR 86.082-2 and is:
      (1)   Designed primarily for purposes of transportation of property or is
a derivation of such a vehicle;
      (2)   Designed primarily for transportation of persons and has a capacity
of more than 12 persons; or
      (3)   Available with special features enabling off-street or off-highway
operation and use.

patio slab immediately next to the building, or deck support, after completion
of the building.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than
a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP REPOSITORY. The location of the official flood hazard data to be applied
for floodplain management. It is a central location in which flood data is
stored and managed; in North Carolina, FEMA has recognized that the application
of digital flood hazard data products have the same authority as hard copy
products. Therefore, the NCEM's Floodplain Mapping Program websites house
current and historical flood hazard data. For effective flood hazard data the
NC FRIS website (http://FRIS.NC.GOV/FRIS) is the map repository, and for
historical flood hazard data the FloodNC website (http://FLOODNC.GOV/NCFLOOD)
is the map repository.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, not including the land value and that of
any accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. MARKET VALUE may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced
on or after the effective date of the initial floodplain management regulations
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NON-CONVERSION AGREEMENT. A document stating that the owner will not convert
or alter what has been constructed and approved. Violation of the agreement is
considered a violation of the ordinance and, therefore, subject to the same
enforcement procedures and penalties. The agreement must be filed with the
recorded deed for the property. The agreement must show the clerk's or
recorder's stamps and/or notations that the filing has been completed.
   NON-ENCROACHMENT AREA. The channel of a river or other watercourse,

(Ord. passed 8-19-2008; Ord. passed 9-20-2022)
§ 152.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
    In all special flood hazard areas where BFE data has been provided, as set
forth in §§
152.07, or
152.42, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
152.40, are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE), as defined in §
152.05.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
152.05. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) in lieu of elevation provided
that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with §
152.45(B). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the floodproofing standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in
§
152.26(C), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation (RFPE), as defined in §
152.05.   
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is
above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) below.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)    Shall not be temperature-controlled or conditioned;
      (3)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      (4)   Shall include flood openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To
meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional
engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      (5)   Fill/grading.
         (a)   Fill is prohibited in the SFHA.
      (6)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record a non-
conversion agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring that the
area below the lowest floor shall not be improved, finished or otherwise
converted to habitable space. Laurel Park will have the right to inspect the
enclosed area. Laurel Park will conduct annual inspections. This agreement
shall be recorded with the Henderson County Register of Deeds and shall
transfer with the property in perpetuity.
      (7)   Release of restrictive covenant. If a property which is bound by a
non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed areas below BFE, then
the owner may request release of restrictive covenant after staff inspection
and submittal of confirming documentation.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally
modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the
addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
      (2)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure.
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one-year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with
the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the one-
year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this chapter.
Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement
does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions.
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Temporary placement.
         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no
permanently attached additions).
      (2)   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
   (G)   Temporary non-residential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures.
      (1)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be

elevation in conformance with the provisions of §
152.41(D)(4).
      (2)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet,
or that is a minimal investment of $3,000 or less and satisfies the criteria
outlined above is not required to meet the elevation or floodproofing standards
of §
152.41(B). Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other
accessory structures in accordance with §
152.26(C).
   (I)   Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within a
special flood hazard area, the following criteria shall be met:

      (2)   Above-ground tanks, elevated. Above-ground tanks in flood hazard
areas shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation
on a supporting structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement during conditions of the design flood. Tank-supporting
structures shall meet the foundation requirements of the applicable flood
hazard area;
      (3)   Above-ground tanks, not elevated. Above-ground tanks that do not
meet the elevation requirements of §
152.41(B) shall be permitted in flood hazard areas provided the tanks are
designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist all flood-related and
other loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of the design
flood and without release of contents in the floodwaters or infiltration by
floodwaters into the tanks. Tanks shall be designed, constructed, installed,

152.07 and utilized in implementing this chapter.
      (4)   When BFE data is not available from a federal, state, or other
source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated or floodproofed
(nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as
defined in §
152.05. All other applicable provisions of §
152.41 shall also apply.
(Ord. passed 8-19-2008; Ord. passed 9-20-2022)
§ 152.43 STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS WITH BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS BUT
WITHOUT ESTABLISHED FLOODWAYS OR NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
    Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available
from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are
identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report,
the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   Standards of §§
152.40 and
152.41; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
(Ord. passed 8-19-2008; Ord. passed 9-20-2022)
§ 152.44 FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
    Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within
the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.07. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards
outlined in §§
152.40 and
152.41, shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
      (1)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result
in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain
Administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
      (2)   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by
FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six months
of completion of the proposed encroachment.
   (B)   If §
152.44(A) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Manufactured homes may be permitted provided the following provisions
are met:
      (1)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
152.41(C); and
      (2)   The encroachment standards of §
152.44(A).
(Ord. passed 8-19-2008; Ord. passed 9-20-2022)
§ 152.45 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO).
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to §§
152.40 and
152.41, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
   (A)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of four feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
   (B)   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed
to the same level as required in §
152.45(A) so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required in accordance with §§
152.26(C) and
152.41(B).
   (C)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes,
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(Ord. passed 9-20-2022)
§ 152.46 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AH).
   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas are subject
to inundation by 1%-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding)
where average depths are one to three feet. Base flood elevations are derived
from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone. In addition to §§
152.40 and
152.41, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
   (A)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes,
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(Ord. passed 9-20-2022)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall
constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. § 143-215.58. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned for not more
than 30 days, or both. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Laurel Park from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.
