   (A)   The uncontrolled growth of noxious weeds, early successional natural

   (G)   Any condition detrimental to the public health which violates the

(Prior Code, § 1401)
§ 92.02 COMPLAINT AND INVESTIGATION.
   The Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee, upon notice from any person
of the existence of any of the conditions described in §
92.01, shall cause to be made by the appropriate town employee such
investigation as may be necessary to determine whether, in fact, a condition or
conditions described in §
92.01 exists. For purposes of this section, the Town Manager or the Town
Manager’s designee will select the appropriate town employee to conduct the
investigation.
(Prior Code, § 1402)
§ 92.03 NOTICE TO ABATE NUISANCE.
   Upon a determination that the conditions constituting a public nuisance
exist, the town shall notify in writing the property owner and, if different,
the occupant or person in possession of the premises in question of the
conditions constituting the public nuisance and shall order the prompt
abatement thereof within 15 days from the receipt of the written notice. The
notice shall include the procedure to appeal the decision.
(Prior Code, § 1403)
§ 92.04 SERVICE OF NOTICE.
   (A)   Notices issued by the Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee
shall be served either personally upon the owner or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the last known address of the property owner and, if
different, the occupant or person in possession of the premises. In cases where
all owners cannot be identified or served after due diligence to do so has been
exercised by the Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee, then notice (and
an order) served on any one owner will constitute notice (and an order) to all
owners.
   (B)   If the whereabouts of all owners are unknown and the same cannot be
ascertained by the Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee in the exercise
of reasonable diligence or where none of the owners can be served in the
exercise of reasonable diligence by either personal service or by mail, the
Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee shall make an affidavit to that
effect and the notice and order may be served by publishing the same
(identifying the property location and all known owners) two times, with one
publication each week for two consecutive weeks, in a newspaper of general
circulation in the town. Service shall be complete upon the second such
publication and the person or persons served shall have 15 days to abate the

notice and order shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises
affected by the notice.
(Prior Code, § 1404)
§ 92.05 ANNUAL NOTICE TO CHRONIC VIOLATORS.
   The Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee may notify a chronic
violator of this subchapter that, if the violator’s property is found to be in
violation of this subchapter, the town shall, without further notice in the
calendar year in which notice is given, take action to remedy the violation,
and the expense of the action shall become a lien upon the property and shall
be collected as unpaid taxes. The notice shall be sent by certified mail. A
chronic violator is a person who owns property whereupon in the previous
calendar year the town gave notice of violation at least three times under any
provision of this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 1405)
§ 92.06 APPEAL OF DESIGNATION OF A NUISANCE.
   (A)   Any person who has been ordered to abate a public nuisance shall have
the right to appeal such order within five days of service of said notice and
order as provided in this subchapter by giving written notice of appeal to the
Town Manager by filing said notice of appeal with the Town Clerk. The Town
Manager will then schedule a hearing within five days after receipt of the
notice of appeal and inform the property owner and, if different, the occupant
or person in possession of the premises in question, as well as any other
citizen who has filed a complaint resulting in the investigation, of the date,
time, and place of the hearing. The rules of evidence will not apply to the
hearing. Anyone with relevant information may be allowed to give testimony. The
Town Manager will issue a written decision to the parties involved no later
than five days after the hearing.
   (B)   The property owner and, if different, the occupant or person in
possession of the premises in question may then appeal the decision to the Town
Council by filing a notice of appeal with the Town Clerk within five days of
the date the Town Manager’s decision is personally delivered to the person or
the date the notice is mailed by first class mail to said person’s last known
address. The Town Council will hold a hearing at the first regularly scheduled
Council meeting which is at least three days after receiving the notice of
appeal or at any earlier meeting at least at three days after receiving the
notice of appeal which is properly convened as allowed by G.S. Ch. 143, Art.
33C, provided the property owner and, if different, the occupant or person in
possession of the premises are given actual notice of date and time of the
meeting in person or by telephone at least three days in advance of the meeting
or by notice mailed by first class mail at least seven days in advance of the
meeting. The Town Clerk will send notice as required herein of the date, time,
and place of the hearing as soon as available to the property owner and, if
different, the occupant or person in possession of the premises. To the extent
practicable, notice shall also be provided in like manner to any other citizen
who has filed a complaint resulting in the investigation.
   (C)   The Town Council may consider all reliable evidence and shall not be
bound by the strict rules of evidence applicable to courts of law, but all
witnesses shall be sworn. The respondent may be represented by counsel and may
present evidence. All parties may cross examine adverse witnesses. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the Town Council shall make findings of fact, state
its conclusions, and enter an appropriate order. The Town Council’s order shall
be reduced to writing and a copy sent by first class mail to the last known
address of, or delivered personally to, the property owner and, if different,
the occupant or person in possession of the premises within three days of the
hearing.
(Prior Code, § 1406)
§ 92.07 REMOVAL BY TOWN.
   (A)   If the person having been ordered to abate the public nuisance fails,
neglects, or refuses to abate or remove the condition constituting the nuisance
within 15 days from receipt of the order (or within 15 days after said order
has been affirmed if an appeal was taken), then the Town Manager or the Town
Manager’s designee shall cause the condition to be removed or otherwise
remedied by:
      (1)   Having employees of the town go upon the premises and remove or
otherwise abate the nuisance under the supervision of an officer or employee
designated by the town; or
      (2)   Contracting with an individual or firm to remove or abate the same
on behalf of the town.
   (B)   Any person who has been ordered to abate a public nuisance may, within
the time allowed by the order, request in writing that the town remove the
public nuisance or cause the same to be removed, the cost of which shall be
paid by the person making the request.
(Prior Code, § 1407)
§ 92.08 COST INCURRED BY OWNER.
   The actual cost incurred by the town in removing or otherwise remedying a
public nuisance shall be charged jointly and severally to the owner of the lot
or parcel of land and, if different, to the occupant or person in possession of
the premises, and it shall be the duty of the town to mail a statement of the
charges to the owner with instructions that the charges are due and payable
within 30 days from the receipt thereof.
(Prior Code, § 1408)
§ 92.09 CHARGES BECOME A LIEN.
   (A)   In the event charges for the removal or abatement of a public nuisance
are not paid within 30 days after the receipt of a statement of the charges,
the expense of the action shall be paid by the person in default as set out in
G.S. § 160A-193(a). If the expense is not paid, it is a lien on the land or
premises where the public nuisance occurred. A lien established pursuant to
this division (A) shall have the same priority and be collected as unpaid ad
valorem taxes.
   (B)   As set out in G.S. § 160A-193(b), the expense of any action under this
subchapter is also a lien on any other real property owned by the person in
default within the town limits or within one mile of the town limits, except
for the person’s primary residence. A lien established pursuant to this
division (B) is inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a money
judgment. This division (B) shall not apply if the person in default can show
that the nuisance was created solely by the actions of another.
(Prior Code, § 1409)
§ 92.10 PROCEDURE IS IN ADDITION TO OTHER AUTHORIZED PROCEDURES.
   The procedure set forth in §§
92.01 through
92.11 shall be in addition to any other remedies that may now or hereafter
exist under law for the abatement of public nuisances. Nothing herein shall be
read to limit the town authority under G.S. § 160A-193 to summarily remove,
abate, or remedy everything in the city limits, or within one mile thereof,
that is dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or safety; provided,
however, that the procedures set out in §§
92.01 through
92.11 shall be used at all times unless the Town Manager or the Town Manager’s
designee makes a written finding that the condition in question poses an
imminent threat to the safety of persons and property such that the procedures
set forth in §§
92.01 through
92.11, if followed, unreasonably delay necessary action to remove, abate, or
remedy the condition.
(Prior Code, § 1410)
§ 92.11 APPLICATION.
   While dwellings may constitute a public nuisance, the town will follow the
procedures in G.S. § 160A-443 as stated in
Chapter 150 whenever a dwelling is found to create a public nuisance. Whenever
a nonresidential structure is found to be a nuisance, the town will abide by
the procedures set forth in G.S. § 160A-439 as stated in
Chapter 151.

§ 93.05 JUNKED VEHICLES; REMOVAL.
   (A)   Unless subject to an exception from the requirements of this chapter,
no person or entity shall allow a junked motor vehicle to remain on premises
owned or occupied by said person or entity.
   (B)   Any junked motor vehicle found to be in violation of this chapter may
be removed to a storage or garage area, but no such vehicle shall be removed
from private property without the written request of the owner, lessee, or
occupant of the premises unless the Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee
finds in writing that the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh
the burdens imposed on the private property owner. Such finding by the Town
Manager or the Town Manager’s designee shall be based on a balancing of the
monetary loss of the apparent owner against the corresponding gain to the
public by promoting or enhancing community, neighborhood, or area appearance.
The following, among other relevant factors, may be considered by the Town
Manager or the Town Manager’s designee:
      (1)   Protection of property values;
      (2)   Promotion of tourism and other economic development opportunities;
      (3)   Indirect protection of public health and safety;

      (5)   Promotion of the comfort, happiness, and emotional stability of
area residents.

requesting the removal of a junked motor vehicle from private property to
indemnify the town against any loss, expense, or liability incurred because of

the owner as required by G.S. § 20-219.11(a) and (b) as the same may be from
time to time amended.
   (E)   The owner of a junked motor vehicle whose junked motor vehicle has
been removed or disposed as provided for in this section shall have a right to
a hearing prior to such removal or disposal as set out in §
93.10.
   (F)   The removal or disposal under this section of any motor vehicle that
is used on a regular basis for business or personal use is prohibited.
   (G)   As set out in G.S. § 160A-303.2(a4), any person who removes a vehicle
pursuant to this section shall not be held liable for damages for the removal
of the vehicle to the owner, lienholder, or other person legally entitled to
the possession of the vehicle removed; however, any person who intentionally or
negligently damages a vehicle in the removal of such vehicle, or intentionally
inflicts injury upon any person in the removal of such vehicle, may be held
liable for damages.

10.99
§ 93.06 ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLES AND JUNKED MOTOR VEHICLES; PRE-TOWING.
   (A)   Except as set forth herein, an abandoned motor vehicle or junked motor
vehicle which is to be removed shall be towed only after notice to the last
known registered owner of the vehicle. The notice required hereunder shall, if
feasible, be given by telephone. Whether or not the owner is reached by
telephone, notice shall be mailed to the last known address of the owner unless
he or she or his or her agent waives this notice in writing. The person who
mails the notice(s) shall retain a written record to show the name(s) and
address(es) to which mailed, and the date mailed. If the names and addresses
cannot be ascertained, notice shall be given by affixing it on the windshield
or some other conspicuous place on the vehicle. The notice shall state that the
vehicle will be removed by the town on a specified date, no sooner than seven
days after the notice is affixed or mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by the
owner or legal possessor prior to that time.
   (B)   With respect to abandoned motor vehicles on private property and
junked motor vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if the
registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the vehicle,
but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is an abandoned motor
vehicle or, in the case of a junked motor vehicle, that the aesthetic benefits
of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, the appeal shall be made to the
Town Council in writing, heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Town Council, and further proceedings to remove the vehicle shall be stayed
until the appeal is heard and decided.
(Prior Code, § 1306)
§ 93.07 EXCEPTIONS TO PRIOR NOTICE REQUIREMENT.
   The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an abandoned
motor vehicle may, as determined by the Town Manager or the Town Manager’s
designee pursuant to written findings maintained with the public records
related to the towing, be omitted in those circumstances where the vehicle
impedes the flow of traffic or otherwise jeopardizes the public welfare so that
immediate towing is necessary.
(Prior Code, § 1307)
§ 93.08 REMOVAL OF VEHICLES; POST-TOWING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Any abandoned motor vehicle or junked motor vehicle which has been
ordered removed following the procedures set out in this chapter shall be
removed to a storage garage or area by the tow truck operator or towing
business contracting to perform services for the town. Whenever a vehicle is
removed, the Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee shall immediately
notify in writing the last known registered owner of the vehicle and, in the
case of a junked motor vehicle, the owner, lessee, or occupant of the real
property upon which the vehicle was located prior to towing if the names and
mailing addresses of the owner, lessee, or occupant can be ascertained in the
exercise of reasonable diligence. The written notice shall include the
following:
      (1)   A description of the vehicle;
      (2)   The place where the vehicle is stored;
      (3)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;
      (4)   The procedure the owner must follow to have the vehicle returned to
him or her; and
      (5)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable cause
hearing on the towing.
   (B)   If the vehicle has a North Carolina registration plate or
registration, notice shall be given to the owner within 24 hours; if the
vehicle is not registered in the state, notice shall be given to the owner
within 72 hours. This notice shall, if feasible, be given by telephone. Whether
or not the owner is reached by telephone, notice shall be mailed to his or her
last known address unless he or she or his or her agent waives this notice in
writing. In the case of vehicles towed from private property, notice shall be
given in like manner and in like time to the owner, lessee, or occupant of the
real property upon which the vehicle was located prior to towing if the names
and mailing addresses of the owner, lessee, or occupant can be ascertained in
the exercise of reasonable diligence.
   (C)   Whenever a vehicle with neither a valid registration plate nor
registration is towed hereunder, the Town Manager or the Town Manager’s
designee shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the vehicle
identification number, to determine the last known registered owner of the
vehicle and to notify him or her of the information listed in division (A)
above. Unless the owner has otherwise been given notice, it is presumed that
the authorizing person has not made reasonable efforts, as required under this
division (C), unless notice that the vehicle would be towed was posted on the
windshield or some other conspicuous place at least seven days before the
towing actually occurred; except, no pre-towing notice need be given if the
vehicle impeded the flow of traffic or otherwise jeopardized the public welfare
so that immediate towing was necessary.
(Prior Code, § 1308)
§ 93.09 RIGHT TO PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING.
   (A)   As set out in G.S. § 20-219.11, the owner or any other person entitled
to claim possession of the vehicle may request in writing a hearing to
determine if probable cause existed for the towing. The request shall be filed
with a magistrate in the county. If there is more than one magistrate’s office
in the county, the request may be filed with the magistrate in the warrant-
issuing office in the county seat or in any other office designated to receive
requests by the chief district court judge. The magistrate shall set the
hearing within 72 hours of his or her receiving the request. The owner, the
person who requested the hearing if someone other than the owner, the tower,
and the Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee who authorized the towing
shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing.
   (B)   The owner, the tower, the Town Manager, or the Town Manager’s designee
who authorized the towing, and any other interested parties may present
evidence at the hearing. The Town Manager or the Town Manager’s designee who
authorized the towing and the tower may submit an affidavit in lieu of
appearing personally, but the affidavit does not preclude that person from also
testifying.
   (C)   The only issue at this hearing is whether or not probable cause
existed for the towing. If the magistrate finds that probable cause did exist,
the tower’s lien continues. If the magistrate finds that probable cause did not
exist, the tower’s lien is extinguished.
   (D)   Any aggrieved party may appeal the magistrate’s decision to district
court.
(Prior Code, § 1309)
§ 93.10 REDEMPTION OF VEHICLES DURING PROCEEDINGS.
   At any stage in the proceedings after the vehicle has been towed, including
before the probable cause hearing, the owner may obtain possession of his or
her vehicle by:
   (A)   Paying the towing fee; or
   (B)   Posting a bond for double the amount of the towing fee.
(Prior Code, § 1310)
§ 93.11 SALE AND DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED VEHICLES.
   The town may seek to enforce its lien or the owner may seek to contest the
lien pursuant to G.S. Ch. 44A.
(Prior Code, § 1311)
§ 93.12 REMOVAL OF VEHICLES FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   As a general policy, the town will not remove a vehicle from private
property if the owner, occupant, or lessee of the property could have the
vehicle removed under applicable state law procedures. In no case will a
vehicle be removed by the town from private property without a written request
of the owner, occupant, or lessee, except in those cases where a vehicle is a
junked motor vehicle which has been ordered removed by the Town Manager or the
Town Manager’s designee.
(Prior Code, § 1312)
§ 93.13 PROTECTION AGAINST CRIMINAL/CIVIL LIABILITY.
   No person shall be held to answer in any civil or criminal action to any
owner or other person legally entitled to the possession of any abandoned motor
vehicle or junked motor vehicle, for disposing of the vehicle as provided in
this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 1313)
§ 93.14 EXCEPTIONS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall apply to any vehicle:
   (A)   Which is located in a bona fide “automobile graveyard” or “junkyard”
as defined in G.S. § 136-143, in accordance with the Junkyard Control Act,
being G.S. §§ 136-141 et seq.;

lawful place and manner by the town; or
   (E)   Which is covered by a bona fide car cover and is located to the rear
of a residence within the applicable setback limits for an accessory structure
as specified in the town’s land development code; provided, however, that no
more than two such vehicles may be maintained on any one property.
(Prior Code, § 1314)
§ 93.15 UNLAWFUL REMOVAL OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLES.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or attempt to remove from any
storage facility designated by the town any vehicle which has been impounded
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter unless and until all towing and
impoundment fees which are due, or bond in lieu of the fees, have been paid.

§ 95.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Excessive and unnecessary noise endangers the physical and emotional
health and welfare of the people, interferes with legitimate business and
recreational activity, depresses property values, offends the senses, creates
public nuisances, and in other respects reduces the quality of life.
   (B)   A substantial body of science and technology exists by which excessive
sound may be measured and substantially abated. Because excessive and
unnecessary noise may jeopardize human health or welfare or substantially
degrade the quality of life, it is the purpose of this chapter to prevent,
prohibit and provide for the regulation and abatement of excessive and
unnecessary noise which may injure the physical and emotional health or welfare
of the town's citizens or degrade the quality of life.

   (C)   Except as allowed in division (D) below, no person shall operate or
cause to be operated any source of sound in such a manner as to create a sound
level which at its peak exceeds the limits set forth for the use occupancy
categories in Table 1 when measured at or beyond the property line of the
property from which the sound originates. For purposes of measurement, the back
of the curb, the outside edges of driveways, fences, hedges or other physical
features commonly associated with property boundaries are presumed to be at a
point which is at or beyond the property line. In all cases the maximum sound
level permitted by use occupancy shall be determined on the basis of the use
occupancy of the property from which the sound originates and not by the use

(Prior Code, § 1611) Penalty, see §
150.99
§ 150.12 RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS UNFIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION.
   (A)   The public officer shall determine that a residential dwelling is

   (B)   Irrespective of division (A) above, a residential dwelling or dwelling
unit shall be construed by the public officer to be unfit for human habitation
if more than three separate types of violations of any of the minimum housing
code standards set forth in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 1612)
§ 150.13 POWERS AND DUTIES OF PUBLIC OFFICER.
   The public officer shall have the following powers and duties:
   (A)   To investigate the dwelling conditions and to inspect dwellings and
dwelling units located in the town in order to determine which dwellings and
dwelling units are unfit for human habitation, and for the purpose of carrying
out the objectives of this chapter with respect to such dwellings and dwelling
units;
   (B)   To take such action, together with other appropriate departments and
agencies, public and private, as may be necessary to affect rehabilitation of
housing which is deteriorated;
   (C)   To keep a record of the results of inspections made under this chapter
and an inventory of those dwellings that do not meet the minimum standards of
fitness herein prescribed;
   (D)   To administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive
evidence;
   (E)   To enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations and
inspections; provided, the entries shall be made in accordance with §
150.14 and state law, and shall be made in such manner as will cause the least
possible inconvenience to the persons in possession;
   (F)   To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents, and employees
as he or she deems necessary to assist in carrying out the purposes of this
chapter, and to delegate any of his or her functions and powers to other
officers, agents, and employees; and
   (G)   To perform such other duties as may be prescribed herein or by the
Town Council.
(Prior Code, § 1613)
§ 150.14 INSPECTIONS; DUTY OF OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS.
   (A)   For the purpose of making inspections, the public officer and other
appropriate town employees working with or under the direction of the public
officer are authorized to enter, examine, and survey at all reasonable times
all dwellings, dwelling units, rooming houses, rooming units, and the premises
associated therewith in accordance with division (C) below, or upon the consent
of the owner of the premises, or when the public officer determines that an
emergency exists that poses an immediate threat to the health or safety of the
public. No owner or occupant of any dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, or
rooming unit or the person in charge thereof shall interfere with an inspection
conducted in accordance with this section.
   (B)   Every occupant of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, or rooming
unit shall give the owner thereof, or his or her agent or employee, access to
any part of the dwelling or dwelling unit and its premises at all reasonable
times for the purpose of making the repairs or alterations as are necessary to
effect compliance with the provisions of this chapter or with any lawful order
issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   When permission to inspect a dwelling or its premises is denied, the
public officer must obtain a warrant to inspect. G.S. § 15-27.2 provides for
the issuance of warrants for the conduct of inspections authorized by law. The
state’s court of appeals, in In Re Dwelling, 24 N.C. App. 17 (1974), has held
that the consent of the tenant-occupant who was in actual possession and
control of the premises was sufficient to authorize an inspection without a
warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the owner had objected to the
warrantless search. When faced with a situation where permission to inspect is
denied, the public officer shall seek the advice of the Town Attorney.
(Prior Code, § 1614)
§ 150.15 PROCEDURE FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is
filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five
residents of the town charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for
human habitation, or whenever it appears to the public officer, (on his or her
own motion), that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation,
the Public Office shall, if his or her preliminary investigation discloses a
basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and
parties in interest in such dwellings and dwelling units a complaint stating
the charges in that respect and containing a notice that a hearing will be held
before the public officer (or his or her designated agent) at a place within
the town limits, fixed, not less than ten days nor more than 30 days after the
serving of the complaint. The owner and parties in interest shall have the
right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise,
and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. The rules of
evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in
hearings before the public officer. Any person desiring to do so may attend the
hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard.
   (B)   Procedure after hearing. After such notice and hearing, the public
officer shall state in writing his or her determination whether the dwelling or
dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is
deteriorated or dilapidated.
      (1)   If the public officer determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit
is deteriorated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact
in support of the determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon
the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter,
or improve the dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards
of fitness established by this chapter within a specified period of time, not
to exceed 90 days. The order may also direct and require the owner to vacate
and close the dwelling or dwelling unit until the repairs, alterations, and
improvements have been made; provided, however, no order that the property be
vacated and closed shall be issued unless the public officer finds that
continued occupancy during the time allowed for repair will present a
significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of the
necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current state of the
property; and any additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors
under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. The
order issued hereunder shall state that failure to make timely repairs as
directed in the order shall make the dwelling unit subject to the issuance of
an unfit order as set out herein below and as set out in G.S. § 160D-1203(4).
      (2)   If the public officer determines that the dwelling is dilapidated,
he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact to support the
determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an
order directing and requiring the owner to remove or demolish such dwelling or
dwelling unit within a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days. However,
notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the dwelling is located in a
historic district of the town and the Town Council determines, after a public
hearing as provided by ordinance, that the dwelling is of particular
significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, and the
dwelling has not been condemned as unsafe, the order may require that the
dwelling be vacated and closed consistent with G.S. § 160D-949.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or
improve or to vacate and close the dwelling, the public officer may cause the
dwelling to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed. The
public officer may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling so
closed a placard with the following words: “This building is unfit for human
habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is
prohibited and unlawful.” Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a
Class 1 misdemeanor as set forth in G.S. § 160D-1203(4). The duties of the
public officer set forth in this division (C)(1) shall not be exercised until
the governing body shall have by ordinance ordered the public officer to
proceed to effectuate the purpose of this chapter with respect to the
particular property or properties which the public officer shall have found to
be unfit for human habitation and which property or properties shall be
described in the ordinance. The ordinance shall be recorded in the office of
the County Register of Deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property
owner in the grantor index.
      (2)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish
the dwelling, the public officer may cause such dwelling to be removed or
demolished. The duties of the public officer set forth in this division (C)(2)
shall not be exercised until the governing body shall have by ordinance ordered
the public officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this chapter with
respect to the particular property or properties which the public officer shall
have found to be unfit for human habitation and which property or properties
shall be described in the ordinance. No such ordinance shall be adopted to
require demolition of a dwelling until the owner has first been given a
reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with the housing code. This
chapter shall be recorded in the office of the County Register of Deeds and
shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index.
   (D)   Town Board of Adjustment to hear appeals. All appeals, which may be
taken from decisions or orders of the public officer pursuant to division (E)
below, shall be heard and determined by the Town Board of Adjustment. As the
appeals body, the Board of Adjustment shall have the power to fix the times and
places of its meetings to adopt necessary rules of procedure and any other
rules and regulations which may be necessary for the proper discharge of its
duties. The Board of Adjustment shall perform the duties prescribed by division
(E) below, and shall keep an accurate journal of all its proceedings.
   (E)   Appeals from orders of public officer. An appeal from any decision or
order of the public officer may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby or by
an officer, board, or commission of the town. Any appeal from the public
officer shall be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or
service of the order, and shall be taken by filing with the public officer and
with the Board of Adjustment in care of the Town Clerk a notice of appeal,
which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing
of any notice of appeal, the public officer shall forthwith transmit to the
Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the
decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the
public officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act,
his or her decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When an
appeal is from a decision of the public officer requiring the person aggrieved
to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement
until the hearing by the Board of Adjustment, unless the public officer
certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal is filed with
him or her, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of
which shall be furnished the appellant) a suspension of his or her requirement
would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the requirement
shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for
due cause shown upon not less than one day’s written notice to the public
officer, by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of record upon petition made
pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1208 and this division (E).
   (F)   Petition to superior court. Any person aggrieved by an order issued by
the public officer or a decision rendered by the Board of Adjustment may
petition the superior court for an injunction restraining the public officer
from carrying out the order or decision and the court may, upon such petition
issue a temporary injunction restraining the Public Office pending a final
disposition of the cause. The petition shall be filed within 30 days after the
issuance of the order or rendering of the decision. The rights of a person so
aggrieved are governed by G.S. § 160D-1208.
   (G)   Dwelling constructed, repaired in violation of this chapter. In case
any dwelling is erected, constructed, altered, repaired, converted, maintained,
or used in violation of this chapter or any valid order or decision of the
public officer or Board of Adjustment made pursuant to this chapter, the public
officer or Board of Adjustment may institute any appropriate action or
proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or use; to restrain, correct, or abate such violation; to prevent
the occupancy of the dwelling; or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, or use
in or about the premises of the dwelling.

Statutory reference:
   Remedies, see G.S. § 160D-1208
§ 150.16 METHODS OF SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)   Complaints issued by the public officer or orders issued by a hearing
officer under this chapter shall be served upon persons either personally or by
registered or certified mail. When service is made by registered or certified
mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also be sent by regular mail.
Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is
unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post office
within ten days after the mailing. If regular mail is used, a notice of the
pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises
affected.
   (B)   If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the public officer in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, or, if the owners are known but have refused to accept
service by registered or certified mail, and the public officer shall make an
affidavit to that effect, then the serving of such complaint or order upon such
owners or other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having
general circulation in the town at least once no later than the time at which
personal service would be required under the provisions of this chapter. When
service is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be
posted in a conspicuous place on the premises thereby affected.
(Prior Code, § 1616)
§ 150.17 COSTS A LIEN ON PREMISES.
   (A)   The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations, or improvements, or
vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the public officer shall be a
lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred, which lien
shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected as the lien for
special assessment provided in G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 10.
   (B)   The amount of the costs is also a lien on any other real property of
the owner located within the corporate limits of the town or within one mile
thereof, except for the owner’s primary residence. The additional lien provided
in this division (B) is inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a
money judgment.
   (C)   If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the public officer, he or
she shall sell the materials of the dwelling and any personal property,
fixtures, or appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall
credit the proceeds of the sale against the costs of the removal or demolition
and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the
public officer, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall
be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final
order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
impair or limit in any way the power of the town to define and declare
nuisances and to cause the removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or
otherwise.
(Prior Code, § 1617)
§ 150.18 LIS PENDENS.
   (A)   Pursuant to the authority granted in G.S. § 1-120.2, upon the issuance
of a complaint and notice of hearing or order pursuant thereto (under the
provisions of this chapter), the issuing officer may file in the office of the
County Clerk of superior court a notice of lis pendens, with a copy of the
complaint and notice of hearing attached thereto.
   (B)   From the date and time of the proper indexing of the same by the Clerk
of superior court in accordance with the state’s general statutes, the
complaint and notice of hearing or order (and all further orders entered in
said proceeding) shall be binding upon the successors and/or assigns of the
owners and parties in interest in the dwelling. A copy of the notice of lis
pendens shall be served upon the owners and parties in interest in the dwelling
at the time of filing in accordance with applicable law.
   (C)   The notice of lis pendens shall remain in full force and effect until
cancelled, which is authorized to be done by the Town Manager, Town Attorney,
and the respective issuing officer (or his or her successor in office as such),
upon full compliance with the order by the owner and upon the payment in full
of any lien of the town by reason of actions of the town pursuant to said
order; said persons are further authorized to subordinate the notice of lis
pendens to a deed of trust thereafter upon reasonable assurances by the owner
or the lending party that the loan proceeds will be escrowed or otherwise used
in the repairs or other expenses incurred in fulfilling the matters to be done
by the property owner to comply with the matters alleged in the complaint.
(Prior Code, § 1618)
§ 150.19 ALTERNATIVES.
   Neither this chapter nor any of its provisions shall be construed to impair
or limit in any way the power of the town to define and declare nuisances and
to cause their abatement by summary action or otherwise or to enforce this
chapter by criminal process as authorized by G.S. § 14-4, §
150.99 of this chapter, and otherwise by applicable law, and the enforcement of
any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the enforcement of any other
remedy or remedies provided herein or in other ordinances or laws.
(Prior Code, § 1619)
§ 150.20 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ORDER.
   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling to fail, neglect, or
refuse to repair, alter, or improve the same or to vacate, close, demolish, and
remove the same, upon order of the public officer duly made and served as
provided in this chapter, within the time specified in such order.
(Prior Code, § 1620) Penalty, see §
150.99
§ 150.21 REMOVAL OF COMPLAINTS, NOTICES, AND THE LIKE.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, without written consent of the public
officer, to remove or permit the removal of any complaint, notice, or order
posted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. When the public
officer finds that a dwelling is unfit for human habitation within the meaning
of this chapter and has notified the owner to such effect and the time limit
set by the public officer for the correction of the defects or vacating the
same has expired, it shall be unlawful for any person to receive rentals, offer
for rent, or occupy such dwelling as a human habitation.
(Prior Code, § 1621) Penalty, see §
150.99
§ 150.22 CERTIFICATE OF MINIMUM HOUSING COMPLIANCE.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to occupy, rent, or offer to rent as a
dwelling, any vacant dwelling, or any part thereof upon which an order to
repair, alter, or improve has been issued or upon which an order to vacate and
close has been issued without such owner or agent first filing an application
form securing a certificate of minimum housing compliance from the town. The
public officer shall issue a certificate of minimum housing compliance when,
after examination and inspection, it is found that the structure conforms to
the provisions of this chapter. The owner or agent requesting a certificate of
minimum housing compliance shall pay a fee of $50 for each inspection required
hereunder to determine whether the dwelling, vacant building, or any part
thereof is in compliance with this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 1622) Penalty, see §
150.99
§ 150.23 FAILURE TO VACATE.
   (A)   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling,
the public officer may cause a civil action to be filed in the name of the town
to remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the
nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming
as parties-defendant any person occupying such dwelling.
   (B)   The Clerk of superior court shall issue a summons requiring the
defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date, and place not
to exceed ten days from the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint.
The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. § 42-29. The
summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it
appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the public officer
produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the governing body
pursuant to §
150.15 of this chapter authorizing the officer to proceed to vacate the
occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the
premises be vacated and that all persons be removed.
   (C)   The judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be enforced
in the same manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under G.S. §
42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be
taken as provided in G.S. § 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be
stayed as provided in G.S. § 7A-227.
   (D)   An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the
owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to
this section unless such occupant was served with notice at least 30 days
before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the governing body
has ordered the public officer to proceed to exercise his or her duties under §
150.17 to vacate and close or remove and demolish the dwelling.
(Prior Code, § 1623)
§ 150.24 NOTICE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever a determination is made pursuant to §
150.17 that a dwelling must be vacated and closed or removed or demolished
under the provisions of this section, notice of the order shall be given by
first class mail to any organization involved in providing or restoring
dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for such
notices.
   (B)   A minimum period of 45 days from the mailing of such notice shall be
given before removal or demolition by action of the public officer to allow the
opportunity for any organization to negotiate with the owner to make repairs,
lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of providing affordable
housing.
   (C)   The public officer or Clerk shall certify the mailing of the notices,
and the certification shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. Only an
organization that has filed a written request for such notices may raise the
issue of failure to mail such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order
requiring the public officer to wait 45 days before causing removal or
demolition.
(Prior Code, § 1624)
§ 150.25 CONFLICT WITH OTHER PROVISIONS.
   In the event any provision, standard, or requirement of this chapter is
found to be in conflict with any provision of any other ordinance or code of
the town, the provision which established the higher standard or more stringent
requirement for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the
residents of the town shall prevail.
(Prior Code, § 1625)

maintained, or used in violation of this chapter or in violation of G.S. Ch.
160D, Art. 12, or any valid order or decision of the public officer or Board of
Adjustment made pursuant to any ordinance or code adopted pursuant to this
chapter, the public officer or Board of Adjustment may institute any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent the unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or use; to restrain, correct, or
abate the violation; to prevent the occupancy of the dwelling; or to prevent
any illegal act, conduct, or use in or about the premises of the dwelling.

§ 150.28 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling or dwelling unit to
fail, neglect, or refuse to repair, alter, or improve the same, or to vacate
and close and remove or demolish the same, upon order of the public officer
duly made and served as herein provided, within the time specified in such

§ 151.04 MAINTENANCE STANDARDS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   All nonresidential buildings and structures shall be free of all
conditions that are dangerous and injurious to the public health, safety, and
welfare of occupants or members of the general public.
   (B)   Without limitation of the foregoing requirement, the existence of any

closing, or demolition of such building or structure and must be corrected in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter:
      (1)   Interior walls, vertical studs, partitions, supporting members,
sills, joists, rafters, or other basic structural members that list, lean, or
buckle to such an extent as to render the building unsafe, that are rotted,
deteriorated, or damaged, and that have holes or cracks which might admit
rodents;
      (2)   Exterior walls that are not structurally sound, free from defects
and damages, and capable of bearing imposed loads safely. Where a wall of a
building has become exposed as a result of demolition of adjacent buildings,
such wall must have all doors, windows, vents, or other similar openings closed
with material of the type comprising the wall. The exposed wall shall be
painted, stuccoed, or bricked and sufficiently weatherproofed to prevent
deterioration of the wall;
      (3)   Floors or roofs which have improperly distributed loads, which are
overloaded, or which have insufficient strength to be reasonably safe for the
purpose used. Floors or roofs shall have adequate supporting members and
strength to be reasonably safe for the purpose used. Roofs shall be kept

facilities to such extent as to endanger the health, safety, or general welfare
of the occupants or members of the general public;
      (7)   Buildings and structures including their environs that have
accumulations of garbage, trash, or rubbish, which creates health and
sanitation problems. All garbage and solid waste shall be in approved
containers or stored in a safe and sanitary manner;
      (8)   Buildings and structures that have loose and insufficiently
anchored overhanging objects, which constitute a danger of falling on persons
or property;
      (9)   Buildings and structures including their environs that have
insufficiently protected holes, excavations, breaks, projections, obstructions,
and other such dangerous impediments on and around walks, driveways, parking
lots, alleyways, and other areas which are accessible to and generally used by
persons on or around the premises;
      (10)   Buildings and structures that have cracked or broken glass, loose
shingles, loose wood, crumbling stone or brick, loose or broken plastic, or
other dangerous objects or similar hazardous conditions. Exterior surfaces
shall be maintained in such material or treated in such a manner as to prevent
deterioration and repaired or replaced with like or similar material according
to its original use;

structures that cause a safety hazard to the occupants or members of the
general public;
      (16)   All exterior surfaces that may cause unsafe conditions due to a
lack of maintenance. Exterior surfaces shall be painted or sealed when
necessary to protect the underlying surface from deterioration. All exterior
surfaces that have been painted shall be maintained generally free of peeling
and flaking. Where 50% or more of the aggregate of any painted surface shall
have peeling or flaking or previous paint worn away, the entire surface shall
be repainted in order to prevent further deterioration;
      (17)   Windows containing broken or cracked glass that could be in danger
of falling or shattering. All windows must be tight-fitting and have sashes of
proper size and design and free from rotten wood, broken joints, or broken or
loose mullions;
      (18)   All openings originally designed as windows, doors, loading docks,
or other means of egress or ingress which have been temporarily closed by
boarding or other manner in a non-secure manner so as to allow unauthorized
admittance. If an opening is temporarily closed by boarding to secure the
building or structure, the boarding shall be trim fit, sealed to prevent water
intrusion, and painted or stained to properly conform with the other exterior
portions of the building and the building or structure shall be maintained in a
state that secures the building or structure from any unauthorized admittance
from humans, animals, or birds; and
      (19)   Any combination of conditions which in the judgment of the code

properly maintained so that the safety or health of its occupants or members of
the general public are jeopardized for failure of the property to meet minimum
standards established herein, the public officer shall undertake a preliminary
investigation.
   (B)   Complaint and hearing. If the preliminary investigation discloses
evidence of a violation in the minimum standards, the public officer shall
issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in the
nonresidential building or structure a complaint. The complaint shall state the
charges and contain a notice that a hearing will be held before the public
officer (or his or her designated agent) at a place within the corporate limits
of the town scheduled not less than ten days nor more 30 days after the serving
of the complaint; that the owner and parties in interest shall be given the
right to answer the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give
testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; and that the rules of
evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in
hearings before the public officer.
   (C)   Procedure after hearing.
      (1)   If, after notice and hearing, the public officer determines that
the nonresidential building or structure has been maintained in that the
property meets the minimum standards established by this chapter, the public
officer shall state in writing findings of fact in support of that
determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof a
copy of said determination.
      (2)   If, after notice and hearing, the public officer determines that
the nonresidential building or structure has not been properly maintained so
that the safety or health of its occupants or members of the general public is
jeopardized for failure of the property to meet the minimum standards
established in this chapter, the public officer shall state in writing findings
of fact in support of that determination and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner thereof an order. The order may require the owner to take
remedial action, within a reasonable time specified, subject to the procedures
and limitations set out in divisions (C)(3) and (C)(4) below and elsewhere in
this chapter.
      (3)   An order may require the owner to repair, alter, or improve the

nonresidential building or structure if the cost of repair, alteration, or
improvement of the building or structure would exceed 50% of its then current
value.
   (D)   Failure to comply with order and ordinances.
      (1)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or
improve, or to vacate and close the nonresidential building or structure, the
Town Council may adopt an ordinance ordering the public officer to proceed to
effectuate the purpose of this chapter with respect to the particular property
or properties that the public officer found to be jeopardizing the health or
safety of its occupants or members of the general public. The property or
properties shall be described in the ordinance. The ordinance shall be recorded
in the office of the County Register of Deeds and shall be indexed in the name
of the property owner or owners in the grantor index. Following adoption of an
ordinance, the public officer may cause the nonresidential building or
structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed. The
public officer may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any
nonresidential building or structure so closed a placard with the following
words: “This building is unfit for any use; the use or occupation of this
building for any purpose is prohibited and unlawful.” Any person who occupies
or knowingly allows the occupancy of a nonresidential building or structure so
posted shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.
      (2)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish
the nonresidential building or structure, the Town Council may adopt an
ordinance ordering the public officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of
this chapter with respect to the particular property or properties that the
public officer found to be jeopardizing the health or safety of its occupants
or members of the general public. No ordinance shall be adopted to require
demolition of a nonresidential building or structure until the owner has first
been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with the
minimum standards established by the governing body. The property or properties
shall be described in the ordinance. The ordinance shall be recorded in the
office of the County Register of Deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the

(Prior Code, § 1707)
§ 151.08 LIMITATIONS ON ORDERS AND ORDINANCES CONCERNING HISTORIC LANDMARK OF
HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the nonresidential
building or structure is a designated local historic landmark, listed in the
National Register of Historic Places, or located in a locally designated
historic district or in a district listed in the National Register of Historic
Places and the Town Council determines, after a public hearing as provided by
ordinance, that the nonresidential building or structure is of individual
significance or contributes to maintain the character of the district, and the
nonresidential building or structure has not been condemned as unsafe, the
order may require that the nonresidential building or structure be vacated and
closed until it is brought into compliance with the minimum standards
established by the Town Council.
(Prior Code, § 1708)
§ 151.09 LIMITATIONS ON ORDERS AND ORDINANCES CONCERNING VACANT MANUFACTURING
FACILITY OR VACANT INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE.
   An order may not require repairs, alterations, or improvements to be made to
vacant manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial warehouse facilities to
preserve the original use. The order may require such building or structure to
be vacated and closed, but repairs may be required only when necessary to
maintain structural integrity or to abate a health or safety hazard that cannot
be remedied by ordering the building or structure closed for any use.
(Prior Code, § 1709)
§ 151.10 ACTION BY TOWN COUNCIL UPON ABANDONMENT OF INTENT TO REPAIR.
   (A)   If the Town Council has adopted an ordinance or the public officer has
issued an order requiring the nonresidential building or structure to be
repaired or vacated and closed and the building or structure has been vacated
and closed for a period of two years pursuant to the ordinance or order, the
Town Council may make findings that the owner has abandoned the intent and
purpose to repair, alter, or improve the nonresidential building or structure
and that the continuation of the building or structure in its vacated and
closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, and welfare of the town
in that it would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire safety hazard,
would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on
criminal activities, or would cause or contribute to blight and the
deterioration of property values in the area.
   (B)   Upon such findings, the Town Council may, after expiration of the two
year period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting
forth the following:
      (1)   If the costs of repair of the nonresidential building or structure
to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards is less than or equal to
50% of its then current value, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the nonresidential building or structure
within 90 days; or
      (2)   If the costs of repair of the nonresidential building or structure
to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards exceeds 50% of its then
current value, the ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the
nonresidential building or structure within 90 days.
   (C)   In the case of vacant manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial
warehouse facilities, the building or structure must have been vacated and
closed pursuant to an order or ordinance for a period of five years before the
Town Council may take action under this section. The ordinance shall be
recorded in the office of the County Register of Deeds and shall be indexed in
the name of the property owner or in the grantor index. If the owner fails to
comply with the ordinance, the public officer shall effectuate the purpose of
the ordinance.
(Prior Code, § 1710)
§ 151.11 METHODS OF SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)   Complaints or orders issued by the public officer pursuant to this
chapter shall be served upon persons either personally or by registered or
certified mail so long as the means used are reasonably designed to achieve
actual notice. When service is made by registered or certified mail, a copy of
the complaint or order may also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be
deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is refused, but the
regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten days after the
mailing. If regular mail is used, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be
posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected.
   (B)   If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the public officer in the exercise of
reasonable diligence and the public officer makes an affidavit to that effect,
then the serving of the complaint or order upon the owners or other persons may
be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the town at
least once no later than the time at which personal service would be required
under the provisions of this chapter. When service is made by publication, a
notice of the pending proceeding shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
premises affected.
(Prior Code, § 1711)
§ 151.12 COSTS; A LIEN ON PREMISES.
   (A)   The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations, or improvements, or
vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the public officer shall be a
lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred, which lien
shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected as the lien for
special assessment provided in G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 10.
   (B)   The amount of the costs is also a lien on any other real property of
the owner located within the corporate limits of the town, except for the
owner’s primary residence. The additional lien provided in this section is
inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a money judgment.
   (C)   If the nonresidential building or structure is removed or demolished
by the public officer, he or she shall offer for sale the recoverable materials
of the building or structure and any personal property, fixtures, or
appurtenances found in or attached to the building or structure, and shall
credit the proceeds of the sale against the costs of the removal or demolition
and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the
public officer, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall
be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final
order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
impair or limit in any way the power of the Town Council to define and declare
nuisances and to cause the removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or
otherwise.
(Prior Code, § 1712)
§ 151.13 EJECTMENT.
   (A)   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a
nonresidential building or structure, the public officer may cause a civil
action to be filed in the name of the town to remove such occupant. The action
to vacate the building or structure shall be in the nature of summary ejectment
and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as parties-defendant any
person occupying such nonresidential building or structure.
   (B)   The Clerk of superior court shall issue a summons requiring the
defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date, and place not
to exceed ten days from the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint.
The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. § 42-29. The
summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it
appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the public officer
produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the Town Council pursuant
to §
151.07(C) of this chapter authorizing the public officer to proceed to vacate
the occupied building or structure, the magistrate shall enter judgment
ordering that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed.
   (C)   The judgment ordering that the nonresidential building or structure be
vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary
ejectment entered under G.S. § 42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered under
this section by the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. § 7A-228, and
the execution of such judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. § 7A-227. An
action to remove an occupant of a nonresidential building or structure who is a
tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding
pursuant to this section unless such occupant was served with notice at least
30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the Town
Council has ordered the public officer to proceed to exercise his or her duties
under this chapter to vacate and close or remove and demolish the
nonresidential building or structure.
(Prior Code, § 1713)
§ 151.14 LIS PENDENS.
   (A)   Pursuant to the authority granted in G.S. § 1-120.2, upon the issuance
of a complaint and notice of hearing or order pursuant thereto (under the
provisions of this chapter), the issuing officer may file in the office of the
County Clerk of superior court a notice of lis pendens, with a copy of the
complaint and notice of hearing attached thereto.
   (B)   From the date and time of the proper indexing of the same by the Clerk
of superior court in accordance with the state’s general statutes, the
complaint and notice of hearing or order (and all further orders entered in
said proceeding) shall be binding upon the successors and/or assigns of the
owners and parties in interest in the nonresidential building or structure. A
copy of the notice of lis pendens shall be served upon the owners and parties
in interest in the building or structure at the time of filing in accordance
with applicable law.
   (C)   The notice of lis pendens shall remain in full force and effect until
cancelled, which is authorized to be done by the Town Manager, Town Attorney,
and the respective issuing officer (or his or her successor in office as such),

the appeal is based.
      (2)   Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the public officer shall

to do any act, his or her decision shall remain in force until modified or
reversed.
      (3)   When an appeal is from a decision of the public officer requiring
the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of
suspending the requirement until the hearing by the Board of Adjustment, unless
the public officer certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of
appeal is filed with him or her, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant) a suspension of
his or her requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property.
      (4)   In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a
restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than
one day’s written notice to the public officer, by the Board of Adjustment or
by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1208 and
division (C) below.
   (C)   Petition to superior court. Any person aggrieved by an order issued by
the public officer or a decision rendered by the Board of Adjustment may
petition the superior court for an injunction restraining the public officer
from carrying out the order or decision and the court may, upon such petition,
issue a temporary injunction restraining the public officer pending a final
disposition of the cause. The petition shall be filed within 30 days after the
issuance of the order or rendering of the decision. The rights of a person so
aggrieved are governed by G.S. § 160D-1208.

§ 151.17 CONFLICT WITH OTHER PROVISIONS.
   In the event any provision, standard, or requirement of this chapter is
found to be in conflict with any provision of any other ordinance or code of
the town, the provision which establishes the higher standard or more stringent
requirement for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the
citizens of the town shall prevail.
(Prior Code, § 1717)
§ 151.18 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any nonresidential building or
structure to fail, neglect, or refuse to repair, alter, or improve the same, or
to vacate and close and remove or demolish the same, upon order of the public
officer duly made and served in accordance with the provisions of this chapter,
within the time specified in such order, and each day that any such failure,
neglect, or refusal to comply with such order continues shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense.

structure, with respect to which an order has been issued pursuant to this
chapter, to occupy or permit the occupancy of the same after the time
prescribed in such order for its repair, alteration, improvement, or its
vacation and closing, and each day that such occupancy continues after such
prescribed time shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.

§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Civil penalty. Any person in violation of any provision of this
chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty in the amount of $200 per day of
non-compliance from and after the date a citation is issued to such person
until the property is brought into compliance with this chapter. The penalty
may be recovered by the town in a civil action in the nature of a debt if the
person who has been assessed a civil penalty does not pay the same within 30
days after first being cited by the public officer for a violation of this
chapter. Penalties assessed for continuing violations constituting a separate
and distinct offense may be aggregated and collected in one action.
   (B)   Misdemeanor; fine. Except as specifically set out herein to the
contrary, the violation of this chapter is a Class 3 misdemeanor as set out in
G.S. §§ 14-4 and 160A-175 to the extent the violation relates to an unsafe
building. The maximum fine for a violation of this chapter is $500.
   (C)   Equitable relief; abatement. This chapter may be enforced by an
appropriate equitable remedy issued from a court of competent jurisdiction as
set out in G.S. § 160A-175. The town may apply to the appropriate division of
the general court of justice for mandatory prohibitory injunction and an order
of abatement commanding the defendant(s) to correct the unlawful condition
upon, or cease the unlawful use of, the property.
   (D)   Continuing violation. Each day’s continuing violation of any provision
of this chapter shall be a separate and distinct offense.

maintain facilities in the public way and includes, but is not limited to, a
franchise, a license, a permit, a letter, construction drawing approval.
Multiple AUTHORIZATIONS may be required for certain activities. Receipt of

(Ord. passed 5-1-2014)
§ 152.02 GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF THE PUBLIC WAY.
   (A)   The provisions of this section and §§
152.03 through
152.06 apply to work performed in the public way and to facilities that have
been placed in the public way. Noncompliance with a requirement in this section
is a violation of the law and is subject to all remedies available under the
law to the town.
   (B)   The right to perform work in the public way and the ability to
maintain facilities in the public way are allowed subject to the conditions
below, as supplemented by those set forth in other sections of this chapter,
standards adopted by the town, and requirements contained in authorizations.
      (1)   The town does not warrant its legal interest in the public way.
Persons doing work in the public way and users may need to obtain approvals
from persons with property interests in the public way. The town routinely will
consult with SGWASA concerning any activities in the public way which have the
potential to impact SGWASA. Additional approvals may need to be obtained
directly from SGWASA.
      (2)   An authorization does not grant exclusive rights to provide a
service or to a particular location unless such rights are explicitly
guaranteed in an authorization.
      (3)   The town retains all rights it may have to use all portions of the
public way for any purpose not prohibited by law.
      (4)   An authorization does not convey any legal right, title, or
interest in the public way.
      (5)   The town and its officials, officers, and employees are not liable
for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages that result when facilities
in the public way are damaged during the construction, installation,
inspection, maintenance, or repair of public improvements that have received
town funding or that are installed pursuant to a contract with the town.
      (6)   Users and persons who cause work to be done in the public way shall
pay for all damage that results, directly or indirectly, from work performed
for their benefit in the public way, and for the installation, repair,
maintenance, and operation of their facilities in the public way.
      (7)   Nonenforcement of one or more provisions of an authorization does
not waive the town’s right to enforce the provisions of an authorization.
      (8)   An authorization creates no third party rights against the town and
is intended only for the benefit of the person receiving the authorization.
      (9)   An authorization does not limit the town’s exercise of its
regulatory, police, governmental, legislative, or contracting authority. A
subsequent ordinance may regulate users more strictly than is provided in prior
authorizations received by such users. If an authorization conflicts with the
terms of another authorization or with the town code, the stricter of the
applicable provisions shall control. The stricter provision shall not control,
however, if a later-issued authorization or ordinance explicitly and
specifically states that particular terms are to override prior, less strict
terms in an authorization.
(Ord. passed 5-1-2014)
§ 152.03 WORK IN PUBLIC WAY REQUIRING PRIOR NOTICE; AUTHORIZATIONS; STANDARDS;
FEES.

public way.
   (C)   Unlawful to do work without authorizations; emergency. Except in the
event of an emergency, it shall be unlawful to do work in the public way or

necessary to address the emergency. Application shall immediately be made for
necessary authorizations from the town, notwithstanding that work may have
started or have been completed and all necessary fees shall be paid. The person
doing emergency work in the public way shall be responsible for returning the
public way to its original condition, shall be liable for any and all damages
caused by such emergency work, and shall not be relieved of any other
obligation or responsibility under this chapter except as expressly set out in
this division (C).
   (D)   Standards. The town shall develop standards and requirements for
authorizations, including, but not limited to, franchises, licenses, permits,

who contract to have work performed in the public way maintain an updated list
of the contractors working on their projects, and acknowledge responsibility
for the actions of the contractors on the public way.
   (F)   Fees; accounts. The town shall charge such fees as are authorized by
the Town Council for authorizations, applications for authorizations, review of
information and plans, inspections and reinspections, maintenance of facilities
in the public way, and for any other town review, oversight, or administration
of proposed, ongoing, or completed activities described in division (A) above.
Such fees may be waived for relocations required by the town or other similar
circumstances. The town may allow persons to establish and fund escrow accounts
or other accounts with the town to which fees may be charged.

   (C)   Bonds; performance guarantees.
      (1)   The town may require a person conducting activities in the public
way or a user to provide a performance bond or other performance guarantee for
the work in division (A) above or for keeping facilities in the public way. The
amount, form, and content of the guarantee shall be determined in the
discretion of the town. The town may increase or decrease the amount of the
bond or performance guarantee required.
      (2)   The town shall determine, in its discretion, the time period for
which a performance guarantee shall be kept in force. The town may consider,
among other things, the time period for a project and assessment of the
performance of the project, the length of a license or franchise, and/or the
projected time during which facilities will exist in the public way.
      (3)   The performance guarantee shall, among other things, ensure
compensation for:
         (a)   Damages resulting from the proposed work or a user’s maintenance
of facilities in the public way;
         (b)   Direct and indirect costs to the town of remedying damage to the

      (4)   The rights reserved to the town under a bond or performance
guarantee do not limit the claims or rights the town may bring against a
person, except where a bond or guarantee has fully satisfied a town claim.
Every bond shall require the surety to provide notice of cancellation or
nonrenewal by registered or certified mail, which notice must be given in
writing to the town at least 14 days prior to the effective date of such
cancellation or nonrenewal.
   (D)   Insurance.
      (1)   The town may require persons that do work in the public way and

require that the town be named as an additional insured on such insurance
policies as it shall specify. The amount of insurance shall be as determined by
the town.
   (E)   No interference with town or SGWASA utilities. Persons doing work in
the public way shall not interfere with existing town or SGWASA utilities, such
as infrastructure for water and sewer, the natural and constructed stormwater
system, and traffic signals and associated lines, or the repair or replacement
of such systems. Persons doing work in the public way shall give the town and
SGWASA at least two full business days to locate and mark any existing town or
SGWASA utility lines prior to initiating work. For example, if notice is given
at 3:00 p.m. on Friday, the town and/or SGWASA shall have all day Monday and
Tuesday to locate and mark any existing town or SGWASA utility lines with work
by the person giving notice beginning in the public way no earlier than
Wednesday. Damage to town or SGWASA utilities or other infrastructure shall be
paid for by the person or user contracting for the work that resulted in such
damage. If facilities are installed in violation of this provision, the town
may require their removal, at the owner’s expense.
   (F)   Compliance with regulations, safety standards, and industry codes.
Persons and users performing work in the public way shall ensure worker,
traffic, and pedestrian safety and shall ensure that all work is performed in
accordance with industry standards. Compliance with all federal, state, and
local regulations, and all federal, state, local and industry codes and
standards is required. These include, but are not limited to, compliance with
the Occupational Safety and Health Act, being G.S. §§ 95-126 et seq.,
compliance with the National Electrical Code and National Electrical Safety
Code, compliance with fiber optic installation standards and telecommunication
industry standards, compliance with plumbing and pipe installation codes and
standards, and compliance with standards and codes for traffic safety and lane
closures. Persons and users shall provide all equipment and personnel necessary
to meet applicable regulations, codes, and standards and shall furnish
additional equipment or personnel if requested by the town. Information
requested by the town regarding compliance with these standards shall be
provided within the time frame requested by the town.
   (G)   Licensed professionals. Work in the public way shall be performed and
supervised by licensed professionals where required under state law.
   (H)   Notice of beginning and end of project. Persons doing work in the
public way shall notify the town upon beginning and ending a project in the

   (I)   Inspections; fees. The town may conduct inspections of work performed
in the public way. Persons performing such work and users shall comply with all
directives of the town to facilitate such inspections. The town may charge fees
as set by the Town Council for such inspections, which may be varied to account
for the nature of the project, the number of inspections required, or other
factors, and which may be sufficient to reimburse SGWASA for the costs of any
activities that it is required to undertake at the request of the town or
otherwise hereunder; provided, however, nothing herein shall prevent SGWASA
from directly charging a person any fees or for any services that it is
entitled to charge. The town may direct a person or user to do additional work
as a result of an inspection and such person or user shall comply with such
directive.
(Ord. passed 5-1-2014)
§ 152.05 RESTORATION OF SURROUNDING AREAS.
   (A)   Obligation to restore disturbed areas. A person or user that conducts
excavation or other activities that disturb the public way or planting within
the public way or facilities within the public way shall restore the public way
to a condition equivalent to that it was in prior to the disturbance. The
restoration shall include, but is not limited to, installation of pavement,
resurfacing nearby areas, grading other surface areas, restoring below ground
areas, planting and landscaping, and repairing improvements and facilities.
Restoration shall meet the standards set by the town. The town may also require
restoration of areas that have not been disturbed if it is necessary to restore
the disturbed areas to a similar functional condition as existed prior to the
person’s or user’s work.
   (B)   Temporary restoration. Where permanent restoration is impractical
because of weather or other circumstances, the town may require temporary
restoration to be followed by permanent restoration.
   (C)   Timetable set by town. The town shall determine the time period during
which restoration must be accomplished.
   (D)   Repair of inadequate restoration work. Where restoration work proves
to be inadequate over time, as determined in the town’s discretion in
consultation with SGWASA as appropriate, the town may require additional
restoration. Such additional restoration may be required for a period of one
year from the date of completion of the initial restoration work. The person or
user responsible for the work necessitating the original restoration shall be
responsible for the costs of the additional restoration. The town’s inspection
and/or approval of original restoration work does not waive the town’s right to
require additional restoration.
   (E)   Reimbursement to town of costs of restoration. If a user or other
person responsible for damage to the public way does not complete required
restoration during the period required by the town, the town may complete the
restoration. The costs shall be promptly reimbursed by the user or the person
directing the original work that required restoration of the public way.

ducts are available and practicable to use, as determined in the discretion of
the town, taking into account relevant considerations. A user shall take
reasonable steps to procure the right to use existing ducts.
   (D)   Documentation of sufficient space. A user shall demonstrate to the
town’s satisfaction that sufficient space exists in the public way for its
proposed facilities without interfering with existing or future public
projects, and that placement of the facilities will not unduly disrupt use of
the public way or negatively impact the condition of the public way.
   (E)   Posting of notice. The town may require a user to post written notice
of proposed work or activities along the public way impacted and/or to
distribute notices to individual properties located along the public way.
   (F)   Documentation to town upon completion. Users shall give the town and
SGWASA (if requested) all information requested by the town regarding the
installation of facilities upon completion. Such information may include, but

required by the town, and changes to planned locations that were necessary to
avoid pre-existing infrastructure.
   (G)   Maps and information on file with users. During the time period a user
has facilities in the public way, the user shall maintain one or more maps
showing the placement of its facilities in the public way. A user shall also

   (I)   Relocation of facilities. A user shall, at its own cost, relocate its
facilities within a time determined in the discretion of the town, if the town
determines in its discretion or after consultation with SGWASA that the
facilities:
      (1)   Interfere with the use of the public way or the provision of
services to town residents;
      (2)   Will impede the construction of a project funded in part with
public funds, or a project to be dedicated to the public upon completion; or
      (3)   That the public way can be better or more efficiently utilized by
the relocation of the facilities.
   (J)   Maintenance of facilities. Users shall monitor, maintain, and repair
their facilities in the public way so that they function in a safe manner and
do not create a risk to persons or property. Users shall notify the town of

public way without an authorization, if one is required by the town, and
facilities for which a license or franchise has expired shall be removed upon
order of the town. In addition, all abandoned facilities or facilities that no
longer function as part of a user’s system shall be removed by their owner upon
order of the town. If facilities that are required to be removed are not
removed, the town or SGWASA may remove them, with the cost of removal to be
borne by the owner.

   The town may exempt its contractors, SGWASA’s contractors, or the North
Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) from particular requirements in
§§
152.02 through
152.07 when substantial compliance has been assured through the town’s or
SGWASA’s contracting system, or, in the case of NCDOT, where the need for state
infrastructure on town roads, or a joint undertaking by the town and NCDOT, or
the use of state controlled areas of the public way makes the application of
such requirements unreasonable.
(Ord. passed 5-1-2014)
§ 152.08 FRANCHISES AND LICENSES.
   (A)   Services in the public way subject to a franchise. In order to place

   1.6.3   Rules of language and construction. For the purposes of interpreting
the general language and sentence construction of this ordinance, except where
as otherwise noted, the following rules of construction apply unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise.
   (A)   Meaning of words. Words listed in
Article 17, Definitions, have the specific meaning assigned, unless the context
expressly indicates another meaning. Words that are not defined are given their
common meaning.
   (B)   Tense. Words used in the present tense include the future tense. The
reverse is also true.
   (C)   Singular and plural. Words used in the singular include the plural.
The reverse is also true.
   (D)   Mandatory terms. The words “shall”, “will”, “must”, and “may not” are

with the particular provision.
   (E)   Gender. Words used in the male gender include the female gender. The
reverse is also true.
   (F)   Days. Any reference to “days” means calendar days unless otherwise
specified. The time in which an act is to be done shall be computed by
excluding the first day and including the last day. If a deadline or required
date of action falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday observed by the town,

   (I)   Current versions and citations. All references to other town, county,

other regulations, requirements for compliance are no longer in effect.
   (J)   Lists and examples. Unless otherwise expressly indicated, lists of
items or examples that use “including,” “such as”, or similar terms are
intended to provide examples only. They are not to be construed as exhaustive
lists of all possibilities.
   (K)   Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring a
specific officer or employee of the town to perform an act or duty, that
provision will be construed as authorizing the officer or employee to delegate
that responsibility to others over whom he or she has authority. Delegation of
authority is not allowed when the provisions of this ordinance or other laws or
regulations expressly prohibit such delegation.
   (L)   Calculations and rounding. Unless otherwise specified within this
ordinance, all calculations that result in a part or fraction of a whole number

§ 1.7 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   1.7.1   Conflict with state or federal regulations. If any provisions of
this ordinance are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government,
the more restrictive provisions shall govern unless the state or federal
regulation is intended to preempt the local regulation. The more restrictive
provision is the one that imposes greater restrictions or more stringent
controls. Regardless of any other provision of this ordinance, no land may be
developed or used, and no structure may be erected or maintained in violation
of any state or federal regulation.
   1.7.2   Conflict with local regulations. If the provisions of this ordinance
are inconsistent with one another, or if they conflict with provisions found in
other adopted ordinances or regulations of the town, the more restrictive
provision governs. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes
greater restrictions or more stringent controls.
   1.7.3   Conflict with private agreements and contracts. This ordinance is
not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing
easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, or permits previously
adopted or issued pursuant to law. The town has no responsibility for
monitoring or enforcing private agreements or contracts.
§ 1.8 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.

boundaries of the zoning districts established by this ordinance. The Official
Zoning Map shall be kept on file with the Town Clerk, and is available for
public inspection during normal business hours. The original official version
of the map shall be certified by the Town Clerk, and shall bear the seal of the
town. It shall be the final authority as to the status of the current zoning
district classification of land within the town’s jurisdiction, and shall only
be amended in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.
   1.8.2   Incorporation by reference. The Official Zoning Map is hereby
incorporated by reference and made part of this ordinance.
   1.8.3   Interpretation of district boundaries.
      (A)   A boundary shown on the map as approximately following the
centerline of a street, highway, or alley is construed as following such
centerline.
      (B)   A boundary shown on the map as approximately following a parcel
boundary is construed as following the parcel boundary as it actually existed
at the time the zoning boundary was established.
      (C)   A boundary shown on the map as approximately following a river,
stream, lake, or other watercourse is construed as following the actual
centerline of the watercourse.
      (D)   A boundary shown on the map as approximately following the
corporate limits of the town is construed as following that boundary.
      (E)   A boundary shown on the map as approximately parallel to, or as an
extension of, a feature described above is construed as being actually parallel
to, or an extension of, the feature.
§ 1.9 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.
   1.9.1   Effect on valid building permits and vested rights. Unless the
property owner consents, this ordinance does not apply to the completion of the
development of buildings or uses for which either:
      (A)   Building permits have been issued pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1110
prior to October 1, 2008, so long as the permits remain valid and unexpired
pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1111 and unrevoked pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1115; or
      (B)   A vested right has been established pursuant to G.S.§§ 160D-108 and
160D-108.1 and such right remains valid and unexpired pursuant to G.S.§§ 160D-
108 and 160D-108.1.
   1.9.2   Other approvals granted prior to the effective date. Variances,
special use permits, subdivision plats, site plans, and other similar
development approvals that are valid on September 30, 2008 will remain valid
until their expiration date if applicable. Development may be completed in
accordance with such approvals even if such building, development, or structure
does not fully comply with the provisions of this ordinance. If development is
not commenced and diligently pursued in the time allowed under the original
approval or any extension granted, then the building, development, or structure
must meet the standards of this ordinance in effect at the time of any re-
application.
   1.9.3   Applications in process prior to effective date. Applications for
building permits, variances, special use permits, subdivision plats, site plan
approvals, and other similar development approvals that were submitted in
complete form and are pending approval on October 1, 2008 must be reviewed
wholly under the terms of the ordinance in effect on September 30, 2008. Any
re-application for an expired approval must meet the standards of this
ordinance in effect at the time of re-application.
   1.9.4   Violations continue. Violations of the previous ordinance which are
in violation of this ordinance will continue to be a violation and will be
subject to penalties and enforcement action under
Article 4, Enforcement. The adoption of this ordinance does not affect nor
prevent any pending or future action to abate violations of previous
ordinances.
(Ord. A.21.01, passed 6-3-2021)
§ 1.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any article, section, division, phrase, or word of this ordinance be
held invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction of either
the state or the United States, such decision does not affect, impair, or
invalidate the validity of the remaining parts of this ordinance which can be
given effect without the invalid provision.
§ 1.11 VESTED RIGHTS.
   1.11.1   Purpose and intent. This section is intended to implement G.S. §
160D-108 with respect to the establishment of zoning vested rights for
landowners or applicants who have received a development approval from the
town.
   1.11.2   Vested rights defined. As used in this ordinance, a ZONING VESTED
RIGHT is defined as the right to undertake and complete the development and use
of land under the terms and conditions of a development approval issued by the

Statutes. The following subsections detail the ways in which a vested right may
be established.
      (A)   Common law vested rights.
         (1)   Defined. A common law vested right establishes the right to
undertake and complete the development and use of property on substantial

ordinance, made substantial expenditures of time, effort, or money on a
proposed development; and
            (ii)   The obligations and/or expenditures were incurred in good
faith; and
            (iii)   The obligations and/or expenditures were made in reasonable
reliance on and after the issuance of a valid governmental permit, if such
permit is required provided however, a mistakenly-issued governmental permit
shall not give rise to a common law vested right; and
            (iv)   The amended or newly adopted ordinance is a substantial
detriment to the applicant.
      (B)   Issuance of a building permit. Issuance of a building permit by the
county in accordance with the applicable standards in this ordinance and
applicable state law shall entitle the building permit holder to vested rights
to develop the proposal as identified in the approved building permit, subject

         (6)   If the building permit expires or is revoked, the vested right
based on it is also lost.
      (C)   Statutory vested rights. Development permits for a building, use of
a building, use of land, or subdivision of land establishes statutory vested
rights, which shall entitle the permit holder to vested rights to develop the
proposal as identified in the approved permit, subject to the following

permit, and the vesting term shall only continue in accordance with the
provisions in G.S. § 160D-801.

unless otherwise specified by statute, and the applicant is vested in that
permit for the term of validity.

within one year, then the development permit and vesting expire.
         (4)   Vesting shall continue provided there is a substantial
commencement of authorized work under a valid development permit.

ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of the local
ordinance and the terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the Floodplain
Administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on
any premises within the jurisdiction of the community at any reasonable hour
for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action;

the person doing or in charge of the work. The stop work order shall state the
specific work to be stopped, the specific reason(s) for the stoppage, and the
condition(s) under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop work
order constitutes a misdemeanor;
         (15)   Revoke floodplain development permits as required. The
Floodplain Administrator may revoke and require the return of the floodplain
development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason
(s) for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure
from the approved application, plans, and specifications; for refusal or
failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false
statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any floodplain
development permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or
local law may also be revoked;
         (16)   Make periodic inspections throughout the Special Flood Hazard
Areas within the jurisdiction of the community. The Floodplain Administrator
and each member of his or her inspections department shall have a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action;
         (17)   Enforce the regulations contained within this ordinance related
to floodplain and flood damage prevention as outlined in

ARTICLE 3: REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES
Section
3.1   Common review procedures
3.2   Standards, procedures, and requirements for development applications
§ 3.1 COMMON REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   Applications for development approval shall utilize the procedures set forth
in this section.
   3.1.1   Authority to file applications.
      (A)   General. Applications submitted under this in accordance with
division
3.1.5, Application Submission, shall be submitted by the landowner, a lessee or
person holding an option or contract to purchase or lease the land, or an
authorized agent of the landowner. An easement holder may also apply for
development approval for such development as is authorized by the easement.
      (B)   Applicant not the owner. If the applicant is not the owner (or sole
owner) of the land, or is a contract purchaser of the land, a notarized form
supplied by the town and signed by the owner(s) consenting to the submission of
the application shall be submitted along with all the required application
information, with the exception of applications to amend the Official Zoning
Map initiated by the Town Council, Planning Board, or Ordinance Administrator
subject to divisions
3.2.(C) of this ordinance.
   3.1.2   Application content. The Ordinance Administrator shall establish the
requirements for the general form and content of applications required by this
ordinance. These shall be in addition to any specific application content
requirements established by the ordinance.
   3.1.3   Fees. The Town Council shall establish, and may modify from time to
time, a schedule of fees that must be paid in full prior to the review of any
submitted application.
   3.1.4   Submission and review schedule. The Ordinance Administrator shall
establish a submission and review schedule (including time frames for review)
for development applications. This schedule may be amended and updated as
determined necessary.
   3.1.5   Application submission. All applications shall be submitted to the
Ordinance Administrator on such forms and in such numbers as have been
established for that type of development application. Applications which do not
meet the requirements of division
3.1.6, Determination of Completeness, shall not be considered to be submitted,
and their review shall be deferred until such time that all requirements of
that division  have been fulfilled. The Ordinance Administrator may require a
pre-submittal conference prior to any application, at the applicant’s expense.
   3.1.6   Determination of completeness.
      (A)   Review for completeness. Upon the receipt of an application, the
Ordinance Administrator shall review the application for completeness. A
complete application is one that:
         (1)   Contains all information and materials established by the
Ordinance Administrator, or set forth elsewhere in the ordinance, for the
particular type of development application;
         (2)   Is in the form established by the Ordinance Administrator for
the particular type of development application;
         (3)   Includes information in sufficient detail to evaluate the
application to determine whether it complies with the appropriate standards of
this ordinance; and
         (4)   Is accompanied by the fee established for the particular type of
application.
      (B)   Incomplete applications. If the application is determined to be
incomplete, the Ordinance Administrator shall notify the applicant of the
deficiencies within ten business days following submittal. Following
notification, the applicant may correct the deficiencies and resubmit the
application for review.
   3.1.7   Permit choice.
      (A)   If a land development regulation is amended by the Town Council
between the time a development permit application was determined to be complete
and a development permit decision is made or if a land development regulation
is amended after a development permit decision has been challenged and found to
be wrongfully denied or illegal, the development permit applicant may choose
which adopted version of the rule or ordinance will apply to the permit and use
of the building, structure, or land indicated on the permit application in the
manner established in G.S. § 143-755. In cases where an applicant has a choice
as to which adopted version of the rule or ordinance shall apply, the applicant
shall notify the town, in writing, as to which adopted version of the rule or
ordinance has been selected.
      (B)   If the development permit applicant chooses the version of the rule
or ordinance applicable at the time of the permit application, the development
permit applicant shall not be required to await the outcome of the amendment to
the rule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development permit.
      (C)   If an applicable rule or ordinance is amended after the development
permit is wrongfully denied or after an illegal condition is imposed, as
determined in a proceeding challenging the permit denial or the condition
imposed, the development permit applicant may choose which adopted version of
the rule or ordinance will apply to the permit and use of the building,
structure, or land indicated on the permit application. Provided, however, any
provision of the development permit applicant's chosen version of the rule or
ordinance that is determined to be illegal for any reason shall not be enforced
upon the applicant without the written consent of the applicant.
      (D)   If a permit application is placed on hold at the request of the
applicant for a period of six consecutive months or more, or the applicant
fails to respond to comments or provide additional information reasonably
requested by the local or state government for a period of six consecutive
months or more, the application review shall be discontinued and the
development regulations in effect at the time permit processing is resumed
shall be applied to the application.
      (E)   Multiple permits for development project. Subject to G.S. § 160D-
108(d), where multiple local development permits are required to complete a
development project, the development permit applicant may choose the version of
each of the local land development regulations applicable to the project upon
submittal of the application for the initial development permit. This provision
is applicable only for those subsequent development permit applications filed
within 18 months of the date following the approval of an initial permit. For
purposes of the vesting protections of this subsection, an erosion and
sedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial development
permit.
   3.1.8   Final approval by the Ordinance Administrator. When an application
that is subject to final approval by the Ordinance Administrator is submitted
and determined to be complete, he or she shall review the application and
approve or deny it based on the standards set forth in the ordinance. Following
his or her approval or denial of the application, the Ordinance Administrator
shall notify the applicant of his or her decision within the time period set
forth in the submission and review schedule.
   3.1.9   Preparation of staff report. When an application which will be
considered by a reviewing or decision-making body is submitted and determined
to be complete, the Ordinance Administrator shall review the application and
prepare a written staff report.
      (A)   The staff report shall be addressed to the reviewing or decision-
making body as appropriate, and shall state whether the application complies
with all appropriate standards of this ordinance and all other applicable
policy documents.
      (B)   The Ordinance Administrator may include a recommendation for
approval or denial of the application in the staff report. Proposed conditions
of approval may also be included in the report to the extent, and in the
manner, allowed by law and specified in this ordinance.
      (C)   A copy of the staff report shall be delivered to the applicant, and
to the landowner(s), if different from the applicant prior to consideration by
a decision-making body.
   3.1.10   Public hearings. Legislative hearings will be scheduled for LDO
text amendments, zoning map amendments, Conditional Zoning District
classifications, and the establishment of vested rights. The  Ordinance
Administrator shall be responsible for scheduling public hearings for all
applications for which one is required. The hearing may be scheduled for either
a regular meeting or a special called meeting of the Town Council. Hearings
shall be scheduled in a manner that will allow sufficient time for public
notice to be given in accordance with statutory requirements.
   3.1.11   Public notification of legislative decisions.
      (A)   Content. All public notices required under this ordinance shall
comply with G.S. §§ 160D-601 and 160D-602. Additionally, all notices, except
for posted notices shall:
         (1)   Identify the date, time, and location of the public hearing;
         (2)   Identify the property involved by the street address (if
applicable) or by the legal description and/or parcel identification number
(PIN);
         (3)   Describe the nature and scope of the proposed action;
         (4)   Indicate that interested parties may appear at public hearings
and speak on the matter; and
         (5)   Indicate how additional information on the matter can be
obtained.
      (B)   Published notice. When the provisions of this ordinance require
that notice of a public hearing be published pursuant to G.S. § 160D-601, the
Ordinance Administrator shall publish a notice of the public hearing once a
week for two successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the
town. The first notice shall be published not less than ten days nor more than
25 days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. In computing such period, the
day of publication is not included but the day of the hearing shall be
included.
      (C)   Mailed notice.
         (1)   When the provisions of this ordinance require that mailed notice
be provided pursuant to G.S. § 160D-602, the Ordinance Administrator shall
prepare a notice of the public hearing and deliver the notice via first class
mail to the following persons:
            (i)   The applicant;
            (ii)   Listed property owner(s) directly affected by the proposed
action if the applicant is not the owner;
            (iii)   Listed owners of adjacent property (this includes adjacent
properties even if they are separated by a street, railroad, or other
transportation corridor); and
            (iv)   Listed owners of property lying within 500 feet of the
boundary of the subject property or zoning district boundary, as applicable.
         (2)   Mailed notices shall be deposited in the mail no fewer than ten
days and no more than 25 days prior to the date of the public hearing.
         (3)   The Ordinance Administrator shall certify to the Town Council
that the required mailed notice procedures have been followed. This
certification shall be conclusive evidence that the terms of this division have
been met as set forth in G.S. § 160D-602.
         (4)   Mailed notice shall not be required when an application to amend
the Official Zoning Map includes more than 50 different lots or tracts, owned
by at least 50 different landowners, provided that the town publishes a notice
(occupying at least one-half of a newspaper page) in a newspaper of general
circulation once a week for two consecutive weeks beginning at least ten but
not more than 25 days prior to the public hearing date. Affected landowners
residing outside of the newspaper’s circulation area shall be notified via
first class mail in accordance with the procedures set forth in divisions (C)
(1) and (C)(2) above.
      (D)   Posted notice.
         (1)   When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the Ordinance
Administrator shall prominently post the notice on the subject property or on
an adjacent public street or highway right- of-way at least ten days prior to
the first public hearing. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed
zoning map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not required, but
the town shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to
interested persons. In computing such period, the day of the posting shall not
be counted, but the day of the hearing shall be counted. Posted notices shall
remain in place until such time that the approving authority has rendered its
final decision on the matter.
         (2)   If no part of the subject property is visible from a public
right-of-way, the notice shall be posted along the nearest street in the public
right-of-way in such a manner as to ensure consistency with the intent of this
division (D).
      (E)   Constructive notice.
         (1)   Minor defects in any notice shall not impair the notice or
invalidate proceedings pursuant to the notice if a bona fide attempt has been
made to comply with the applicable notice requirements. Minor defects in
notices may include, but are not limited to:
            (i)   Errors in legal descriptions; or
            (ii)   Typographical or grammatical errors that do not impede the
communication of the notice to affected parties.
         (2)   Failure of an affected party to receive written notice shall not
invalidate subsequent action. In all cases, however, the requirements for the
timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date, and place of a public
hearing or meeting and the location of the subject property(ies) shall be
strictly adhered to.
         (3)   If question arises at the hearing regarding the adequacy of the
notice, the reviewing or decision-making body shall direct the Ordinance
Administrator to make a formal finding as to whether there was substantial
compliance with the notice requirements of this ordinance, and such findings
shall be made available to the reviewing or decision-making body prior to
further action being taken on the request.
      (F)   Summary of notice requirements. The following table summarizes the
public notice requirements for development applications requiring legislative
decisions.

   3.1.12   Public notification of quasi-judicial decisions. Evidentiary
hearings will be scheduled for special use permits, variance, watershed
variances, floodplain variances, and appeals of administrative decisions. The
Ordinance Administrator shall be responsible for scheduling evidentiary
hearings for all applications for which one is required. The hearing may be
scheduled for either a regular meeting or a special called meeting of the Board
of Adjustment. Hearings will be scheduled in a manner that allows sufficient
time for notice to be given in accordance with statutory requirements.
   3.1.13   Notice of evidentiary hearings. Notice of evidentiary hearings
shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request
is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject
of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all
parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing;
and to any other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by the land
development ordinance. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the town may
rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of property entitled to
mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten days, but
not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time
period, the town shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the
site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway
right-of-way. The Board of Adjustment may continue an evidentiary hearing that
has been convened to a date certain that is specified during an evidentiary
hearing without further advertisement. If an evidentiary hearing is set for a
given date and a quorum of the Board of Adjustment is not then present, the
hearing shall be continued until the next regular Board meeting without further
advertisement.
   3.1.14   Administrative materials. The Ordinance Administrator shall
transmit to the Board of Adjustment all applications, reports, and written
materials relevant to the matter being considered. The administrative materials
may be distributed to the members of the board prior to the hearing if at the
same time they are distributed to the Board a copy is also provided to the
appellant or applicant and to the landowner if that person is not the appellant
or applicant. The administrative materials shall become a part of the hearing
record. The administrative materials may be provided in written or electronic
form. Objections to inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials may be
made before or during the hearing. Rulings on unresolved objections shall be
made by the Board at the hearing.
   3.1.15   Presentation of evidence. The applicant, the local government, and
any person who would have standing to appeal the decision under G.S. § 160D-
1402(c) shall have the right to participate as a party at the evidentiary
hearing. Other witnesses may present competent, material, and substantial
evidence that is not repetitive as allowed by the Board. Objections regarding
jurisdictional and evidentiary issues, including, but not limited to, the
timeliness of an appeal or the standing of a party, may be made to the Board of
Adjustment. The Board Chair shall rule on any objections, and the Chair's
rulings may be appealed to the full Board. These rulings are also subject to
judicial review pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1402. Objections based on
jurisdictional issues may be raised for the first time on judicial review.
   3.1.16   Appearance of official. The official who made the decision or the
person currently occupying that position, if the decision maker is no longer
employed by the local government, shall be present at the evidentiary hearing
as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters
stated in a notice of appeal. If any party or the local government would be
unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of
appeal, the Board of Adjustment shall continue the hearing.
   3.1.17   Oaths. The Chair of the Board of Adjustment or any member acting as
Chair and the Clerk to the Board are authorized to administer oaths to
witnesses in any matter coming before the Board. Any person who, while under
oath during a proceeding before the Board determining a quasi-judicial matter,
willfully swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   3.1.18   Subpoenas. The Board of Adjustment through the Chair or, in the
Chair's absence, anyone acting as Chair may subpoena witnesses and compel the
production of evidence. To request issuance of a subpoena, the applicant, the
local government, and any person with standing under G.S. § 160D-1402(c) may
make a written request to the Chair explaining why it is necessary for certain
witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The Chair shall issue requested
subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope,
and not oppressive. The Chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a
subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the Chair may be immediately
appealed to the full Board. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena
issued pursuant to this subsection, the Board or the party seeking the subpoena
may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order requiring that its
subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders
after notice to all proper parties.
   3.1.19   Appeals in nature of certiorari. When hearing an appeal pursuant to
G.S. § 160D-947(e) or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing
shall be based on the record below, and the scope of review shall be as
provided in G.S. § 160D-1402(j).
   3.1.20   Voting. The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board shall be
necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to
decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the
nature of certiorari. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on
the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial
matter under G.S. § 160D-109(d) shall not be considered members of the Board
for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates
available to take the place of such members.
   3.1.21   Quasi-judicial decisions. The Board of Adjustment shall determine
contested facts and make its decision within a reasonable time. When hearing an
appeal, the Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
decision appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or
determination that ought to be made. The Board shall have all the powers of the
official who made the decision. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based
upon competent, material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-
judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Board of
Adjustment’s determination of contested facts and their application to the
applicable standards. The written decision shall be signed by the chair or
other duly authorized member of the Board of Adjustment. A quasi-judicial
decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the Town Clerk. The
decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be delivered within a reasonable time
by personal delivery,  electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the
applicant, property owner, and to any person who has submitted a written
request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The
person required to provide notice shall certify that proper notice has been
made.
   3.1.22   Judicial review of quasi-judicial decisions. Every quasi-judicial
decision shall be subject to review by the Superior Court by proceedings in the
nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. § 160D-1402. Appeals shall be filed with
the Clerk of Superior Court by the later of 30 days after the decision is
effective or after a written copy thereof is given in accordance with division
3.1.20. When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three days shall be
added to the time to file the petition. This division
3.1.22, is a summary of state law only and parties are advised to consult the
state’s general statutes which shall govern judicial review of quasi-judicial
decisions.
   3.1.23   Conditions of approval. See applicable standards regarding
conditions of approval for conditional zoning (§
3.2.3(4)(C)), special use permits (§
3.2.4(F)), and variances (§
3.2.5(F)).
      (A)   All other development approvals. In other cases when a decision-
making body may, according to the express terms of this ordinance, approve a
development application with conditions, such body may impose reasonable and
appropriate conditions or restrictions on the approval.
         (1)   The conditions may, as appropriate, ensure compliance with the
general goals and policies of this ordinance, or with particular standards of
this ordinance, in order to prevent or minimize adverse effects from the
proposed development on surrounding lands.
         (2)   Limitations. The restrictions and conditions imposed must be
directly related, in both type and scope, to the impact that the proposed
development would have on the public and surrounding lands. All conditions
imposed shall be expressly set forth in the motion by the decision-making body
to approve the development application.
         (3)   Conditions of approval included as part of the decision on a
development application shall be accepted, in writing, by the applicant prior
to delivery of written notification of a decision or filing of a final order.
   3.1.24   Deferral of application.
      (A)   Request prior to publication of notice. An applicant may request
that a decision-making body’s consideration of an application at a public
hearing be deferred by submitting a written request for deferral to the
Ordinance Administrator prior to the publication of notice for the public
hearing. The Ordinance Administrator may grant such requests for good cause.
The date of the new public hearing at which the application will be heard shall
be set at the time the deferral is granted.
      (B)   Request after publication of notice. If a request for deferral of
consideration of an application by a decision-making body is submitted
subsequent to publication of notice, the request for deferral shall be placed
on the public hearing agenda and acted upon by the decision-making body. The
decision-making body may grant such requests for good cause. The date of the
new public hearing at which the application will be heard shall be set at the
time the deferral is granted. If a deferral is granted, the application may be
subject to additional application fees to defray the costs of processing the
application and advertising the public hearing, if any. Any additional fees
must be paid to the town prior to the readvertisement of the public hearing
notice.
   3.1.25   Changes to application after notice of public hearing.
      (A)   Clerical errors. Minor additions, deletions, or corrections
constituting clerical errors in an application may be made without referral of
the application, as amended, back to the Ordinance Administrator for review and
preparation of a staff report, or to any review bodies as is required for the
original review of the application.
      (B)   Major changes. No substantive changes to a development application
related to uses, densities, intensities, street layout, access, open space
configuration, or other major element shall be made after notification of a
public hearing. Major changes by the applicant after notification of a public
hearing require that the original application be withdrawn and a new
application be submitted along with any required fees. The resubmitted
application must go through the entire review process as if it were a new
application in order to ensure the proper review of all changes.
      (C)   Conditions of approval. Proposed changes in conditions of approval
may be considered by the Town Council or Board of Adjustment without referral
back to the Ordinance Administrator or other recommending body.
   3.1.26   Withdrawal of application.
      (A)   Submission of request. Any request for withdrawal of an application
subject to a public hearing shall be submitted in writing to the Ordinance
Administrator, or shall be made through a verbal request at the public hearing
for which the application has been scheduled.
      (B)   Prior to notice of public hearing. The Ordinance Administrator
shall approve a request for withdrawal of an application if it has been
submitted prior to public notification of the application.
      (C)   Subsequent to notice of public hearing.
         (1)   If the request for withdrawal of an application is submitted
subsequent to public notification, the request for withdrawal shall be placed
on the public hearing agenda and acted upon by the decision-making body.
         (2)   Whenever an application subject to a requirement for a public
hearing before the Town Council is withdrawn after public notification, but
prior to a decision by the Town Council, no similar application may be
submitted for the same property for a period of 90 days following the
withdrawal.
      (D)   Fees. Fees shall not be refunded for withdrawn applications.
      (E)   Waiting period. No more than two withdrawals of the same type of
development application for the same property may be filed within any single
12-month period, and no similar type of application may be filed for the same
land within one year following the second withdrawal.
      (F)   Notification of decision to applicant. Within a reasonable period
of time after a decision on an application, the Town Clerk shall notify the
applicant of the decision in writing. Applicants may request delivery of a
written notice of decision via first class mail, electronic mail, or in-person
receipt. Within a reasonable period of time after the decision, a copy of the
decision shall also be made available to the public in the office of the Town
Clerk.
      (G)   Lapse of approval. Lapse of approval (also referred to as
“expiration”) shall occur as provided by this ordinance for the various types
of development applications. If no provision for lapse is given by this
ordinance for a particular type of development permit or approval, and if no
lapse period is imposed as part of an approval by the decision-making body,
lapse shall occur if development is not commenced or a subsequent permit
authorized by that approval, or an extension is not obtained within two years.
Withdrawal of an application by an applicant shall render the application and
any associated approval null and void upon withdrawal.
      (H)   Examination of application and supporting documents. At any time
upon reasonable request and during normal business hours, any person may
examine an application, a finalized staff report and materials submitted in
support of or in opposition to an application in the office of the Town Clerk.
Copies of such materials shall be made available at a reasonable cost.

downzones property in accordance with the definition of downzoning included in
this ordinance and consistent with the definition provided in G.S. § 160D-601
(d) shall be initiated nor is it enforceable without the written consent of all
property owners whose property is the subject of the downzoning amendment.
      (E)   Conditional Zoning District classification distinguished.
         (1)   Applications for an amendment to the Official Zoning Map that
are accompanied by applicant sponsored conditions or limitations shall be
considered as a Conditional Zoning District classification, and shall be
reviewed in accordance with this division and division 3.2.3, Conditional
Zoning District Classification.
         (2)   In no case shall an application for an amendment to the Official
Zoning Map be converted into an application for a Conditional Zoning District
classification, nor shall an application for a Conditional Zoning District
classification be converted into an application for a Zoning Map Amendment. If
such a conversion is desired by the applicant, he or she shall withdraw the
original request and resubmit a new application and any required fees for the
desired process.
      (F)   Procedures.
            (1)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures and
requirements for submission and review of an application are established in §
3.1, Common Review Procedures.
         (2)   Review and recommendation by Ordinance Administrator. Prior to

recommendation, and any comments given by the public on the matter. Within a
reasonable period of time, the Planning Board shall make a written
recommendation to the Town Council.
            (ii)   In making its recommendation, the Planning Board shall
advise and comment on whether the proposed action is consistent with any
comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan
that is applicable, in accordance with G.S. § 160D-604(d).
            (iii)   The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation
to the governing board that addresses plan consistency and other matters as
deemed appropriate by the Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board
that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not
preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the governing
board.
            (iv)   If a zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning
designation of more than 50 properties, owned by at least 50 different property
owners, and therefore qualifies as a large-scale rezoning under G.S. § 160D-602
(b), the Planning Board statement describing plan consistency may address the
overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant
adopted plans were considered in the recommendation made.
         (4)   Review and action by Town Council. Following the receipt of a
recommendation from the Planning Board, the Town Council shall conduct a
legislative hearing to review and consider the application, the relevant

            (i)   Regardless of the decision on the application, the Town
Council shall approve a brief statement describing whether its action is
consistent or inconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan.
            (ii)   If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was
deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the
effect of also amending the future land use map in the approved plan, and no
additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required.
            (iii)   If a zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning
designation of more than 50 properties, owned by at least 50 different property
owners, and therefore qualifies as a large-scale rezoning under G.S. § 160D-602
(b), the governing board statement describing plan consistency may address the
overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant
adopted plans were considered in the action taken.
         (6)   Council reasonableness review.
            (i)   When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map
amendment, a statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning
shall be approved by the governing board. This statement of reasonableness may
consider, among other factors:
               (a)   The size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the
area proposed to be rezoned;
               (b)   The benefits and detriments to the landowners, the
neighbors, and the surrounding community;
               (c)   The relationship between the current actual and
permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development
that would be permissible under the proposed amendment;
               (d)   Why the action taken is in the public interest; and
               (e)   Any changed conditions warranting the amendment.
            (ii)   If a zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning
designation of more than 50 properties, owned by at least 50 different property
owners, and therefore qualifies as a large-scale rezoning under G.S. § 160D-602
(b), the governing board statement on reasonableness may address the overall
rezoning.
            (iii)   The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency
statement required by this section may be approved as a single statement.
         (7)   Citizen comment. If anyone submits a written statement regarding
a proposed zoning map amendment to the Town Clerk within two days of the date
the matter is to be voted on by the Town Council, the Town Clerk shall deliver
the written statement to the Town Council, who may, at it its sole discretion,
take the written statement under advisement.
      (G)   Zoning map amendment standards. Amending the Official Zoning Map is
a matter committed to the legislative discretion of the Town Council. In
determining whether to approve or deny a proposed amendment, the Town Council
shall consider and weigh the relevance of the following factors.
         (1)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment is
consistent with the comprehensive plan, Land Use Plan, and any other relevant
plans;
         (2)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment
addresses a demonstrated community need;
         (3)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment is
compatible with existing and proposed uses surrounding the land subject to the
amendment;
         (4)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment would
result in a logical and orderly pattern of development;
         (5)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment would

Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive
plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by
the governing board.
            (4)   Review and action by Town Council. Following the receipt of a
recommendation from the Planning Board, the Town Council shall conduct a public
hearing to review and consider the application, the relevant supporting
materials, the Ordinance Administrator’s recommendation, the  recommendation of
the Planning Board, and the comments given during the hearing (if any).
Following the close of the public hearing, the Town Council shall take one of

whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with the adopted comprehensive
plan.
            (6)   Citizen comment. If anyone submits a written statement
regarding a proposed land development ordinance text amendment to the Town
Clerk within two days of the date the matter is to be voted on by the Town
Council, the Town Clerk shall deliver the written statement to the Town
Council, who may, at it its sole discretion, take the written statement under
advisement.
      (E)   Land development ordinance text amendment standards. Amending the
text of the land development ordinance is a matter committed to the legislative
discretion of the Town Council. In determining whether to approve or deny a
proposed amendment, the Town Council shall consider and weigh the relevance of
the following factors:
         (1)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment is
consistent with the comprehensive plan, the Land Use Plan, and any other
relevant plans;
         (2)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment
addresses a demonstrated community need;
         (3)   Whether the proposed amendment is in conflict with any other
provision of this ordinance or other related town regulations;
         (4)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment is
consistent with the purpose of the zoning districts in the ordinance, or will
improve compatibility among uses and will ensure efficient development in the
town; and
         (5)   Whether, and to the extent which, the proposed amendment would
result in significantly adverse impacts on the natural environment.
   3.2.3   Conditional Zoning District classification.
      (A)   Purpose. A Conditional Zoning District classification allows
particular land uses to be established only in accordance with specific
standards and conditions adopted as part of the establishment of the district.
In cases where the standards of a Base Zoning District are inadequate to ensure
the compatibility of a proposed development with immediately surrounding lands,
the landowner may apply for an amendment to the Official Zoning Map to a
Conditional Zoning District classification. Conditional Zoning Districts are
subject to additional conditions or restrictions above and beyond the standards
of  the parallel Base Zoning District as a means of ensuring compatibility of
the proposed development with the use of neighboring lands.
      (B)   Procedure. Approval of a Conditional Zoning District classification
shall require an amendment to the Official Zoning Map (using the procedures
established in division
3.2.1, Zoning Map Amendment) accompanied by the submission of applicant
sponsored conditions limiting the scope of the development proposal and a
concept plan (reviewed in accordance with division
3.2.6(D)(3), Concept Plan - Conditional Zoning District classification).
            (1)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures and
requirements for submission and review of an application are established in §
3.1, Common Review Procedures. Applications for a conditional zoning district
application shall be signed by all landowners of the property subject to the
request.
            (2)   Concept plan review by the Ordinance Administrator.
Applications for a Conditional Zoning District classification shall be subject
to review of a concept plan (see division
3.2.6, Concept Plan) by the Ordinance Administrator prior to the preparation of
a staff report. Establishment of development identified in a concept plan may
not take place until a site plan, in substantial conformity with the approved
concept plan, is approved in accordance with division
3.2.7, Site Plan. An applicant may choose to file a site plan with a
Conditional Zoning District classification, which shall be reviewed by the
Ordinance Administrator prior to consideration by the Planning Board. In cases
where a Conditional Zoning District classification application includes a site
plan, the Town Council shall render a decision on the site plan. In cases where
a site plan is submitted, all stormwater and public infrastructure aspects must
comply with all applicable town and governmental agency requirements before the
site plan may be approved.
            (3)   Review and recommendation by the Planning Board. After the
review of the concept plan and the preparation of a staff report, the
application shall be referred to the Planning Board for review and
recommendation. During the meeting, the Planning Board shall consider the
application, the relevant supporting materials, the concept plan, the staff
report, and the public comments given at the meeting. Within a reasonable
period of time, the Planning Board shall make a written recommendation to the
Town Council. This shall include a plan consistency review following the
procedures in §
3.2.1(F)(3).
            (4)   Review and action by Town Council. Following the receipt of a
recommendation from the Planning Board, the Town Council shall hold a
legislative hearing on the application. At the public hearing, the Town Council
shall consider the application, the relevant supporting materials, the concept
plan, the staff report, the recommendation of the Planning Board, and comments
given at the public hearing (if any). After the close of the public hearing,
the Town Council shall, by a simple majority of all members present and
qualified to vote, approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application.
This shall include a plan consistency review following the procedures in §
3.2.1(F)(5) and a reasonableness review following the procedures in §
3.2.1(F)(6).
      (C)   Conditions. Specific conditions of approval may be proposed by the
petitioner or the town.
         (1)   Only those conditions approved by the town and consented to by
the petitioner in writing may be incorporated into the zoning regulations.
         (2)   All conditions shall be expressly set forth in the motion by the
decision-making body to approve the development application.
         (3)   Unless consented to by the petitioner in writing, the town may
not require, enforce, or incorporate into the zoning regulations any condition
or requirement not authorized by otherwise applicable law, including, without
limitation, taxes, impact fees, building design elements within the scope of
G.S. § 160D-702(b), driveway-related improvements in excess of those allowed in
G.S. §§ 136-18(29) and 160A-307, or other unauthorized limitations on the
development or use of land.
         (4)   Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional
district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the
development and use of the site to local government ordinances, plans adopted
pursuant to G.S. § 160D-501, or the impacts reasonably expected to be generated
by the development or use of the site.
         (5)   No use shall be authorized within a Conditional Zoning District
except those uses proposed by the applicant and approved by the Town Council.
In no case shall any use prohibited within a parallel Base Zoning District be
authorized in a corresponding Conditional District.
         (6)   No condition shall be less restrictive than the parallel Base
Zoning District or any applicable Overlay District standards.
         (7)   No condition shall be included that specifies the ownership
status, race, religion, or character of the occupants of dwelling units, the
minimum value of improvements, or any other exclusionary device.
         (8)   No changes in the concept plan, site plan, or proposed
conditions that are less restrictive than those in the application (e.g.,
smaller setbacks, more dwelling units, greater height, more access points, new
uses, fewer improvements, and the like) shall be proposed by the applicant
following public notification. Nothing in this division
3.2.3(C)(4) shall limit the application of new or more restrictive conditions
after public notification, provided such conditions are received by the
Ordinance Administrator in writing and signed by all owners of the property at
least ten business days prior to the final decision on the application by the
Town Council.
         (9)   In addition to any conditions proposed by the applicant, the
Town Council may attach any additional conditions in accordance with division
3.1.23, Conditions of Approval (e.g., limitations on location, hours of
operation, extent of the proposed uses, and the like), but the Town Council
shall not attach a condition that requires a landowner to waive a vested right.
      (D)   Effect of approval. Lands subject to a Conditional Zoning District
classification shall also be subject to the approved concept plan and approved
conditions. The approved concept plan and conditions shall constitute the
standards for the approved Conditional Zoning District, and are binding on the
land as an amendment to this ordinance and the Official Zoning Map.
      (E)   Designation. A Conditional Zoning District classification shall
bear the same designation as the parallel Base Zoning District, but shall also
include the suffix “CD.”
      (F)   Changes to an approved conditional zoning. The owners of individual
parcels may apply for a minor deviation or an amendment so long as the change
would not result in other properties failing to meet the terms of the
conditions. Any approved changes shall only be applicable to those properties
whose owners petitioned for the change.
      (G)   Minor deviation. The Ordinance Administrator is authorized to
review and approve a minor deviation to a concept plan, site plan, or approved
conditions if the proposed revision meets all of the following limitations:
         (1)   It does not involve a change in uses permitted or the density of
overall development permitted;
         (2)   It complies with the intent of both the underlying zoning
standards and other applicable conditions of the approval; and
         (3)   It involves technical considerations which could not be
reasonably anticipated during the approval process, or any other change which
has no material effect on the character of the approved development or any if
its approved conditions.
   For example, minor deviations shall include, but not be limited to, the
following if they comply with the provisions in (G)(1), (G)(2), and (G)(3) in
this subsection:
            (a)   Driveway relocations;
            (b)   Structure floor plan revisions;
            (c)   Facility design modifications for amenities and other site
features;
            (d)   Adjustments to road configuration or internal circulation;
            (e)   Adjustments to building location;
            (f)   Minor adjustments to landscaping;
            (g)   Adjustments to lot configuration; and
            (h)   Adjustments to utility alignment and/or stormwater
facilities.
      (H)   Amendment. Changes that do not qualify as minor deviations shall be
amendments that may only be considered in accordance with the procedure used to
establish the Conditional Zoning District.
      (I)   Expiration. In cases where the town has proposed, and the applicant
has accepted, a condition of approval permitting the town to initiate a zoning
map amendment in accordance with division
3.2.1 to remove a Conditional Zoning District classification and revert the
land to its prior conventional zoning district classification (or the closest
corresponding conventional zoning district) unless an application for a
building permit (or other similar permit for uses which do not involve the
construction of a structure) for any part of the associated concept plan is
submitted within two years of the initial approval, the town may initiate such
amendment without additional landowner consent. Such time period shall not be
extended with transfer of ownership.
      (J)   Extension. Upon written application by the owner, submitted at
least 30 days prior to the expiration of the Conditional Zoning District
classification, and in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not
limited to, extreme weather events, economic cycles, and market conditions, the
Town Council may grant one extension, not to exceed six months, for an
applicant to obtain a building permit (or other similar permit for uses which
do not involve the construction of a structure). Failure to obtain a building
permit (or other similar permit for uses which do not involve the construction
of a structure) within the time established in the extension may result in the
town initiating a zoning  map amendment to remove the Conditional Zoning
District classification and revert the land to its prior conventional zoning
district classification (or the closest corresponding conventional zoning
district).
   3.2.4   Special use permit.
      (A)   Purpose. Special uses are uses that are generally compatible with
the other uses permitted in a zoning district, but require individual review of
their location, design, configuration, density and intensity of use, and
usually require the imposition of conditions to ensure the appropriateness of
the use at a particular location.
      (B)   Authority. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to review and
decide applications for special use permits in accordance with this section.
Only those uses identified as special uses in
Table 7-1, Table of Permitted Uses, are authorized to be considered as special
uses under this section. The designation of a use as a special use does not
constitute an authorization that such use shall be approved through a special
use permit in accordance with this section. Rather, each proposed special use
shall be evaluated by the Board of Adjustment for compliance with the standards
set forth in this section and the applicable standards for the use in §
7.3, Use Specific Standards (if applicable).
      (C)   Initiation. Application for a special use permit may only be
initiated by the owner(s), an authorized agent, lessee, or contract purchaser
(s), of the property for which the special use permit is designated in
accordance with division
3.1.1.
      (D)   Procedures.
            (1)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures and
requirements for submission and review of an application are established in §
3.1, Common Review Procedures.
            (2)   Concept plan required. A concept plan must be submitted as
part of the application for a special use permit. The concept plan shall
conform to the requirements set forth in division
3.2.6(E), Concept Plan Standards. Establishment of a special use identified in
a concept plan may not take place until a site plan, in substantial conformity
with the approved concept plan, is approved in accordance with division
3.2.7, Site Plan. An applicant may choose to file a site plan with a special
use permit application, which shall be reviewed by the Ordinance Administrator
prior to consideration by the Board of Adjustment. In cases where a special use
permit application includes a site plan, the Board of Adjustment shall render a
decision on the site plan. In cases where a site plan is submitted, all
stormwater and public infrastructure aspects must comply with all applicable
town and governmental agency requirements before the site plan may be approved.
            (3)   Action by Board of Adjustment. After proper notice and
scheduling of a public hearing following the procedures in §§
3.1.12 and
3.1.13, the Board of Adjustment shall conduct a quasi-judicial public hearing
on the application following the procedures in §§
3.1.14 through
3.1.21. At the public hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the
application, the relevant supporting materials, the concept plan, and any
evidence presented at the quasi-judicial public hearing. After the close of the
public hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall approve, approve with conditions,
or deny the application based on the standards in division
3.2.4(E), Special Use Permit Standards. In accordance with the standards set
forth in G.S. § 160D-406(i), granting approval or conditional approval of a
special use permit shall require an affirmative vote of the majority of the
members of the Board of Adjustment who are eligible to vote.
      (E)   Special use permit standards.
         (1)   The proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety,
or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious
to property or improvements in the vicinity.
         (2)   The proposed use is in compliance with all standards in §
7.3, Use Specific Standards.
         (3)   The proposed use is compatible with the character of surrounding
property and uses permitted in the zoning district(s) of surrounding property.
         (4)   The proposed use is configured in a manner to minimize any
adverse effects on surrounding lands.
         (5)   The proposed use will not adversely impact traffic circulation
on or in the vicinity of the site.
         (6)   The proposed use will not be detrimental to the value of
adjacent or nearby property.
         (7)   The proposed use is in full compliance with all other relevant
town laws and ordinances, state and federal laws, and regulations.
      (F)   Conditions of approval. In approving a special use permit, the
Board of Adjustment may impose additional reasonable and appropriate conditions
and safeguards on the permit approval in accordance with G.S. § 160D-705(c).
         (1)   All conditions that are included as part of the approval shall
be consented to in writing by the landowner and the permit applicant before the
special use permit will be issued.
         (2)   Where appropriate, such conditions may include requirements that
street and utility rights-of-way be dedicated to the public and that provision
be made for recreational space and facilities.
         (3)   Conditions and safeguards imposed under this subsection shall
not include requirements for which the local government does not have authority
under statute to regulate nor requirements for which the courts have held to be
unenforceable if imposed directly by the local government, including, without
limitation, taxes, impact fees, building design elements within the scope of
G.S. § 160D-702(b), driveway-related improvements in excess of those allowed in
G.S. §§ 136-18(29) and 160A-307, or other unauthorized limitations on the
development or use of land.
      (G)   Effect of approval. Issuance of a special use permit shall
authorize only the particular special use that is approved in the permit. All
subsequent development and use of the property must be in accordance with the
approved special use permit and conditions (if applicable). Nothing in this
division
3.2.4(G) shall prevent the establishment of a different use of land, provided
such use is established in accordance with the requirements in this ordinance.
      (H)   Recordation. When the Board of Adjustment approves a special use
permit, the town shall, at the applicant’s expense, record the special use
permit in the office of the County Register of Deeds within 30 days of its
issuance.
      (I)   Subsequent development. Development authorized by the special use
permit shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other
permits required by this ordinance. A special use permit does not ensure that
the use shall receive subsequent approval for other applications for permit
approval unless the relevant and applicable portions of this ordinance are met.
      (J)   Expiration.
         (1)   General. The Board of Adjustment may prescribe a time limit
within which development activity shall begin or be completed under the special
use permit, or both. Failure to begin or complete such development activity
within the time limit specified shall void the special use permit.  Unless
specified otherwise by the Board of Adjustment, a special use permit shall
automatically expire two years from the date of its issuance if:
            (i)   The development authorized by the permit has not
substantially commenced, as defined in this ordinance; or
            (ii)   The development approved by the special use permit is
discontinued and not resumed for a period of 24 months.
      (K)   Extension. Upon written application submitted at least 30 days
prior to the expiration of the permit period by the applicant, and in light of
all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, extreme weather
events, economic cycles, and market conditions, the Ordinance Administrator may
grant one extension not to exceed six months. Failure to submit an application
for an extension within the time limits established by this division shall
result in the expiration of the special use permit.
      (L)   Minor deviation. The Ordinance Administrator is authorized to
review and approve a minor deviation to a concept plan, site plan, or approved
conditions if the proposed revision meets all of the following limitations:
         (1)    It does not involve a change in uses permitted or the density
of overall development permitted;
         (2)   It complies with underlying zoning standards and other
applicable conditions of the approval; and
         (3)   It involves technical considerations which could not be
reasonably anticipated during the approval process, or any other change which
has no material effect on the character of the approved development or any if
its approved conditions.
   For example, minor deviations shall include, but not be limited to, the
following if they comply with the provisions in (L)(1), (L)(2) and (L)(3) in
this subsection:
            (a)   Driveway relocations;
            (b)   Structure floor plan revisions;
            (c)   Facility design modifications for amenities and other site
features;
            (d)   Minor adjustments to road configuration or internal
circulation;
            (e)   Minor adjustments to building location;
            (f)   Minor adjustments to landscaping;
            (g)   Minor adjustments to lot configuration; and
            (h)   Minor adjustments to utility alignment.
      (M)   Amendments.
         (1)   Changes to a special use permit that do not qualify as minor
deviations may only be made in accordance with the procedures and standards
established for the original approval of a special use permit.
         (2)   If multiple parcels of land are subject to a special use permit,
the owners of individual parcels may apply for a permit modification so long as
the modification would not result in other properties failing to meet the terms
of the special use permit or regulations. Any modifications approved apply only
to those properties whose owners apply for the modification.
   3.2.5   Variance.
      (A)   Purpose. The purpose of a variance is to allow certain deviations
from the standards of this ordinance (such as height, yard setback, lot
coverage, or similar numeric standards), when the landowner demonstrates that,
owing to special circumstances or conditions beyond the landowner’s control
(such as exceptional topographical conditions, narrowness, shallowness, or the
shape of a specific parcel of land), the literal application of the standards
would result in undue and unique hardship to the landowner and the deviation
would not be contrary to the public interest. Variances to the standards
established in
Article 15, Watershed Protection or
Article 16, Flood Damage Prevention shall be subject to additional requirements
as set forth in divisions
3.2.5(J) and
3.2.5(K) respectively.
      (B)   Authority. The Board of Adjustment shall review and decide any
applications for variances from the requirements of this ordinance in
accordance with this division
3.2.5.
      (C)   Initiation. Application for a variance may only be initiated by the
owner(s), an authorized agent, lessee, or contract purchaser(s), of the
property for which the variance is designated in accordance with division
3.1.1.
      (D)   Procedures.
         (1)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures and
requirements for submission and review of an application are established in §
3.1, Common Review Procedures.
         (2)   Action by Board of Adjustment. After appropriate notice has been
given, the Board of Adjustment shall conduct a quasi-judicial hearing on the
application. At the hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the
application, the relevant support materials and the sworn testimony given at
the public hearing. Within a reasonable time following the close of the public
hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall approve, approve with conditions, or
deny the application based on the standards in division
3.2.5(E), Required Findings of Fact. In accordance with the standards set forth
in G.S. § 160D-406, granting approval or conditional approval of a variance
shall require an affirmative vote of at least four-fifths of the members of the
Board of Adjustment who are eligible to vote.
      (E)   Required findings of fact. When unnecessary hardships would result
from carrying out the strict letter of the LDO, the Board of Adjustment shall
vary any of the provisions of the LDO upon a showing of all of the following.
         (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the regulation. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence
of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
         (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. A variance may be granted when
necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal
Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
         (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant
or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with the knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as self-created hardship.
         (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose,
and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and
substantial justice is achieved.
      (F)   Conditions of approval. In approving a variance, the Board of
Adjustment may impose additional appropriate conditions on the variance
provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. All
conditions that are included as part of the approval shall be consented to in
writing by the landowner and the permit applicant, if different from the
landowner, before the variance is issued.
      (G)   Recordation. When the Board of Adjustment grants a variance, the
town shall, at the applicant’s expense, record the written decision on the
variance in the office of the County Register of Deeds within 30 days of its
issuance.
      (H)   Subsequent development. Development authorized by the variance
shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other permits
required by this ordinance. A variance does not ensure that the use shall
receive subsequent approval for other applications for permit approval unless
the relevant and applicable portions of this ordinance are met.
      (I)   Variance runs with the land. A variance is not a personal right,
but runs perpetually with the land for which the variance has been granted. As
such, the provisions of an approved variance shall continue with the transfer
of ownership of the land.
      (J)   Additional standards for watershed variances including variances
under stormwater requirements for new development implementing the Falls Lake
rules.
         (1)   The following additional requirements set out in 15A NCAC 02B
.0104 shall apply to watershed variances and to variances from the provisions
of this ordinance implementing the Falls Lake rules:
            (i)   A description of each project receiving a variance and the
reason for granting the variance shall be submitted to the Environmental
Commission on an annual basis by January 1.
            (ii)   Board of Adjustment may attach conditions to the major or
minor variance approval that support the purpose of the applicable local
watershed protection ordinance.
            (iii)   If the variance request qualifies as a major variance, and
the Board of Adjustment decides in favor of granting the major variance, the
Board of Adjustment shall then prepare a preliminary record of the hearing and
submit it to the Environmental Management Commission for review and approval.
            (iv)   If the Environmental Management Commission approves the
major variance or approves with conditions or stipulations added, then the
Environmental Management Commission shall prepare an Environmental Management
Commission decision which authorizes the Board of Adjustment to issue a final
decision which would include any conditions or stipulations added by the
Environmental Management Commission.
            (v)   If the Environmental Management Commission denies the major
variance, then the Environmental Management Commission shall prepare an
Environmental Management Commission decision to be sent to the Board of
Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall prepare a final decision denying the
major variance.
            (vi)   For all proposed major and minor variances, the town shall
notify and allow a reasonable comment period for all other local governments
having jurisdiction within the watershed area governed by the applicable rules
and the entity using the water supply for consumption.
            (vii)   Appeals from the Board of Adjustment’s decision on a major
or minor variance request are made on certiorari to the Superior Court. Appeals
from the Environmental Management Commission decision on a major variance
request are made on judicial review to Superior Court.
            (viii)   When the town’s ordinances are more stringent than the
state’s minimum water supply protection rules, a variance to the town’s
ordinance is not considered a major variance as long as the result of the
variance is not less stringent than the state’s minimum requirements.
      (K)   Additional standards for floodplain variances.
         (1)   Additional information required. Applications for a floodplain
variance shall include a written report evaluating the following factors. The
contents of such report shall be considered by the Board of Adjustment as it
makes its ruling on the floodplain variance:
            (i)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;
            (ii)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            (iii)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            (iv)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            (v)   The necessity of a waterfront location for the facility,
where applicable;
            (vi)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
            (vii)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            (viii)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan and floodplain management program for that area;
            (ix)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            (x)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            (xi)   The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         (2)   Conditions for floodplain variances.
            (i)   Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
            (ii)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
or non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge.
            (iii)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
            (iv)   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval.
            (v)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
               (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
               (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and
               (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         (3)   Variances for solid waste disposal facilities or sites,
hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage
facilities. A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities or
sites, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical
storage facilities that are located in Special Flood Hazard Areas provided that
all of the following conditions are met:
            (i)   The use serves a critical need in the community;
            (ii)   No feasible location exists for the use outside the Special
Flood Hazard Area;
            (iii)   The reference level of any structure is elevated or
floodproofed to at least the regulatory flood protection elevation;
            (iv)   The use complies with all other applicable federal, state,
and local laws; and
            (v)   The town has notified the Secretary of the state’s Department
of Public Safety of its intention to grant a variance at least 30 calendar days
prior to granting the variance.
         (4)   Additional notice requirements.
            (i)   Any applicant to whom a floodplain variance is granted shall
be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood
elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and
that such construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life
and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all floodplain variance actions, including
justification for their issuance.
            (ii)   The Ordinance Administrator shall report all floodplain
variance approvals to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state’s
Department of Crime Control and Public Safety.
   3.2.6   Concept plan.
      (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this division
3.2.6 is to establish a procedure for the review of a concept plan by the
Ordinance Administrator prior to the submittal of an application for site plan
approval or subdivision preliminary plat approval, or as part of an application
for a Conditional Zoning District classification, special use permit, or for a
parcel in one of the Gateway Districts. The intent of the concept plan
procedure is to allow the town to consider the general design and configuration
of a development proposal, and any applicant sponsored conditions, for general
compliance with the requirements of this ordinance prior to the consideration
of a Conditional Zoning District classification or a special use permit by the
bodies charged with their review and approval, or the preparation of highly
technical and detailed engineered drawings required for a site plan or
subdivision preliminary plat approval.
      (B)   Applicability. Submittal of a concept plan shall be required prior
to the consideration of approval of a site plan, subdivision preliminary plat,
Conditional Zoning District classification, or special use permit.

         (1)   Concept plans associated with an application for a site plan or
subdivision preliminary plat approval shall be reviewed by the Ordinance
Administrator, who shall provide written comments on the concept plan to the
applicant. Once an applicant receives comments on a submitted concept plan,
they may then proceed with the preparation of the site plan or subdivision
preliminary plat.
         (2)   Concept plans associated with an application for a Conditional
Zoning District classification or special use permit shall be considered as an
applicant sponsored condition of approval and are further distinguished by the
following.
            (i)   In the case of a Conditional Zoning District classification,
the Ordinance Administrator shall provide his or her recommendation on the
concept plan to the Planning Board, which shall consider the concept plan in
making its own recommendation to the Town Council. Following a recommendation
from the Planning Board, the Town Council may approve, approve with conditions,
or deny approval of a concept plan associated with the application for
Conditional Zoning District classification.
            (ii)   In the case of a special use permit, the Ordinance
Administrator shall review the concept plan for conformance to the ordinance
and forward his or her comments to the Board of Adjustment, which shall
consider the concept plan as it makes its decision on approving, conditionally
approving, or denying approval of the special use permit.
         (3)   Concept plans associated with an application for a site plan or
subdivision preliminary plat in one of the Gateway Districts shall be
considered as an applicant sponsored condition of approval. The Ordinance
Administrator shall provide his or her recommendation on the concept plan to
the Planning Board, which shall consider the concept plan in making its own
recommendation to the Town Council. Following a recommendation from the
Planning Board, the Town Council may approve, approve with conditions, or deny
approval of a concept plan for development in any of the Gateway Districts.
      (D)   Procedures.
         (1)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures for

this instance, the site plan shall be reviewed in the same manner as a concept
plan, and if approved by the Town Council, shall not require subsequent review
in accordance with division
3.2.7, Site Plan. In cases where a site plan is submitted as an alternative to
a concept plan, all stormwater and public infrastructure aspects must comply
with all applicable town and governmental agency requirements before the site
plan may be approved. In the event a site plan approved in this manner requires
an amendment, it shall require a reconsideration as a conditional rezoning
district classification.
         (4)   Concept plan - special use permit.
            (i)   Review by Ordinance Administrator. In the case of a concept
plan submitted in association with an application for a special use permit, the

conformity with the approved concept plan.
            (iv)   Site plan alternative to a concept plan. An applicant for a
special use permit may, in the applicant’s sole discretion, file a site plan
with the application instead of a concept plan. In this instance, the site plan
shall be reviewed in the same manner as a concept plan, and if approved by the
Board of Adjustment, shall not require subsequent review in accordance with
division
3.2.7, Site Plan. In cases where a site plan is submitted as an alternative to
a concept plan, all stormwater and public infrastructure aspects must comply
with all applicable town and governmental agency requirements before the site
plan may be approved. In the event a site plan approved in this manner requires
an amendment, it shall require a reconsideration as a special use permit.
         (5)   Concept plan - Gateway District.
            (i)   Review and recommendation by Ordinance Administrator. In the
case of a concept plan submitted in association with an application for site

as well as all other technical considerations. In addition, the site plan shall
demonstrate that all of the following standards are met:
         (1)   The use is allowed in the zoning district in accordance with
Table 7-1, Table of Permitted Uses;
         (2)   The development and uses in the site plan comply with §
7.3, Use Specific Standards;
         (3)   The development is consistent with the associated concept plan
and applicant sponsored conditions (if applicable).
         (4)   The development proposed in the site plan and its general layout
and design comply with all appropriate standards in this ordinance; and
         (5)   The development complies with all other applicable town
requirements.
      (F)   Effect of approval. The approval of a site plan allows the
applicant to apply for a land development permit to initiate land development
activities in accordance with the approved site plan.
      (G)   Expiration. Site plan approval shall automatically expire at the
end of two years following initial approval if a building permit has not been
issued and construction pursuant to that permit has not commenced for at least
one building in the proposed development. A change in ownership shall not
affect this time frame.
      (H)   Minor deviation. The Ordinance Administrator is authorized to
review and approve a minor deviation to a concept plan or approved conditions
if the proposed revision meets all of the following limitations:
         (1)   It does not involve a change in uses permitted or the density of
overall development permitted;
         (2)   It complies with underlying zoning standards and other
applicable conditions of the approval; and
         (3)   It involves technical considerations which could not be
reasonably anticipated during the approval process, or any other change which
has no material effect on the character of the approved development or any if
its approved conditions.
      For example, minor deviations shall include, but not be limited to, the
following if they comply with the provisions in (H)(1), (H)(1), and (H)(1) in
this subsection:
            (a)   Driveway relocations;
            (b)   Structure floor plan revisions;

      (I)   Amendments.
         (1)   Changes to a site plan that do not qualify as minor deviations
may only be made in accordance with the procedures and standards established
for the original approval of the site plan.
         (2)   Changes to any approved site plan following the issuance of a
land development permit shall require a re-review of a site plan, may void the
land development permit, and may require additional review fees at the
discretion of the Ordinance Administrator.
   3.2.8   Stormwater management permit.
      (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this division is to set forth the
procedures and requirements for the review and approval of a stormwater
management permit that establishes compliance with the standards of §
15.2, Stormwater Requirements for New Development Implementing the Falls Lake
Rules.
      (B)   Applicability. All land development activities must have an
approved stormwater management permit unless specifically exempted by the
development thresholds or general exemption established in division
15.2.4(E)(2). A permit may only be issued subsequent to a properly submitted
and reviewed permit application.
      (C)   Procedures.
         (1)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures and
requirements for submission and review of a stormwater management permit
application are established in §
3.1, Common Review Procedures.
         (2)   Review and decision by Ordinance Administrator. Following the
submission of a complete stormwater management permit application, the
Ordinance Administrator shall review and  approve, approve with modifications,
or deny approval of the stormwater management permit based on the standards in
division
3.2.8(E) Stormwater Management Permit Application.
      (D)   Applications for approval.
         (1)   Concept plan and consultation meeting.
         Before a stormwater management permit application is deemed complete,
the Ordinance Administrator or developer may request a consultation on a
concept plan for the post-construction stormwater management system to be
utilized in the proposed development project. This consultation meeting should
take place at the time of the preliminary plan of subdivision or other early
step in the development process. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the
stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, as well as
to discuss and assess constraints, opportunities and potential approaches to
stormwater management designs before formal site design engineering is
commenced. Local watershed plans, open space plans, and other relevant resource
protection plans should be consulted in the discussion of the concept plan.
         To accomplish this goal, the following information should be included
in the concept plan, which should be submitted in advance of the meeting:
            (i)   Existing conditions/proposed site plans. Existing conditions
and proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a minimum: existing
and proposed topography; perennial and intermittent streams; mapping of
predominant soils from soil surveys (if available); stream and other buffers
and features used in designing buffers and meeting any applicable buffer
requirements; boundaries of existing predominant vegetation; proposed limits of
clearing and grading; and location of existing and proposed roads, buildings,
parking areas, and other impervious surfaces.
            (ii)   Natural resources inventory. A written or graphic inventory
of natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the
commencement of the project. This description should include a discussion of
soil conditions, forest cover, geologic features, topography, wetlands, and
native vegetative areas on the site, as well as the location and boundaries of
other natural feature protection and conservation areas such as lakes, ponds,
floodplains, stream buffers, and other setbacks (e.g., drinking water well
setbacks, septic setbacks, and the like). Particular attention should be paid
to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or
constraints for development and stormwater management.
            (iii)   Stormwater Management System Concept Plan. A written or
graphic concept plan of the proposed post-development stormwater management
system including: preliminary selection and location of proposed engineered
stormwater controls; low-impact design elements; location of existing and
proposed conveyance systems such as grass channels, swales, and storm drains;
flow paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits; relationship of site to
upstream and downstream properties and drainages; and preliminary location of
any proposed stream channel modifications, such as bridge or culvert crossings.
      (E)   Stormwater management permit application. The stormwater management
permit application shall detail how post-development stormwater runoff will be
controlled and managed and how the proposed project will meet the requirements
of divisions
15.1.3 and
15.2.7, Stormwater Management Standards. All such plans shall be prepared by a
registered state professional engineer or a state registered landscape
architect or by a person who has been awarded a stormwater BMP inspection and
maintenance certification by the North Carolina State University Cooperative
Extension. Any such person preparing a plan shall perform services only in
their area of competence, and shall verify that the design of all stormwater
management facilities and practices meets the submittal requirements for
complete applications, that the designs and plans are sufficient to comply with
applicable standards and policies found in the Stormwater BMP Design Manual,
and that the designs and plans ensure compliance with this ordinance.
      (F)   Effect of approval. Approval authorizes the applicant to go forward
with only the specific plans and activities authorized in the permit. The
approval shall not be construed to exempt the applicant from obtaining other
applicable approvals from local, state, and federal authorities.
      (G)   Certification and “as built” plans.
         Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy
shall be granted, the applicant shall certify that the completed project is in
accordance with the approved stormwater management permit and designs
established therewith, and shall submit actual “as-built” plans for all
stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is
completed.
         The plans shall show the final design specifications for all
stormwater management facilities and practices and the field location, size,
depth, and planted vegetation of all measures, controls, and devices, as
installed. The designer of the stormwater management measures and plans shall
certify, under seal, that the as-built stormwater measures, controls, and
devices are in compliance with the approved stormwater management plans and
designs and with the requirements of this ordinance. A final inspection and
approval by the Ordinance Administrator shall occur before the release of any
performance securities.
      (H)   Other permits. No certificate of compliance or occupancy shall be
issued by the town or any agency acting on behalf of the town without final as-
built plans and a final inspection and approval by the Ordinance Administrator,
except where multiple units are served by the stormwater practice or
facilities, in which case the town may elect to withhold a percentage of
permits or certificates of occupancy until as-built plans are submitted and
final inspection and approval has occurred.
      (I)   Expiration.
   An approved plan shall become null and void if the applicant fails to
substantially commence work on the site within one year after the date of
approval. The Ordinance Administrator may grant a single, one-year extension of
this time limit upon receiving a written request from the applicant before the
expiration of the approved permit and in light of all relevant circumstances,
including, but not limited to, extreme weather events, economic cycles, and
market conditions.
   In granting an extension, the Ordinance Administrator may require compliance
with standards adopted since the original application was submitted unless
there has been substantial reliance on the original permit and the change in
standards would infringe the applicant’s vested rights.
   3.2.9   Subdivision.
      (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this division and
Article 14, Subdivision Standards, are to promote the health, safety, and
general welfare of the residents of the town by:
         (1)   Providing for the orderly growth and development of the town;
         (2)   Coordinating streets and roads within proposed subdivisions with

division shall be submitted to the Ordinance Administrator who shall sign a
certificate of exemption (see
Appendix B) on the plat. This certificate must be signed prior to recordation
of the exempt subdivision plat with the County Register of Deeds.
      (D)   Subdivision preliminary plat (major subdivision).
         (1)   General. A subdivision preliminary plat (major subdivision)
establishes the general layout and design for the subdivision. Upon the
approval of a subdivision preliminary plat, applicants may begin to install
streets, public utilities, and other infrastructure. Following installation and
approval of all required infrastructure, applicants may submit an application
for a subdivision final plat. Building permits may not be issued before
approval and recordation of a subdivision final plat.
         (2)   Applicability. The subdivision preliminary plat (major
subdivision) procedures shall be utilized for the subdivision of land where any
of the following apply:
            (i)   New public or private streets are proposed;
            (ii)   Changes to existing public rights-of-way are proposed;
            (iii)   New public utilities are required to serve the proposed
lots;
            (iv)   Flag lots are created or modified;
            (v)   More than five lots are proposed; or
            (vi)   The total land area contained in the subdivision is more

         (3)   Subdivision preliminary plat content standards. The required
contents of a subdivision preliminary plat are shown in
Appendix A, Subdivision Plat Content Standards.
         (4)   Review and approval procedures.
            (i)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures and
requirements for submission and review of a subdivision preliminary plat are
established in §
3.1, Common Review Procedures.
            (ii)   Review of concept plan. Except for the subdivision
activities list in division
3.2.9(C), Exemptions, the submittal and review of a concept plan in accordance
with the standards in division
3.2.6, shall be required prior to the consideration of a subdivision
preliminary plat.
            (iii)   Review and recommendation by Ordinance Administrator.
Following the review of a concept plan, the applicant shall prepare a
subdivision preliminary plat that reflects the configuration depicted in the
finalized concept plan along with any other required information. Once the
complete application and subdivision preliminary plat are submitted, the
Ordinance Administrator shall review the application and submit his or her
recommendation and comments to the Planning Board prior to the meeting at which
they will review the application.
            (iv)   Review and recommendation by Planning Board. Following the
receipt of comments and a recommendation from the Ordinance Administrator, the
Planning Board shall review the proposed subdivision preliminary plat. The
Planning Board shall review the application for consistency with the standards
of this ordinance and with the finalized concept plan that was reviewed by the
Ordinance Administrator. Within 45 days following its initial review, the
Planning Board shall make a recommendation to the Town Council to approve,
conditionally approve, or deny approval of the subdivision preliminary plat.
            (v)   Review and action by Town Council. Following the receipt of a
recommendation from the Planning Board, the Town Council shall review and make
its decision on the submitted subdivision preliminary plat. During its review,
the Town Board shall makes its decision to approve, conditionally approve, or
deny approval of the preliminary plat based on the standards in division
3.2.9(D)(5), Standards for Approval.
         (5)   Standards for approval. A subdivision preliminary plat shall
only be approved upon finding that the application complies with the standards
in
Article 14, Subdivision Standards, all other relevant provisions of this
ordinance, and all other relevant town ordinances, plans, and regulations.
         (6)   Effect of approval. Approval of a subdivision preliminary plat
shall constitute approval of the development with the general lot shapes and
alignments of streets identified in the phases depicted on the approved
preliminary plat. Phases not depicted on an approved subdivision preliminary
plat shall not have preliminary plat approval. Approval of a subdivision
preliminary plat allows the subdivider to proceed with the submittal of
construction drawings for site plan and stormwater management permits the
required infrastructure and utilities. Approval of a subdivision preliminary
plat does not constitute or guarantee approval of a final plat. The approval of
a subdivision preliminary plat is not a personal right, but one which runs with
the land, and, therefore, changes in ownership of the subject property shall
not alter the effect of the approval.
         (7)   Amendment. A subdivision preliminary plat may be amended or
modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards established for
its original approval.
         (8)   Installation and inspection of required improvements. Following
the construction of all required improvements, or the posting of a performance
guarantee for required improvements that are not installed or completed, the
subdivider shall submit a written request for inspection of those improvements.
When all required public improvements and/or performance guarantees have been
approved by the town, the subdivider may apply for subdivision final plat
approval.
         (9)   Performance guarantees. In lieu of meeting the requirement for
the completion, installation, and dedication of any and all public
infrastructure improvements (e.g., underground utilities, streets, sidewalks,
storm drainage, trees, landscaping, buffer plantings, street lights, and the
like) prior to subdivision final plat approval, the town may accept a
performance guarantee in accordance with the standards in this division
3.2.9.
            (i)   Type. The type of the performance guarantee shall be at the
election of the developer. The term PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE means any of the
following forms of guarantee:
               (a)   Surety bond issued by any company authorized to do
business in this state.
               (b)   Letter of credit issued by any financial institution
licensed to do business in this state.
               (c)   Other form of guarantee that provides equivalent security
to a surety bond or letter of credit.
            (ii)   Duration. The duration of the performance guarantee shall
initially be one year, unless the developer determines that the scope of work
for the required improvements necessitates a longer duration. In the case of a
bonded obligation, the completion date shall be set one year from the date the
bond is issued, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the
required improvements necessitates a longer duration.
            (iii)   Inspection.  In cases where a developer has completed the
improvements subject to a performance guarantee, and requested the town to
inspect the improvements, such inspection shall take place within 30 days of
the inspection request unless both parties agree, in advance, to a different
duration in accordance with G.S. § 160D-804.1.
            (iv)   Extension. A developer shall demonstrate reasonable, good
faith progress toward completion of the required improvements that are secured
by the performance guarantee or any extension. If the improvements are not
completed to the specifications of the local government, and the current
performance guarantee is likely to expire prior to completion of the required
improvements, the performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance
guarantee issued, for an additional period. An extension shall only be for a
duration necessary to complete the required improvements. If a new performance
guarantee is issued, the amount shall be determined by the procedure provided
in subdivision (v) of this subsection and shall include the total cost of all
incomplete improvements.
            (v)   Release. The performance guarantee shall be returned or
released, as appropriate, within 30 days of acknowledgment by the town that the
improvements for which the performance guarantee is being required are
complete. The town shall return letters of credit or escrowed funds upon
completion of the required improvements to its specifications or upon
acceptance of the required improvements, if the required improvements are
subject to local government acceptance. When required improvements that are
secured by a bond are completed to the specifications of the town, or are
accepted by the town, if subject to its acceptance, upon request by the
developer, the town shall timely provide written acknowledgment that the
required improvements have been completed.
            (vi)   Amount. The amount of the performance guarantee shall not
exceed 125% of the reasonably estimated cost of completion at the time the
performance guarantee is issued. The town may determine the amount of the
performance guarantee or use a cost estimate determined by the developer. The
reasonably estimated cost of completion shall include 100% of the costs for
labor and materials necessary for completion of the required improvements.
Where applicable, the costs shall be based on unit pricing. The additional 25%
allowed under this subdivision includes inflation and all costs of
administration regardless of how such fees or charges are denominated. The
amount of any extension of any performance guarantee shall be determined
according to the procedures for determining the initial guarantee and shall not
exceed 125% of the reasonably estimated cost of completion of the remaining
incomplete improvements still outstanding at the time the extension is
obtained.
            (vii)   Timing. The town, at its discretion, may require the
performance guarantee to  be posted either at the time the plat is recorded or
at a time subsequent to plat recordation.
            (viii)   Coverage. The performance guarantee shall only be used for
completion of the required improvements and not for repairs or maintenance
after completion.
            (ix)   Legal responsibilities. No person shall have or may claim
any rights under or to any performance guarantee provided pursuant to this
subsection or in the proceeds of any such performance guarantee other than the
following:
               (a)   The town to whom the performance guarantee is provided;
               (b)   The developer at whose request or for whose benefit the
performance guarantee is given;
               (c)   The person or entity issuing or providing the performance
guarantee
      (E)   Subdivision final plat (major subdivision).
         (1)   General. After the inspection and approval of the required
public improvements or the posting of a performance guarantee for improvements
that are not installed or completed, the subdivider shall prepare a subdivision
final plat for review in accordance with this division
3.2.9. The subdivider shall receive approval of a subdivision final plat prior
to the issuance of building permits for structures on lots.

   3.2.12   Tree preservation and protection plan.
      (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this division
3.2.12 is to establish the review and approval procedures for tree preservation
and protection plans submitted in accordance with
Article 11, Tree Preservation and Protection.
      (B)   Applicability. A tree preservation and protection plan shall be
required for all land development activities that are seeking tree preservation
incentives as set forth in §
11.3, Tree Preservation Incentives.
      (C)   Procedure.
         (1)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures and
requirements for submission and review of a tree preservation and protection
plan are established in §
3.1, Common Review Procedures.
            (i)   Review and action by Ordinance Administrator. Following the
receipt of a complete tree preservation and protection plan application, the
Ordinance Administrator shall review the application and either approve,
approve with modifications, or deny approval of the application based  on the
standards in
3.2.12(D), Standards for Approval. If the application is denied, the Ordinance
Administrator shall state the reasons for denial in writing.
      (D)   Standards for approval. To receive approval, and subsequently
incentives and credits, the tree preservation and protection plan must fully
comply with all standards for tree preservation and protection as set forth in
Article 11.
      (E)   Effect of approval. Following approval, the developer may begin the
preparation of the site specific plan that incorporates the approved tree
preservation and protection plan and the credits received for compliance with
the tree preservation and protection standards.
      (F)   Final inspection required. Following the completion of land
development activity, the Ordinance Administrator shall inspect the site for
final compliance with the tree preservation and protection plan. If it is found
that any violations of the approved plan have occurred, then any credits or
incentives associated with those violated portions of the plan shall be revoked
and full compliance shall be required in place of those revoked credits or
incentives.
      (G)   Expiration of approval. Approved tree preservation and protection
plans shall expire one year after their initial approval if development
activity has not substantially commenced. If an approved plan expires, any
associated incentives and/or credits shall be revoked. Credits or incentives
may only be reinstated in accordance with the approval procedures for the
original submission of a tree preservation and protection plan.
   3.2.13   Appeals of administrative decisions and penalties imposed under
Article 15.
      (A)   Right of appeal. Any person who has standing under G.S. § 160D-
1403.1(b) or the town may appeal a decision to the Board of Adjustment.
Penalties imposed under
Article 15 pursuant to the authority granted to the town under G.S. § 143-
215.6A may also be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
      (B)   Appeal standards and procedures.
         (1)   Initiation. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with
the Town Clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.
         (2)   Notice of decision. The official who made the decision shall
give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the
decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the owner.
The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or
by first-class mail.
         (3)   Time to file an appeal. The owner or other party shall have 30
days from the receipt of the written notice within which to file an appeal. Any
other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from the receipt from
any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to
file an appeal.
         (4)   Constructive notice; posting. It shall be conclusively presumed
that all persons with standing to appeal have constructive notice of the
determination from the date a sign providing notice that a determination has
been made is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of the
determination, provided the sign remains on the property for at least 10 days.
The sign shall contain the words “Zoning Decision” or “Subdivision Decision” or
similar language for other determinations in letters at least six inches high
and identifying the means to contact a town official for information about the
decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of the
determination. Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice.
Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant.
Verification of the posting shall be provided to the official who made the
decision. Absent an ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall
not be required.
         (5)   Transmission of record. The official who made the decision shall
transmit to the Board of Adjustment all documents and exhibits constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The official shall also
provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property
that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
         (6)    Schedule of notice and hearing.
            (i)   Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the Clerk to the Board of
Adjustment shall schedule a quasi-judicial hearing and provide public
notification in accordance with the standards in §
3.1, applicable to quasi-judicial hearings.
            (ii)   Subject to the provisions of
3.2.13(D), the Board of Adjustment shall hear the appeal within a reasonable
time.
         (7)   Hearing and decision by Board of Adjustment. The official who
made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness. At the hearing,
the person making the appeal may appear in person or by agent or attorney, and
shall state the grounds for the appeal and identify any materials or evidence
from the record to support the appeal. The appellant shall not be limited at
the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the town
would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the
notice of appeal, the Board of Adjustment shall continue the hearing. In making
its determination, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the application, the
relevant support materials, and the testimony given at the public hearing.
Within 30 days following the close of the public hearing, the Board of
Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision
appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination
that ought to be made based on the record, and the requirements and standards
of this ordinance. The Board of Adjustment shall have all the powers of the
official who made the decision. A majority of the members of the Board of
Adjustment who are eligible to vote shall be required to determine an appeal of
a decision of an administrative official charged with enforcement of the LDO,
any appeal arising out of the LDO, or any appeal made in the nature of
certiorari as set forth in G.S. § 160D-406. All decisions shall be in
accordance with division
3.1.13, Quasi-Judicial Decisions.
      (C)   Effect of appeal. An appeal of a notice of violation or other
enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from (including the
accrual of fines and fees) unless the official who made the decision certifies
to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of appeal has been filed, that
because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril
to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay
would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case,
enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order,
which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the
appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the
appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15
days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of
decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of
property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay further review of an
application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these
situations the appellant may request and the Board of Adjustment may grant a
stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by
the issue being appealed. Filing of an appeal shall toll all time periods
associated with conditions of approval, permit expiration, or vesting until the
appeal is decided.
      (D)   Appeals in the nature of certiorari. When hearing an appeal
pursuant to G.S. §160D-947 or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the
hearing shall be based on the record below and the scope of review shall be as
provided in G.S. § 160D-1402.
      (E)   Other forms of dispute resolution. The parties to an appeal that
has been made under division
3.2.13, Appeals of Administrative Decisions, may agree to mediation or other
forms of alternative dispute resolution.
   3.2.14   Vested rights certificate.
      (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this division is to implement the
provisions of G.S. §§ 160D-108 and 160D-108.1 in order to permit an applicant
to request vesting, or an extended vesting period, from changes in this
ordinance that take place after approval of a development application but prior
to completion of an approved site-specific vesting plan associated with the
application.
      (B)   Applicability. An application for a vested rights certificate shall
be limited to applications with an approved site-specific vesting plan in
accordance with division
1.11.4(D), Site-specific vesting plan.
      (C)   Procedure.
         (1)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures and
requirements for submission and review of an application are established in §
3.1, Common Review Procedures.
         (2)   Review and decision by Town Council. After scheduling of a
public hearing, the Town Council shall conduct a public hearing on the
application. At the public hearing, the Town Council shall consider the
application, the relevant support materials, and the testimony given at the
public hearing. After the close of the public hearing, the Town Council shall,
by simple majority of those present and eligible to vote, approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the application based on the standards in division
3.2.14(D), Vested Rights Certificate Standards. In the event the application is
approved, the Town Council shall establish the vesting period, which shall not
exceed a maximum of five years from the date of approval of the establishment
of vested rights.
      (D)   Vested rights certificate standards. The Town Council shall only
grant a vested rights certificate in accordance with the following:
         (1)   The site-specific vesting plan was lawfully established and
approved in the appropriate manner by the appropriate decision-making body;
         (2)   The site-specific vesting plan has not expired and the
development proposed remains valid and unexpired;
         (3)   All required variances, if any, have been obtained; and
         (4)   The site-specific vesting plan provides sufficient information
to establish the types and intensity of proposed development with reasonable
certainty.
   In approving the establishment of vested rights, the Town Council may extend
the two-year vested rights period to a period of up to five years, where
warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited
to, the size and phasing of development, economic cycles, and market
conditions.
      (E)   Effect.
         (1)   Each document used to establish a site-specific vesting plan
shall bear the following notation:
            “Approval of this application establishes a zoning vested right
under Section 160D-108 of the North Carolina General Statutes, as amended.
Unless terminated at an earlier date, the vested right shall be valid until
              (date).”
         (2)   The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the
application of overlay zoning district provisions that impose additional
requirements but do not affect the allowable type and intensity of use, or
through ordinances that are general in nature and are applicable to all
property subject to land use regulation by the town, including, but not limited
to: building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes.
      (F)   Duration.
         (1)   In no instance shall a vested right certificate provide a vested
right for a period of longer than five years from the date of approval of the
site-specific vesting plan.
         (2)   A vested right certificate shall expire and become null and
void:
            (i)   At the end of the approved vesting period; or
            (ii)   If a building permit application for the development subject
to the certificate is not submitted within two years of the approval of the
vested rights certificate associated with a special use permit concept plan,
subdivision preliminary plat, or site plan, or five years of the approval of a
vested rights certificate associated with a conditional rezoning concept plan;
or
            (iii)   Upon a finding by the Town Council after public notice and
a public hearing, that:
               (a)   Natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate
vicinity of the land, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public
health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated;
               (b)   The landowner or landowner’s representative intentionally
supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which
affected the approval of the site-specific vesting plan;
               (c)   The landowner failed to comply with any condition imposed
upon the establishment of the site-specific development plan or vested rights
certificate; or
            (iv)   Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for
all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including all
fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning,
marketing, legal, and other consultant fees incurred after approval of the
certificate by the town, together with interest at the legal rate until paid.
Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the land which is
caused by such action; or
            (v)   With the written consent of the affected landowner.
         (3)   Upon enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or
regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site-specific
vesting plan, the Town Council may modify the affected provisions of the
certificate by ordinance, if after conducting a hearing, it finds the changed
conditions created by the change in the state or federal law have a fundamental
effect on the site-specific vesting plan.
   3.2.15   Special intensity allocation.
      (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this division
3.2.15 is to set forth the procedures and requirements for the review and
approval of a special intensity allocation in compliance with the standards of
§
15.1, Water Supply Watershed Protection Rules.
      (B)   Applicability. SIA can only be requested in WS-II-NSW-P.
      (C)   Procedure.
         (1)   Preliminary procedures. The preliminary procedures and
requirements for submission and review of an application are established in §
3.1, Common Review Procedures.
         (2)   Review and decision by Ordinance Administrator. Following the
submission of a complete special intensity allocation application, the
Ordinance Administrator shall review and approve, or deny approval of the
special intensity allocation based on the standards in division
15.1.3, Development Regulations. Projects must, to the maximum extent
practicable, minimize built-upon surface area, direct stormwater away from
surface waters, and incorporate stormwater control measures to minimize water
quality impacts.
      (D)   Standards for approval. The special intensity allocation
application shall detail how post-development stormwater runoff will be
controlled and managed and how the proposed project will meet the requirements
of Article 15, Watershed Protection. All such plans shall be prepared by a
qualified registered state professional engineer and/or surveyor, soil
scientist, or landscape architect. The engineer, surveyor, soil scientist, or
landscape architect shall perform services only in their area of competence,
and shall verify that the design of all stormwater management facilities and
practices meets the submittal requirements for complete applications, that the
designs and plans are sufficient to comply with applicable standards and
policies found in the Stormwater Design Manual, and that the designs and plans
ensure compliance with this ordinance.
      (E)   Effect of approval. Approval authorizes the applicant to apply for
a stormwater management permit for the specific project authorized under the
special intensity allocation. The approval shall not be construed to convey any
land disturbance activities, or exempt the applicant from obtaining appropriate
land development permits, stormwater management permits, or other applicable
approvals from local, state, and federal authorities.
      (F)   Expiration. Special intensity allocation approval shall
automatically expire at the end of two years following initial approval if a
building permit has not been issued and construction pursuant to that permit
has not commenced for at least one building in the proposed development. A
change in ownership shall not affect this time frame.
(Ord. A.21.01, passed 6-3-2021; Ord. A.22.01, passed 4-7-2022; Ord. A.24.03,
passed 5-2-2024)
   3.2.16   Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA).
      (A)   Purpose. The Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) procedure allows
an assessment of a proposed development’s impact on the town’s transportation
system. It identifies recommended transportation system improvements to be
included by the proposed development as necessary to mitigate any negative
impacts on the transportation system created by the proposed development.
      (B)   Applicability.
         (1)   A TIA, prepared in accordance with this section, shall be
required for all proposed developments, or phases of development, or contiguous
tracts under the same ownership, containing 80 or more dwelling units or where
the estimated traffic generated from the site exceeds 800 vehicle trips per
day, according to the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual.
         (2)   A TIA may be required in cases where a proposed development does
not contain 80 or more dwelling units or where estimated traffic is below 800
trips per day, when, in the opinion of the Ordinance Administrator, the
proposed development is located on a roadway that has a demonstrated
transportation capacity issue or if there are likely to be significant changes
to adjacent development traffic patterns as a result of the proposed
development.
         (3)   A Transportation Memorandum, in lieu of a TIA, may be required
in cases where the number of vehicle trips is not known or in cases where a TIA
is not necessary but an investigation of potential transportation impacts is
warranted, in the opinion of the Ordinance Administrator. A Transportation
Memorandum is a general investigation of anticipated traffic on adjacent
roadway capacity and function as opposed to detailed estimates of the number of
trips and steps necessary to maintain a minimum operating level of service.
      (C)   Procedure. When required, submittal of a TIA or Transportation
Memorandum shall be included with the initial application for development and
must be completed by a qualified professional transportation engineer licensed
in the State of North Carolina in accordance with the following:
         (1)   Scoping meeting. Prior to the preparation of a TIA or a
Transportation Memorandum, a scoping meeting shall be held with town planning
staff. This meeting shall establish the analysis parameters, including but not
limited to: the study area, planned and/or committed roadway improvements, road
links and intersections to be analyzed, preliminary traffic distribution, other
planned developments to be considered in the analysis, traffic growth rate,
available data, periods for which analysis is to be performed, and other
transportation-related concerns expressed by town staff.
         (2)   Review and acceptance by Ordinance Administrator. Following the
submission of a complete TIA, the Ordinance Administrator shall review and
accept, or not accept the TIA based on the standards for approval in this
section.
         (3)   Third party preparation or review. An applicant may request or
the Ordinance Administrator may require that an independent third party be
hired by the town, at the applicant’s expense, to prepare a TIA or
Transportation Memorandum or to review a TIA or Transportation memorandum
submitted by an applicant. The third party shall be a professional engineer
licensed in the State of North Carolina to prepare and review such analyses,
shall be approved by the town prior to the commencement of work, and the third
party’s contract shall be administered solely by the town. The applicant shall
provide funds to the town for the third-party review in accordance with the
town’s fee schedule. Funds for third-party preparation or review are not
refundable if an applicant withdraws their application after third-party
preparation or review has commenced.
      (D)   Standards for TIA acceptance. The TIA shall contain the following
information, and any other information required from the scoping meeting:
         (1)   The report shall provide a general description of the
development site including the number of proposed dwelling units and layout of
the proposed internal roadway network. The report shall describe the entire
roadway system, including intersections, within the study area.
         (2)   Existing traffic conditions shall be documented, including
documentation of traffic accidents, traffic volumes for average daily traffic
and peak highway hour(s), manual traffic counts at major intersections, a
volume to capacity analysis, and levels of service shall be determined for each
major intersection or roadway segment in the study area.
         (3)   Transportation impact of the development shall be documented by
showing estimated trip generation obtained from the latest version of the Trip
Generation Manual and distributed to the existing roadways and intersections in
the study area. Peak hour turning movements shall also be shown at all major
intersections including the access point(s) to the development.

for enforcement purposes in lieu of the state is undertaken in substantial
violation of any applicable provision of this ordinance or state law or in a
manner that endangers life or property, the Ordinance Administrator may order
the specific part of the work or activity that is in violation or presents such
a hazard to be immediately stopped, or request a stop work order be issued by
the County Building Inspections Department.
      (B)   Delivery. The stop work order shall be in writing, directed to the
person doing the work, and shall state the specific work to be stopped, the
reasons therefor, and the conditions under which the work or activity may be
resumed. A copy of the order shall be delivered to the holder of the
development approval and to the owner of the property involved (if that person

order shall certify to the town that the order was delivered and that
certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.
      (C)   Appeals. Except as provided by G.S. §§ 160D-1112 and 160D-1208, a
stop work order may be appealed pursuant to G.S. § 160D-405. No further work or
activity shall take place in violation of a stop work order pending a ruling on
the appeal. Violation of a stop work order shall constitute a Class 1
misdemeanor.
   4.6.3   Revocation of zoning permit. The Ordinance Administrator may revoke
any zoning permit by written notification to the permit holder when violations
of this ordinance have occurred. Permits may be revoked when false statements
or misrepresentations were made in securing the permit, work is being or has
been done in substantial departure from the approved application or plan, there
has been a failure to comply with the requirements of this ordinance, or a
permit has been mistakenly issued in violation of this ordinance. Permit
revocation may only take place in accordance with the procedure used to issue
the permit.
   4.6.4   Injunction. When a violation occurs, the Ordinance Administrator
may, either before or after the initiation of other authorized actions, apply

   4.6.6   Equitable remedy. The town may apply to a court of law for any
appropriate equitable remedy to enforce the provisions of this ordinance. The

relief.
   4.6.7   Criminal penalties.
      (A)   Pursuant to G.S. § 14-4, any person, firm, or corporation convicted
of violating the provisions of this ordinance adopted solely pursuant to G.S.

extent allowed under G.S. § 143-215.6.B.
      (C)   If a specific provision of this ordinance specifies a criminal
penalty for a violation, that provision shall control.
   4.6.8   Execution of court decisions.
   As provided in G.S. § 160A-175(e), if the violator fails or refuses to

bond shall be given with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court in an
amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be
conditioned upon the defendant’s full compliance with the terms of the order of
abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of
abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction
therewith.
   4.6.9   Deny or withhold permits. The Ordinance Administrator may deny or
withhold authorization to use or develop any land, structure, or improvements
until an alleged violation and associated civil penalty related to such land,
use, or development is corrected.

§ 4.7 ASSESSMENT OF CIVIL PENALTIES.
   The following procedure shall be applied by the town in the assessment and

      (G)   If compliance is not achieved, then the town shall make a written
demand for payment of penalties that have accrued while the property has been
in violation.
      (H)   The demand for payment shall be sent to the responsible party in
violation and must include a description of the violation for which the civil
penalties have been imposed.
      (I)    Payment of the penalty shall not constitute a remedy for the
violation.

ARTICLE 5: NONCONFORMITIES
Section
5.1   General applicability
5.2   Nonconforming uses
5.3   Nonconforming structures
5.4   Nonconforming lots of record
5.5   Nonconforming signs
5.6   Nonconforming manufactured homes
5.7   Nonconforming religious and civic institutional uses in the Highway
Business, Light Industrial, or Heavy Industrial Zoning Districts
§ 5.1 GENERAL APPLICABILITY.
   5.1.1   Purpose and scope.
      (A)   General. In the provisions established by this ordinance, there
exist uses of land, structures, lots of record, and signs that were lawfully
established before this ordinance was adopted or amended, that now do not
conform to its terms and requirements. The purpose and intent of this article
is to regulate and limit the continued existence of those uses, structures,
lots of record, and signs that do not conform to the provisions of this
ordinance, or any subsequent amendments.
      (B)   Permit, but not encourage nonconformities to continue. It is the
intent of this ordinance to permit most of these nonconformities to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their continuance except under the
limited circumstances established in this article. The provisions of this
article are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities.
   5.1.2   Authority to continue. Nonconformities are allowed to continue in
accordance with the requirements of this article, and are encouraged to receive
routine maintenance as a means of preserving safety and appearance.
   5.1.3   Determination of nonconforming status. In all cases, the burden of
establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be the responsibility
of the owner of the land on which the alleged nonconformity is located.
   5.1.4   Minor repairs and maintenance. Minor repairs and normal maintenance,
as defined in this ordinance, that are required to keep nonconforming uses,
structures, lots of record, and signs in a safe condition are permitted,
provided the minor repair or maintenance does not extend, expand, or enlarge
the nonconforming use,  structure, lot of record, or sign.
(Ord. A.21.01, passed 6-3-2021)
§ 5.2 NONCONFORMING USES.
   5.2.1   General. Nonconforming uses are declared generally incompatible with
the permitted uses in the district in which they are located and with the
provisions of this ordinance. Nonconforming uses shall be subject to the
standards in this section.
   5.2.2   Change of use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other
nonconforming use. Once a nonconforming use has ceased operation or has been
discontinued for a period of 180 days or longer, it shall only be replaced with
a conforming use.
   5.2.3   Expansion and enlargement. Except in accordance with this division,
a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, expanded in area occupied, or
intensified. An existing nonconforming use may be enlarged into any portion of
the structure where it is located, provided the area proposed for expansion was
designed and intended for such use prior to the date the use became a
nonconformity.
   5.2.4   Discontinuance. A nonconforming use shall not be reestablished after
discontinuance for a period of 180 consecutive calendar days or more. An effort
to renovate the structure housing the use is not considered a vacancy,
abandonment, or discontinuance, provided all appropriate development approvals
are obtained, and provided the renovation is completed within 180 days from its
commencement, and the use is re-established within 30 days from the time the
renovation is completed. Failure to complete the renovation within 180 days or
reestablish the use within 30 days following renovation shall constitute
discontinuance, and a nonconforming use shall not be reestablished in the
structure.
   5.2.5   Accessory uses. Once a nonconforming principal use is discontinued,
all associated accessory uses shall cease operation within 30 days.
   5.2.6   Reconstruction after casualty damage.
      (A)   Destruction or damage beyond 50% of value.
         (1)   In the event a structure housing a nonconforming use is damaged
or destroyed, by any means, to an extent of more than 50% of its structural
replacement cost at the time of damage or destruction, the nonconforming use
may not be reestablished following reconstruction.
      (B)   Damage of 50% or less of value.
         (1)   In the event a structure housing a nonconforming use is damaged,
by any means, to an extent of 50% or less of its structural replacement cost at
the time of damage, it may be repaired to its previous form, and the
nonconforming use reestablished, if a building permit for such repair or
restoration is obtained within 365 days of the casualty damage.
         (2)   In no case shall a different nonconforming use be established in
the place of the nonconforming use that was housed in the structure at the time
of casualty damage.
(Ord. TA.24.02, passed 4-4-2024)
§ 5.3 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   5.3.1   Continuation. Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to
allow the continued use of nonconforming structures.
   5.3.2   Enlargement. A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or
expanded in any way that increases the degree of nonconformity. (For example, a
structure that has a five-foot side yard setback where the ordinance requires a
ten-foot side yard setback cannot be enlarged so as to further encroach into
the side yard setback.) Expansion of the structure in a way that complies with
applicable dimensional standards or that decreases the degree of nonconformity
is permitted.
   5.3.3   Relocation. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, in whole
or in part, to another location within the town’s jurisdiction, on or off the
parcel of land on which it is presently located, unless upon relocation it
conforms to the requirements of this ordinance.
   5.3.4   Reconstruction after casualty damage.
      (A)   Destruction or damage beyond 50% of value.
         (1)   In the event a nonconforming structure (or portion of a
structure) is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to an extent more than 50% of
its structural replacement cost at the time of damage or destruction, it shall
only be restored in a manner that conforms with the provisions of this
ordinance.
         (2)   New construction (including the establishment of off-street
parking, landscaping, signage, and other site features) shall be in accordance
with the requirements of this ordinance.
      (B)   Damage of 50% or less of value.
         (1)   In the event a nonconforming structure is damaged, by any means,
to an extent of 50% or less of its structural replacement cost at the time of
damage or destruction, it may be rebuilt to its previous form if a building
permit for such repair or restoration is obtained within 365 days of the
casualty damage.
         (2)   In no event shall the repair or restoration increase the degree
of nonconformity.
(Ord. TA.24.02, passed 4-4-2024)
§ 5.4 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   No use or structure shall be established on a nonconforming lot of record
except in accordance with the standards in this section.
   5.4.1   Status of nonconforming lots.
      (A)   Conforming structures legally established on nonconforming lots of
record prior to the effective date of this ordinance may be continued,
enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered in any way that is
in conformance with the standards of this ordinance.
      (B)   Nonconforming structures legally established on a nonconforming lot
prior to the effective date of this ordinance may be continued, enlarged, or
redeveloped only in accordance with the standards in §
5.3, Nonconforming Structures.
   5.4.2   Development of unimproved lots.
      (A)   Residential districts. In the residential zoning districts,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance, a
single-family detached dwelling and customary accessory structures may be
developed on any single lot of record existing on October 1, 2008. This
provision applies even if the lot of record fails to comply with the standards
for area or width in §
6.8, Dimensional Standards. Development of a single-family detached dwelling on
the lot of record shall comply with the other standards in §
6.8, Dimensional Standards, to the maximum extent practicable.
      (B)   Nonresidential districts. In the nonresidential zoning districts,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance, a
permitted use may be developed on any single nonconforming lot of record
existing on October 1, 2008, or the date the lot of record became
nonconforming, subject to review and approval of a special use permit. This
provision shall apply even though the lot of record fails to comply with the
standards for lot area that are applicable in the zoning district. In
considering the application for a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment
shall ensure the design and location of the proposed use is compatible with
surrounding uses. Development of the permitted use on the lot of record shall
comply with the other standards in §
6.8, Dimensional Standards, to the maximum extent practicable.
      (C)   Recombination required. In the event that a vacant nonconforming
lot is located adjacent to a lot under common ownership, and the adjacent lot
has sufficient size to allow for a lot line adjustment as a means of bringing
the vacant lot closer into conformity with the requirements of the zoning
district where its located, then such lot line adjustment shall be required as
a condition of approval for development on the vacant nonconforming lot.
   5.4.3   Redevelopment of improved lots in residential districts after
casualty. If a legally established single-family attached or detached use is
destroyed by casualty on a nonconforming lot in a residential zoning district
that was part of a subdivision or division of land evidenced by plat or deed,
or both, recorded prior to October 1, 2008, an identical replacement structure
may be reconstructed within the same footprint as the use destroyed by casualty
even though the lot does not meet the minimum lot area or lot width

signs or new sign faces that meet all sign requirements for the district as set
forth in
Article 12, Sign Regulations.
      (B)   Multi-tenant buildings. In the event there is a change in use to an
existing multi-tenant building, and there are one or more on-premises
nonconforming signs which advertised the business or use which changed, the
owner or new tenant shall replace all nonconforming signs which pertain
specifically to the new tenant with new signs or new sign faces that meet all
sign requirements for the district as set forth in
Article 12, Sign Regulations. Common signage on the property (those signs
advertising more than one tenant) may not be changed or altered when a change
in use occurs, except in order to bring the sign(s) into conformance with the
requirements of
Article 12.
   5.5.5   Damage or destruction beyond 50% of value. In the event that a
nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed from natural causes to an extent

180 days, that sign shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within 30 days after
such abandonment, be brought into compliance with this ordinance or be removed
by the sign owner, owner of the land where the sign is located, or other person
having control over the sign. For purposes of this ordinance, a sign shall be
deemed “blank” if:
         (1)   It advertises a business, commodity, accommodation, attraction,
service, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being
offered or conducted in that location;
         (2)   The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole
or substantial part; or
         (3)   It does not contain an advertising message. (For such purposes,
the terms “Sign For Rent”, “Sign For Lease”, “Building For Rent”, “Building For
Lease”, “Building for Sale”, and the like shall not be deemed to be an
advertising message.)

institutional use in the Highway Business (HB), Light Industrial (LI), or Heavy
Industrial (HI) Zoning Districts may only be expanded, repaired, reconstructed,
or restored in accordance with the terms of this section. This division only
applies to the HB, LI, or HI Zoning Districts.
   5.7.2   Change of use. A nonconforming religious or civic institutional use
shall not be changed to any other nonconforming use. Once a nonconforming
religious or civic institutional use in the HB, LI, or HI Zoning District has
ceased operation or has been discontinued for a period of 12 months or longer,
it shall only be replaced with a conforming use.
   5.7.3   Expansion and enlargement. Except in accordance with this division,
a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, intensified, or expanded in area
occupied. An existing nonconforming religious or civic institutional use may be

property for a period of 12 months or more. An effort to renovate the structure
housing the use is not considered a vacancy, abandonment, or discontinuance,
provided all appropriate development approvals are obtained prior to the use
being interrupted on the property and provided the renovation is completed
within 12 months from its commencement and the use is re-established within 30
days from the time the renovation is completed as evidenced by a certificate of
occupancy. Failure to either complete the renovation within 12 months from its
commencement or reestablish the use within 30 days following renovation shall
constitute discontinuance, and a nonconforming use shall not be reestablished.
   If a nonconforming religious or civic institutional use ceases using the
property, a different religious or civic institution may resume the use on the
property and operate as a nonconforming use, provided such new nonconforming
activity is commenced within 12 months of the discontinuance of the use by the
prior nonconforming religious or civic institutional use.
   5.7.6   Accessory uses or structures. 
   A preexisting nonconforming religious or civic institutional use in the HB,
LI, or HI Zoning District may add accessory uses or structures, provided such

IMAGES/0-0-0-6452.jpg]Publisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new
legislation (Ord. LDOTA.24.05, adopted 6-6-2024). The text of the amendment
will be incorporated below when the ordinance is codified.
   6.3.1   Purpose and intent. The Conditional Zoning District classification
allows the Town Council to consider proposed uses and tailor the zoning to
accommodate those uses while addressing anticipated problems that may arise
from the establishment of the proposed uses. This section sets forth the types
of Conditional Zoning Districts and explains their relationship to the Base
Zoning Districts
   6.3.2   Designation. Conditional Zoning Districts shall be designated only
in accordance with the procedures set forth in division
3.2.3, Conditional Zoning District Classification, and may not contain
conditions which are less restrictive than this ordinance, other town
requirements, or other applicable state or federal laws.
   6.3.3   Allowable uses. No use shall be permitted within a Conditional
Zoning District except pursuant to the conditions imposed as part of the
approval. The permitted uses shall be limited to those permitted in the
corresponding Base Zoning District unless otherwise restricted in the
conditions set forth in the approval of the Conditional Zoning District
classification. Any use allowed in one Gateway District may be approved as a
Conditional District in any other Gateway District.
   6.3.4   Applicable standards.
   (A)   Base Zoning District standards apply. All standards and requirements
that apply to the corresponding Base Zoning District shall also apply to the
Conditional Zoning District, except where allowed in division
6.3.6(B) and §
6.5.
   (B)   No less restrictive than base district. Conditions imposed on a
Conditional Zoning District may be no less restrictive than the standards that
apply to the corresponding Base Zoning District, except where allowed in
division
6.3.6(B) and
6.5.
   (C)   Stricter standards adopted. Existing conditions or limitations
associated with an approved Conditional Zoning District classification shall
become null and void if future amendments to this ordinance require stricter
standards than those imposed under the Conditional Zoning District
classification.
   (D)   Application of conditions. In cases where the ability to implement an
approved Conditional Zoning District condition is impossible or impractical
(e.g., a condition requiring trees to be preserved when the trees have
subsequently died due to natural causes), the Ordinance Administrator shall
enforce the condition in a way that most closely meets the condition’s original
intent.
   6.3.5   Parallel Conditional Districts established. Each Base Zoning
District shall have a corresponding “parallel” Conditional Zoning District.
Conditional Zoning District classifications shall be indicated on the Official
Zoning Map by the suffix “CD” in front of the associated Base Zoning District.
   6.3.6   Planned Unit Development District (CD-PUD).
      (A)   General. The Planned Unit Development District (CD-PUD) is a
special purpose Conditional Zoning District that is established in order to
accommodate a diverse mix of residential or nonresidential uses and structures
that function as a cohesive, integrated, and unified development. This district
encourages innovative development patterns by allowing flexibility in permitted
uses, design, and layout requirements in conjunction with a concept plan. This
district may only be established through the process set forth in division
3.2.3, Conditional Zoning District Classification.

wetlands as defined by state and federal agencies, steep slopes of 15% and
greater, floodways as delineated by the North Carolina Division of Emergency
Management or its successor, and sites listed in the most recent Natural
Heritage Inventory shall be preserved as open space.
         (4)   Protection of open space corridors. Open space connections must
be retained in a natural condition, with the exception of greenways that comply
with the town's adopted standards, which are still allowed in these areas.
         (5)   Density. The overall residential density of the PUD is
established by the concept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District
classification.
         (6)   Minimum lot size. Minimum lot sizes in each area of the PUD are
established by the concept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District
classification.
         (7)   Minimum interior setbacks. Setback requirements within the PUD
are established by the concept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District
classification. While no minimum setback is required, if one is provided it
must be at least five feet in width.
         (8)   Minimum street setbacks. Minimum street (front yard) setbacks
within the PUD are established by the concept plan as part of the Conditional
Zoning District classification.
         (9)   Maximum height. Within single-family residential portions of a
PUD, the maximum height limit is 35 feet. In nonresidential or mixed-use
portions of a PUD, the maximum height limit is determined by the concept plan.
         (10)   Open space and recreation facilities. A minimum of 20% of the
gross area of the PUD must be dedicated to open space. No more than 50% of the
dedicated open space may be used for active recreation purposes (i.e., soccer

   6.4.1   Watershed Protection Overlay Districts. The following Watershed
Protection Overlay Districts are established to comply with the rules set forth
by the state’s Environmental Management Commission for the protection of those
water supply watersheds which lie within the jurisdiction of the town. The
specific regulations for these districts are set forth in
Article 15, Watershed Protection.
   (A)   Watershed Protection Overlay District - Critical Area (WPO-CA). The
Watershed Protection Overlay District - Critical Area (WPO-CA) establishes
regulations for protecting those portions of the Falls Lake (WS- IV), Lake Holt
(WS- II), and Lake Rogers (WS-II) watersheds which lie within the one-fourth
mile critical watershed area of those water supply sources as established and
determined by the state’s Environmental Management Commission.
   (B)   Watershed Protection Overlay District - General Area (WPO-GA). The
Watershed Protection Overlay District - General Area (WPO-GA) establishes
regulations for protecting those portions of the Falls Lake (WS- IV), Lake Holt
(WS- II), and Lake Rogers (WS-II) watersheds which lie within the remaining
balance of the watershed area of those water supply sources as established and
determined by the state’s Environmental Management Commission.
§ 6.5 MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICTS.
   6.5.1   Purpose and intent. The Mixed-Use Districts allow for a mix of
nonresidential and residential uses within the same development or building.
This type of development is intended to encourage the physical design
characteristics of pedestrian oriented, storefront-style shopping streets.
   6.5.2   Gateway Districts. The Butner Gateway consists of five Base Zoning
Districts described in §
6.5 and three floating Conditional Zoning Districts described in §
6.6 within separate specific areas. Using a hybrid of form based code and
traditional land use based code, these Base Zoning Districts create a cohesive,
integrated, and unified development consistent with the town’s Gateway Small
Area Plan adopted December 3, 2015 and the town’s current Comprehensive Plan.
The Base Districts are allowed only within the Gateway Area. Before development
in the Gateway Districts may  occur, a concept plan must be reviewed and
approved by Town Council in accordance with
3.2.6. Uses allowed in each Gateway District are shown in
Table 7-1, Table of Permitted Uses. Any property in the Gateway area can
request a Conditional District rezoning to allow a use allowed in another
Gateway District.
   (A)   Gateway Base Zoning Districts.
      (1)   Central Avenue Mixed-Use District (CX). The Central Avenue Mixed-
Use District (CX) is established to accommodate a mix of commercial, office,
and supporting higher density residential uses typically within a vertical
mixed-use project. It is intended to serve as the Gateway “Main Street”
promoting a compact urban form. This district utilizes build-to lines as
compared to more traditional building setbacks, and minimum building/block
standards. Uses which utilize and/or incorporate public space into the
development (sidewalk cafes, and the like) shall be encouraged within this
district, especially those properties fronting Central Avenue.
      (2)   South Interchange Gateway District (SI). The South Interchange
Gateway District (SI) is established to accommodate a mix of convenience retail
and restaurants, moderate intensity commercial development, as well as
neighborhood serving commercial and professional office uses. The district may
provide transient uses typically associated with higher volume thoroughfares
and interstate interchanges. Multi-family residential uses may be provided as
part of a vertically integrated mixed-use project.
      (3)   North Interchange Gateway District (NI). The North Interchange
Gateway District (NI) is established to accommodate a mix of convenience retail
and restaurants, including moderate and high intensity commercial uses
typically associated with higher volume thoroughfares and interstate
interchanges. This district may also provide large-scale, big-box oriented
uses.
      (4)   Central Gateway West District (CW). The Central Gateway West
District (CW) is established to accommodate an economic development and
employment generating area including office, industrial, and institutional
uses. Institutional uses are intended to be located across from Murdoch Center.
Office and institutional uses are intended south of 26th Street up the Central
Avenue Mixed-Use District to act as a transition between the mixed-use area and
the more intense industrial uses. The area in between, north of 26th Street and
extending across the railroad to the east, is intended to be the primary
employment center for the Gateway area. This area focuses on nonresidential
operations including employment and job generating uses. Uses within this
district will likely use the railroad and interstate for the movement of goods.
Properties in this area may be developed individually or as part of a business
or office park. Supporting residential may be provided under limited
situations, and shall not be primary uses in this district.
      (5)   Central Gateway East District (CE). The Central Gateway East
District (CE) is established to accommodate the connection between the major
commercial nodes via the parkway with a mix of uses including primarily office,
institutional, and industrial. The district also includes “Opportunity Site A”
which may be developed as either office and institutional or residential
developments with increased densities. Nonresidential uses within the
opportunity site are envisioned to include an academic/healthcare campus
concept. Residential uses are envisioned as an age-targeted neighborhood and/or
a variety of housing types and styles including attached and limited detached
housing. Consistent with the Central Gateway West District, properties north of
26th Street and its continuation to Telecom Drive comprise the Gateway Area’s
primary employment center.

specifically noted in this division shall be established by the approved
concept plan.
   (F)   Building frontage.
      (1)   Within the CX and SI Districts, the minimum building frontage shall
be 65% of the lot width. This standard may be modified by the Ordinance
Administrator based on required utility and drainage easements and/or vehicular
accesses (i.e., public streets). In the case of a corner lot and/or double
frontage lot, the Ordinance Administrator shall determine the front yard.
Minimum building frontage in all other Gateway Districts shall be no less than
30% of the lot width. Building frontage may be provided as follows.
         (i)   The building frontage minimum requirement may be achieved
completely by building facade or a combination of building facade, porte
cochere, and similar decorative structural feature, including the use of street
walls. These elements when used to meet this standard shall be designed with

increased building heights above the maximum stated may be considered up to a
maximum of 50% of the maximum height standard, providing height mitigation
measures such as a building stepback or setback are proposed and approved by
the Ordinance Administrator. Buildings exceeding the maximum height shall
provide a stepback of at least 15 feet along all sides facing a public roadway.
      (5)   Any single-story structure in which the floor to ceiling height
exceeds 15 feet or the exterior facade height exceeds 25 feet, shall be
designed to appear like a multistory structure.
   (H)   Open space and recreation facilities.
      For developments greater than ten acres as identified by a concept plan,
subdivision, or site plan, a minimum of 5% of the gross area of the development
must be dedicated to open space exclusive of any existing wetland area; parcels
less than ten acres shall be exempt from this standard. No more than 50% of the
dedicated open space may be used for active recreation purposes (i.e., soccer
fields, multi-purpose fields, tennis courts, and the like). At least 50% of the
passive recreation/natural areas must be usable and accessible (i.e., not
including wetlands, steep slopes, or other marginal lands); stormwater features
including ponds, lakes, or similar may count towards this total providing they
are publicly accessible and provide a public edge through a sidewalk, trail, or
similar.
      Within mixed-use and residential developments, the open space can be
provided in the form of neighborhood parks, plazas, greenways, or similar,
subject to approval by the Ordinance Administrator. These areas shall include a
minimum of three or more of the following program elements: community building;
public gathering space; playground; pet park; trails; picnic area; shade
structures; and benches. The minimum open space area shall be 10,000 square

      (1)   All buildings and/or lots shall front on a public street either
existing or a new street constructed to the town’s standards.
      (2)   All development must be arranged in such a manner that convenient
pedestrian access is provided between and within those developments and uses
through sidewalks, greenways, trails, or similar features. Connectivity shall
also be provided to civic and recreational spaces, where practical.
      (3)   Cross access shall be provided to the adjacent properties except
where not practical due to environmental features, utilities/infrastructure, or
other site specific features. Any request to waive the requirement for cross
access shall be approved by the Ordinance Administrator.
      (4)   Placement and width shall be consistent with the Gateway street
standards as described in the town’s street design standards.
      (5)   Due to the nature and intent of the Gateway area, division
13.4.3(A)(1) shall not apply. Except where approved by the Ordinance
Administrator, adjacent parcels shall provide for cross access.
   (J)   Parking and loading. Off-street parking and loading areas must be
provided in accordance with
Article 13 of this ordinance.
      (1)   Cross access. Cross access to adjacent properties in the Gateway
Districts shall be provided in accordance with the approved concept plan,
consistent with the town’s Gateway Small Area Plan adopted December 3, 2015.

more than 400 feet from the lot on which the principal building or use is
located. A continuous paved pedestrian pathway or sidewalk a minimum of five
feet in width shall be required between the off-site parking area and the entry
to the principal use.
      (3)   Shared parking. Shared parking is encouraged within the Gateway
Districts in order to provide opportunities to reduce the amount of land needed
for parking and create opportunities for more compact development, more space
for pedestrian circulation, or more open space and landscaping. Up to 50% of
required parking may be shared between uses with different peak use times as
approved by the Ordinance Administrator.
      (4)   On-street parking.
         (i)   On-street parking may be provided on the local commercial
collector streets within the Gateway Districts except for:

intersection of S. 33rd Street.
         (ii)   On-street parking within 300 feet of the building entry may
provide for up to 10% of the required parking spaces. Parking spaces proposed
to meet this standard shall be striped/dedicated on-street parking spaces and
recognized by the town.
         (iii)   The minimum sidewalk width for public streets providing on-
street parking shall be 12 feet.
      (5)   Parking location.
         (i)   Parking within the SI, CX, and CW Districts in the Gateway shall

driveways, and joint access (cross access) driveways shall not be used for
parking vehicles.
         (iv)   Required parking spaces for all uses except single-family and
two-family dwellings shall be designed to permit entry and exit without moving
any other vehicle.
         (v)   No parking space shall be located so as to block designated
emergency access.
         (vi)   No portion of any required parking space shall be located
within the right-of-way of a street or alley.
      (6)   Change in use. If the change in use requires an increase in
required parking greater than 50% of the previously required parking, all
parking must be brought into compliance with the provisions of this ordinance,
including, but not limited to, location, size, materials, and access.
      (7)   Bicycle parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided per division
13.7.3 of the town’s land development ordinance.
   (K)   Street design. Streets must be designed and located so that they are
integrated into and provide continuation of the surrounding street network. A
minimum street connectivity index score of 1.5, as outlined in division
14.3.4(B), shall be maintained throughout the development.
   (L)   Signs.
      (1)   A common signage plan must be included as part of the concept plan.
This common signage plan shall specify the size, type, height, setback,
location, design, illumination, and number of signs to be allowed in the
Gateway Districts. All signs included in the common signage plan shall utilize
the same coordinated colors, styles, and lettering schemes throughout the
development.
      (2)   Single-family residential portions of the Gateway Districts shall
follow the standards set forth for signs in the RT District.
      (3)   Non-single-family residential portions of the CX, SI, and CW
Gateway Districts shall follow the standards set forth for signs in the CB
District.
      (4)   Non-single-family residential portions of the NI and CE Gateway
Districts shall follow the standards set forth for signs in the HB District.

awning, or window or similar signage may not be exchanged for free standing
signage.
   (M)   Landscaping. Landscaping standards for the Gateway Districts are
established by the approved concept plan and shall follow
Article 9 of this ordinance.
   (N)   Buffering. Buffering standards for the Gateway Districts are
established by the approved concept plan. Due to the nature of the Gateway
Area, there are no buffers required between uses except as noted here.
      (1)   Between industrial land uses and residential land use a Type B
buffer according to
Article 10 of this ordinance is required.
      (2)   Between industrial land uses and all other land uses a Type A
buffer according to
Article 10 of this ordinance is required.
      (3)   Buffering between uses separated by a road or railroad may reduce
the buffer standards by one-half.
      (4)   The Ordinance Administrator may require the installation of a Type
A buffer strip along the frontage of all lots. Individual single-family lots
and development along Central Avenue shall be exempt from this standard.
      (5)   In the case of a conflict, the Ordinance Administrator is
authorized to interpret and require the application of the buffer standard.

1   Applicants must meet the standards for either stories or feet. The
following uses are exempt from this requirement: retail/service use with
gasoline sales, and all educational facilities.
2   Frontage types are described in more detail in §
6.6.1(D)(2).
3   The minimum build-to zone street frontage is the percentage of the street
frontage that includes a building or other qualifying frontage, and is only
required along the primary street adjacent to the development site
4   This number is the minimum separation between townhome buildings, not
individual units.
5   See §
6.6.1(D)(7) for details on parking requirements.
6   Applicants must submit a street plan that includes map(s) and text showing
how their application meets the requirements for streets and blocks for this
district.
7   All street types are as defined in the North Carolina Department of
Transportation's latest version of its Traditional Neighborhood Development
(TND) Guidelines and must meet these standards.
8   Bicycle parking shall be provided as specified in §
13.7.3, with the addition that it shall be provided for all new developments,
regardless of size, and that the bicycle parking spaces be covered with a
permanent canopy that is structurally sound and visually consistent with the
adjacent buildings in order to shelter the spaces.
9   A Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) must be conducted using the current
methodology of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, and the TIA
shall identify all improvements needed to maintain the current level of service
on existing roadways.
10   Each project shall maintain a minimum Street Connectivity Index score of
1.5 or greater throughout the development in the manner detailed in §

(C).
 
      (D)   Conditional Zoning District standards.
         (1)   Purpose. The development standards in this subsection (D) apply
to all Gateway Conditional Zoning Districts. They are intended to support high-
quality, walkable, mixed-use, and connected neighborhoods and districts that
allow for some flexibility in development standards to help achieve these
outcomes.
         (2)   Frontage types. Frontage types establish the desired development
form along the street edge to shape the experience from the public right-of-
way. Each development shall provide a regulating plan in map form that
identifies which of the following frontage types it will use along each street
and developed area throughout the project.
            i.   Shopfront. This frontage type is marked by storefronts with
large display windows on the first floor of multistory buildings that are
pulled up to the back of the sidewalk to help create an engaging experience for
pedestrians.

[https://export.amlegal.com/media/53ac9eae4bb8e47be1b5b6dba849b81ab58a2fa9/
IMAGES/0-0-0-6452.jpg]Publisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new
legislation (Ord. LDOTA.24.05, adopted 6-6-2024). The text of the amendment
will be incorporated below when the ordinance is codified.
   6.7.1   Compliance with this ordinance required. No building or portion of a
building shall be erected, used, moved, or altered except in conformity with
this ordinance.
   6.7.2   Pre-existing lots. Lots established prior to October 1, 2008 shall
only be required to meet the minimum setback provisions for the Base Zoning
District in which they are located, and shall be exempt from the other minimum
lot size or lot width requirements.
   6.7.3   Reduction prohibited. Except as required through the establishment
of new public rights-of-way (such as roadway widening) or approved as a
variance, no yard or lot existing on October 1, 2008 shall be reduced in size
or area below the minimum requirements of the Base and Overlay Zoning District
where it is located.
   6.7.4   Street access. All lots shall front upon, and have access to, a
public or private street built in accordance with the town’s standards.
   6.7.5   Double frontage and flag lots prohibited. Double frontage lots
including those served by alleys may be allowed in the Gateway Districts or PUD
as approved by the Ordinance Administrator. In all other districts, double
frontage lots shall be prohibited except where required due to extreme
topographic circumstances or site conditions. Flag lots shall be prohibited
except where required due to extreme topographic circumstances or site
conditions.
   6.7.6   Yard determination on irregular lots. The location of required
front, side, and rear yards on irregularly shaped lots shall be determined by
the Ordinance Administrator. Such determination shall be based on the spirit
and intent of this ordinance in order to achieve an appropriate spacing and
location of buildings and structures on individual lots.
   6.7.7   Allowable yard encroachments for residential use. Building features
and architectural elements may encroach into required yards or setbacks only in
accordance with the following standards.
   (A)   Balconies, stoops, open porches, bay windows, steps, mechanical units,
raised doorways, and similar architectural features are permitted to encroach
into a setback a maximum of four feet.
   (B)   First floor encroachments shall not extend into the right-of-way.
   (C)   Side yard encroachments shall not be closer than five feet to a lot
line.
   6.7.8   Height limitation exceptions. The height limitations of this
ordinance shall not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, and domes not intended
for residential purposes, nor to monuments, water towers, observation towers,
power transmission towers, chimneys, elevator shaft enclosures, flag poles, and
similar structures, provided such structures meet the required provisions of
the state’s Building Code. Height limitations shall apply to wireless
communication towers as regulated herein.
   6.7.9   Orientation of structures in Residential Districts. Principal
structures in residential zoning districts must be situated in such a manner
that their primary entrance faces the primary street frontage on which they are
located.
   6.7.10   Prevailing front setbacks. In the RT and RMX Zoning Districts the
prevailing front setback of neighboring developed lots shall be utilized to
determine the minimum front setback of undeveloped lots which are located on a
block face where at least 50% of the lots have been developed with a single-
family or two-family (duplex) dwelling that was constructed prior to the
effective date of this ordinance. The minimum front setback shall be defined by
establishing the mean, or prevailing, front setback of the closest two
residential structures on either side of the undeveloped lot. In no case shall
structures located more than 500 feet from the property line of an undeveloped
lot be used to establish a prevailing front setback. When the subject lot abuts
any lot or property developed as a use other than a single-family or two-
family (duplex) dwelling, (including, but not limited to, multi-housing,
religious institutions, undeveloped lots, and/or public rights-of-way), the
abutting lot shall be considered to have a default 30-foot setback for the
purpose of determining the front setback requirement on the subject lot. For
purposes of determining setback on abutting lots, lots having single-family or
two-family (duplex) dwelling located more than 50 feet from the front lot line
shall be considered to have a default 50-foot setback. In no case shall the
minimum required setback be less than 30 feet.

   7.1.1   Explanation of the structure of the table of permitted uses.
   (A)   Organization of use table. The Table of Permitted Uses in this article
organizes allowable uses by use classification, use categories, and use types.
Section
7.2, Use Classifications, Categories, and Types, establishes the
characteristics and examples of each of the use categories and types set forth
in the Table of Permitted Uses.
      (1)   Use classification. The use classifications are: Residential Uses,
Institutional Uses, Agricultural Uses, Commercial Uses, and Industrial Uses.
The use classification provides a systematic basis for assigning present and
future land uses into broad general classifications. The use classifications
then organize land uses and activities into general use categories and specific
use types based on the common functional, operational, or physical
characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers
or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions.
      (2)   Use categories. The use categories describe the major sub-groups of
the use classification based on common characteristics (e.g., the Residential
Use Classification is divided into two use categories: Household Living and
Group Living). Use Categories are further broken down into a series of
individual use types or principal uses.
      (3)   Use types. The specific use types are included in the respective
use categories. They identify the specific uses that are considered to fall
within the characteristics identified in the use category. For example, single-
family detached dwellings, duplexes, townhouses, multi-family dwellings, and
manufactured homes area use types in the household living category.
   (B)   Permitted uses. A “P” in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed
by right in the respective Base Zoning District, subject to compliance with any
use-specific standards contained in this article.
   (C)   Special uses. An “S” in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed in
the respective Base Zoning District only upon the issuance of a special use
permit by the Board of Adjustment, and subject to compliance with any use-
specific standards contained in this article.
   (D)   Prohibited uses. A blank cell indicates that a particular use type is
not allowed in the Base Zoning District.
      (1)   A blank cell indicates that a particular use type is not allowed in
the Base Zoning District.
      (2)   No hazardous or noxious uses are allowed within any zoning district
established by the land development ordinance such as, but not limited to:
         (i)   Acid manufacturing;
         (ii)   Ammonia, bleaching powder or chlorine manufacturing;
         (iii)   Creosote manufacturing or treatment plants;
         (iv)   Distillation of bones, coal, petroleum, refuse, tar and wood;
         (v)   Explosives, ammunition, fireworks or gunpowder manufacturing;
         (vi)   Fat rendering, production of fats and oils from animal and
vegetable products by boiling or distillation;
         (vii)   Garbage, offal and animal reduction and processing;
         (viii)   Junkyard;
         (x)   Linseed oil, shellac, turpentine manufacturing or refining;
         (xi)   Nitrogenous tankage, fish meal or manufacturing of any
fertilizer materials;
         (xii)   Oilcloth or linoleum manufacturing;
         (xiii)   Ore reduction; and
         (xv)   Pulp mills.
   (E)   Use specific standards. When a particular use category or use type is
permitted in a Base Zoning District, there may be additional regulations that
are applicable to the specific use. The existence of these use specific
standards is noted through a section reference in the last column in the table
titled “Additional Requirements.” References refer to §
7.3, Use Specific Standards. These standards shall apply to a particular use
regardless of the Base Zoning District where it is proposed, unless otherwise
specified.
   (F)   Uses prohibited by overlay zoning. An Overlay District may prohibit a
particular use type despite it being allowed in the Base Zoning District, or it
may require a special use permit for a use allowed by right in the Base Zoning
District. In such case, the more restrictive regulation shall apply.
   (G)   Uses not listed. The Ordinance Administrator shall determine whether
or not an unlisted use is part of an existing use category or use type defined
in §
7.2, Use Classification, Categories, and Types, or is substantially similar to
an already defined use type, using the standards in division
7.1.3, Interpretation of Unlisted Uses.
   7.1.2   Developments with multiple permitted uses. When all principal uses
of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is
assigned that use category. For example, a development that contains a coffee
shop, bookstore, and bakery would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service
category because all of the development’s principal uses are in that use
category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use
categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable use category and
each use is subject to applicable regulations within that category.
Developments with multiple use types, such as shopping centers, shall
incorporate only those use types allowed in the Base Zoning District.
   7.1.3   Interpretation of unlisted uses.
   (A)   Procedure for approving unlisted uses. Where a particular use type is
not specifically listed in the Table of Permitted Uses, the Ordinance
Administrator may permit the use type upon a finding the standards of division
7.1.3(B), Standards for Approving Unlisted Uses, are met. The Ordinance
Administrator shall give due consideration to the purpose and intent statements
in this ordinance concerning the Base Zoning District(s) involved, the
character of the uses specifically identified, and the character of the use(s)
in question.
   (B)   Standards for approving unlisted uses. In order to determine if the
proposed use(s) has an impact that is similar in nature, function, and duration
to the other use types allowed in a specific zoning district, the Ordinance
Administrator shall assess all relevant characteristics of the proposed use,
including, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale, and the like;
      (2)   The size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the
premises;
      (3)   Any processing done on the premises, including assembly,
manufacturing, warehousing, shipping, and distribution;
      (4)   Any dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the
processing;
      (5)   The nature and location of storage and outdoor display of
merchandise, whether enclosed, open, inside, or outside the principal building;
      (6)   The type, size, and nature of buildings and structures;
      (7)   The number and density of employees and customers per unit area of
site in relation to business hours and employment shifts;
      (8)   Transportation requirements, including the demand for people and
freight, by volume type and characteristic of traffic generation to and from
the site;
      (9)   Trip purposes and whether trip purposes can be shared by other use
types on the site;
      (10)   Parking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the number
of spaces required per unit area or activity, and the potential for shared
parking with other use types;
      (11)   The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises,
including, but not limited to, noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation,
and fumes;
      (12)   Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed
use type, including, but not limited to, water supply, wastewater output, pre-
treatment of wastes and emissions required or recommended, and any significant
power structures and communications towers or facilities; and
      (13)   The impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use type,
which should not be greater than that of other use types in the zoning
district.
   (C)   Effect of finding by Ordinance Administrator.
      (1)   Use found to be appropriate. When the Ordinance Administrator finds
that an unlisted use is appropriate and congruent with the Base Zoning District
for which it is proposed, he or she shall issue a written opinion allowing such
use to be established in the particular district. If the Ordinance
Administrator believes that requests for such a use will become common, or that
adding the use to the Table of Permitted Uses is beneficial, he or she shall
initiate a text amendment to insert the use into the Table of Permitted Uses.
      (2)   Use found to be inappropriate. When the Ordinance Administrator
finds that an unlisted use is inappropriate and incongruent with the Base
Zoning District for which it is proposed, he or she shall issue a written
opinion stating that such use is not allowed in the particular district. This
finding may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the
procedures for appealing an administrative decision.
   7.1.4   Permitted uses. 
Table 7-1 on the following pages outlines the uses which are allowed either by
right or with a special use permit in the Base Zoning Districts.

§ 7.2 USE CLASSIFICATIONS, CATEGORIES, AND TYPES.
   7.2.1   Structure of this section.
   (A)   General. This section identifies each of the five use classifications
in
Table 7-1, Table of Permitted Uses, and includes a section under each use
classification identifying each use category. There are “Characteristics” and
“Examples” divisions under each use category which describe the typical types
of uses that are included in each category.
   (B)   Principal use characteristics and accessory uses. The
“Characteristics” division describes common characteristics of each use
category. Principal uses are assigned to the use category that most closely
describes the nature of the principal use. Also listed are examples of common
accessory uses, which, unless otherwise stated in this ordinance, are allowed
in conjunction with a principal use.
   (C)   Examples. The “Examples” division lists common examples of use types
included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are
generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may
call itself. For example, a use that calls itself “Wholesale Sales”, but sells
mostly to consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service category
rather than the Wholesale Sales category. This is because the activity on the
site matches the characteristics of the retail sales and service use category.
   7.2.2   Residential use classification.

         (iii)   A buffer must be provided around the perimeter of the
property. At a minimum, this buffer must meet the requirements for a Type A
buffer strip as specified in
Article 10 of this ordinance. For RV parks being subdivided out of a mobile
home park existing on September 24, 2008, this buffer may be reduced along that
boundary where the RV park abuts the existing mobile home park if existing
utilities make planting new vegetation an unreasonable hardship. Said owner or
operator must demonstrate in a written request to the Ordinance Administrator
that complying with the requirements of this division
7.3.3 would cause the owner or operator an unreasonable hardship. The Ordinance
Administrator shall determine, in his or her reasonable discretion, when such
an unreasonable hardship exists.
         (iv)   All public road frontages shall be planted with a streetyard
planting area as specified in §
9.5 of this ordinance.
         (v)   Campsites shall be graded and maintained to prevent any water

graded to obtain a reasonably flat area and to provide adequate drainage away
from the campsite.
         (vi)   Each campsite shall be located at least 30 feet from the edge
of any publicly-maintained street or road; provided, however, in those cases
where an RV park is being subdivided from a mobile home park existing as of
September 24, 2008 which already has in place underground water, sewer, and
power servicing existing lots, this requirement may be waived by the Ordinance
Administrator following a written request from an owner or operator of the
existing mobile home park. Said owner or operator must demonstrate in its
written request that complying with the requirements of this division
7.3.3 would cause the owner or operator an unreasonable hardship. The Ordinance
Administrator shall determine, in his or her reasonable discretion, when such
an unreasonable hardship exists.
         (vii)   RV parks shall be designed to prevent overcrowding, fire
hazards, and to provide sufficient light and air. Every campsite shall be a
minimum of 2,000 square feet in area and shall have a minimum average width of
25 feet.

be provided. Each campsite must have enough space, one parking space, and
enough room for a RV to back into the campsite. Additional parking may be
provided on individual campsites or in a common parking area.
         (ii)   All streets and parking areas shall be surfaced with a minimum
of six inches of compacted stone and shall be maintained in a smooth, well-
graded condition. All internal roads shall be capable of supporting the imposed
load of fire apparatus in accordance with the Fire Apparatus Roads Standard in
the state’s Fire Code (N.C. Fire Code § 503).
         (iii)   All streets and parking areas shall be maintained in a manner
to be free from potholes, breaks in the pavement (if applicable), rough
surfaces, ponding of water, and associated problems which would impede or cause
hazards to motor vehicles.
         (iv)   All internal streets must be a minimum of 24 feet in width for
two-way traffic and 14 feet in width for one-way traffic. Such streets shall be
well-maintained and clearly identified. All streets within the RV park shall be

§ 7.4 ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   7.4.1   Purpose. This section authorizes the establishment of accessory uses
that are incidental and customarily subordinate to principal uses. The town’s
intent in adopting this section is to allow a broad range of accessory uses, so
long as such uses are located on the same site as the principal use, and so
long as they comply with the standards set forth in this section in order to
reduce potentially adverse impacts on surrounding lands.
   7.4.2   General standards and limitations.
   (A)   Compliance with ordinance requirements. All accessory uses and
accessory structures shall conform to the applicable requirements of this
ordinance. The provisions of this section establish additional standards and
restrictions for particular accessory uses and structures.
   (B)   General standards. All accessory uses and accessory structures shall
meet the following standards:
         (1)   Directly serve a pre-existing principal use or structure;
         (2)   Be customarily accessory and clearly incidental and subordinate

bulk, density, parking, landscaping, or open space standards of this ordinance;
         (7)   Not be constructed or established prior to the time the
principal use or structure is constructed or established unless expressly
permitted by this ordinance; and
         (8)   Not constitute a combination use, which is the combination of

of being subordinate or providing service to the principal use).
   (C)   Approval of accessory uses and structures.
         (1)   Unless otherwise specified in this section, any accessory use or
accessory structure shall be treated as a permitted use in the Base Zoning
District in which it is located. An accessory use or structure may be approved
in conjunction with approval of the principal use or structure.
         (2)   In cases where a use identified in
Table 7-1, Table of Permitted Uses, is proposed as an accessory use, the
accessory use shall also comply with all applicable standards in §
7.3, Use Specific Standards.
   (D)   Table of permitted accessory uses.
      (1)   Table as guide. 
Table 7-2, Table of Permitted Accessory Uses, is established as a guide to
identify the appropriateness of the more common accessory uses in each zoning
district.
      (2)   Listed accessory uses. 
Table 7-2, Table of Permitted Accessory Uses, lists what types of accessory
uses, structures, and activities are allowed in each of the zoning districts.
If a specific accessory use is allowed in a Base Zoning District, the column
underneath the zoning district is marked with a “P”. If a specific accessory
use is allowed as a special use in a Base Zoning District, the column
underneath the zoning district is marked with an “S”. If the accessory use or
structure is not allowed in a zoning district, the column is blank. If there is
a reference contained in the column entitled “Additional Requirements”, refer
to the cited section(s) for additional standards that apply to the specific
accessory use.
      (3)   Interpretation of unidentified accessory uses. The Ordinance
Administrator shall evaluate potential accessory uses that are not identified
in
Table 7-2, Table of Permitted Accessory Uses, on a case-by-case basis, as an
interpretation (see division
7.1.3). In making the interpretation, the Ordinance Administrator shall apply
the following standards:
         (i)   The definition of “accessory use” and the general accessory use
standards established in this division
7.4.2, General Standards and Limitations;
         (ii)   The additional regulations for specific accessory uses
established in division
7.4.3, Specific Standards for Certain Accessory Uses;
         (iii)   The purpose and intent of the zoning district in which the
accessory use is located;
         (iv)   Any potential adverse impacts the accessory use may have on
other lands in the area, compared with other accessory uses permitted in the
zoning district; and
         (v)   The compatibility of the accessory use, including the structure
in which it is housed, with other principal and accessory uses permitted in the
zoning district.

      (3)   Except for accessory structures identified in subsection (E)(1)
above, no accessory structure shall project beyond the front building line of
the principal structure or site. An attached porch, deck, garage, or carport
shall not be considered as an accessory structure for the purposes of this
subsection.
      (4)   Except for fences, walls, and unenclosed carports, no detached
accessory structures shall be located within five feet of a principal structure
or any other accessory structure.

§ 11.1 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this article is to provide incentives for developers to
preserve and protect existing mature trees in conjunction with new development.
Specifically, these standards are meant to:
   11.1.1   Improve the aesthetic quality of new development through the
preservation of existing trees;
   11.1.2   Maintain and enhance property values;
   11.1.3   Discourage the wholesale clearing of land for development;

environment and enhance the quality of the built environment; and
   11.1.5   Maintain the stability of slopes and control erosion and sediment
runoff into streams and waterways.
§ 11.2 APPLICABILITY.
   The standards set forth in this article may be utilized by developers who
desire to receive credit towards the tree planting requirements established in
Article 9, Landscaping Standards, and/or
Article 10, Buffering Standards, or the minimum parking requirements in
Article 13.
§ 11.3 TREE PRESERVATION INCENTIVES.
   The following incentives shall be provided when a development proposal
complies fully with the standards and requirements set forth in this article.
   11.3.1   Tree preservation credits. In order to encourage the preservation
of existing trees on a site, a tree preservation credit for the retention and
protection of existing, undisturbed, structurally sound and healthy trees shall
be granted in accordance with the following standards.
   (A)   Credit amount. For each tree preserved and protected in accordance
with the standards of this article, a credit in the amount of one and one-half
times the number of preserved trees shall be credited and applied towards the
tree planting requirements for landscaping and buffering. To receive credit,
the preserved trees must meet the following requirements.
      (1)   Canopy trees, whether deciduous or evergreen, shall have a minimum
diameter of eight inches, as measured four and one-half feet above ground
level, to receive credit.
      (2)   Understory or ornamental trees, whether deciduous or evergreen,
shall have a minimum diameter of four inches, as measured four and one-half
feet above ground level, to receive credit.
      (3)   For credit towards the tree planting requirements in
Article 9, Landscaping Standards, the preserved tree(s) must be located inside,
or within 30 feet of, the planting area for which the credit will be applied.
      (4)   For credit towards the tree planting requirements in
Article 10, Buffering Standards, the preserved tree(s) must be located within
the width of the required perimeter buffer strip.
   (B)   Credit towards required plantings. Approved tree preservation credits
may be applied to the tree planting requirements for streetyard landscaping,
motor vehicle use area landscaping, street trees, or perimeter buffers as
appropriate. In no case shall tree preservation credits be used to offset more
than 50% of the required number of trees in the area to which they are applied.
   11.3.2   Reduction in minimum parking requirements. When trees preserved and
credited in accordance with division
11.3.1 are located inside, or within 15 feet of, the perimeter of a motor
vehicle use area containing required parking spaces, the minimum parking
requirement, as set forth in
Article 13, may be reduced by 2.5% for each preserved tree that meets these
standards. In no case shall the minimum parking requirement be reduced by more
than 15%, regardless of the number of trees preserved.
§ 11.4 TREE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION PLAN REQUIRED.
   In order to qualify for tree preservation incentives, the developer must
submit, and receive approval of, a tree preservation and protection plan in
accordance with the standards in division
3.2.12. The plan shall indicate the size, type, and location of the tree(s) to
be preserved, tree protection zones, and the location and type of all active
and passive tree protection measures.
§ 11.5 PRESERVATION OF TREES THROUGH DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED.
   All trees indicated for preservation on the approved tree preservation and
protection plan must be preserved before, during, and following site
development activities. Tree protection measures, in accordance with the
standards in §
11.6, must be in place prior to development, and remain in place until a
certificate of occupancy is granted. If, through reckless or careless action by
the developer or his or her agents, or through disregard for the requirements
of this article, the developer removes or destroys a tree or trees indicated
for preservation, the incentive associated with that tree or trees shall be
revoked.
§ 11.6 TREE PROTECTION MEASURES DURING CONSTRUCTION.
   During the course of construction activities the following regulations shall
govern activities on sites which have an approved tree preservation and
protection plan.
   11.6.1   Tree protection zones shall be established surrounding all trees
indicated for preservation on the tree preservation and protection plan. These
zones shall extend outward to a distance of six feet from edge of the bottom of
the tree canopy.
   11.6.2   No person, in the construction of any structure(s) or improvement
(s) or any other activity, shall encroach or place solvents, material,
construction machinery, or temporary soil deposits within a tree protection
zone.
   11.6.3   Before development, land clearing, filling, or any land alteration,
the developer shall be required to erect suitable protective barriers as
required by the Ordinance Administrator, including tree fences, tree protection
signs, and erosion barriers until completion of site landscaping. Authorization
to remove the protective devices shall be in writing by the Ordinance
Administrator. Inspection of tree protection barriers is required prior to the
commencement of land disturbance or development. The Ordinance Administrator
shall be contacted to schedule an inspection time.
   11.6.4   Materials for active tree protection shall consist of chain link,
orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing, or other equivalent
restraining material. In addition to fencing, where active tree protection is
required, each tree to be saved shall be marked at the base of the trunk with
blue water-based paint.
   11.6.5   Materials for passive tree protection shall consist of heavy mil
plastic flagging, a minimum of four inches wide with dark letters reading “Tree
Protection Area - Do Not Enter”, or equivalent signage of a continuous, durable
restraint.
   11.6.6   All tree protection devices must remain in functioning condition
until the certificate of occupancy is issued, and must be removed promptly
thereafter.

   The following signs shall be prohibited.
   12.4.1   Signs interfering with traffic safety. Any sign that obstructs the
view of pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorists using any street, the approach to
any street intersection, or which interferes with the effectiveness of, or
obscures, any traffic sign, device, or signal as determined by the Ordinance
Administrator.
   12.4.2   Signs misconstrued as regulatory. Signs which contain lights,
rotating disks, words, and other devices not erected by a public authority,
which may be erroneously construed as regulatory signs or emergency warning
signs. An example of this is a sign which contains a picture of a traffic sign
plus the word “Stop” or “Yield”.
   12.4.3   Signs within the right-of-way. Any sign (other than a regulatory
sign), banner, or display placed on any curb, sidewalk, post, pole, hydrant,
bridge, tree, or other surface located on, over, or across any street or right-
of-way, or any banner placed on stakes on a property, unless otherwise
permitted.
   12.4.4   Signs blocking existing signs. Any sign located in such a way as to
intentionally deny visual access to another existing sign.
   12.4.5   Flashing signs. Signs with flashing or reflective disks, signs with
flashing lights or lights of changing degree of intensity or color (except
regulatory signs).
   12.4.6   Signs on stakes. Pole signs or signs on metal or wood stakes which
are not affixed to a permanent foundation (excluding regulatory signs and
temporary election signs).
   12.4.7   Portable signs. Portable signs, including marquee signs with wheels
and axles that have been removed and placed on permanent foundations.
   12.4.8   Vehicular signs. Vehicular signs placed or parked in such a manner
as to advertise a business or product from any street right-of-way. This also
includes billboards or outdoor advertising signs mounted to the bed of a truck.
   12.4.9   Moving or rotating signs. Signs which rotate or have any mechanical
or wind-driven components that cause the sign to move or transform.
   12.4.10   Roof signs. Roof signs that extend above the soffit of a pitched
roof, or above the highest point of a mansard roof or parapet wall.
   12.4.11   Off-premises commercial signs. Signs containing a commercial
message which are not located on the same parcel as the business, product, or
service being advertised. This shall not apply to outdoor advertising signs
(billboards) which comply fully with the requirements of this article and all
other applicable state and federal regulations.
   12.4.12   Inflatable signs. Inflatable signs (including inflated balloons
with a diameter of greater than two feet) except as allowed as part of a
temporary display as part of a holiday or civic event.
§ 12.5 GENERAL SIGN PROVISIONS.
   12.5.1   General standards. All permitted signs shall comply with the
following general standards.
      (A)   The scale of a sign shall be appropriate for the building on which
it is located.
      (B)   Signs shall be integrated with the design of the building and shall
not obscure architectural features.
      (C)   Any structurally-unsafe sign that endangers the public safety shall
be immediately removed or repaired and made compliant with the requirements of
this ordinance.
      (D)   No sign shall be located in a sight distance triangle or so as to
impair traffic visibility.
      (E)   Non-commercial message. Whenever the LDO permits a commercial sign,
a non-commercial message may be substituted for the commercial message. The
right to substitute the non-commercial message does not waive any other
requirement imposed by the LDO as to the number, size, type, construction,
location, lighting, safety or other regulated attribute.
   12.5.2   Computation of sign area.
      (A)   The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign
or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest
polygon that will encompass the limits of the writing, emblem, or other
display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the
background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop
or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting
framework, base, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall
otherwise meets the regulations of this ordinance and is clearly incidental to
the display itself. Street address numbers are not included within the sign
copy area.
      (B)   For a single wall, all pieces of information or other graphic
representations within a grouping on that wall shall be measured as though part
of one sign, encompassed within one rectangle, which may not exceed the
permitted total wall area to which the sign is affixed. For a single wall on a
multi-occupant building, the area of signs shall be computed using these
principles, and the aggregate copy of each.
   12.5.3   Authority to remove signs from right-of-way. Except where
authorized, signs within a public right-of-way shall be prohibited. The town
may remove and dispose of any sign located in the public right-of-way without
providing prior notice to the sign’s owner.

§ 13.1 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this article to relieve traffic congestion in the
streets, to minimize any detrimental effects of off-street parking areas on
adjacent lands, and to ensure the proper and uniform development of automobile
parking areas throughout the town.
§ 13.2 APPLICABILITY.
   These regulations shall apply to all land development activities within the
town. This includes the expansion, enlargement, change of use, or other action
which alters the parking demand for a structure or use.
§ 13.3 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING, AND STACKING
AREAS.
   13.3.1   Use of parking area, stacking area, or loading space. All vehicular
parking areas, stacking areas, and loading spaces required by this article
shall be used only for those purposes. Any other use, including, but not
limited to, vehicular storage, vehicle sales, vehicular repair work, vehicle

Off-street parking areas of three or more spaces and off-street loading areas
shall include painted lines, wheel stops, or other methods of identifying
individual parking spaces and loading areas and distinguishing such spaces from
aisles.
   13.3.3   Surfacing. All off-street parking, loading, and stacking areas
shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, brick, stone, pavers, or an
equivalent material. These materials shall be maintained in a smooth, well-
graded condition at all times. Except for detached single-family development,
gravel shall not be used to satisfy the requirements of this section. When
gravel is used, a hard surfaced driveway apron must be installed to the greater
of eight feet from the edge of pavement or past the ditch tile.

   (A)   All off-street parking and loading areas shall be arranged for
convenient access and safety of pedestrians and vehicles.
   (B)   Except for detached residential uses, off-street parking areas with
three or more spaces shall be arranged so that no parking or maneuvering
incidental to parking shall be on a public street or sidewalk, and so that an
automobile may be parked and un-parked without moving another automobile.
   (C)   All off-street parking and loading areas, except on lots used for
detached residential uses and townhouses, shall be arranged so that no vehicle
shall be required to back from such facilities directly onto public streets.
   13.3.5   Curbs and vehicle stops. All off-street parking and loading areas
shall provide curbs, wheel stops, or similar devices so as to prevent vehicles
from overhanging onto or into the public right-of-way, sidewalks, walkways,
adjacent land, or landscape areas.
   13.3.6   Maintenance. All off-street parking and loading areas shall be
maintained in good repair, and in safe condition at all times, so as not to
constitute a hazard to public safety or a visual or aesthetic nuisance to
surrounding land. All off-street parking and loading areas shall be
periodically re-striped or otherwise restored to maintain a clear
identification of separate parking stalls.
   13.3.7   Responsibility for provision. The responsibility for providing the
off-street parking and loading areas required by this section shall be that of
whomever develops the land that requires parking and loading areas.
   13.3.8   Construction of off-street parking and loading areas. All off-
street parking and loading areas shall be completed prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for the use or uses they serve.
§ 13.4 OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS.
   13.4.1   Minimum number of spaces required. Unless otherwise expressly
stated in this section, off-street parking spaces shall be provided in
accordance with
Table 13-1, Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements. Unlisted uses shall
conform to the requirements of the most similar use. The Ordinance
Administrator may approve an alternative parking standard if an applicant
submits an alternative parking standard with a parking study from a
professional engineer which demonstrates the alternative design meets more
current and accepted standards such as IT or ULI standards.

development be required to provide cross access to more than two adjacent
parcels.
      (2)   Future stubs required. A stub for future cross access shall be
provided to all adjacent vacant land designated as OI, NB, or HB.
      (3)   Placement and width. Cross access ways shall be located and
configured in a manner to provide the most convenient access between adjacent
parcels. No part of a cross access way shall be located within a street right-
of-way. The minimum width of the cross access way shall be 22 feet.
   (B)   Waiver. The cross access standard shall be waived by the Planning
Department if the applicant demonstrates it is impractical to provide cross
access due to:
      (1)   Topography or natural features;
      (2)   The size and configuration of the site;
      (3)   Vehicular safety factors;
      (4)   The presence of incompatible uses; or
      (5)   Existing development patterns on adjacent developed sites that make
cross access impossible.
      When cross access is waived in accordance with this section, pedestrian
connections shall be provided between adjacent developments or uses, to the
maximum extent practicable.
   (C)   Recording required. Where provided, cross access easements must be
recorded by the owner/developer of the property prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.

14.3   Streets
14.4   Sidewalks
14.5   Utilities
§ 14.1 GENERAL.
   14.1.1   Design. All proposed subdivisions, including group developments,
shall comply with this article and shall be designed to promote beneficial
development of the community, and shall bear a reasonable relationship to the
approved plans of the town.
   14.1.2   Reasonable relationship. All required improvements, easements, and
rights-of-way (other than required reservations) shall substantially benefit
the development or bear a reasonable relationship to the need for public
facilities attributable to the new development.
   14.1.3   Off-site connections. When, in the opinion of the approving body,
it is necessary to connect streets and/or utilities off-site to adjoining
streets and/or utilities, said improvements may be required in accordance with
town policy.
   14.1.4   Land suitability. Land which has been determined, on the basis of
an engineering assessment or other expert survey, to pose an ascertainable
danger to life or property by reason of its unsuitability for the use proposed
shall not be platted for that purpose until the subdivider has taken the
necessary measures to correct said conditions and to eliminate said dangers.
Areas that have been used for disposal of solid waste shall not be subdivided
unless tests by the Granville-Vance District Health Department, a structural
engineer, and a soils expert determine that the land is suitable for the
purpose proposed.
   14.1.5   Placement of monuments. The Standards of Practice for Land
Surveying in the state, as adopted by the state’s Board of Registration for
Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, shall apply when installing
permanent monuments.
   14.1.6   Sites for public use. In subdividing property, due consideration
shall be given by the subdivider to the reservation of suitable sites for
schools and other public uses in accordance with G.S. § 160A-372.
   14.1.7   Property owners’ associations.
   (A)   Creation. An owners’ association shall be established to fulfill
requirements of the state’s Condominium Act, being G.S. §§ 47C-1-101 et seq.,
state’s Planned Community Act, being G.S. 47F-1-101 et seq., or to accept
conveyance and maintenance of all common elements (common areas) within a
development. The owners’ association shall be in legal existence prior to the
conveyance, lease-option, or other long-term transfer of control of any unit or
lot in the development.
   (B)   Conveyance. Where developments have common elements serving more than
one dwelling unit, these areas shall be conveyed to the owners’ association, in
which all owners of lots in the development shall be members. All areas other
than public street rights-of-way, other areas dedicated to the town, and lots
shall be designated as common elements. In a condominium development the common
elements shall be platted in accordance with the state’s Condominium Act. In
other developments, the fee-simple title shall be conveyed by the subdivider or
developer to the owners’ association prior to the sale of the first lot.
   (C)   Subdivision or conveyance of common elements. Common elements shall
not subsequently be subdivided or conveyed by the owners’ association unless a
revised preliminary plat and a revised final plat showing such subdivision or
conveyance have been submitted and approved.
   (D)   Minimize number of associations. Developments, whether including
different land uses, different types of housing, or simply different sections,
shall hold the number of owners’ associations to a minimum. An association may
establish different categories of membership, different budgets for the
categories, and different rates of assessment when different kinds of services
are provided to different categories. Smaller associations under an umbrella
(master) association are permitted.
   (E)   Exemption from owners’ association requirement. A development
involving only two units attached by a party wall (or two separate walls back-
to-back) shall not be required to have common elements or an owners’
association. Such developments without an owners’ association shall establish a
binding agreement between owners to govern any party walls and to ensure
reciprocal easement rights needed for maintenance.

§ 14.2 LOT STANDARDS.
   The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development
contemplated and shall conform to the following.
   14.2.1   Conformance with other regulations. Every lot shall have sufficient
area, dimensions, and street access to permit a principal building to be
erected thereon in compliance with all zoning and other requirements of this
ordinance.
   14.2.2   Minimum building area. Every lot shall have at least 40% of its
total area, or 3,000 square feet, whichever is less, of contiguous buildable
area of a shape sufficient to hold a principal building. Said area shall lie at
or be filled to an elevation at least one foot above the 100-year flood
elevation.
   14.2.3   Lot depth to width ratio. No lot shall have a depth greater than
four times the width at the minimum front street setback.
   14.2.4   Side lot line configuration. Side lines of lots should be at or
near right angles or radial to street lines.
   14.2.5   Lot lines and drainage. Lot boundaries shall coincide with natural
and pre-existing human- made drainageways to the extent practicable to avoid
lots that can be built upon only by altering such drainageways.
   14.2.6   Lots on thoroughfares. Major subdivisions shall not be approved
that permit individual residential lots to access major or minor thoroughfares.
   14.2.7   Access requirements. All lots must have public street access and
frontage meeting the requirements set forth in
Article 6, Zoning, or as follows.
   (A)   Flag lots may be allowed only if the following requirements are met:
      (1)   A flag lot shall contain only one single-family dwelling and its
uninhabited accessory structures;
      (2)   The maximum flagpole length shall be 300 feet;
      (3)   The minimum flagpole width shall be 25 feet;
      (4)   The maximum lot size in areas with public sewer shall be one acre;
      (5)   The maximum lot size without public sewer shall be three acres.
(Note: the flagpole portion of the lot is not used to calculate area, width,
depth, coverage, and setbacks of the lot or to provide off-street parking);
      (6)   Where public water is available, any building on the flag lot must
be within 500 feet of a fire hydrant. This distance shall be measured along the
street, then along the flagpole, then in a straight line to the building
location;
      (7)   Where public sewer is available, occupied buildings on the flag lot
shall have a gravity service line, or the sewer pump requirement shall be noted
on the plat; and
      (8)   Use of a single driveway to serve adjoining flag lots or to serve a
flag lot and an adjoining conventional lot is permitted and encouraged. In the
latter case, the preferred location for the driveway is on the flagpole portion
of the flag lot, with the conventional lot granted an access easement over the
flagpole.
§ 14.3 STREETS.
   14.3.1   Dedication of right-of-way. Right-of-way for public streets shall
be dedicated to the town pursuant to G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 19, Part 2 and other
applicable state laws. When dedication cannot be required, any future street
right-of-way indicated on adopted thoroughfare plans or collector street plans
shall be shown on the plat.
   14.3.2   Conformance with thoroughfare plans and collector street plans. The
location and design of streets shall be in conformance with applicable
thoroughfare plans and collector street plans. Where conditions warrant, right-
of-way widths and pavement widths in excess of the minimum street standards may
be required.
   14.3.3   Conformance with adjoining street systems. The planned street
layout of a proposed subdivision shall be compatible with existing or proposed
streets and their classifications on adjoining or nearby tracts.
   14.3.4   Internal street network connectivity.
      (A)   A minimum street connectivity index, as determined by the method
outlined in division
14.3.4(B), shall be established for all new residential subdivisions. Within
the RP and RR Districts, the minimum index score shall be 1.2, and within the
RS, RT, and RMX Districts, the minimum index score shall be 1.4. Planned unit
developments shall have a minimum index score of 1.5 for the entire street
network serving the development.
      (B)   The street connectivity index shall be calculated by dividing the
number of “links” contained in the network by the number of “nodes” contained
in the network. For the purpose of this calculation, a “node” is the
intersection of two streets or the head of a cul-de-sac within the development.
“Links” are lengths of street that connect the nodes. Street stubs shall be
considered to be links, but alleys and temporary dead-end streets within the
development are not counted as links. One link beyond each node that connects
the internal street network to the external street network shall be included in
this calculation.
      (C)   An applicant may submit a petition to the town requesting that the
minimum connectivity index score be reduced. In the petition, the applicant
shall demonstrate how if the proposed site design developer has achieved the
required connectivity score to the maximum extent practicable given the
topography, environmental conditions, natural features, or adjacent existing
development patterns. The Ordinance Administrator shall review the petition and
evaluate whether it meets the town's connectivity standard to the maximum
extent practicable given the demonstrated site conditions listed in this
subsection.
   14.3.5   Access to adjoining property. Where, in the opinion of the
approving body, it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining
property, proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary of such property.
   14.3.6   Minimum number of access points to public street network. The
minimum number of points of street access shall be based on the number of
dwelling units in the proposed development as set forth below.
      (A)   Residential developments with more than 50 lots or dwelling units
shall have at least two separate points of public road access.
      (B)   Residential developments with more than 150 lots or dwelling units
shall have at least three separate points of public road access.
   14.3.7   Reserve strips. Reserve strips adjoining street rights-of-way for
the purpose of preventing access to adjacent property shall not be permitted
under any condition.
   14.3.8   Public street design criteria. Public streets shall be constructed
in accordance with the standards contained in the NCDOT Roadway Design Manual
or the NCDOT Subdivision Roads Minimum Construction Standards as appropriate.
   14.3.9   Private street design criteria.
      (A)   Where permitted. Private streets shall be permitted in single-
family detached residential developments, townhouses developments, and in
residential developments that are gated or otherwise secured self-contained
developments that have their access to public street(s) at one or more secured
points.
      (B)   Design and construction. The pavement, construction, and design
standards for all private streets shall be equivalent to the standards for
local residential streets unless the developer supplies an alternate pavement
design (supported by an engineering study) approved by the town. The developer
must furnish an engineer’s seal and certification that the private streets have
been tested and certified for the subgrade, base, and asphalt. Common area may
need to be widened to include the side ditch section.
      (C)   Through streets. No through street in a residential area connecting
two public streets can be designated as a private street.
      (D)   Connections to public streets. All private streets connecting with
public streets require approved driveway permits from the town or NCDOT as
applicable.
      (E)   Sidewalks. Where sidewalks are installed on private streets, they
shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards as specified
in this ordinance and shall meet or exceed the town’s standard specifications
for sidewalks.
   14.3.10   Street intersections. Streets shall be designed to intersect each
other at angles as close to 90 degrees as possible. Property lines at street
intersections shall be a tangent connecting points on each right-of-way line,
which are located a minimum distance of 20 feet back from the intersection of
the two right-of-way lines in residentially zoned areas and 50 feet in
nonresidentially zoned areas.
   14.3.11   Streets crossing natural areas. All streets crossing natural
areas, wetlands, or streams shall cross at or as near to 90 degrees as possible
within topographic limits.
   14.3.12   Spacing between intersections. A minimum spacing of 150 feet
between intersections shall be maintained. In no case shall a pair of
intersecting streets be approved with an offset that does not meet this minimum
distance standard.
   14.3.13   Maximum length of cul-de-sacs. The maximum distance from an
intersecting through street to the end of a cul-de-sac shall be 1,000 feet,
except in the Watershed Critical Area, where a maximum length of 1,600 feet is
allowed.
   14.3.14   Temporary turnarounds. Streets stubbed to adjoining property or to
phase lines shall be required to have temporary turnarounds at the end of the
street which are of a sufficient size to permit sanitation and emergency
vehicles to turn around.
   14.3.15   Grades at intersections. The grade on stop streets approaching an
intersection shall not exceed 5% for a distance of 100 feet from the centerline
of the intersection.

      (5)   Along one side of new and existing local streets, unless other
pedestrian safety, access, or circulation needs are identified.
   14.4.3   Exempt locations.
   (A)   Along new and existing local and sub-collector residential streets
where, upon review by the approving body, the following conditions are found to
exist:
      (1)   The proposed development is within an area consisting predominantly
of existing single-family residential development, where no sidewalks are
present;
      (2)   The character and size of the proposed development will not result
in substantial additional pedestrian facility needs; and
      (3)   There are no new pedestrian facilities planned or identified in a
pedestrian transportation network plan that would provide a pedestrian
connection to the proposed development.
   (B)   Along existing streets in predominantly industrial areas where no
sidewalks are present and where, upon review by the approving body, a sidewalk
is not deemed necessary or feasible.
   (C)   Along new and existing cul-de-sac streets and permanent dead-end
streets, which are 800 feet or less in length, and which are not strategic
pedestrian routes.
   14.4.4   Extent. Sidewalks required by this ordinance shall be constructed
along that portion of the street or streets that the parcel abuts, for the full
length of the property line abutting the street or streets. Where sidewalks are
required to be installed on one side of a street, the approving body shall
determine upon which side the sidewalks are to be installed, in accordance with
the town’s standard specifications for sidewalks.
   14.4.5   Construction standards. All sidewalks, whether required by this
ordinance or installed voluntarily, shall be constructed to the town’s standard
specification for sidewalks and have a minimum width of five feet and a minimum
thickness of four inches of concrete.
   14.4.6   Payment in lieu of sidewalk alternative. As an alternative to
sidewalks construction, the applicant has the option to make a payment in lieu
of constructing the required sidewalks and shall be informed of the amount of
payment in lieu before issuance of a zoning permit. Payment in lieu
requirements.
   (A)   Approval must be given for payment in lieu of sidewalks by the
Ordinance Administrator with guidance from the Planning Board, and/or Technical
Review Committee.
   (B)   Payment in lieu of sidewalks is allowed where:
      (1)   Construction of sidewalks would be inconsistent or unreasonable
based on surrounding conditions such as topography, wetlands, and the like; and
      (2)   Where a sidewalk would not connect to adjacent sidewalks nor are
there proposed or adopted plans for a connecting sidewalk at the site.
   (C)   Payment in lieu is not permitted if:
      (1)   Site is located in the RMF, CB, SI, NI, CX, CW, or CE Zoning
Districts;
      (2)   If property is adjacent to any existing sidewalk, greenway bikeway,
or pathway; or
      (3)   Site is adjacent to a proposed development plan with sidewalk and/
or adjacent to any sidewalk planned for construction.
   (D)   Payment in lieu of sidewalks fund requirements. Funds must be equal to
the estimated cost of construction of the required sidewalk, which includes
materials, labor, engineering, and any required infrastructure improvements for
that sidewalk. In situations where the payment in lieu is being made because
topography or wetlands make the construction of the sidewalk impractical or
impossible, the Ordinance Administrator may take such impracticality or
impossibility into account and may accept a payment lower than the actual costs
of building a sidewalk or trail in such location provided such lower payment is
not less than cost of construction of such a sidewalk under ordinary
conditions. Payment shall be made prior to final plat approval.
   (E)   Fund appropriations. Such funds shall be used at the discretion of the
town for use in building or completing pedestrian, bikeway, and/or pathway
systems.

South Granville Water and Sewer Authority’s standard specifications for utility
line construction.
   14.5.2   Water and sewer connections. Connection of each lot to public water
and sewer utilities shall be required if the proposed subdivision is within 300
feet of the nearest adequate line of a public system, provided that no
geographic or topographic factors would make such connection infeasible. Where
public sewer is not available, lots shall meet applicable Granville-Vance
District Health Department regulations. The final plat shall show the
certificate of approval from the Environmental Health Division as shown in
Appendix B .
   14.5.3   Water and sewer capacity. Subdivisions which are required connect
to public utilities must obtain adequate water and sewer capacity allocations
from the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority (SGWASA) for the expected
amount of usage for the entire subdivision prior to the approval of a
preliminary plat. As a condition of approval for a preliminary plat, the
subdivider may be required to release allocated water and sewer capacity back
to SGWASA if the preliminary plat is allowed to expire.
   14.5.4   Underground utilities. Electrical, telecommunication, cable
television, and other utility lines installed within and along streets abutting
major subdivisions shall be underground unless the approving body determines
underground installation is inappropriate.

§ 15.1 WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION RULES.
   15.1.1   Authority and general regulations.
      (A)   Authority. The state legislature has, in G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 8, §
174, General Ordinance Authority; and in G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 21, Watershed
Protection Rules, delegated the responsibility or directed local governmental
units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare of its citizenry. In addition, G.S. § 160D-926 refers
specifically to water supply watershed management. The Town Council does hereby
ordain and enact into law the following provisions.
      (B)   Jurisdiction. The provisions of this article shall apply within the
areas designated as a Water Supply Watershed by the state’s Environmental
Management Commission and shall be defined and established on the map entitled,
“Water Supply Watershed Protection Map of the Town of Butner, North Carolina”
(“the Watershed Map”), which is adopted simultaneously herewith. The Watershed
Map and all explanatory matter contained thereon accompanies and is hereby made
a part of this LDO. This ordinance shall be permanently kept on file in the
office of the Town Clerk.
      (C)   Exceptions to applicability.
         (1)   Nothing contained herein shall repeal, modify, or amend any
federal or state law or regulation, or any ordinance or regulation pertaining
thereto except any ordinance which these regulations specifically replace; nor
shall any provision of this article amend, modify, or restrict any provisions
of the LDO or the Code of Ordinances of the town; however, the adoption of this
article shall and does amend any and all ordinances, resolutions, and
regulations in effect in the town at the time of the adoption of this article
that may be construed to impair or reduce the effectiveness of this article or
to conflict with any of its provisions.
         (2)   It is not intended that these regulations interfere with any
easement, covenants, or other agreements between parties. However, if the
provisions of these regulations impose greater restrictions or higher standards
for the use of a building or land, then the provisions of these regulations
shall control.
         (3)   Existing development, as defined in §
17.1, is not subject to the requirements of §
15.1. Expansions to structures classified as existing development must meet the
requirements of §
15.1.
         (4)   Expansions to existing development must meet the requirements of
this ordinance, except single-family residential development or unless
expansion is part of common plan of development. In any expansion, the built-
upon area of the existing development is not required to be included in the
density calculations. Where there is a net increase of built-upon area, only
the area of net increase is subject to this ordinance. Where existing
development is being replaced with new built-upon area, and there is net
increase of built-upon area, only areas of net increase shall be subject to
this ordinance.
         (5)   If a nonconforming lot of record is not contiguous to any other
lot owned by the same party, then that lot of record shall not be subject to
the development restrictions of this article if it is developed for single-
family residential purposes. Any lot or parcel created as part of a family
subdivision after the effective date of these rules shall be exempt from these
rules if it is developed for one single-family detached residence and if it is
exempt from the subdivision regulations set out in the LDO. Any lot or parcel
created as part of any other type of subdivision that is exempt from the LDO’s
subdivision ordinance, shall be subject to the land use requirements (including
impervious surface requirements) of this article, except that such a lot or
parcel must meet the minimum buffer requirements to the maximum extent
practicable.
         (6)   An applicant may exceed the density limits in
15.1.3(B) if all of the following circumstances apply:
            (i)   The property was developed prior to the effective date of the
local water supply watershed program.
            (ii)   The property has not been combined with additional lots
after January 1, 2021.

preserved in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance.
   15.1.2   Subdivision regulations.
      (A)   General provisions.
         (1)   No subdivision plat of land within the Water Supply Watershed
shall be filed or recorded by the Register of Deeds until it has been approved
in accordance with the provisions of this article. Likewise, the Clerk of
Superior Court shall not order or direct the recording of a plat if the
recording of such plat would be in conflict with this article.
         (2)   The approval of a plat does not constitute or effect the
acceptance by the town or the public of the dedication of any street or other
ground, easement, right-of-way, public utility line, or other public facility
shown on the plat and shall not be construed to do so.
         (3)   All subdivisions shall conform with the mapping requirements
contained in G.S. § 47-30.
         (4)   All subdivisions of land within the jurisdiction of town after
the effective date of this article shall require a plat to be prepared,
approved, and recorded pursuant to this article.
      (B)   Subdivision application and review procedures.
         (1)   All proposed subdivisions shall be reviewed prior to recording
with the Register of Deeds by submitting a vicinity map to the Ordinance
Administrator to determine whether or not the property is located within the
designated Water Supply Watershed. Subdivisions that are not within the
designated watershed area shall not be subject to the provisions of this
article and may be recorded provided the Ordinance Administrator signs all
appropriate certifications. In addition, subdivisions within a WS-IV watershed
are subject to the provisions of this article only when an erosion and
sedimentation plan is required under the provisions of state law, or approved
local program. Subdivisions within the designated watershed area shall comply
with the provisions of this article and all other state and local requirements
that may apply.
         (2)   Subdivision applications shall be filed with the Ordinance
Administrator. The application shall include a completed application form, two
copies of the plat, and supporting documentation deemed necessary by the
Ordinance Administrator or the Planning Board (see Appendix A).
         (3)   The Ordinance Administrator shall review the completed
application and shall either approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove each
application. The Ordinance Administrator shall take final action within 45 days
of submission of the application. The Ordinance Administrator or the Planning
Board may provide public agencies an opportunity to review and make
recommendations. However, failure of the agencies to submit their comments and
recommendations shall not delay action within the prescribed time limit. Said
public agencies may include, but are not limited to, the following:
            (i)   The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT)
District Highway Engineer with regard to proposed streets and highways that
will be maintained by the NCDOT;
            (ii)   The Health Department with regard to proposed private water
system or sewer systems normally approved by the Health Department;

approval shall be indicated on both copies of the plat by the certificate of
watershed compliance (see Appendix B) and signed by the Ordinance
Administrator.
         (5)   If the Ordinance Administrator disapproves or approves
conditionally the application, the reasons for such action shall be stated in
writing for the applicant and entered in the minutes. The subdivider may make
changes and submit a revised plan which shall constitute a separate request for
the purpose of review.
         (6)   All subdivision plats shall comply with the requirements for
recording of the County Register of Deeds.
         (7)   The plat shall be recorded within 30 days of approval. The
Subdivider shall provide the Watershed Administrator with evidence the plat has
been recorded with the Register of Deeds within five working days.
      (C)   Subdivision standards and required improvements.
         (1)   Adequate building space. All lots shall provide adequate
building space in accordance with the development regulations contained in
division 15.1.3. Existing lots of record which are smaller than the minimum
required for residential lots may be developed using built-upon area criteria
in accordance with division 15.1.3.
         (2)   For the purpose of calculating built-upon area, total project
area shall include total acreage in the tract on which the project is to be
developed.
         (3)   Storm water drainage facilities. The application shall be
accompanied by a description of the proposed method of providing storm water
drainage. The subdivider shall provide a drainage system that diverts
stormwater runoff away from surface waters and incorporates to minimize water
quality impacts and meets local requirements.
         (4)   Erosion and sedimentation control. The application shall, where
required, be accompanied by a written statement that a sedimentation and
erosion control plan has been submitted to and approved by the state’s Division
of Land Quality.
         (5)   Roads constructed in critical areas and watershed buffer areas.
Where possible, roads should be located outside of critical areas and watershed
buffer areas. Roads constructed within these areas shall be designed and
constructed to minimize their impact on water quality.
      (D)   Construction procedures.
         (1)   No construction or installation of improvements shall commence
in a proposed subdivision until a subdivision plat has been approved, public
roadway construction drawings are approved, the stormwater permit is issued,
and NCDEQ has issued an erosion control permit.
         (2)   No building or other permits shall be issued for erection of a
structure on any lot not of record at the time of adoption of this article
until all requirements of this article have been met. The subdivider, prior to
commencing any work within the subdivision, shall make arrangements with the
Watershed Administrator to provide for adequate inspection.

1   New development in WS-II Balance of Watershed may occupy 10% of the
watershed area which is outside the critical area, with 70% built-upon area
when approved as a special intensity allocation (SIA). The Ordinance
Administrator is authorized to approve SIAs consistent with the provisions of
this ordinance. Projects must, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize
built-upon surface area, direct stormwater away from surface waters and
incorporate stormwater control measures to minimize water quality impacts. Non-
discharging landfills and residuals application sites are allowed.
 
      (C)   Calculation of project density.
         (1)   The following requirements shall apply to the calculation of
project density:
            (i)   Project density shall be calculated as the total built-upon
area divided by the total project area;
            (ii)   A project with existing development as defined in article
17.1 may use the calculation method in
15.1.3(C)(1)(i) above or shall have the option of calculating project density
as the difference of total built-upon area minus existing built-upon area
divided by the difference of total project area minus existing built-upon area;
            (iii)   Expansions to existing development shall be subject to 15A
NCAC 02B .0624 except as excluded in Rule 15A NCAC 02B .0622(1)(d).
            (iv)   When there is a net increase of built-upon area, only the
area of net increase shall be subject to density and built-upon area limits,
per 15A NCAC 02B.0264.
            (v)   Where existing development is being replaced with new built-
upon area and there is a net increase of built-upon area only the area of net
increase shall be subject to density and built-upon area limits, per 15A NCAC
02B.0624.
            (vi)   Total project area shall exclude the following:
               (a)   Areas below the normal high water line (NHWL); and
               (b)   Areas defined as “coastal wetlands” pursuant to 15A NCAC
07H .0205 herein incorporated by reference including subsequent amendments and
additions, and available at no cost at http://reports.oah.state.nc.us/ncac.asp
as measured landward from the normal high water line (NHWL); and
            (vii)   Projects under a common plan of development shall be
considered as a single project for purposes of density calculation except that
on a case-by-case basis, local governments may allow projects to be considered
to have both high and low density areas based on one or more of the following
criteria:
               (a)   Natural drainage area boundaries;
               (b)   Variations in land use throughout the project; and
               (c)   Construction phasing.
      (D)   Low density design standards.
         (1)   Low density projects, in addition to complying with the project
density requirements of division (B) of this article, shall meet the following
minimum design criteria.
            (i)   Stormwater runoff from the project shall be released to
vegetated areas as dispersed flow or transported by vegetated conveyances to
the maximum extent practicable. In determining whether this criteria has been
met, the local government shall take into account site-specific factors such as
topography and site layout as well as protection of water quality. Vegetated
conveyances shall be maintained in perpetuity to ensure that they function as
designed. Vegetated conveyances that meet the following criteria shall be
deemed to satisfy the requirements of this divivsion:
               (a)   Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical) unless it is demonstrated to the Ordinance Administrator that the
soils and vegetation will remain stable in perpetuity based on engineering
calculations and on-site soil investigation; and
               (b)   The conveyance shall be designed so that it does not erode
during the peak flow from the ten-year storm as demonstrated by engineering
calculations.
            (ii)   Curb outlet systems. Low density projects may use curb and
gutter with outlets to convey stormwater to grassed swales or vegetated areas.
Requirements for these curb outlet systems are as follows:
               (a)   The curb outlets shall be designed such that the swale or
vegetated area can carry the peak flow from the ten-year storm at a non-erosive
velocity;
               (b)   The longitudinal slope of the swale or vegetated area
shall not exceed 5%, where practicable. Where not practical due to physical
constraints, devices to slow the rate of runoff and encourage infiltration to
reduce pollutant delivery shall be provided;
               (c)   The swale’s cross-section shall be trapezoidal with a
minimum bottom width of two feet;
               (d)   The side slopes of the swale or vegetated area shall be no
steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical);
               (e)   The minimum length of the swale or vegetated area shall be
100 feet;
               (f)   Low density projects may use treatment swales designed
pursuant to 15A NCAC 02H .1061 in lieu of the requirements specified in
divisions (a) through (e) above.
      (E)   High density design standards.
         (1)   In addition to complying with the project density requirements
of
15.1.3(B), high density projects shall meet the following minimum design
criteria.
            (i)   Treatment requirements. SCMs shall be designed, constructed,
and maintained so that the project achieves either “runoff treatment” or
“runoff volume match” as those terms are defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0621.
            (ii)   For high density projects designed to achieve runoff
treatment, the required storm depth shall be one inch. Applicants shall have to
option to design projects to achieve runoff volume match in lieu of runoff
treatment;
            (iii)   Stormwater runoff from off-site areas and existing
development shall not be required to be treated in the SCM. Runoff from off-
site areas or existing development that is not bypassed shall be included in
sizing of on-site SCMs;
            (iv)   Stormwater outlets shall be designed so that they do not
cause erosion downslope of the discharge point during peak flow from the ten-
year-storm event as shown by engineering calculations.
      (v)   SCMs shall meet the relevant MDC set forth in 15A NCAC 02H.1050
through .1062.
         (2)   Peak Flow Management.
            (i)   Developments that increase the post-developed peak runoff
rate from the predeveloped peak runoff rate for either the two-year or ten-year
24-hour storm event shall provide one of the following:
               (a)   Offsite Downstream Analysis:
                  1.   Perform an analysis of the downstream drainage
conveyances, storm drainage, culverts, etc. for the two-year and ten-year storm
events that confirms no adverse impacts to those downstream conveyances,
buildings, and other structures.
                  2.   The total drainage area used in the analysis shall
extend offsite downstream to a point where the proposed site development or
redevelopment represents less than 10% of the total drainage area analyzed.
Example: A five-acre parcel that disturbs four-acres for development and that
four-acres is discharged at a single location would be required to extend the
analysis downstream to a point where the total drainage area analyzed equals 40
acres.
               (b)   Provide SCMs that control the post-developed peak runoff
flow rates to the predeveloped peak runoff flow rates for the two-year and ten-
year 24-hour storm events.
               (c)   The Development discharges directly into a 100-year
floodplain and the stormwater outlets are designed so that they do not cause
erosion downslope of the discharge point during peak flow from the ten-year-
storm event as shown by engineering calculations. Any portion of the
development that does not discharge directly into the 100-year floodplain will
be required to comply with the High Density Standard, division
15.1.3. (E).
            (ii)   Developments that increase the peak runoff from the 100-year
storm may be required to install stormwater management facilities to address
the impact, as determined by the Stormwater Administrator.
      (F)   Variations from division 15.1.3(D) and (E). The Ordinance
Administrator may approve projects that do not comply with all of the
provisions of this section on a case-by-case basis as follows.
         (1)   If the variation pertains to an SCM design that does not meet
all of the MDC, then the applicant shall provide technical justification based
on engineering calculations and the results of research studies showing that
the proposed design is equally or more protective of water quality than the
requirements of this section and that it shall function in perpetuity. The
Ordinance Administrator shall have the option to require compliance with the
MDC in the event that the alternative SCM design fails.
         (2)   If the variation pertains to other aspects of the project, then
the applicant shall demonstrate that the project provides equal or better
stormwater control and equal or better protection of waters of the state.
      (G)   Density averaging.
         (1)   An applicant may average development density on up to two
noncontiguous properties for the purpose of achieving compliance with the water
supply watershed development standards if all of the following circumstances
exist:
            (i)   The properties are within the same water supply watershed.
However, if one of the properties is located in the critical area of the
watershed, the critical area property shall not be developed beyond the
applicable density requirements for its classification.
            (ii)   Overall project density meets applicable density or
stormwater control requirements under 15A NCAC 2B .0200.
            (iii)   Vegetated setbacks on both properties meet the minimum
statewide water supply watershed protection requirements.
            (iv)   Built-upon area designed and located to minimize stormwater
runoff impact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated stormwater flow,
maximize concentrated stormwater flow, maximize the use of street flow through
vegetated areas and maximize the flow length through vegetated areas.
            (v)   Areas of concentrated density development are located in
upland areas and, to the maximum extent practicable, away from the surface
waters and drainageways.
            (vi)   The property or portions of the properties that are not
being developed will remain in a vegetated or natural state and will be managed
by a homeowner's association as common area, conveyed by a local government as
a park or greenway, or placed under a permanent conservation or farmland
preservation easement unless it can be demonstrated that the local government
can ensure long-term compliance through deed restrictions and an electronic
permitting mechanism. A metes and bounds description of the areas to remain
vegetated and limits on use shall be recorded on the subdivision plat in
homeowners' covenants, and on individual deeds. Any such limitations or
restrictions on use shall be irrevocable.
         (2)   Development permitted under density averaging and meeting
applicable low density requirements shall transport stormwater runoff by
vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable.
         (3)   A special use permit shall be obtained from the Butner Board of
Adjustment to ensure that both properties are considered together to meet the
standards of the watershed ordinance and that potential owners have record of
how the watershed regulations were applied to the properties.
      (H)   Cluster development. Cluster development is allowed in all
Watershed Areas [except WS-I] under the following conditions:
         (1)   Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster
development projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the
number of lots allowed for single-family detached developments in division
15.1.3. Density or built-upon area for the project shall not exceed that
allowed for the critical area, balance of watershed, or protected area,
whichever applies.
         (2)   All built-upon area shall be designed and located to minimize
stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated
stormwater flow, maximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas, and
maximize the flow length through vegetated areas.
         (3)   Areas of concentrated density development shall be located in
upland area and away, to the maximum extent practicable, from surface waters
and drainageways.
         (4)   The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or
natural state. The title to the open space area shall be conveyed to an
incorporated homeowners’ association for management; to a local government for
preservation as a park or open space; or to a conservation organization for
preservation in a permanent easement. Where a property association is not
incorporated, a maintenance agreement shall be filed with the property deeds.
         (5)   Cluster developments that meet the applicable low density
requirements shall transport stormwater runoff by vegetated conveyances to the
maximum extent practicable.
      (I)   Vegetated setbacks required.
         (1)   A minimum 100-foot vegetative buffer is required for all new
development activities that exceed the low density option; otherwise, a minimum
30-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is required along all
perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S. 1:24,000
(7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by local government
studies. Desirable artificial streambank or shoreline stabilization is
permitted.
         (2)   No new development is allowed in the buffer except for water
dependent structures, other structures such as flag poles, signs, and security
lights which result in only diminutive increases in impervious area and public
projects such as road crossings and greenways where no practical alternative
exists. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff
away from the surface waters, and maximize the utilization of stormwater
stormwater control measures.
         (3)   Where USGS topographic maps do not distinguish between perennial
and intermittent streams, on on-site stream determination may be performed by
an individual qualified to perform such stream determinations.
      (J)   Rules governing the interpretation of watershed area boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of the watershed areas, as shown
on the Watershed Map, the following rules shall apply.
         (1)   Where area boundaries are indicated as approximately following
either street, alley, railroad, or highway lines or centerlines thereof, such
lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
         (2)   Where area boundaries are indicated as approximately following
lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. However, a
surveyed plat prepared by a registered land surveyor may be submitted to the
town’s planning and zoning jurisdiction as evidence that one or more properties
along these boundaries do not lie within the watershed area.
         (3)   Where the watershed area boundaries lie at a scaled distance
more than 25 feet from any parallel lot line, the location of watershed area
boundaries shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the Watershed
Map. The Environmental Management Commission adopted this provision with
intention of locating build-upon surface area in the least environmentally
sensitive area of the project.
         (4)   Where the watershed area boundaries lie at a scaled distance of
25 feet or less from any parallel lot line, the location of watershed area
boundaries shall be construed to be the lot line.
         (5)   Where other uncertainty exists, the Watershed Administrator
shall interpret the Watershed Map as to location of such boundaries. This
decision may be appealed to the Watershed Review Board.
      (K)   Application of regulations.
         (1)   No building or land shall hereafter be used and no development
shall take place except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for
the watershed area in which it is located.
         (2)   No area required for the purpose of complying with the

requirements of §
15.1, however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required
to be included in the built-upon area calculations.
         (1)   Uses of land. This category consists of uses existing at the
time of adoption of this ordinance where such use of the land is not permitted
to be established hereafter in the watershed area in which it is located. Such
uses may be continued except as follows.
            (i)   When such use of land has been changed to an allowed use, it
shall not thereafter revert to any prohibited use.
            (ii)   Such use of land shall be changed only to an allowed use.
            (iii)   When such use ceases for a period of at least one year, it
shall not be reestablished.
         (2)   Reconstruction of buildings or built-upon areas. Any existing
building or built-upon area not in conformance with the restrictions of this
ordinance that has been damaged or removed may be repaired and/or
reconstructed, except that there are no restrictions on single-family
residential development, provided:
            (i)   Repair or reconstruction is initiated within 12 months and

the Ordinance Administrator may consult with qualified personnel for assistance
to determine if the application meets the requirements of this ordinance.
         (4)   A watershed protection/stormwater permit shall expire if a
building permit or occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the
applicant within 12 months from the date of issuance.
      (N)   Building permit required. No permit required under the state’s
Building Code shall be issued for any activity for which a watershed
protection/stormwater permit is required until that permit has been issued.
      (O)   Watershed protection/stormwater occupancy permit.
         (1)   The Ordinance Administrator shall give approval for an occupancy
permit certifying that all requirements of this ordinance have been met prior
to the occupancy or use of a building hereafter erected, altered, or moved and/
or prior to the change of use of any building or land.
         (2)   An occupancy permit, either for the whole or part of a building,
shall be applied for coincident with the application for a watershed
protection/stormwater permit and shall be issued or denied within ten days
after the erection or structural alterations of the building.
         (3)   When only a change in use of land or existing building occurs,

structurally altered may be occupied until the Ordinance Administrator has
approved the issuance of an occupancy permit.
   15.1.4   Public health regulations.
      (A)   Public health, in general. No activity, situation, structure, or
land use shall be allowed within the watershed which poses a threat to water
quality and the public health, safety, and welfare. Such conditions may arise
from inadequate on-site sewage systems which utilize ground absorption;
inadequate sedimentation and erosion control measures; the improper storage or
disposal of junk, trash, or other refuse within a buffer area; the improper
management of stormwater runoff; or any other situation found to pose a threat
to water quality.

§ 15.2 STORMWATER REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTING THE FALLS LAKE
RULES.
   15.2.1   Authority. This article is adopted pursuant to G.S. § 143-214.7,
Session Law 2006-246 and the rules promulgated by the state’s Environmental
Management Commission thereunder. Specifically, this article is adopted to
comply with the standards of the Universal Stormwater Management Program and
the Falls Nutrient Strategy New Development Rule as set forth in the state’s
Administrative Code (15A NCAC 2H .1020(b) and 15A NCAC 02B .0277).
   15.2.2   Findings. It is hereby determined that:
   (A)   Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil
erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and
sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;
   (B)   These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities
of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to
public health and safety as well as to the natural environment;
   (C)   These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design
and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites;
   (D)   Further, the Commission has identified Falls of Neuse reservoir, a
water supply reservoir as nutrient sensitive waters; has identified all or a
portion of the reservoir as impaired waters under the Federal Clean Water Act,
being 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq. due to exceedances of the chlorophyll a
standard; and has promulgated rules (the “Falls Rules”) to reduce the average
annual loads of nitrogen and phosphorus delivered to Falls Reservoir from all
point and nonpoint sources of these nutrients located within its watershed,
including stormwater from new development in this jurisdiction; and
   (E)   Therefore, the town establishes this set of water quality and quantity
regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control
of stormwater runoff and discharge for development.
   15.2.3   Purpose.
   (A)   General. 
      The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain, and enhance the
public health, safety, environment, and general welfare by establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-
development stormwater runoff, nitrogen and phosphorus in stormwater runoff,
and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and
redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of construction-
related and post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public
and private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety,
and general welfare; and protect water and aquatic resources.
      This article seeks to meet its general purpose through the following
specific objectives and means:
      (1)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect
the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
      (2)   Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as
practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, stream bank
erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream
temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic
habitats;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)   Establishing design criteria for the construction, function, and
use of structural stormwater best management practices ( BMPs) that may be used
to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices,
such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of
open space, riparian buffers, and other conservation areas to the maximum
extent practicable;
      (6)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they
continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no
threat to public safety; and
      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the inspection of
approved projects and to assure adequate and appropriate long-term maintenance.
   15.2.4   Applicability.
   (A)   General. This article shall be applicable to all development and
redevelopment activities, unless exempt pursuant to division
15.2.4(E), Exemptions.
   (B)   Effective date. The effective date of §
15.2, Stormwater Requirements For New Development Implementing the Falls Lake
Rules, is May 3, 2012.
   (C)   Final approvals, complete applications.
      All development and redevelopment projects for which complete and full
applications were submitted and approved by the town of, if prior to
incorporation, by the county prior to the effective date of this article and
which remain valid, unexpired, unrevoked, and not otherwise terminated at the
time of development shall be exempt from complying with all provisions of this
article dealing with the control and/or management of stormwater.
      A phased development plan shall be deemed approved prior to the effective
date of this article if it has been approved by all necessary government units,
it remains valid, unexpired, unrevoked, and not otherwise terminated, and it
shows:
      (1)   For the initial or first phase of development or redevelopment, the
type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels, including at a
minimum, the boundaries of the project and a subdivision plan that has been
approved; and
      (2)   For any subsequent phase of development or redevelopment,
sufficient detail so that implementation of the requirements of this article to
that phase of development would require a material change in that phase of the
plan.
   (D)   Violations continue. Any violation of provisions existing on the
effective date of this article shall continue to be a violation under this
article and be subject to penalties and enforcement under this article unless
the use, development, construction, or other activity complies with the
provisions of this article.
   (E)   Exemptions.
      (1)   Thresholds.
         (i)   Single-family and duplex residential and recreational

acre and is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale is exempt
from the provisions of this article.
         (ii)   Commercial, industrial, institutional, multi-family
residential, or local government development and redevelopment that
cumulatively disturbs less than 12,000 square feet, and is not part of a larger
common plan of development or sale is exempt from the provisions of this
article.
         (iii)   Development and redevelopment that disturb less than the above
thresholds are not exempt if such activities are part of a larger common plan
of development or sale and the larger common plan exceeds the relevant
threshold, even though multiple, separate, or distinct activities take place at
different times on different schedules.
         (iv)   Development that is exempt from permit requirements of § 404 of
the Federal Clean Water Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1344, as specified in 40 C.F.R.
part 232, (primarily, ongoing farming and forestry activities) are exempt from
the provisions of this article.
      (2)   General exemption.

violation of the city regulations.
   (F)   No development or redevelopment until compliance and permit. No
development or redevelopment shall occur except in compliance with the
provisions of this article as evidenced by the issuance of a stormwater
management permit, unless exempted herein. No development or redevelopment for
which a permit is required pursuant to this article shall occur except in
compliance with the provisions, conditions, and limitations of the permit.
   (G)   Map.
      (1)   The provisions of this article shall apply within the areas
designated on the map titled “Town of Butner Watershed Map”, which is adopted
simultaneously herewith. The town’s Watershed Map and all explanatory matter
contained thereon accompanies, and is hereby made a part of, this ordinance and
is integrated with the Official Zoning Map.
      (2)   The town’s Watershed Map shall be kept on file by the Ordinance
Administrator and shall be updated to take into account changes in the land
area covered by this article and the geographic location of all structural BMPs
permitted under this article. In the event of a dispute, the applicability of
this article to a particular area of land or BMP shall be determined by
reference to the state’s statutes, the state’s Administrative Code, and the
standards for determining zoning district boundaries as set forth in division
1.8.3.
   15.2.5   Stormwater Design Manual.
   (A)   Reference to Stormwater Design Manual.
      The Ordinance Administrator shall use the policy, criteria, and
information, including technical specifications and standards, in the latest
version of the NC Stormwater Design Manual available through the Ordinance
Administrator as the basis for decisions about stormwater permits and about the
design, implementation, and performance of structural and non-structural
stormwater BMPs and other practices for compliance with this article.
      The Stormwater Design Manual includes a list of acceptable stormwater
treatment practices, including specific design criteria for each stormwater
practice. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and
maintained in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed
to meet the minimum water quality performance standards of Phase II, Falls
Rules and other applicable stormwater laws.
   (B)   Relationship of Stormwater Design Manual to other laws and
regulations.
      (1)   Conflict of laws. This article is not intended to modify or repeal
any other article, ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The
requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other
article, ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. Where any
provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by
any other article, ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards
for human or environmental health, safety, and welfare shall control.
      (2)   Private agreements. This article is not intended to revoke or
repeal any easement, covenant, or other private agreement. However, where the
regulations of this article are more restrictive or impose higher standards or
requirements than such an easement, covenant, or other private agreement, the
requirements of this article shall govern. Nothing in this article shall modify
or repeal any private covenant or deed restriction, but such covenant or
restriction shall not legitimize any failure to comply with this article. In no
case shall the town be obligated to enforce the provisions of any easements,
covenants, or agreements between private parties.
   (C)   Changes to standards and specifications. If the standards,
specifications, guidelines, policies, criteria, or other information in the
Stormwater Design Manual are amended subsequent to the submittal of an
application for approval pursuant to this ordinance but prior to approval, the
new information shall control and shall be utilized in reviewing the
application and in implementing this ordinance with regard to the application.
   15.2.6   Review and decision-making entities.
   (A)   Stormwater Administrator.
      (1)   Designation. The Ordinance Administrator shall be the Stormwater
Administrator.
      (2)   Powers and duties. In addition to the powers and duties that may be
conferred by other provisions of this ordinance and other laws, the Ordinance
Administrator shall have the following powers and duties under this article:
         (i)   To review and approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove
applications for approval of plans pursuant to this article;
         (ii)   To make determinations and render interpretations of this
article;
         (iii)   To establish application requirements and schedules for
submittal and review of applications and appeals, to review and make
recommendations to the Town Council on applications for development or
redevelopment approvals;
         (iv)   To enforce the provisions of this article in accordance with
its enforcement provisions;
         (v)   To maintain records, maps, forms, and other official materials
as relate to the adoption, amendment, enforcement, and administration of this

governing board and, if a stormwater board is established, the name of that
board as well), upon request;
         (vii)   To designate appropriate other person(s) who shall carry out
the powers and duties of the Ordinance Administrator; and
         (viii)   To take any other action necessary to administer the
provisions of this article.
   (B)   Review procedures.
      (1)   Permit required; must apply for permit. A stormwater permit is
required for all development and redevelopment unless exempt pursuant to this
article. A permit may only be issued subsequent to a properly submitted and
reviewed permit application, pursuant to this section. Applications shall be
governed by other applicable provisions of this ordinance, specifically
including, but not limited to,
Article 3, Review and Approval Procedures.
      (2)   Effect of permit.
      A stormwater permit shall govern the design, installation, and
construction of stormwater management and control practices on the site,
including engineered stormwater controls and elements of site design for
stormwater management other than engineered stormwater controls.
      The permit is intended to provide a mechanism for the review, approval,
and inspection of the approach to be used for the management and control of
stormwater for the development or redevelopment site consistent with the
requirements of this article, whether the approach consists of engineered
stormwater controls or other techniques such as low-impact or low-density
design. The permit does not continue in existence indefinitely after the
completion of the project; rather, compliance after project construction is
assured by the maintenance provisions of this article.
      (3)   Authority to file application. All applications required pursuant
to this Code shall be submitted to the Stormwater Administrator by the land
owner or the land owner’s duly authorized agent.
      (4)   Establishment of application requirements, schedule, and fees.
         (i)   Application contents and form. The Ordinance Administrator shall
establish requirements for the content and form of all applications and shall
amend and update those requirements from time to time. At a minimum, the
stormwater permit application shall describe in detail how post-development
stormwater runoff will be controlled and managed, the design of all stormwater
facilities and practices, and how the proposed project will meet the
requirements of this article.
         (ii)   Submission schedule. The Ordinance Administrator may establish
a submission schedule for applications. The schedule shall establish deadlines
by which complete applications must be submitted for the purpose of ensuring
that there is adequate time to review applications, and that the various stages
in the review process are accommodated.
         (iii)   Permit review fees. The Town Council shall establish permit
review fees as well as policies regarding refund of any fees upon withdrawal of
an application, and may amend and update the fees and policies from time to
time.
         (iv)   Administrative manual. For applications required under this
article, the Ordinance Administrator shall compile the application
requirements, submission schedule, fee schedule, a copy of this article, and
information on how and where to obtain the Design Manual in an Administrative
Manual, which shall be made available to the public.
      (5)   Submittal of complete application.
      Applications shall be submitted to the Ordinance Administrator pursuant
to the application submittal schedule in the form established by the Ordinance
Administrator, along with the appropriate fee established pursuant to this
section.
      An application shall be considered as timely submitted only when it
contains all elements of a complete application pursuant to this article, along
with the appropriate fee. If the Ordinance Administrator finds that an
application is incomplete, the applicant shall be notified of the deficient
elements and shall be provided with an opportunity to submit a complete
application. However, the submittal of an incomplete application shall not
suffice to meet a deadline contained in the submission schedule established
above.
      (6)   Review. The Ordinance Administrator shall review the application
and determine whether the application complies with the standards of this
article.
         (i)   Approval. If the Ordinance Administrator finds that the
application complies with the standards of this ordinance, the Ordinance
Administrator shall approve the application. The Ordinance Administrator may
impose conditions of approval as needed to ensure compliance with this article.
The conditions shall be included as part of the approval.
         (ii)   Fails to comply. If the Stormwater Administrator finds that the
application fails to comply with the standards of this ordinance, the
Stormwater Administrator shall notify the applicant and shall indicate how the
application fails to comply. The applicant shall have an opportunity to submit
a revised application.
         (iii)   Revision and subsequent review.
         A complete revised application shall be reviewed by the Ordinance
Administrator after its re-submittal and shall be approved, approved with
conditions, or disapproved.
         If a revised application is not re-submitted within 30 calendar days
from the date the applicant was notified, the application shall be considered
withdrawn and a new submittal for the same or substantially the same project
shall be required along with the appropriate fee for a new submittal.
         One re-submittal of a revised application may be submitted without
payment of an additional permit review fee. Any re-submittal after the first
re-submittal may require additional review fees, as established pursuant to
this article.
   15.2.7   Stormwater management standards. All development and redevelopment
to which this article applies shall comply with the standards of this section.
   (A)   Riparian buffer standards.
      (1)   Riparian buffer requirements.
      Proposed new development shall demonstrate compliance with the riparian
buffer protection requirements of 15A NCAC 02B .0233 and .0242 or subsequent
amendments or replacements to those requirements.
      If surface waters (intermittent, perennial, lakes, ponds, and estuaries)
are present, riparian stream buffers are required and measured from the top of
bank as follows; Zone 1 a 30-foot undisturbed buffer; and Zone 2 a 20-foot
vegetated buffer, both in accordance with 15A NCAC 02B .0233.
   (B)   Stormwater control requirements.
      (1)   Stormwater control measures shall be designed to control and treat
the runoff generated from all surfaces by one inch of rainfall. The treatment
volume shall be drawn down pursuant to standards specific to each practice as
provided in the Stormwater BMP Design Manual.
      (2)   To ensure that the integrity and nutrient processing functions of
receiving waters and associated riparian buffers are not compromised by erosive
flows, stormwater flows from the development shall not contribute to
degradation of waters of the state. At a minimum, the development shall not
result in a net increase in peak flow leaving the site from pre-development
conditions for the one-year, 24-hour storm event. New development may satisfy
the requirements of this rule by meeting the post-development hydrologic
criteria set out in Chapter 2 of the state’s Low Impact Development Guidebook,
dated June 2009, or the hydrologic criteria in the most recent version of that
guidebook.
   (C)   Standards.
      (1)   General standards. All development and redevelopment to which this
article applies shall comply with the standards of this section. The approval
of the stormwater permit shall require an enforceable restriction on property
usage that runs with the land, such as a recorded deed restriction or
protective covenants, to ensure that future development and redevelopment
maintains the site consistent with the approved project plans.
      (2)   Nitrogen and phosphorus loading.
         (i)   Nitrogen and phosphorus loads contributed by the proposed new
development shall not exceed the following unit-area mass loading rates: [2.2
and 0.33 pounds per acre per year for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively].
         (ii)   Notwithstanding 15A NCAC 2B .104(q), redevelopment subject to
this ordinance that would replace or expand existing structures or improvements
and would result in a net increase in built-upon area shall have the option of
either meeting the loading standards identified in division
15.2.7(A)(1) or meeting a loading rate that achieves the following nutrient
loads compared to the existing development: 40% and 77% reduction for nitrogen
and phosphorus, respectively.
         (iii)   Nitrogen and phosphorus loading rates shall be calculated by
using the approved accounting tool and methods.
      (3)   Nitrogen and phosphorus standard is supplemental. The nitrogen and
phosphorus loading standards in this article are supplemental to, not
replacements for, stormwater standards otherwise required by federal, state, or
local law, including without limitation any riparian buffer requirements
applicable to the location of the development. This includes, without
limitation, the riparian buffer protection requirements of 15A NCAC 2B .0233
and .0242.
      (4)   Partial offset of nutrient control requirements. Development
subject to this article shall attain nitrogen and phosphorus loading rate
reductions on-site that meet the following criteria prior to using an off-site
offset measure:
         (i)   Thirty percent or more reduction in both nitrogen and phosphorus
loading from the untreated conditions for any single-family, detached and
duplex residential development disturbing one half acre but less than one acre;
         (ii)   Fifty percent or more reduction in both nitrogen and phosphorus
loading from the untreated conditions for any single-family, detached and
duplex residential development disturbing more than one acre;
         (iii)   Thirty percent or more reduction in both nitrogen and
phosphorus loading from the untreated condition for other development,
including multi-family residential, commercial, and industrial development
disturbing 12,000 square feet but less than one acre;
         (iv)   Fifty percent or more reduction in both nitrogen and phosphorus
loading from the untreated condition for other development, including multi-
family residential, commercial, and industrial development disturbing more than
one acre; or
         (v)   Thirty percent or more reduction in both nitrogen and phosphorus
loading from the untreated condition for proposed redevelopment activities in a
designated downtown area that would replace or expand structures or
improvements that existed as of December 2006.
      A developer subject to this ordinance may achieve the additional
reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus loading required by this article by
making offset payments to the state’s Ecosystem Enhancement Program contingent
upon acceptance of payments by that program. A developer may use an offset
option provided by the town. A developer may propose other offset measures to
the town, including providing his or her own off-site offset or utilizing a
private seller. All offset measures permitted by this ordinance shall meet the
requirements of 15A NCAC 02B .0282 and 15A NCAC 02B .0240.
   (D)   Standards for stormwater control measures.
      (1)   Evaluation according to contents of design manual. All stormwater
control measures and stormwater treatment practices (also referred to as best
management practices, or BMPs) required under this article shall be evaluated
by the Ordinance Administrator according to the policies, criteria, and
information, including technical specifications and standards and the specific
design criteria for each stormwater practice, in the Stormwater BMP Design
Manual. The Ordinance Administrator shall determine whether proposed BMPs will
be adequate to meet the requirements of this article.
      (2)   Determination of adequacy; presumptions and alternatives.
Stormwater treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained
in accordance with the criteria and specifications in the Stormwater BMP Design
Manual will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality and quantity
performance standards of this article. Whenever an applicant proposes to
utilize a practice or practices not designed and constructed in accordance with
the criteria and specifications in the Stormwater BMP Design Manual, the
applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the practice(s) will
satisfy the minimum water quality and quantity performance standards of this
article. The Ordinance Administrator may require the applicant to provide the
documentation, calculations, and examples necessary for the Ordinance
Administrator to determine whether such an affirmative showing is made.
      (3)   Dedication of BMPs, facilities, and improvements. The town may
accept the dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility
for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this
article and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by
easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
   15.2.8   Variances. Applications for variances shall be considered as set
out in division
3.2.5 of this ordinance.
   15.2.9   Maintenance.
   (A)   Standards for maintenance.
      (1)   Function of BMPs as intended. The owner of each structural BMP
installed pursuant to this article shall maintain and operate it so as to
preserve and continue its function in controlling stormwater quality and
quantity at the degree or amount of function for which the structural BMP was
designed.
      (2)   Annual maintenance inspection and report. The person responsible
for maintenance of any structural BMP installed pursuant to this article shall
submit to the Ordinance Administrator an inspection report from a registered
state professional engineer or a state registered landscape architect, or by a
person who has been awarded a Stormwater BMP Inspection and Maintenance
Certification by the North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension
Service. The inspection report shall contain all of the following:
         (i)   The name and address of the land owner;
         (ii)   The recorded book and page number of the lot of each structural
BMP;
         (iii)   A statement that an inspection was made of all structural
BMPs;
         (iv)   The date the inspection was made;
         (v)   A statement that all inspected structural BMPs are performing
properly and are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the approved
maintenance agreement required by this article; and
         (vi)   The original signature and seal of the engineer, surveyor, or
landscape architect.
   All inspection reports shall be on forms supplied by the Ordinance
Administrator. An original inspection report shall be provided to the Ordinance
Administrator beginning one year from the date of as-built certification and
each year thereafter on or before the date of the as-built certification.
   (B)   Operation and maintenance agreement.
      (1)   In general.
         (i)   Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site
to be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this article, and prior to
issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural
BMP pursuant to this article, the applicant or owner of the site must execute
an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent
owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the
structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served
by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary
responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement.
         (ii)   The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner
or owners to maintain, repair, and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural
BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the
structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the town a right of entry in the
event that the Ordinance Administrator has reason to believe it has become
necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural
BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an
obligation on the town to assume responsibility for the structural BMP.
         (iii)   The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by
the Ordinance Administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced
on the final plat and shall be recorded with the County Register of Deeds upon
final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be
given to the Ordinance Administrator within 14 days following its recordation.
      (2)   Special requirement for homeowners’ and other associations. For all
structural BMPs required pursuant to this article and that are to be or are
owned and maintained by a homeowners’ association, property owners’
association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance
agreement shall include all of the following provisions.
         (i)   Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate
and maintain the stormwater control and management facilities.
         (ii)   Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely
for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major
repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not
performing adequately or as intended or are not properly maintained, the town,
in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such instances the
town shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be
spent by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or
vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural
BMPs, provided that the town shall first consent to the expenditure.
         (iii)   Both a developer contribution(s) and annual sinking funds
shall fund the escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of
construction permits, whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into
the escrow account an amount equal to 10% of the initial construction cost of
the structural BMPs. Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget
shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five years and the
full amount shall be deposited within ten years following initial construction
of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow
account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association shall include
an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow
account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work
used to create the sinking fund budget.
         (iv)   The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to
fund the escrow account may be varied by the town depending on the design and
materials of the stormwater control and management facility.
         (v)   Granting to the town a right of entry to inspect, monitor,
maintain, repair, and reconstruct structural BMPs.
         (vi)   Allowing the town to recover from the association and its
members any and all costs the (name of local government) expends to maintain or
repair the structural BMPs or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure
to pay the town all of its expended costs, after 45 days written notice, shall
constitute a breach of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, the town shall
thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and its
members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement
against the property, or both. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees
shall be added to the recovery.
         (vii)   A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the town to
maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the town shall not be liable to any
person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs.
         (viii)   A statement that this agreement shall not in any way
diminish, limit, or restrict the right of the town to enforce any of its
ordinances as authorized by law.
         (ix)   A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the town for any
costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP, unless the
town has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for the BMP
and has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out that
maintenance.
   (C)   Inspection program.
      Inspections and inspection programs by the town may be conducted or
established on any reasonable basis, including, but not limited to, routine
inspections, random inspections, inspections based upon complaints or other
notice of possible violations, and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are
not limited to, reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges,
surface water, groundwater, and material or water in BMPs; and evaluating the
condition of BMPs.
      If the owner or occupant of any property refuses to permit such
inspection, the Ordinance Administrator shall proceed to obtain an
administrative search warrant pursuant to G.S. § 15-27.2 or its successor. No
person shall obstruct, hamper, or interfere with the Ordinance Administrator or
his or her designee while carrying out his or her official duties.

§ 15.3 STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURE ADDITIONAL STANDARDS.
   15.3.1   Performance security may be required.
   (A)   The Ordinance Administrator may, at his or her discretion, require the
submittal of a performance security or bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of
credit, or other acceptable legal arrangement prior to issuance of a permit in
order to ensure that the structural BMPs are:
      (1)   Installed by the permit holder as required by the approved
stormwater management permit; and/or
      (2)   Maintained by the owner as required by the operation and
maintenance agreement.
   (B)   Amount of security.
      (1)   Installation security. The amount of an installation performance
security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs approved
under the permit, plus 25%.
      (2)   Maintenance security. The amount of a maintenance performance
security shall not exceed 10% of the stormwater control project’s original cost
of construction and shall be retained by the owner(s) of the stormwater control
measure.
   (C)   Uses of performance security.
      (1)   Forfeiture provisions. The performance security shall contain
forfeiture provisions for failure, after proper notice, to complete work within
the time specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions which may be
required of the applicant or owner in accordance with this ordinance, approvals
issued pursuant to this ordinance, or an operation and maintenance agreement
established pursuant to this ordinance.
      (2)   Default. Upon default of the owner to construct, maintain, repair,
and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the
applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement, the Ordinance
Administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of the security to make
necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of
funds shall only be made after requesting the owner to comply with the permit
or maintenance agreement. In the event of a default triggering the use of
installation performance security, the town shall not return any of the unused
deposited cash funds or other security, which shall be retained for
maintenance.
      (3)   Costs in excess of performance security. If the Ordinance
Administrator takes action upon such failure by the applicant or owner, the
town may collect from the applicant or owner the difference between the amount
of the reasonable cost of such action and the amount of the security held, in
addition to any other penalties or damages due.
      (4)   Refund. Within 60 days of the final approval, the installation
performance security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, except
any amount attributable to the cost (plus 25%) of landscaping installation and
ongoing maintenance associated with the BMPs covered by the security. Any such
landscaping shall be inspected one year after installation with replacement for
compliance with the approved plans and specifications and, if in compliance,
the portion of the financial security attributable to landscaping shall be
released.
   15.3.2   Notice to owners.
      (1)   Deed recordation and indications on plat. The applicable operations
and maintenance agreement, conservation easement, or dedication and acceptance
into public maintenance, as applicable, pertaining to every structural BMP
shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the County
Register of Deeds upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat is recorded
for the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement, conservation
easement or dedication, and acceptance into public maintenance, as applicable,
shall be recorded with the County Register of Deeds so as to appear in the
chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching
principles.
      (2)   Signage. Where appropriate in the determination of the Ordinance
Administrator to assure compliance with this article, structural BMPs shall be
posted with a conspicuous sign stating who is responsible for required
maintenance and annual inspection along with that person or entity’s contact
information including phone number. The sign shall be maintained so as to
remain visible and legible. In addition, danger and no trespassing signs shall
be posted around any structural BMP.
   15.3.3   Records of installation and maintenance activities. The owner of
each structural BMP shall keep records of inspections, maintenance, and repairs
for at least five years from the date of creation of the record and shall
submit the same upon reasonable request to the Ordinance Administrator.
   15.3.4   Nuisance. The owner of each stormwater BMP, whether a structural or
non-structural BMP, shall maintain it so as not to create or result in a
nuisance condition.
   15.3.5   Inspection easement. Every structural BMP installed pursuant to
this article shall be made accessible for inspection by an inspection easement.
The easement shall be recorded and its terms shall specify who may make use of
the easement and for what purposes.
   15.3.6   Enforcement and violations.
   (A)   Responsible persons/entities.
      Any person who erects, constructs, reconstructs, alters (whether actively
or passively), or fails to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair, or
maintain any structure, BMP, engineered stormwater control, practice, or
condition in violation of this article shall be subject to the remedies,
penalties, and/or enforcement actions in accordance with this section. Persons

   The legislature of the state of has in G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 21, Part 6; G.S.
Ch. 160A, Art. 19, Parts 3, 5, and 8; and G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 8, delegated to
local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Town
Council does ordain as follows.
(Ord. A.19.08, passed 11-7-2019)
§ 16.2 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   16.2.1   The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are
subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life, property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   16.2.2   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities
and by the occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other
hazards.
(Ord. A.19.08, passed 11-7-2019)
§ 16.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this article to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to:
   16.3.1   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
   16.3.2   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   16.3.3   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   16.3.4   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that
may increase erosion or flood damage; and
   16.3.5   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. A.19.08, passed 11-7-2019)
§ 16.4 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this article are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety, and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges)
that are located in flood-prone areas;
   (F)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
   (G)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the National
Flood Insurance Program;
   (H)   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
   (I)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas; and
   (J)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special
Flood Hazard Area.
(Ord. A.19.08, passed 11-7-2019)
§ 16.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   16.5.1   Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to
all Special Flood Hazard Areas within the planning and zoning jurisdiction of
the town, including extraterritorial jurisdictions.
   16.5.2   Basis for establishing the Special Flood Hazard Areas. The Special
Flood Hazard Areas are those identified under the cooperating technical state
(CTS) agreement between the state and FEMA, in its flood insurance study (FIS)
dated December 6, 2019, for Granville County and associated DFIRM panels,
including any digital data developed as part of the FIS, which are adopted by
reference and declared a part of this article, and all revisions thereto after
January 1, 2021. Future revisions to the FIS and DFIRM panels that do not
change flood hazard data within the jurisdictional authority of the town are
also adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. Subsequent
letters of map revision (LOMRs) and/or physical map revisions (PMRs) shall be
adopted within three months.
   16.5.3   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
article prior to the commencement of any development activities within Special
Flood Hazard Areas determined in accordance with the provisions of division
16.5.2.
   16.5.4   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located,
extended, converted, altered, or developed in anyway without full compliance
with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
   16.5.5   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   16.5.6   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
article, all provisions shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   16.5.7   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur. Actual flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This article does not imply that land outside the Special Flood Hazard
Areas, or uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the town, or by
any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this article, or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
   16.5.8   Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this
article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation
of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance
or special exceptions, shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor pursuant to G.S.
§ 143-215.58. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $100
or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing contained herein
shall prevent the town from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation.

   (U)   Coordinate revisions to FIS reports and FIRMs, including letters of
map revision based on fill (LOMR-Fs) and letters of map revision (LOMRs).
   16.6.4   Corrective procedures.
   (A)   Violations to be corrected. When the Floodplain Administrator finds
violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his or her duty to
notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law cited in such
notification.
   (B)   Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of
a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
Floodplain Administrator shall give the owner written notice, by certified or
registered mail to the owner’s last known address or by personal service,
stating:
      (1)   That the building or property is in violation of the floodplain
management regulations;
      (2)   That a hearing will be held before the Floodplain Administrator at
a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the
notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by
counsel, and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
      (3)   That following the hearing, the Floodplain Administrator may issue
an order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
applicable.
   (C)   Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of this article, he or she shall issue
an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation
within a specified time period, not less than 60 calendar days, nor more than
180 calendar days. Where the Floodplain Administrator finds that there is
imminent danger to life or other property, he or she may order that corrective
action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible.
   (D)   Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal the order to the local elected governing body, by giving notice of
appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the Clerk within ten days
following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order
of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall
hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or
revoke the order.
   (E)   Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no appeal has
been made, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an
appeal, the owner shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. §
143-215.58, and shall be punished at the discretion of the court.
   16.6.5   Variance procedures.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment as established, hereinafter referred to as the
“appeal board”, shall hear and decide requests for variances from the
requirements of this article.
   (B)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal
such decision to the court, as provided in G.S. Ch. 7A.
   (C)   Variances may be issued for:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures, upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure, and that the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure;
      (2)   Functionally dependent facilities if determined to meet the
definition as stated in §
17.2, provided provisions of division
16.6.5(I)(2),
(3), and
(5) have been satisfied, and such facilities are protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety; or
      (3)   Any other type of development provided it meets the requirements of
this section.
   (D)   In passing upon variances, the appeal board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this article, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as defined
under §
17.2 as a functionally dependent facility, where applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
         (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters, and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (E)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
      (F)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
article.
      (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the BFE and the elevation to which the
structure is to be built, and that such construction below the BFE increases
risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the BFE may result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to FEMA and the state upon request.
   (I)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or
non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (i)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (ii)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; and
      (iii)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
   (J)   A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities or sites,
hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage
facilities that are located in Special Flood Hazard Areas, provided that all of
the following conditions are met.
      (1)   The use serves a critical need in the community;
      (2)   No feasible location exists for the use outside the Special Flood
Hazard Area;
      (3)   The reference level of any structure is elevated or floodproofed to
at least the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (4)   The use complies with all other applicable federal, state and local
laws.

and electric outlets/switches.
      (1)   Replacements that are part of a substantial improvement,
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and
other service equipment shall also meet the above provisions.
      (2)   Replacements that are for maintenance and not part of a substantial
improvement, may be installed at the original location, provided the addition
and/or improvements only comply with the standards for new construction
consistent with the code and requirements for the original structure.
   (E)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   (F)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems, and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (H)   Nothing in this article shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this
article, and located totally or partially within the floodway, non-encroachment
area, or stream setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the
regulatory flood protection elevation in the floodway, non-encroachment area,
or stream setback, and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or
replacement meets all of the other requirements of this article.
   (I)   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in division
16.6.5(J). A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an
allowed use, or to the operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater
treatment facility, may be located in a Special Flood Hazard Area only if the
structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least the regulatory
flood protection elevation, and certified in accordance with the provisions of
division
16.6.2(C).
   (J)   All subdivision and other development proposals shall be consistent
with the need to minimize flood damage.
   (K)   All subdivision and other development proposals shall have public

   (L)   All subdivision and other development proposals shall have adequate
drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (M)   All subdivision and other development proposals shall have received
all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which approval is
required by federal or state law, including § 404 of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1344.
   (N)   When a structure is partially located in a Special Flood Hazard Area,
the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
   (O)   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest BFE shall apply.
   16.7.2   Specific standards. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where BFE
data has been provided, as set forth in division
16.5.2 or division
16.7.4, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of division
16.7.1, are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
17.2.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
17.2. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 may be floodproofed to the
regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation, provided that all
areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight,
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with division
16.7.4(B). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of division
16.7.4(B) are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator, as set forth in division
16.6.2(C), along with the operational and maintenance plans.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
17.2.
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by a certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State Regulations for Manufactured Homes adopted by the
Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15. Additionally, when the
elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above
the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or
engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in
height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division
16.7.2(D).
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. A fully enclosed area, of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor:
      (1)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Shall not be temperature-controlled or conditioned;
      (3)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      (4)   Shall include, in Zones A and AE, flood openings to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified
by a professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the following
minimum design criteria:
         (i)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (ii)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (iii)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (iv)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         (v)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (vi)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures, when the
addition and/or improvements, in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure, are:
         (i)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages; or
         (ii)   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall structurally modified
more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the addition
must comply with the standards for new construction.
      (2)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement, with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures, when the
addition and/or improvements, in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure, are:
         (i)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and requirements for the original structure; or
         (ii)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one-year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started, must comply with
the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the one-
year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this article.
Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period, for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement
does not, however, include either:
         (i)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the Building
Official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;
or
         (ii)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Temporary placement.
         (i)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (ii)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A recreational
vehicle is READY FOR HIGHWAY USE if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect-type utilities, and has no
permanently attached additions.)
      (2)   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction.
   (G)   Temporary nonresidential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood, or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the Special Flood Hazard Area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   (H)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, and the like) are to be placed within a Special Flood Hazard Area, the
following criteria shall be met:
      (1)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas);
      (2)   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
      (3)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
      (4)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
      (5)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
the provisions of division
16.7.1(A);
      (6)   All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of division
16.7.1(D); and
      (7)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in
conformance with the provisions of division
16.7.2(D)(4).
      An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet, or
that is a minimal investment of $3,000 or less, and satisfies the criteria
outlined above, is not required to meet the elevation or floodproofing
standards of division
16.7
.2(B). Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other
accessory structures in accordance with division
16.6.2(C).
   (I)   Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within a
Special Flood Hazard Area, the following criteria shall be met.
      (1)   Underground tanks. Underground tanks in flood hazard areas shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads during conditions of the design flood,
including the effects of buoyancy, assuming the tank is empty.
      (2)   Aboveground tanks, elevated. Aboveground tanks in flood hazard
areas shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation
on a supporting structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement during conditions of the design flood. Tank-supporting
structures shall meet the foundation requirements of the applicable flood
hazard area.
      (3)   Aboveground tanks, not elevated. Aboveground tanks that do not meet
the elevation requirements of division
16.7
.2(B) of this article shall be permitted in flood hazard areas, provided the
tanks are designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist all flood-
related and other loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions
of the design flood, and without release of contents in the floodwaters or
infiltration by floodwaters into the tanks. Tanks shall be designed,
constructed, installed, and anchored to resist the potential buoyant and other
flood forces acting on an empty tank during design flood conditions.
      (4)   Tank inlets and vents. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and
vents shall be:
         (i)   At or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, or fitted
with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the
contents of the tanks during conditions of the design flood; and
         (ii)   Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during
conditions of the design flood.
   (J)   Other development.
      (1)   Fences in regulated floodways and NEAs. Fences in regulated
floodways and NEAs that have the potential to block the passage of floodwaters,
such as stockade fences and wire mesh fences, shall meet the limitations of
division
16.7
.6 of this article.
      (2)   Retaining walls, sidewalks and driveways in regulated floodways and
NEAs. Retaining walls and sidewalks and driveways that involve the placement of
fill in regulated floodways shall meet the limitations of division
16.7
.6 of this article.
      (3)   Roads and watercourse crossings in regulated floodways and NEAs.
Roads and watercourse crossings, including roads, bridges, culverts, low-water
crossings and similar means for vehicles or pedestrians to travel from one side
of a watercourse to the other side, that encroach into regulated floodways
shall meet the limitations of division
16.7
.6 of this article.
   16.7.3   Reserved.
   16.7.4   Standards for floodplains without established base flood
elevations. Within the Special Flood Hazard Areas designated as Approximate
Zone A and established in division
16.5.2, where no BFE data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions,
in addition to the provisions of division
16.7
.1, shall apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20
feet each side from top of bank, or five times the width of the stream,
whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered professional engineer is provided, demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined, based on the following criteria.
      (1)   When BFE data is available from other sources, all new construction
and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all
applicable provisions of this article and shall be elevated or floodproofed in
accordance with standards in divisions
16.7.1 and
16.7.2.
      (2)   When floodway or non-encroachment data is available from a federal,
state, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements
within floodway and non-encroachment areas shall also comply with the
requirements of divisions
16.7.2 and
16.7.6.
      (3)   All subdivision, manufactured home park, and other development
proposals shall provide BFE data if the development is greater than five acres
or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such BFE data shall be
adopted by reference in accordance with division
16.5.2 and utilized in implementing this article.
      (4)   When BFE data is not available from a federal, state, or other
source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated or floodproofed
(nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as
defined in §
17.2. All other applicable provisions of division
16.7.2 shall also apply.
   16.7.5   Standards for riverine floodplains with base flood elevations, but
without established floodways or non-encroachment areas. Along rivers and
streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source,
but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are identified for a Special
Flood Hazard Area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements
shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   Standards of divisions
16.7.1 and
16.7.2; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided, demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.
   16.7.6   Floodways and non-encroachment areas. Areas designated as floodways
or non-encroachment areas are located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas
established in division
16.5.2. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris
and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards
outlined in divisions
16.7.1 and
16.7.2, shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
      (1)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result
in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain
Administrator prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit; or
      (2)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by
FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of
the proposed encroachment.
   (B)   If division
16.7.6(A) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of this article.
   (C)   Manufactured homes may be permitted, provided the following provisions
are met:
      (1)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of division
16.7.2(C); and
      (2)   The no encroachment standard of division

   FLOOD-PRONE AREA. See FLOODPLAIN.
   FLOOD-RESISTANT MATERIAL. Any building product (material, component or
system) capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours)
with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost
cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to
alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not
flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers
are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict
evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally
unstable, are not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively
after submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to Technical Bulletin
2, “Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements”, available from the FEMA.
Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable FLOOD-RESISTANT
MATERIALS.
   FLOODPLAIN. Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any
source.

preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This ordinance and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power. This term
describes federal, state, or local regulations, in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures that reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse, including the area

   FLOODWAY ENCROACHMENT ANALYSIS. An engineering analysis of the impact that a
proposed encroachment into a floodway or non-encroachment area is expected to
have on the floodway boundaries and flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge. The evaluation shall be prepared by a qualified, North
Carolina-licensed engineer, using standard engineering methods and models.
   FREEBOARD. The height added to the BFE to account for the many unknown
factors that could contribute to flood heights greater that the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, blockage of bridge or culvert openings, and the hydrological effect of
urbanization of the watershed. The BFE plus the FREEBOARD establishes the
“regulatory flood protection elevation”.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY. A facility that cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located in close proximity to water, limited to a
docking or port facility necessary for the loading or unloading of cargo or
passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term

surface, prior to construction, immediately next to the proposed walls of the
structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (A)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (B)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic

communities with a “Certified Local Government (CLG) Program”; or
      (D)   Certified as contributing to the historical significance of a
historic district designated by a community with a “Certified Local Government
(CLG) Program”.
   Certified Local Government (CLG) Programs are approved by the U.S.
Department of the Interior in cooperation with the North Carolina Department of
Cultural Resources through the State Historic Preservation Officer as having
met the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended in 1980.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official determination issued by FEMA that
amends or revises an effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance
study. Letters of map change include:
      (A)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An official amendment, by letter,
to an effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA is based on
technical data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being
in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is
not located in a Special Flood Hazard Area.
      (B)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, Special Flood Hazard
Area boundaries and floodway delineations, and other planimetric features.
      (C)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). A determination that
a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is,
therefore, no longer located within the Special Flood Hazard Area. In order to
qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in
accordance with the community’s floodplain management regulations.
      (D)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP
requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of Special Flood
Hazard Areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map or
flood insurance study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built
documentation, a letter of map revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the
effective FIRM.
   LIGHT DUTY TRUCK. Any motor vehicle with a gross vehicular weight rating of
8,500 pounds or less, which has a vehicular curb weight of 6,000 pounds or
less, and a basic vehicle frontal area of 45 square feet or less, as defined in
40 C.F.R. § 86.082-2, and is:

a derivation of such a vehicle; or
      (B)   Designed primarily for transportation of persons and has a capacity
of more than 12 persons; or
      (C)   Available with special features enabling off-street or off-highway
operation and use.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG). The lowest elevation of the ground, sidewalk,
or patio slab immediately next to the building or deck support, after
completion of the building.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than
a basement area is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR, provided that such
an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this ordinance.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built
on a permanent chassis, and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term MANUFACTURED HOME
does not include a “recreational vehicle”.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP REPOSITORY. The location of the official flood hazard data to be applied
for floodplain management. It is a central location in which flood data is
stored and managed. In North Carolina, FEMA has recognized that the application
of digital flood hazard data products carry the same authority as hard copy
products. Therefore, the NCEM’s Floodplain Mapping Program websites house
current and historical flood hazard data. For effective flood hazard data, the
NC FRIS website (http://FRIS.NC.GOV/FRIS) is the MAP REPOSITORY; and for
historical flood hazard data, the FloodNC website (http://FLOOD.NC.GOV/NCFLOOD)
is the MAP REPOSITORY.
   MARKET VALUE. The building value, not including the land value and that of
any accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. MARKET VALUE may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the “start of construction” commenced
on or after the effective date of the initial floodplain management
regulations, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NON-ENCROACHMENT AREA (NEA). The channel of a river or other watercourse,
including the area above a bridge or culvert when applicable, and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot as
designated in the flood insurance study report.
   POST-FIRM. Construction or other development for which the “start of
construction” occurred on or after the effective date of the initial flood
insurance rate map map dated February 15, 1979.
   PRE-FIRM. Construction or other development for which the “start of
construction” occurred before the effective date of the initial flood insurance
rate map dated February 15, 1979.
   PRINCIPALLY ABOVE GROUND. At least 51% of the actual cash value of the
structure is above ground.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND/OR NUISANCE. Anything that is injurious to the safety or
health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of
persons, or that unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE (RV). A vehicle that is:
      (A)   Built on a single chassis;
      (B)   Four hundred square feet or less, when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (C)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck;
      (D)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use;
and
      (E)   Is fully licensed and ready for highway use.
   REFERENCE LEVEL. The top of the lowest floor for structures within Special
Flood Hazard Areas designated as Zones A, AE, AH, AO or A99.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The “base flood elevation” plus the
“freeboard”. In Special Flood Hazard Areas where base flood elevations (BFEs)
have been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus two feet. In Special
Flood Hazard Areas where no BFE has been established, this elevation shall be
at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION. To bring the structure or other development into
compliance with state and community floodplain management regulations, or, if
this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that
impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected
development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the
ordinance, or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing
federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, and the like
   SALVAGE YARD. Any nonresidential property used for the storage, collection,
and/or recycling of any type of equipment, and including, but not limited to,

solid waste, as defined in G.S. § 130A-290(a)(35).
   SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL SITE. As defined in G.S. § 130A-290(a)(36), any place
at which solid wastes are disposed of by incineration, sanitary landfill, or
any other method.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). The land in the floodplain subject to a 1%
or greater chance of being flooded in any given year, as determined by division
16.5.2 of this ordinance.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The ACTUAL START means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. PERMANENT CONSTRUCTION does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units
or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas,
liquid, or liquefied gas storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure during any
one-year period, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-
damaged condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred. See definition of SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any combination of repairs, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
during any one-year period, for which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (A)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the
community code enforcement official, and that are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (B)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure, and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant
to division
16.6.5 of this ordinance.
   TECHNICAL BULLETIN and TECHNICAL FACT SHEET. FEMA publications that provide
guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP, which are
contained in 44 U.S.C. § 60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are intended for
use primarily by state and local officials responsible for interpreting and
enforcing NFIP regulations, and by members of the development community, such
as design professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of
existing bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins do not
create regulations; rather they provide specific guidance for complying with
the minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations.
   It should be noted that TECHNICAL BULLETINS and TECHNICAL FACT SHEETS
provide guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or
community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design
professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more
restrictive state or local regulations apply to the building or site in
question. All applicable standards of the state or local building code must
also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
   TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED. Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in or appliance.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required §§
16.6 and
16.7 is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time as that documentation is
provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION (WSE). The height, in relation to NAVD 1988, of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine
areas.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
