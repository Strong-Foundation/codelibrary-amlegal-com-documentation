the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may
make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances
included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them
into a unified code.
      (2)   For example, the codifier may:
         (a)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate divisions;
         (b)   Change the words “this ordinance” or words of the same meaning
to “this chapter”,
“this subchapter”, “this division” and the like, as the case may be, or to
“sections ____________ to __________” (inserting section numbers to indicate
the sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the code); and
         (c)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the code, but in no case
shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.
(1991 Code, § 1-11)
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, violation of any provision of
this code or any other town ordinance shall subject the offender to the
remedies provided in this section, except where the General Statutes of the
state provide specific civil remedies for violation of provisions of this code
adopted pursuant to such statutes. Such remedies available to the town for
enforcement of this code shall be in addition to the remedies stated in this
section, provided that no criminal penalties shall be applicable unless stated
in this section to be applicable to specific chapters or provisions of this
code.
   (B)   Violations of any provision of the following chapters and sections of
this code shall be a misdemeanor and punishable as provided by G.S. § 14-4:
      (1)   
Chapter 110: Alcohol, §§
110.01 and
110.02; and
      (2)   
Chapter 74, Schedule II, Speed Limits.
   (C)   (1)   Violations of the following provisions of this code shall
subject the offender to a civil penalty upon the issuance of a citation for
such violation, as provided in this section. The civil penalty, if not paid to
the Town Clerk within ten days of the issuance of a citation, may be recovered
by the town in a civil action in the nature of debt. Unless otherwise provided
by a specific provision of this code, such civil penalties shall be in the
amount of $50 for each violation, and each day any single violation continues
shall be a separate violation, except that for violations of parking ordinances
of this code, the civil penalty provisions and procedures therein shall apply.
Penalties not paid within ten days of issuance of citation shall incur a
delinquency charge of $25 to be paid with the original penalty.
      (2)   The provisions of this code which shall subject the offender to a
civil penalty are all chapters and sections of the code except:
         (a)   
Chapter 110: Alcohol, §§
111.01 and
111.02;
         (b)   
Chapter 73, Schedule II, Speed Limits; and
         (c)   
Chapter 153, Appendix A, Zoning Ordinance.
   (D)   In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this
section, any provision of this code or any other town ordinance may be enforced
by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent
jurisdiction. In this case, the General Court of Justice shall have
jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a
defense to the application of the town for equitable relief that there is an
adequate remedy at law.
   (E)   In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this
section, any provision of this code or any other town ordinance that makes
unlawful a condition existing upon, or use made of, real property may be
enforced by injunction and/or order of abatement, and the General Court of
Justice shall have jurisdiction to issue the orders. When a violation of such a
provision occurs, the town may apply to the appropriate division of the General
Court of Justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and/or order of
abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon, or
cease the unlawful use of, the property. The action shall be governed in all
respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules
of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 55 in particular.
   (F)   (1)   In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of
abatement as a part of the judgement in the case.
      (2)   An order of abatement may direct that:
         (a)   Buildings or other structures on the property be closed,
demolished or removed;
         (b)   Fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from
buildings on the property;
         (c)   Grass and weeds be cut;
         (d)   Improvements or repairs be made; or
         (e)   Any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the
property into compliance with this code or other ordinance.
      (3)   If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or
with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the Court, he or she may
be cited for contempt, and the town may execute the order of abatement. The
town shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of
abatement in the nature of a mechanic’s and materialman’s lien. The defendant
may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the
proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be
given with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount
approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard, and the bond shall be
conditioned on the defendant’s full compliance with the terms of the order of
abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of
abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction
therewith.
   (G)   The provisions of this code and any other town ordinances may be
enforced by one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed
by this section, except that any provision, the violation of which incurs a
civil penalty, shall not be enforced by criminal penalties.
   (H)   Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day’s continuing
violation of any provision of this code or any other town ordinance shall be a
separate and distinct offense and multiple occurrences within a single day
shall constitute separate offenses.
   (I)   Any ordinances adopted by the Town Council, the violation of which
shall incur a penalty, shall specify whether the enforcement shall be pursuant
to the civil penalty or criminal penalty provisions of this section.
   (J)   Upon determination of a violation of any section of this code, the
penalty for which is a civil penalty, the town shall cause a warning citation
to be issued to the violator, setting out the nature of the violation, the
section violated, the date of violation, and the order to immediately cease the
violation or, if the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an
order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, stating a
reasonable period in which the violation must be abated. The warning citation
shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty.
   (K)   If the violator fails to respond to a citation within ten days of its
issuance and pay the penalty prescribed therein, the town may institute a civil
action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of the State General
Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty.
   (L)   Unless otherwise provided by a section of the code adopted by Council
subsequent to this ordinance, all penalties except those in division (B) above,
all penalties published herein shall be replaced by the provisions of this
section.
   (M)   All ordinances or portions thereof in conflict herewith are hereby
repealed.

and general welfare of its citizens; efficiency and economy in the process of
development, convenience of traffic, safety from fire and other dangers,
adequate light and air, healthful and convenient distribution of population,

plan, a plan for economic development, a recreation plan, a school plan and a
community facilities plan.
(1991 Code, § 2-48) (Ord. passed 7-5-1966)
§ 30.08 APPOINTMENT AS ZONING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Board is hereby designated as the Zoning Commission for the
town and shall prepare a zoning ordinance to govern the use of buildings and
premises, which ordinance shall be submitted to the Town Council for its
consideration and possible adoption. After the adoption of a zoning ordinance
by the Town Council, no change, alteration or amendment or such ordinance shall
be made until such change, alteration or amendment shall have been submitted to
the Planning Board for its recommendation. A vote of not less than three-fifths
of the entire membership of the Town Council will be required to overrule an
unfavorable recommendation by the Planning Board. Failure of the Planning Board
to act within 40 days after submission shall constitute approval of the
proposed change, alteration or amendment.

vehicles towed by the wrecker service for the Department.
   WRECKER or TOW TRUCK. A truck chassis having:
      (1)   A minimum gross vehicle weight rating (minimum gross vehicle weight

rotation wrecker list.
(Ord. passed 2-2-2010)
§ 32.32 TOWN ROTATION WRECKER POLICY.
   (A)   Upon request or demand, unless impounded or subject to an order not to
do so, the wrecker service shall return personal property stored in, with or
from a vehicle, whether or not the towing, repair or storage fee on the vehicle
has been or will be paid. Personal property, for purposes of this division (A),
includes any goods, purses, wallets, cash, identification, credit and debit
cards, licenses, photographs, checks, deposit slips, bank records and any other
property having any value whatsoever other than items directly related to the
functioning of the vehicle itself.
   (B)   After financial obligations have been agreed upon between the wrecker
service and the owner(s), or appropriate party, of the disabled vehicle(s), the
wrecker service shall tow such vehicle(s) to any destination requested by the
vehicle owner, or other person with apparent authority.
   (C)   Unless the vehicle is being preserved by the Department as evidence,
the wrecker service shall allow insurance adjusters access to and allow
inspection of the vehicle at any time during normal business hours.
   (D)   The placement of a wrecker service on the rotation list does not
guarantee a particular number or quantity of calls, or an equivalent number of
calls to every wrecker service on the rotation wrecker list. If a wrecker
service responds to a call, said wrecker service shall be placed at the bottom
of the rotation list unless the wrecker service, through no fault of its own,
is not used or is not entitled to receive compensation for the call. In that
event, such wrecker service shall be placed back at the top of the rotation
list. Each wrecker service agrees to charge reasonable towing fees and storage
fees commensurate with fees charged to other customers, and on or before July 1
of each year, each service will furnish the Chief of Police with a schedule of
all fees. The Chief of Police has the right to disapprove any fees that in his
or her judgment are excessive based upon the prevailing fees in the community.
The placement of a wrecker service on the rotation list does not entitle any
wrecker service to compensation as a consequence of a failure to call the
wrecker service in accordance with the list or as a consequence of the removal
of the wrecker service from the rotation list.
   (E)   A rotation wrecker service, upon accepting a call for service from the
Department, must use its own wrecker. Wrecker companies shall not refer a call
to another wrecker company or substitute for each other.
   (F)   If a rotation wrecker service moves its business location or has a
change of address, the owner of the wrecker service must notify the Chief of
Police of the new address or location. Notification shall be made in writing no
later than ten days prior to the projected move. The wrecker service shall not
be entitled to receive rotation calls prior to inspection of the new facility.
   (G)   A wrecker service may dispatch either a wrecker or a car carrier
rollback in response to a rotation wrecker call, except where the wrecker
service is advised that a particular type of recovery vehicle is needed due to
existing circumstances.
   (H)   A rotation wrecker service driver or employee shall not respond to a
Department-initiated call for wrecker service with the odor of alcohol on his
or her breath, or while under the influence of alcohol, drugs or any impairing
substance.
   (I)   Storage fees shall not begin to accrue until the next calendar day
following the towing of a vehicle.
   (J)   The operator of a vehicle, if present and not incapacitated, shall
have the right to select a wrecker service of his or her choice; provided,
however, that the requested wrecker service is located within a reasonable
distance of the incident site. Town Police Department personnel at the scene
shall determine the reasonableness of the distance from the incident site, and
its decision shall be final. If the operator of a vehicle to be towed is not
present, is incapacitated, or has no preference for a specific wrecker service,
Department personnel shall determine the wrecker service per the wrecker
rotation list. When emergency circumstances prevail, the Department officer may
request wrecker services from the entity service closest to the scene. A
Department officer may also request wrecker services from an entity operating
large cranes or other heavy recovery equipment when the same is necessary to
remove traffic obstacles such as large trucks or heavy equipment. The
determination regarding whether an emergency exists, or whether a specialized
recovery service is required, shall be in the sole discretion of the Department
on-duty supervisor.
   (K)   In no event shall any officer, in the performance of his or her
duties, recommend any wrecker service, motor club or automobile membership
service to the owner or driver of a wrecked or disabled vehicle; nor shall any
officer, in the performance of his or her duties, recommend the services of a
particular wrecker service, motor club or automobile membership service.
Officers shall, whenever possible and practicable, dispatch the wrecker service
requested by the motorist requiring such services.
   (L)   An officer who notices a violation of the provisions of this policy
shall notify the Chief of Police in writing as soon as practicable. The Chief
shall notify, in writing, said wrecker service about the violation(s) and of
any planned corrective actions. A wrecker service that is dissatisfied with the
rotation system, or with the requirements of this policy, shall file a written
statement to the Chief of Police. If the Chief cannot satisfy such complaint, a
statement shall be filed with the Town Manager whose decisions will be final.
   (M)   By submitting an application and accepting placement on the rotation

The customer, at his or her own expense, shall install, operate and maintain
the approved backflow prevention device as directed by the town. Each backflow
device shall be tested upon installation and annually as required by public
water supply regulations. The customer’s responsibility starts at the point of
delivery from the town’s potable water system and includes the user’s entire
water system. The town reserves the right to refuse or discontinue service
unless the customer’s lines or piping are installed in such a manner as to
prevent cross-connection or backflow. There is no “grandfather clause” or any
exception to the requirements for backflow prevention. (See § 51.032.)

is not sufficient to cover the service charges and fees, the town shall proceed
to collect the balance in the usual way provided by law for the collection of
debts. This may, at the discretion of the town, include the use of a collection
agency. Service shall be restored only by payment of the balance, if any, of
the outstanding service charges and fees, and when a new deposit is made on the
basis of the deposit schedules above. A service fee shall be charged as adopted
by the Town Council for each meter reconnected during normal working hours, as

all water bills incurred at this location.
   (M)   A property owner may, upon request, be entitled to a refund of his or
her water deposit following 12 months of good payment history with the town. To

next billing period. The meter reading period shall begin on the fifteenth of
each month or the next working day thereafter.
   (B)   It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that water meters shall
not be obstructed by parked vehicles, piles of soil or trash, vegetation or any
other obstacle. In the event the town is required to send personnel to read the
meter a second or subsequent time because the meter was obstructed and
unavailable to be read, the customer shall pay a fee as set out in the town’s
fee schedule, as maintained in the customer service office, per attempted

initial hookup on newly constructed extensions of the water and sewer system;
unless otherwise approved in advance in writing by the Town Manager.
   (E)   Readings from separate meters will not be combined for billing,
irrespective of the fact that such meters may be for the same or different
premises, or for the same or different users, or for the same or different
services. This includes any and all sewer charges based on the different meter
readings. Compound meters are not considered separate meters.

fourths-inch meter. Sewer charges are based on 100% of the water usage and
included in this monthly billing.
   (B)   Failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent such bills from
becoming delinquent or relieve the customer from payment.

§ 51.009 CONSUMER SERVICE LINE LEAKS AND ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Adjustments may be made to bills only under the following conditions:
      (1)   On a concealed leak in the customer’s piping, an adjustment may be
made upon receipt of a statement from a licensed plumber that the leak has been
repaired;
      (2)   On a concealed leak in the customer’s piping, an adjustment may be
made upon receipt of a signed statement from the property owner or his or her
legal representative that the repair has been made and meets or exceeds the
plumbing codes of the town;
      (3)   Upon inspection by Utilities Department personnel that find the
problem corrected; and
      (4)   Under other circumstances, such as theft of services, where the
evidence indicates to the Town Manager that an adjustment is the appropriate
answer to the situation.
   (B)   When Utility Department personnel discover that a leak exists, and the
owner is notified of the same, the owner shall take immediate steps within
seven days to correct the situation. Undue delay by the owner shall cause
forfeiture of the benefits of adjustments. If the leak is of a severity as to
possibly cause property damage or to endanger the water system, the Utility
Department will immediately turn off the water without further notice.
   (C)   The Town Manager shall have the authority to grant an adjustment on
concealed water leaks to the customer’s annual average monthly water usage
along with an adjustment up to 100% of the excessive sewer usage unless the
concealed usage entered the sewer system
   (D)   If a water and/or sewer user believes a bill to be in error, the user
shall present a claim, in person or in writing, at the Customer Service
Department office before the bill becomes delinquent. Such claims, if made
after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective to prevent
discontinuance of service as provided in this section. The user may pay such
bill under protest and payment under protest shall not prejudice his or her
claim. The Town Manager may authorize corrections for billing errors.
   (E)   Customers who pay a sewer bill may be granted an adjustment to their
sewer bills for filling their pool. Customers must present in writing to the
Customer Service Department a request to have their sewer bill adjusted for
filling their pool. The customer should make every attempt to read his or her
meter prior to and after filling their pool. The customer may also request the
meter technician read his or her meter. If the customer fills their pool
without meter readings he or she must present the dimensions of the pool so
that an accurate adjustment to sewer may be calculated
   (F)   In extreme cases of personal hardship verified by the Town Manager, a
delay of up to 120 days of the payment date of the water bill may be granted.
Such a delay may be granted no more than one time per year and may be granted
only by the Town Manager. All other bills during that period of time shall be

§ 51.013 CONNECTION TO WATER AND SEWER SYSTEM REQUIRED.
   (A)   (1)   The owners of all developed property within Newport having
situated on the property one or more residential units or commercial
establishments located within a reasonable distance of any available town water
lines or town sewer collection lines into which residential units or commercial
establishments the owners have, or have had or have permitted facilities
necessary for potable water and/or suitable toilet and other facilities
necessary for the discharge of domestic or industrial wastes (“developed
property”) shall at their own expense connect such facilities directly to the
proper town water line or town public sewer or both in accordance with the
requirements of the town.
      (2)   When town water or sewer lines or both are newly constructed, all
developed property shall be connected as provided in the division (A)(1) above
within 12 months of the date when the lines are activated. No new wells or nor
new septic tanks or other private sewer systems shall be allowed for discharge
of domestic or industrial waster within a reasonable distance of the sewer
lines.
      (3)   Any developed property not now connected to town water and/or sewer
lines and having a properly functioning potable water and septic tank or other
legal private waste disposal system not constructed under the provisions of
division (L) below may continue to opt out of connecting to town water and/or
sewer lines, but if such lines are within a reasonable distance of town water
and/or sewer lines will pay an availability fee equal to the minimum water or
sewer or both (depending on what the owner opts not to connect to) fee for
service to a like property. For those properties paying an availability fee for
sewer, no septic tank maintenance fee will be payable. The town will stop
providing septic tank or private waste disposal systems to all such properties.
   (B)   Where a public water line is not available under the provisions of
division (A) above, such toilet and other facilities requiring potable water
shall be connected to a well or a private water system complying with the
requirements of the appropriate state and/or local regulatory agency. At such
time as a town public water line becomes available to a property served by a
well or a private water system, a direct connection shall be made to the town
public water line in compliance with this subchapter. There shall be no
physical connection (cross-connection) between any privately-owned water source
and the town system. The owner shall operate and maintain any well or private
water facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the town.
No statement contained in this section shall be construed to interfere with any
additional requirements that may be imposed by any state or federal agencies.
   (C)   (1)   All persons wishing to connect with the public sewer system must
file a written application with the customer service department in accordance
with §
51.002.
      (2)   The Clerk shall issue such permit to any duly licensed plumber
after application is filed, which permit must state the location of the wye to
which connection is to be made. After the connection is made, the ditch must be
left open until final inspection is made by the Town Plumbing Inspector who
shall report on the back of the permit the result of his or her inspection.
Such permit must be returned to the Clerk by the Inspector to be filed in the
town records.
   (D)   Every application for a sewer connection shall state the name of the
owner of the lot; the name of the street on which such lot is situated; the 911
address number of the house or lot; the number and kind of connections desired;
and the character of the surface of the abutting street. Every such application
shall be signed by the person making the application, shall be accompanied by
the proper fee for making the connections applied for and shall be filed with
the Plumbing Inspector.
   (E)   In general, where possible, sewer connections shall be made into
manholes. Every sewer connection made directly to a main shall be made at the
wye provided for the lot to be served; if no such wye has been provided for
such lot, the connection may be made directly to the main at any convenient
point.
   (F)   All tap fees for connections to main sewer lines shall be in the
amounts provided in accordance with the Utility Department fee schedule.
   (G)   It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge to any outlet other

industrial wastes except where suitable treatment has been provided in
accordance with this subchapter and state and federal laws.
   (H)   Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of
division (A) above, such toilet and other facilities necessary for the
discharge of domestic and industrial wastes shall be connected to a private
disposal system complying with the requirements of the appropriate state and/or
local regulatory agency. Before commencement of construction of a private
wastewater disposal system, the owner shall first obtain a written permit from
the appropriate regulatory authority and furnish a copy thereof to the Building
Inspector. The copy of the permit shall be accompanied by such supplementary
data as deemed necessary by the Building Inspector to maintain an accurate file
of such private wastewater disposal systems to facilitate the planning of
future public sewer service. The type, capacity, location and layout of a
private wastewater disposal system shall comply with all requirements of the
County Environmental Health Department, North Carolina Division of Water
Quality, or other such board or authority. The town may require a sewer service
line to be installed to the right-of-way for future use. The Utilities Director
shall determine the size and placement of this future service line after
consulting with the Building Inspector.
   (I)   For any property not connected to, and not required to be connected to
public were lines, the town shall charge a septic system maintenance fee to the
utility account holder as set forth in the Utility Department Fee Schedule. The
Utility Department shall then be responsible for routine pumping, maintenance
and repairs to the septic system. This does not relieve the owner of
responsibility to care for the system by following the rules of the County
Health Department or other responsible agency for vegetation control, parking
restrictions, repair area and the like.
   (J)   At such time as a town public sewer becomes available within a
reasonable distance to a property served by a private wastewater disposal
system, a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer in compliance
with this subchapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools and similar private
wastewater disposal facilities shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with
suitable material at the owner’s expense.
   (K)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed to interfere
with any additional requirements that may be imposed by any state or federal
agencies.
   (L)   The Town Council may, on a case-by-case basis, permit new construction
with septic tanks provided with provisions to be connected to the town sewer
system via gravity or a pumping system when such sewer service becomes
available. Such sewer pumps shall be the property of and maintained by the
property owner.
   (M)   The town shall charge a septic tank maintenance fee to cover the cost
of the town maintaining the septic tanks and drain fields permitted in division
(K) above such that the owners have equivalent service to other customers on
the sewer system. The Utility Department shall operate and maintain the septic
systems as required by County Environmental Health or other similar agencies
that have proper jurisdiction.

§ 51.014 WATER CONSERVATION INCENTIVE.
   Whereas, it is desirable to encourage residents of the town to conserve
water and reduce impacts to water supply sources and wastewater collection
systems; and whereas, the town recognizes that water is not an inexhaustible
resource; now, therefore, the following conservation incentive is adopted.
   (A)   The town will allow a one-time reduction of $15 of the town utility
bill for any business or home that demonstrates the installation of a low-flow
toilet, low-flow shower head or low-flow faucet.
   (B)   To qualify for the $15 reduction of the town utility bill, the home or
business owner shall provide proof of installation to the Customer Service
Coordinator. Proof of installation shall be in the form of a signed letter from
a licensed plumber or contractor who completed the installation. If the owner
installs the equipment himself or herself, the Building Inspector, Public
Utilities Director or his or her designee may visit the site and verify the
installation. The homeowner shall provide copies of receipts showing purchase
date, price and place purchased. Information regarding the brand and model of
the fixtures installed shall also be provided. The town shall have the
authority to enter the premises and verify that the low-flow device has been
installed. The town will verify installation of low-flow devices as it deems
necessary.
   (C)   The $15 reduction of the town utility bill shall be a one-time offer.
The $15 reduction of the town utility bill is a maximum reduction and will be
applied once regardless of the number of low-flow devices installed. The credit
will be applied to the bill after evidence satisfactory to the town to show
proof of installation has been provided to the town.

      (2)   The Public Utilities Director may thereupon, without further
notice, cause the water and/or sewer service from the municipal system to be
discontinued for such person.
      (3)   In any case where water and/or sewer service is discontinued by the
town for enforcement purposes, the restoration of such service shall be
conditioned on full compliance by such person and payment of any expense
incurred in the enforcement proceeding and in the restoration of service.
      (4)   The town may, at its discretion, continue or restore service in a
case of failure of compliance on condition that such person furnish a bond or
other security, with terms as specified by the town, and to hold harmless the
town from any loss or expense that it may incur as a result of such
noncompliance or any future noncompliance.
   (C)   In any case where the Public Utilities Director determines that the
health or safety of the public is threatened by the actions of a consumer,
water and/or sewer service shall be immediately terminated to that consumer.
The Public Utilities Director shall then notify the consumer in person along
with written notification by the Utilities Director or by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or by hand delivery by a Town Police Department
officer, of the reason for the termination of service, and the corrective
measures necessary prior to the resumption of service. In no case shall the
town or its representatives be held liable for any damages resulting from such
a termination of service.
   (D)   In any case involving a person who fails to comply with any of these
regulations, but who is not receiving water and/or sewer service from the
municipal system, the Public Utilities Director shall give notice to such
person by certified mail, return receipt requested, stating the specifics of
the failure of compliance and requiring that the person promptly remedy the
failure. At the same time, the Public Utilities Director, in consultation with

Council, and to such other government agencies as may have jurisdiction and
power to take appropriate enforcement action.
   (E)   The town reserves the right to terminate water and/or sewer service
without notice for the following reasons:
      (1)   To prevent fraud or abuse;
      (2)   Consumer’s failure to pay bills and fees as required by this
regulation;

      (4)   Insufficiency of supply or capacity due to circumstances beyond the
town’s control;
      (5)   Legal processes;
      (6)   Direction of higher public authorities;
      (7)   Strike, riot, fire, flood, storm, accident or other unavoidable
cause;
      (8)   Discovery of a cross-connection between a private or non-potable
source and the town water system; and
      (9)   Consumer’s willful disregard of town’s rules.
   (F)   If any person(s) alters, tampers with or bypasses the town’s water
service or meter(s) in a manner that causes such meter(s) to inaccurately
measure and register the water consumed or which would cause the water to be
diverted from the recording apparatus of the meter(s), or who tampers with any
water service which has been disconnected by the Water Department for any
reason, then said meter(s) shall be immediately removed and water service to
said property or premises shall be halted. Service to said property or premises
shall not be reinstated until a required administrative fee as stated in the
town’s fee schedule has been paid in addition to any damages done to said meter
(s). Nothing in this division (F) shall be construed to prevent the town from
pursuing criminal or civil actions against any person(s) who alters, tampers
with or attempts to bypass a water meter in accordance with the provisions of
G.S. § 14-151.1.
   (G)   In cases of wanton and willful damage to either the water or sewer

municipal system. When required, the property owners shall grant to the town
such utility easements as it may require. In addition, a deed to the town for
water and/or sewer facilities installed, which are located outside the
corporate limits, the cost of which is borne by individual property owners,
shall be executed prior to the time any extension provided for in this section
is connected to the municipal system. No certificates of occupancy or water

right-of-way. The Public Utilities Director shall work with the design engineer
to locate the water and sewer services at an agreeable location to be
determined for each lot in the project. Water and sewer services shall be
terminated as described in the following subchapter on water and sewer.
   (I)   The following exceptions are authorized. Nothing in this section shall
prevent the Town Council from extending water and/or sewer mains within the
corporate limits on its own motion, without receipt of an application from
property owners, and assessing the cost of such extensions in accordance with
division (L) below, when, in the opinion of the Town Council, the general
public interest demands such extension of service.
   (J)   When application is received for a proposed new project and approved
by the town, then the developer or owner shall install the extensions or have
them installed by a licensed utility contractor under the supervision and
inspection of the project engineer and in accordance with approved plans. The

require the project engineer to provide full time resident inspection of the
project.
   (K)   If an extension application is approved by the Town Council, the owner
shall be required to pay 100% of the total cost of all extensions including the
cost of engineering, resident inspection and inspection provided by the town;
provided the town may participate to the extent agreed upon by the Town Council
in the cost of larger size mains that are in excess of the size mains required
to serve the project. No reimbursement shall be made upon annexation and all
extensions connected to the town system and located inside or outside the
corporate limits shall become the property of the town at the time such
facilities are connected and accepted.
   (L)   In the case of extensions to existing developed areas, when the
approved extensions have been completed and the total cost has been determined,
a percentage of the total cost shall be assessed against the property owners
whose property is served by the extension at an equal rate per front foot in
accordance with and under the authority of G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 10, as amended.
   (M)   Any property owner shall have the opportunity to pay his or her
proportionate share of the cost assessed in accordance with division (L) above
in full or in equal annual installments with interest as required by statute.

water and/or sewer extensions approved by the town, the owner or developer
shall deposit with the town funds in an amount equal to 100% of the total
estimated cost of such extensions. Such funds shall be in the form of a bond,
cash or other securities deemed acceptable by the Town Manager and Finance
Officer. In the event of a default or any other failure of the developer to
complete the project to the requirements and specifications of the town, the
town shall use this deposit to cover the costs of completing or abandoning the
project as necessary to meet town standards and specifications, or any other
applicable state and/or federal regulations.
   (O)   If the application for extension of water and/or sewer is approved by
the town and state regulatory agencies, the developer shall install the system
in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.
   (P)   The developers, subdividers, owners and the like shall provide
easements in such form as the town may require for mains, service lines,
manholes and appurtenances and for installation and maintenance thereof. Such
easements shall be furnished prior to any service being provided.
   (Q)   At the time of submission of plans for the systems the owners shall
ask that the property to be served and all improvements thereon be annexed to
the town at such times as the town finds this lawful and practical. Such
request for annexation shall remain open indefinitely, shall bind the heirs,
successors, grantees and assigns of the owner, developer, subdivider and the
like, and may be accepted by the town at any time unless the area involved
becomes annexed to some other municipality. The request for annexation may be
withdrawn if the town does not provide water and/or sewer services, as
requested by the developer, owner, subdivider and the like, but not if such
action is caused by failure to pay for services rendered or for damages done to
the system or systems by the willful or negligent acts of the developers,
subdividers, owners and the like, or their heirs, successors, grantees or
assigns of the agents, servants, employees, invitees or licensees or any of
them.
   (R)   Any water and/or sewer mains extended under the provisions of this
policy shall be installed and constructed in accordance with the approved
plans, specifications and other requirements of the town. All facilities
installed under the provisions of this policy shall become the sole property of
the town and under its jurisdiction and control for any and all purposes
whatsoever at the time such facilities are accepted. The cost borne by
individual property owners shall be executed prior to the time any extensions
are provided and connected to the town system.
   (S)   The Town Council may in its discretion, as a condition under which
water and/or sewer service will be extended, require the owner(s) of a proposed
subdivision to enter into an agreement to improve the proposed street therein
at his, her or their own expense and in accordance with the ordinances then in
force governing the acceptance of public streets within the town.

   (A)   Industrial wastewater charges or “surcharges” shall be applied to
industrial users, defined as follows.
      (1)   (a)   INDUSTRIAL USER means any nongovernmental, nonresidential
user of the city sewerage system that discharges more than the equivalent of
25,000 gallons per day (GPD) of sanitary wastewater and is identified in the
Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, Office of Management and
Budget, as amended and supplemented under one of the following divisions:
            1.   Division A, Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing;
            2.   Division B, Mining;
            3.   Division D, Manufacturing;
            4.   Division E, Transportation, Communications, Electric, Gas and
Sanitary Services; and
            5.   Division I, Services.
         (b)   In determining the amount of a user’s discharge for purposes of
classification, domestic wastewater discharges exceeding 25,000 GPD or the
weight of biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids (SS) equivalent to that
weight found in 25,000 GPD of sanitary wastes are considered industrial users.
Sanitary wastes, for purposes of this calculation of equivalency, are the
wastes discharged from residential users.
      (2)   INDUSTRIAL USER shall mean any other industrial, commercial or
institutional user of the sanitary sewerage system that discharges wastewater
to the treatment works which contain toxic pollutants, poisonous solids,
liquids or gases in sufficient quantity either singly or by interaction with
other wastes, to contaminate the sludge at the treatment works, or to injure or
to interfere with any sewage treatment process, or which constitutes a hazard
to humans or animals, creates a public nuisance, or creates any hazard in or
has an adverse effect on the waters receiving any discharge from the treatment
works.
      (3)   Industrial user shall also mean any person discharging wastewater
with concentrations in excess of 350 mg/l for BOD or suspended solids or 50 mg/
l for Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN, as defined in Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater, latest edition).
   (B)   The industrial wastewater charges shall be established not less than
one time per year and at the same time domestic user charges are established.
Industrial wastewater charges shall be based on the actual costs for providing
sewer services during the preceding fiscal year. The charges so computed along
with projected increases in costs shall be the basis for estimating the monthly
billings to each such customer for the following fiscal year. The actual costs
shall be determined as soon after the end of each fiscal year as possible and
until such time the charges for the current year shall be based on either the
rates for the year or on estimated rates for the current year.
   (C)   The costs included in the computation of actual charges for the
preceding fiscal year, or of estimated charges for an ensuing fiscal year,
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Operation and maintenance expenses;
      (2)   Insurance, debt service and other fixed costs; and
      (3)   Laboratory and other testing and monitoring costs.
   (D)   Industrial wastewater surcharges, in addition to the normal charges
charged for domestic wastewater as established in §
51.057, shall be established for each of the following parameters:
      (1)   BOD, per pound;
      (2)   Suspended solids, per pound; and
      (3)   Other parameters as applicable; per pound.
   (E)   The surcharges shall be as set out in the town’s fee schedule. In
addition, laboratory costs, monitoring costs and special costs shall be
annualized and added to the monthly surcharge.
   (F)   Industrial wastewater surcharges shall become effective on the first
regular meter reading date for each user after such user is connected to the
city system, and after written notice from the city of classification as an
industrial user. Interim monthly charges based on domestic user charges shall
be invoiced and collected during the period equitable industrial rates are
being developed.
   (G)   The Town Council may establish classes of industrial users and assign
representative strengths of wastewater to each. Such class wastewater
characteristics may recognize analyses of representative users of each class
based on typical data from other sources. To the extent practical, actual data
for each industrial user’s wastewater shall be used. Industrial users assigned
standard strength parameters may request sample analyses of wastewater. Upon
determination of the characteristics on samples representative of the
wastewater on not less than three working days, such characteristics shall be
used in determining the charges until the wastewater may again be sampled.
   (H)   The Town Council may consolidate the component charges of the
industrial wastewater charges into a single volume charge that includes the
characteristic charges computed for a unit volume of 1,000 gallons. Such a
weighted volume charge may be applicable to a class of users or to each user
where his or her actual wastewater characteristics are known.
   (I)   Industrial users exhibiting marked, seasonal load variations shall pay
charges that recognize the dedication or reservation of capacity for the
treatment of their seasonal peak operating loads, and any unusual operation and
maintenance costs directly related to such seasonal loads. This provision shall
apply only to those industrial users whose peaks loads exceed 10% of any
capacity parameter and are at least twice its off-season loads.

§ 51.060 PRETREATMENT.
   (A)   Any person who is prohibited from discharging any substance as
specified in this chapter shall have the sole responsibility to devise, at his
or her own expense, the methods for eliminating the problem so as to make any
waste discharge eligible for a permit or for compliance with this chapter.
   (B)   Each user shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this section and shall achieve compliance with all federal
categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by
the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the town shall be constructed, operated,
and maintained in good working order at the user’s expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the town for review, and shall be acceptable to the town before construction
of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as
necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the town under the provisions of
this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the wastewater pretreatment facilities
or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the town prior
to the user’s initiation of the changes. All records relating to compliance
with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency or the state upon request. The town reserves
the right to have these plans reviewed by the town’s engineer or other
consultant in order to determine the overall effect on the municipal wastewater
system. This review shall be at the expense of the industrial customer.

or process operations is substantially the same as the volume secured from the
town waterworks system, then the volume of water purchased shall be considered
to be the volume of waste discharged.
      (2)   If, on the premises of any person discharging industrial waste into
the sanitary sewerage system, a substantial portion of the water secured from
the town waterworks system is not used for industrial purposes, or is not
returned to the sanitary sewerage system, the quantity of industrial waste
shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   By a meter (or meters) on the water supply line (or lines) to
his or her industrial and/or process operations;
         (b)   By a meter (or meters) on the waste line (or waste lines) from
his or her industrial and/or process operations; and
         (c)   If meters as required under divisions (A)(2)(a) and (A)(2)(b)
above have not been installed, by an estimate made by the Public Utilities
Director of the proportion of the water purchased which is used for industrial
purposes and returned to the sanitary sewerage system.
   (B)   If any person discharging or proposing to discharge industrial waste
into the sanitary sewerage system does not secure his or her entire water
supply requirements from the town waterworks system such person shall install
and maintain a meter (or meters) on the waste line (or waste lines) from his or
her industrial and/or process operations, or shall install such additional
meters on the private water supply as required to permit a determination of the
total quantity discharged to the sewers from both sources under procedures
comparable to divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) above.

available such person shall construct and maintain an accessible and safe
control manhole on the waste line or lines for such purposes.
   (B)   Any person proposing to discharge industrial waste in quantities
greater than 25,000 gallons per day (GPD), or with strengths equivalent to
25,000 gallons per day (GPD) of domestic wastewater, shall provide a control
manhole in accordance with the requirements of the town.
   (C)   The Public Utilities Director shall determine if an automatic sampling
station is required. If it is required, it shall be constructed in such a
manner so as to be easily accessed by the town at any time. The sampler shall
operate in a flow proportional mode. The sampling station shall be located at a
mutually agreeable point between representatives of the industry and the Public
Utilities Director. The operation and maintenance of the sampling station shall
be the responsibility of the industry. Samples shall be split with the industry
upon request.

§ 51.064 DETERMINATION OF CHARACTER AND STRENGTH OF WASTES.
   (A)   The industrial waste and/or other pollutants being discharged by any
person into the sanitary sewerage system shall be subject to periodic
inspection. A determination of character and strength of such wastes may be
made annually, or more often as may be deemed necessary by the Public Utilities
Director.
   (B)   Samples shall be collected manually or mechanically over such period
of time and composited in such a manner as to be representative of the wastes
being discharged. In general, this means that automatic samplers shall operate
in the flow proportional mode. The laboratory methods followed in the
examination of such wastes shall be those set forth in the latest edition of
Standard Methods or equivalent publication as specified by the appropriate
regulatory agency.
   (C)   The determination of the character, strength or quantity of the wastes
as made by the Town Manager or his or her authorized assistants shall be
binding as a basis for computation of fees, charges or for actions by the Town
Council. When requested by the person discharging wastes, the samples may be
split to permit analysis by the discharger, or a qualified independent
laboratory, for the discharger’s information. The person discharging wastes may
request additional sampling and analyses which will be performed, as soon as
practical, with all costs, as determined by the town, being borne by the
discharger.

the exception of the application fee. The Town Manager will assess any costs
already incurred by the town and coordinate with the affected department heads
to ascertain the amount of refund.
   (H)   Rules and prohibitions.
      (1)   Adherence to town ordinances and rules. All applicants must adhere
to all town ordinances and posted park/facility rules, with exception of any
items exempted by written permission only. A copy of the park rules and

herein unless waived by the Town Manager. Said deposit is refundable within 30
days of the end of an event provided the facility is left in a satisfactory
post event condition.
         (b)   The event organizer is responsible for making arrangements with
the town for additional trash receptacles. Plastic trash can liners will be
placed in all existing trash cans prior to the event. It is the event
organizer’s responsibility to deposit any trash in appropriate trash
receptacles following the event in order to ensure return of the sanitation
deposit. If the size of the event warrants additional receptacles, the Public
Works Department will review the application, and the organizer will be
contacted. It will be the event organizer’s responsibility to make all
arrangements and pay any fees applicable for any additional equipment or
services.
         (c)   All trash receptacles must be dumped upon completion of the
event into pre-determined receptacles or dumpsters as approved by the town and
prior to the park or other public property or facility opening the next day,
unless arranged in advance with the town. Dumpster locations shall be approved
or determined by the town at time of permit issuance.

four hours duration or more, portable toilets may be required. This requirement
may be met if sufficient town restroom facilities are available on-site. The
Utilities Director or Building Code Official will assist the event organizer in
determining the number of toilets needed, although a ratio of two toilets per
500 attendees can be used as a guide. An appropriate mix of toilets for males
and females must be provided. In compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the event organizer must provide sufficient handicap
accessible portable toilets. It is the event organizer’s responsibility to make
all arrangements (drop-off, pumping during the event and pick-up) and pay any
rental fees. The town will stock supplies for permanent restroom facilities
prior to start of event. The town may choose to close public toilets.
   (I)   Revocation of permit. The town shall have authority to revoke any
permit upon violation of the conditions set forth herein, and/or where staging
of the event would have an immediate and adverse effect on the welfare and
safety of persons or property. The Chief of Police or Fire Official or Fire
Chief or his or her designee shall have authority to close any event
immediately upon violation of conditions set forth herein or to preserve safety
of persons or property.
   (J)   Modification of policies. The Council for the town may waive, modify
and/or amend said policies, partially or in its entirety, at any time solely at
the town’s discretion. This may occur only by formal action of the Town
Council.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT;
STATEMENT OF  PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES
§ 150.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. Ch. 143,
Art. 21, Part 6; G.S. Ch. 153A, Art. 6; Ch. 160A, Art. 8; and Ch. 160D, Art. 7,
9 and 11, delegated to local governmental units the authority to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Therefore, the Town of Newport Town Council does ordain as follows.
(Ord. passed 7-15-2003; Ord. 2019-09, passed 9-12-2019; Ord. 2020-02, passed 6-
11-2020)
§ 150.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Newport
are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life, property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 7-15-2003; Ord. 2019-09, passed 9-12-2019; Ord. 2020-02, passed 6-
11-2020)
§ 150.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters, or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 7-15-2003; Ord. 2019-09, passed 9-12-2019; Ord. 2020-02, passed 6-
11-2020)
§ 150.004 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets and bridges)
that are located in flood-prone areas;
   (F)   Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;
   (G)   Make flood insurance available to the community through the National
Flood Insurance Program;
   (H)   Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;
   (I)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas; and
   (J)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.

includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the
actual repair work performed.
      (2)   The term does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any correction of existing violations of state or community
health, sanitary or safety code specifications that have been identified by the
community code enforcement official, and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure, and the alteration is approved by a variance issued

must provide at least two photographs showing the front and rear of the
building taken within 90 days from the date of certification. The photographs
must be taken with views confirming the building description and diagram number
provided in division (C)(1)(a). To the extent possible, these photographs
should show the entire building including foundation. If the building has
split-level or multi-level areas, provide at least two additional photographs
showing side views of the building. In addition, when applicable, provide a
photograph of the foundation showing a representative example of the flood
openings or vents. All photographs must be in color and measure at least three
inches by three inches. Digital photographs are acceptable.
      (2)   Floodproofing certificate.
         (a)   If non-residential floodproofing is used to meet the regulatory
flood protection elevation requirements, a floodproofing certificate (FEMA Form
086-0-34), with supporting data, an operational plan, and an inspection and
maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start of any new
construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a certification of the floodproofed design elevation
of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to NAVD 1988.
Floodproofing certification must be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a professional engineer or architect, and certified by same. The Floodplain
Administrator must review the certificate data, the operational plan, and the
inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies detected by the review shall be
corrected by the applicant prior to permit approval. Failure to submit the
certification or failure to make required corrections will be cause to deny a
floodplain development permit. Failure to construct in accordance with the
certified design will be cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate of
compliance/occupancy.
         (b)   A final finished construction floodproofing certificate (FEMA
Form 086-0-34), with supporting data, an operational plan, and an inspection
and maintenance plan are required prior to the issuance of a certificate of
compliance/occupancy. It will be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a certification of the floodproofed design elevation
of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to NAVD 1988.
The floodproofing certificate will be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect, and certified by same. The
Floodplain Administrator will review the certificate data, the operational
plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies detected by the
review must be corrected by the applicant prior to the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy. Failure to submit the certification or
failure to make required corrections will be cause to deny a floodplain
development permit. Failure to construct in accordance with the certified
design will be cause to deny a certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      (3)   If a manufactured home is placed within Zones A, AE, AH, AO or A99,
and the elevation of the chassis is more than 36 inches in height above grade,
an engineered foundation certification is required in accordance with the
provisions of §
150.066(C)(2).
      (4)   If a watercourse is to be altered or relocated, a description of
the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation; a professional engineer's
certified report on the effects of the proposed project on the flood-carrying
capacity of the watercourse, and the effects to properties located both
upstream and downstream; and a map showing the location of the proposed
watercourse alteration or relocation, must all be submitted by the permit
applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit.
      (5)   Certification exemptions. The following structures, if located
within Zones A, AE, AH, AO or A99, are exempt from the elevation/floodproofing
certification requirements specified in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above:
         (a)   Recreational vehicles meeting the requirements of §
150.066(F)(1);
         (b)   Temporary structures meeting the requirements of §
150.066(G); and
         (c)   Accessory structures, which have footprints of 150 square feet
or less, or are minimal investments of $5,000 or less, meeting the requirements
of §
150.066(H).
   (D)   Determinations for existing buildings and structures. For applications
for building permits to improve buildings and structures, including
alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy,
additions, rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of
substantial damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and
structures, the Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with the Building
Official, will:
      (1)   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work; in the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
      (2)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
      (3)   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; and
      (4)   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage, and that compliance
with the flood-resistant construction requirements of the North Carolina
Building Code and this chapter is required.

such decision to the court, as provided in G.S. Ch. 7A.
   (C)   Variances may be issued for:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures, upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
      (2)   Functionally dependent facilities, if determined to meet the
definition as stated in §
150.015, provided provisions of §
150.054(I)(2), (3) and (5) have been satisfied, and the facilities are
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood, and
create no additional threats to public safety; or
      (3)   Any other type of development, provided it meets the requirements
of this section.
   (D)   In passing upon variances, the Appeal Board must consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage, and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, as defined
in §
150.015, as a functionally dependent facility, where applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters, and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including the maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (E)   A written report, addressing each of the above factors, will be
submitted with the application for a variance.
   (F)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice, specifying the difference between the BFE and the elevation to which
the structure is to be built, and that such construction below the BFE
increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to
construct a structure below the BFE may result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance, up to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage. The notification
will be maintained with a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance.
   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain the records of all appeal
actions, and report any variances to FEMA and the State of North Carolina upon
request.
   (I)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances will not be issued when the variance will make a
structure in violation of other federal, state or local laws, regulations or
ordinances.
      (2)   Variances will not be issued within any designated floodway or non-
encroachment area, if the variance would result in any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge.
      (3)   Variances will only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)   Variances will only be issued prior to development permit approval.
      (5)   Variances will only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;

§ 150.066 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all special flood hazard areas where BFE data has been provided, as set
forth in §
150.031 or §
150.053, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
150.065, are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) will have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation, as defined in §
150.015.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
must have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
150.015. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation, in lieu of elevation, provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight,
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
will be in accordance with §
150.071(B)(2). A registered, professional engineer or architect must certify
that the floodproofing standards of this division (B) are satisfied. Such
certification must be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in
§
150.051(C), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New or replacement manufactured homes must be elevated so that the
reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
150.015.
      (2)   Manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, either
by a certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes, adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is
above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division (D) below.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. A fully enclosed area of new construction and
substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor or below the
lowest horizontal structural member in VE Zones:
      (1)   Must not be designed or used for human habitation, but must only be
used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion
of the enclosed area must not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms,
except to enclose storage areas;
      (2)   Must be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials at least
to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and
      (3)   Must include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required flood openings will be no higher than
one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         (e)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures, when the
addition and/or improvements, in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure, are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages, and must not be any more
nonconforming than the existing structure; and
         (b)   A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/
improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally
modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the
addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
      (2)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement, with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, will
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures, when the
addition and/or improvements, in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure, are:
         (a)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the
code and the requirements for the original structure; or
         (b)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one-year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started, must comply with
the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the one-
year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that
building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this chapter.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement
does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the Building
Official, and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;

         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A recreational
vehicle is READY FOR HIGHWAY USE if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect-type utilities and has no
permanently attached additions.)
      (2)   Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement must meet all the requirements for new
construction.
   (G)   Temporary nonresidential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood, or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed three months, renewable up to one
year;
      (2)   The name, address and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
      (3)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
      (4)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity
responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      (5)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside

§ 150.069 STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS WITH BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS, BUT
WITHOUT ESTABLISHED FLOODWAYS OR NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available
from another source, but neither floodways nor non-encroachment areas are
identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report,
the following requirements will apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   The standards of §§
150.065 and
150.066; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or
other development, will be permitted, unless certification, with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer, is provided,
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the community.

special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet,
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate.
   (B)   In addition to the standards outlined in §§
150.065 and
150.066, all new construction and substantial improvements must meet the
following requirements:
      (1)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of 12 inches, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   Nonresidential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in division (B)(1) above so that the
structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that
level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water, and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is
required in accordance with §§

shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing
and requiring the owner to repair, alter or improve such dwelling or dwelling
unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this
chapter within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days. The order may
require that the property be vacated and closed if continued occupancy during
the time allowed for repair will present a significant threat of bodily harm,
taking into account the nature of the necessary repairs, alterations, or
improvements; the current state of the property; and any additional risks due
to the presence and capacity of minors under the age of 18 or occupants with
physical or mental disabilities. The order shall state that the failure to make
timely repairs as directed in the order shall make the dwelling subject to the

   (C)   If the Inspector determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, and that
repairs cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the
dwelling, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact to

§ 151.024 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ORDER.
   (A)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or
improve or to vacate and close the dwelling, the Inspector may cause the
dwelling to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed, and
the Inspector may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling so
closed a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human
habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is
prohibited and unlawful." Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a
Class 1 misdemeanor. The duties of the Inspector set forth in this division
shall not be exercised until the Town Council shall have by ordinance ordered
the Inspector to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter with
respect to the particular property or properties that the Inspector shall have
found to be unfit for human habitation and which property or properties shall
be described in the ordinance. This subchapter shall be recorded in the Office
of the Register of Deeds in the county where the property or properties are
located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor
index (see G.S. § 160D-1203(4)).

dwelling, the Inspector may cause such dwelling to be removed or demolished.
The duties of the Inspector set forth in this division shall not be exercised

proceed to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter with respect to the
particular property or properties that the Inspector shall have found to be
unfit for human habitation and which property or properties shall be described
in the ordinance. No such ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a
dwelling until the owner has first been given a reasonable opportunity to bring
it into conformity with the housing code. This subchapter shall be recorded in
the Office of the Register of Deeds in the county where the property or
properties are located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner
in the grantor index.
   (C)   (1)   If the dwelling has been vacated and closed for a period of one
year pursuant to an ordinance adopted pursuant to division (A) of this section
or after the Inspector issues an order or proceedings have commenced under the
substandard housing regulations regarding a dwelling to be repaired or vacated
and closed as provided in this division, then the Town Council may find that
the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the
dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation and that the
continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical
to the health, safety, and welfare of the Town of Newport in that the dwelling
would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be
a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal
activities, would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of
property values in the area, and would render unavailable property and a
dwelling that might otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent
shortage of decent and affordable housing in this state, then in such
circumstances, the Town Council may, after the expiration of such one-year
period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth
the following:
         (a)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
         (b)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
      (2)   This subchapter shall be recorded in the Office of the Register of
Deeds in the county wherein the property or properties are located and shall be
indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner
fails to comply with this subchapter, the Inspector shall effectuate the
purpose of the ordinance (see G.S. § 160D-1203(6).

service of the order by filing with the Inspector and with the Board of
Adjustment a notice of appeal that shall specify the grounds upon which the
appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the Inspector shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of
the Inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, the
decision remains in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a
decision of the Inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the
appeal has the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the
Board, unless the Inspector certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal
is filed with the Inspector, that because of facts stated in the certificate, a
copy of which shall be furnished to the appellant, a suspension of the
requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case the
requirement is not suspended except by a restraining order, which may be
granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the
Inspector, by the Board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to
G.S. § 160D-1208(a).
   (B)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals,
shall file due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within
a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. If
by attorney, the Board may request the presence of the Town Attorney. The Board
may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order
appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to
be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the
Inspector, but the concurring vote of the majority of the members of the Board
shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Inspector.
The Board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where
there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, to adapt the application of
this chapter to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this
chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial
justice done.

restraining the Inspector from carrying out the order or decision and the court
may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction restraining the Inspector
pending a final disposition of the cause. The petition shall be filed within 30
days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision. Hearings shall
be had by the court on a petition within 20 days and shall be given preference

the issues raised and shall enter such final order or decree as law and justice
may require. It is not necessary to file bond in any amount before obtaining a
temporary injunction under this section.

§ 3-3.10 PUBLIC NOTIFICATION.
   A.   Content. All public notices required by this ordinance shall comply
with G.S. §§ 160D-406, 160D-601, or 160D-602. Additionally, all notices, except
posted notices, shall:
      (1)   Identify the time, date, and location of the meeting or public
hearing;
      (2)   Identify the property involved by the street address, if
applicable, and the legal description and/or the parcel identification number
(PIN);
      (3)   Describe the nature and scope of the purposed action;
      (4)   Indicate that interested parties may appear at public hearings
where they may speak on the matter; and
      (5)   Indicate how further information may be attained.
   b.   Published notice. When the provisions of this ordinance require that
notice of a public hearing be published pursuant to G.S. §§ 160D-406, 160D-601,
or 160D-602, the Ordinance Administrator shall publish a notice of the public
hearing once a week for two successive calendar weeks in a newspaper having
general circulation in the town. The notice shall be published the first time
not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date scheduled for the
hearing. In computing such period, the day of publication is not to be included
but the day of the hearing shall be included.
   c.   Mailed notice.
      (1)   When the provisions of this ordinance require that mailed notice be
provided pursuant to G.S. §§ 160D-406, 160D-601, or 160D-602, the Ordinance
Administrator shall prepare a notice of the public hearing and deliver the
notice via first class mail to the owners of affected parcels of land and the
owners of all parcels of land abutting that parcel of land. Properties are
"abutting" even if separated by a street, railroad, or other transportation
corridor.
      (2)   Mailed notices must be deposited in the mail at least ten but not
more than 25 days prior to the date of the hearing.
      (3)   The Ordinance Administrator shall certify to the Town Council that
actual notice has been provided, and such certificate shall be deemed

      (4)   Mailed notice shall not be required when an application to amend
the Official Zoning Map includes more than 50 different parcels, owned by at
least 50 different property owners, and the Town of Newport publishes a notice,
occupying at least one-half of a newspaper page, in a newspaper of general
circulation once a week for two consecutive weeks, beginning at least ten but
not more than 25 days prior to the public hearing date. The advertisement shall
only be effective for property owners who reside in the area of general
circulation of the newspaper that publishes the notice. Property owners who
reside outside of the newspaper circulation area, according to the address
listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected property, shall
be notified according to the provisions of subsection (1) and (2) above (see
G.S. § 160D-602(b))
   d.   Posted notice.
      (1)   When the provisions of this ordinance require that notice be posted

shall post the notice on the subject property at least ten but not more than 25
days prior to the public hearing date. When multiple parcels are included
within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is
not required, but the Ordinance Administrator shall post sufficient notices to
provide reasonable notice to interested persons.
      (2)   If no part of the subject property is visible from a public right-
of-way, the notice shall be posted along the nearest street in the public
right-of-way in such a manner as to ensure consistency with the intent of this
subsection.

military base, the Ordinance Administrator shall provide written notice of the
proposed changes by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the commander
of the military base not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the
date fixed for the hearing. If the commander of the military base provides
comments or analysis regarding the compatibility of the proposed development
regulation or amendment with military operations at the base, the Town Council
shall take the comments and analysis into consideration before making a final
determination on the ordinance (see G.S. § 160D-601(b)).
   f.   Constructive notice.
      (1)   Minor defects in any notice shall not impair the notice or
invalidate proceedings pursuant to the notice if a bona fide attempt has been
made to comply with the applicable notice requirements. Minor defects in
notices may include but are not limited to errors in legal descriptions or
typographical or grammatical errors that do not impede the communication of the
notice to affected persons.
      (2)   Failure of an affected party to receive written notice shall not
invalidate subsequent action.
      (3)   If questions arise at the public hearing regarding the adequacy of
the notice, the decision-making body shall direct the Ordinance Administrator
to make a formal finding as to whether there was substantial compliance with
the notice requirements of this ordinance. Such findings shall be made
available to the decision-making body prior to further action being taken on
the request.

   c.   Initiation. An application to amend the Official Zoning Map may be
initiated by the Town Council, the Planning Board, the Ordinance Administrator,
any resident of Newport, or any other interested party. However, no amendment
to the Official Zoning Map that down-zones property shall be initiated nor is
it enforceable without the written consent of all property owners whose
property is the subject of the down-zoning amendment, unless the down-zoning
amendment is initiated by the local government (G.S. § 160D-601(d)).
   d.   Conditional Zoning District classification distinction.
      (1)   Applications for an amendment to the Official Zoning Map that are
accompanied by applicant sponsored conditions or limitations shall be
considered as a Conditional Zoning District Classification, and shall be
reviewed in accordance with § 3-4.2, Conditional Zoning District
Classification.
      (2)   In no case shall an application for an amendment to the Official
Zoning Map be converted into an application for a Conditional Zoning District
classification, nor shall an application for a Conditional Zoning District
classification be converted into an application for an amendment to the
Official Zoning Map. If such a conversion is desired, a new application with
any applicable fees must be submitted.
   e.   Procedures.
      (1)   Preliminary procedures. See §
3-3, Common Review Procedures.
      (2)   Review by the Ordinance Administrator. Prior to the submission of
the application to the Planning Board, the Ordinance Administrator shall review

Planning Board during the meeting at which it considers the application.
      (3)   Review and recommendation by the Planning Board. Following the
review by the Ordinance Administrator, the application shall be forwarded to
the Planning Board for its review and recommendation. The Planning Board shall
consider the application, relevant supporting materials, the Ordinance
Administrator's report and recommendation (if given), and any comments provided
by the general public during its meeting. The Planning Board shall provide a
written statement summarizing the amendment's consistency with the Core CAMA
Land Use Plan and any other relevant plans having applicability to the proposed
amendment in accordance with G.S. § 160D-604(d). If no written report is
received from the Planning Board within 30 days of referral of the application,
the Town Council may act on the amendment without the Planning Board report
(G.S. § 160D-604(b)).
      (4)   Action by the Town Council. Following the receipt of a
recommendation from the Planning Board, the Town Council shall conduct a public
hearing to review and consider the application, the relevant supporting
materials, the Ordinance Administrator's report and recommendation (if given),
the recommendation of the Planning Board, and any comments provided during the
public hearing. Following the close of the public hearing, the Town Council
shall take one of the following actions:
         i.   Approve the application for amendment to the Official Zoning Map
as submitted;
         ii.   Approve the application for amendment to the Official Zoning Map
with a reduction in size of the area requested in the application;
         iii.   Approve the application for amendment to the Official Zoning
Map with a more restrictive base zoning district than proposed;
         iv.   Deny the application for amendment to the Official Zoning Map;
or
         v.   Remand the application back to the Planning Board for further
consideration.
      (5)   Statement of plan consistency and additional reasonableness
statement (G.S. § 160D-605). When adopting or rejecting any Zoning Map
amendment, the Town Council shall approve a brief statement describing whether
its action is consistent or inconsistent with the Core CAMA Land Use Plan. The
requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear
indication in the minutes of the Town Council that at the time of action on the
amendment the Town Council was aware of and considered the Planning Board's
recommendations and any relevant portions of the Core CAMA Land Use Plan. If a
zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-
602(b), the Town Council's statement describing plan consistency may address
the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant
adopted plans were considered in the action taken. If a plan is deemed amended
by virtue of adoption of a zoning amendment that is inconsistent with the plan,
that amendment shall be noted in the plan; however, the plan amendment shall
not become effective until completion of the review and approval process
required by G.S. § 113A-110. Furthermore, a statement analyzing the
reasonableness of the proposed Zoning Map Amendment shall be approved by the
Town Council. This statement of reasonableness may consider, among other
factors:
         i.   The size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the area
proposed to be rezoned;
         ii.   The benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors,
and the surrounding community;
         iii.   The relationship between the current actual and permissible
development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be
permissible under the proposed amendment;
         iv.   Why the action taken is in the public interest; and
         v.   Any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a zoning map
amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under G.S. § 160D-602(b), the
governing board statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.
         vi.   The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency
statement may be approved as a single statement.
   f.   Zoning Map amendment standards. Amending the Official Zoning Map is a
matter committed to the legislative discretion of the Town Council. In
determining whether to approve or deny a proposed amendment, the Town Council
shall consider and weigh the relevance of the following factors:
      (1)   The proposed rezoning corrects an error or meets the challenge of
some changing condition, trend, or fact.
      (2)   The proposed rezoning is compatible with the Town of Newport's Core
CAMA Land Use Plan and accompanying future land use plan map.
      (3)   The proposed rezoning and the range of uses permitted in the
requested zoning district are compatible with the surrounding zoning patterns
and land uses.
      (4)   The Town of Newport will be able to provide sufficient public
safety services, meet transportation and utility demands to the subject
property, while maintaining a sufficient level of service to existing
developments.
      (5)   The proposed rezoning will not impair or injure the health, safety
and general welfare of the public.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 3-4.2 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT CLASSIFICATION.
   a.   Purpose. A Conditional Zoning District classification (CD) allows
particular land uses to be established only in accordance with specific
standards and conditions adopted as part of the establishment of the district.
In cases where the standards of a base zoning district are inadequate to ensure
the compatibility of a proposed development with the immediate area, the
landowner may apply for an amendment to the Official Zoning Map to a CD. CDs
are subject to additional conditions or restrictions above and beyond the
standards of the parallel base zoning district as a means of ensuring the
compatibility of the proposed development with the use and development of the
neighboring area.
   b.   Initiation. An application for a CD may only be initiated by the
current owner(s) or contract purchaser(s), of the property for which the CD is
designated in accordance with §
3-3.1, Authority to File Application.
   c.   Procedures. Approval of a CD shall require an amendment to the Official
Zoning Map using the same procedures established in §
3-4.1, Zoning Map Amendment. This must be accompanied by the submission of
applicant sponsored conditions, which limit the scope of the development
proposal, and a conceptual site plan that is reviewed in accordance with §
3-4.8, Conceptual Site Plan.
      (1)   Preliminary procedures. See §
3-3, Common Review Procedures.
      (2)   Review by the Ordinance Administrator. Prior to the submission of
the application to the Planning Board, the Ordinance Administrator shall review
the application and accompanying conceptual site plan and make a written
report, which shall be presented to the Planning Board during the meeting at
which it considers the application.
      (3)   Review and recommendation by the Planning Board. Following the
review by the Ordinance Administrator, the application and conceptual site plan
shall be forwarded to the Planning Board for its review and recommendation. The
Planning Board shall consider the application, the conceptual site plan,
relevant supporting materials, the Ordinance Administrator's report and
recommendation (if given), and any comments provided by the general public
during its meeting. The Planning Board shall provide a written statement
summarizing the CDs consistency with the Core CAMA Land Use Plan and any other
relevant plans having applicability to the proposed CD in accordance with G.S.
§ 160D-604(d). If no written report is received from the Planning Board within
30 days of referral of the application, the Town Council may act on the
amendment without the Planning Board report (see G.S. § 160D-604(b)).
      (4)   Action by the Town Council. Following the receipt of a
recommendation from the Planning Board, the Town Council shall conduct a public
hearing to review and consider the application, the conceptual site plan, the
relevant supporting materials, the Ordinance Administrator's report and
recommendation (if given), the recommendation of the Planning Board, and any
comments provided during the public hearing. Following the close of the public
hearing, the Town Council shall, by a simple majority vote of all members
present and qualified to vote, either approve, approve with conditions, or deny
the application.
   b.   Fair and reasonable conditions.
      (1)   No use shall be authorized within a CD except those uses proposed
by the applicant and approved by the Town Council. In no case shall any
prohibited use within a parallel base zoning district be allowed in a
corresponding conditional district.
      (2)   No condition shall be less restrictive than the parallel base
zoning district or any applicable overlay district standards.
      (3)   No condition shall be included that specifies the ownership status,
race, religion, or other character of the occupants of dwelling units, the
minimum value of improvements, or any other exclusionary device.
      (4)   No changes in the conceptual site plan or proposed conditions that
are less restrictive than those in the application (e.g. smaller setbacks, more
dwelling units, greater height, more access points, new users, fewer
improvements, etc.) shall be proposed by the applicant following public
notification. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the application of new or
more restrictive conditions after public notification, provided such conditions
are received by the Ordinance Administrator, in writing, signed by all owners
of the property at least ten business days prior to the final decision on the
application by the Town Council.
      (5)   In addition to any conditions proposed by the applicant, the Town
Council may attach any additional conditions in accordance with §
3-3.11, Conditions of Approval. The Town Council shall not attach a condition
that requires a landowner to waive a vested right.
      (6)   Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a CD shall be
limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the
site or the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or
use of the site in accordance with G.S. § 160D-703(b).
   c.   Effect of approval. Lands subject to a CD shall also be subject to the
approved conceptual site plan and approved conditions, and may only be used or
developed in conformance to those approved plans and conditions. The approved
conceptual site plan and conditions shall constitute the standards for the
approved CD, and are binding on the land as an amendment to this ordinance and
Official Zoning Map. The petitioner must sign the conditions for them to be
enforced.
   d.   Designation. A Conditional Zoning District classification shall bear
the same designation as the parallel base zoning district, but shall also
include the suffix "CD".
   e.   Substantial changes. To be permitted, any substantial change to a
conceptual site plan or approved conditions, as noted below, shall be reviewed
by the Planning Board and approved by the Town Council as an amended CD. The
following changes to a conceptual site plan or approved conditions shall
require approval by Town Council:
      (1)   Land being added or removed from the CD;
      (2)   Modification of special performance criteria, design standards, or
other requirements specified by the enacting ordinance;
      (3)   A change in land use or development type beyond that permitted by
the approved conceptual site plan;
      (4)   When there is introduction of a new vehicular access point to an
existing street not previously designated for access;
      (5)   When there is an increase in the total number of residential
dwelling units originally authorized by the approved conceptual site plan; and
      (6)   When the gross floor area of nonresidential use is increased more
than five percent beyond the gross floor area on the approved conceptual site
plan.
   f.   Minor deviations. Minor deviations to a conceptual site plan or
approved conditions, which have no substantial impact on the basic development
concept of the CD may be approved administratively at the discretion of the
Ordinance Administrator. However, if in the judgment of the Ordinance
Administrator, the requested changes alter the basic development concept of the
CD, the Ordinance Administrator may require approval by the Town Council.
   g.   Recordation. The Town of Newport shall, at the applicant's expense,
record the CD in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Carteret County within
30 days of its issuance.
   h.   Rescission of Conditional Districts. The applicant shall secure a valid
building permit within two years from date of approval of the CD unless
otherwise specified. If a valid building permit has not been issued by that
time, the Ordinance Administrator shall notify the applicant of such finding.
Within 60 days of notification, the Ordinance Administrator shall make a
recommendation concerning the rescission of the CD to the Town Council. The
Town Council may grant a single extension of up to one year upon submittal by
the applicant of sufficient justification for the extension and following a
public hearing on the matter. The Town Council may also rescind the CD pursuant
to a Zoning Map amendment.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 3-4.3 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE TEXT AMENDMENT.
   a.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for a uniform
process to amend the text of the Unified Development Ordinance.
   b.   Authority. The Town Council may adopt an ordinance amending the text of
the Unified Development Ordinance upon compliance with the provisions of this
section.
   c.   Initiation. An application to amend the text of the Unified Development
Ordinance may be initiated by the Town Council, the Planning Board, the
Ordinance Administrator, any resident of Newport, or any other interested
party.
   d.   Procedures.
      (1)   Preliminary procedures. See §
3-3, Common Review Procedures.
      (2)   Review by the Ordinance Administrator. Prior to the submission of
the application to the Planning Board, the Ordinance Administrator shall review
the application and make a written report, which shall be presented to the
Planning Board during the meeting at which it considers the application.
      (3)   Review and recommendation by the Planning Board. Following the
review by the Ordinance Administrator, the application shall be forwarded to
the Planning Board for its review and recommendation. The Planning Board shall
consider the application, relevant supporting materials, the Ordinance
Administrator's report and recommendation (if given), and any comments provided
by the general public during its meeting. The Planning Board shall provide a
written statement summarizing the amendment's consistency with the Core CAMA
Land Use Plan and any other relevant plans having applicability to the proposed
amendment in accordance with G.S. § 160D-604(d). If no written report is
received from the Planning Board within 30 days of referral of the application,
the Town Council may act on the amendment without the Planning Board report
(G.S. § 160D-604(b)).
      (4)   Action by the Town Council. Following the receipt of a
recommendation from the Planning Board, the Town Council shall conduct a public
hearing to review and consider the application, the relevant supporting
materials, the Ordinance Administrator's report and recommendation (if given),
the recommendation of the Planning Board, and any comments provided during the
public hearing. Following the close of the public hearing, the Town Council
shall take one of the following actions:
         i.    Approve the application for amendment to the Unified Development
Ordinance as submitted;
         ii.    Approve a revised amendment;
         iii.    Deny the application for amendment to the Unified Development
Ordinance; or
         iv.    Remand the application back to the Planning Board for further
consideration.
      (5)   Statement of plan consistency and additional reasonableness
statement (G.S. § 160D-605). When adopting or rejecting any amendment, the Town
Council shall approve a brief statement describing whether its action is
consistent or inconsistent with the Core CAMA Land Use Plan. The requirement
for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear indication in the
minutes of the Town Council that at the time of action on the amendment the
Town Council was aware of and considered the Planning Board's recommendations
and any relevant portions of the Core CAMA Land Use Plan. If a plan is deemed
amended by virtue of adoption of a zoning amendment that is inconsistent with
the plan, that amendment shall be noted in the plan; however, the plan
amendment shall not become effective until completion of the review and
approval process required by G.S. § 113A-110.
   e.   Unified Development Ordinance text amendment standards. Amending the
text of the Unified Development Ordinance is a matter committed to the
legislative discretion of the Town Council. In determining whether to approve
or deny a proposed amendment, the Town Council shall consider and weigh the
relevance of the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the proposed amendment corrects an ambiguity or error or
meets the challenge of some changing condition, trend or fact;
      (2)   Whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the Core CAMA
Land Use Plan and associated future land use plan map; and
      (3)   Whether the proposed amendment will impair or injure the health,
safety and general welfare of the public.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 3-4.4 SPECIAL USE PERMIT.
   a.   Purpose. Special uses are uses that are generally compatible with the
other uses permitted in a zoning district, but require individual review of
their location, design, configuration, density and intensity of use, and may
require the imposition of conditions to ensure the appropriateness of the use
at a particular location.
   b.   Authority. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to review and make
decisions regarding applications for special use permits in accordance with
this section. Only those uses identified as special uses in Article VII,
District Regulations are authorized to be considered as special uses under this
section. The designation of a use as a special use does not constitute an
authorization that such use shall be approved through a special use permit in
accordance with this section. Rather, each proposed special use shall be
evaluated by the Board of Adjustment for compliance with the standards set
forth in this section.
   c.   Initiation. An application for a special use permit may only be
initiated by the current owner(s) or contract purchaser(s), of the property for
which the special use permit is designated in accordance with §
3-3.1, Authority to File Application.
   d.   Procedures. Approval of a special use permit shall require a conceptual
site plan that is reviewed in accordance with §
3-4.8, Conceptual Site Plan.
      (1)   Preliminary procedures. See §
3-3, Common Review Procedures.
      (2)   Review by the Ordinance Administrator. Prior to the submission of
the application to the Board of Adjustment, the Ordinance Administrator shall
review the application and accompanying conceptual site plan and make a written
report, which shall be presented to the Board of Adjustment during its public
hearing on the application.
      (3)   Action by the Board of Adjustment. Following public notification
and the scheduling of a public hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall conduct a
quasi-judicial public hearing on the application. At the hearing, the Board of
Adjustment shall consider the application, the relevant supporting materials,
the conceptual site plan, and all other competent and relevant evidence
presented at the hearing. Following the close of the hearing, the Board of
Adjustment shall, by a simple majority vote of all members present and
qualified to vote, approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application
based on the standards in this section. All decisions by the Board of
Adjustment shall be reduced to writing, reflect the Board's determination of
contested facts and their application to the applicable standards, and be
approved by the Board and signed by the chairperson or other duly authorized
member of the Board.
   e.   Special use permit standards.
      (1)   The proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety or
general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity of the site.
      (2)   The proposed use is in compliance with all standards in this
ordinance.
      (3)   The proposed use is compatible with the character of the
surrounding area and the uses permitted in the zoning district(s) of the
surrounding area.
      (4)   The proposed use is configured in a manner which minimizes any
possible adverse effects on the surrounding area.
      (5)   The proposed use will not be detrimental to the value of adjacent
or nearby property.
      (6)   The proposed use will be in full compliance with all other relevant
local, state and federal laws and regulations.
   f.   Conditions. In approving a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment
may impose additional conditions on the permit approval in accordance with G.S.
§ 160D-705(c). All additional conditions imposed must be accepted by the
applicant.
   g.   Effect of approval. Issuance of a special use permit shall authorize
only the particular land use that is approved in the permit. All subsequent
development and use of the property must be in accordance with the approved
special use permit and in conformance with the approved conceptual site plan.
Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the establishment of a different use
of land provided such use is established in accordance with the requirements in
this ordinance. All conditions must be consented to in writing by a landowner
or permit applicant.
   h.   Recordation. The Town of Newport shall, at the applicant's expense,
record the special use permit in the Office of the Register of Deeds of
Carteret County within 30 days of its issuance.
   i.   Subsequent development. Development authorized by the special use
permit shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other
permits required by this ordinance. A special use permit does not ensure that
the use shall receive subsequent approval for other applications for permit
approval unless the relevant and applicable portions of this ordinance are met.
   j.   Expiration. The Board of Adjustment may prescribe a time limit within
which development activity shall begin and/or be completed under the special
use permit. Failure to begin or complete such development activity within the
time limit specified shall void the special use permit. Unless specified by the
Board of Adjustment, a special use permit shall automatically expire two years
from the date of its issuance if development authorized by the permit has not
commenced.
   k.   Substantial changes. To be permitted, any substantial change to a
conceptual site plan or approved conditions, as noted below, shall be approved
by the Board of Adjustment as a new special use permit. The following changes
to a conceptual site plan or approved conditions shall require approval by the
Board of Adjustment:
      (1)   Land being added or removed from the special use permit;
      (2)   Modification of special performance criteria, design standards, or
other requirements specified by the enacting ordinance;
      (3)   A change in land use or development type beyond that permitted by
the approved conceptual site plan;
      (4)   When there is introduction of a new vehicular access point to an
existing street not previously designated for access; and
      (5)   When the gross floor area of nonresidential use is increased more
than five percent beyond the gross floor area on the approved conceptual site
plan.
   l.   Minor deviations. Minor deviations to a conceptual site plan or
approved conditions, which have no substantial impact on the basic development
concept of the special use permit may be approved administratively at the
discretion of the Ordinance Administrator. However, if in the judgment of the
Ordinance Administrator, the requested changes alter the basic development
concept of the special use permit, the Ordinance Administrator may require
approval by the Board of Adjustment.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 3-4.5 VARIANCE.
   a.   Purpose. The purpose of a variance is to allow certain deviations from
the standards of this ordinance when unnecessary hardships would result from
carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance.
   b.   Authority. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to review and make
decisions regarding applications for variances in accordance with this section.
   c.   Initiation. An application for a variance may only be initiated by the
current owner(s) or contract purchaser(s), of the property for which the
variance is designated in accordance with §
3-3.1, Authority to File Application.
   d.   Procedures.
      (1)   Preliminary procedures. See §
3-3, Common Review Procedures.
      (2)   Review by the Ordinance Administrator. Prior to the submission of
the application to the Board of Adjustment, the Ordinance Administrator shall
review the application and make a written report, which shall be presented to
the Board of Adjustment during its public hearing on the application.
      (3)   Action by the Board of Adjustment. Following public notification
and the scheduling of a public hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall conduct a
quasi-judicial public hearing on the application. At the hearing, the Board of
Adjustment shall consider the application, the relevant supporting materials,
and the sworn testimony given at the hearing. Within 30 days following the
close of the hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall, by a concurring four-
fifths vote of all members present and qualified to vote, approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the application based on the standards in this section
(G.S. § 160D-406(i)). All decisions by the Board of Adjustment shall be reduced
to writing, reflect the Board's determination of contested facts and their
application to the applicable standards, and be approved by the Board and
signed by the chairperson or other duly authorized member of the Board.
   e.   Variance standards (G.S. § 160D-705(d)). The Board of Adjustment shall
vary any of the provisions of this ordinance upon a showing of all of the
following:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the regulation. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence
of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability;
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship; and
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.
   f.   Conditions. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the
conditions are reasonably related to the variance in accordance with G.S. §
160D-705.
   g.   Recordation. The Town of Newport shall, at the applicant's expense,
record the written decision on the variance in the office of the Register of
Deeds of Carteret County within 30 days of its issuance.
   h.   Subsequent development. Development authorized by the variance shall
not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other permits required
by this ordinance. A variance does not ensure that the use shall receive
subsequent approval for other applications for permit approval unless the
relevant and applicable portions of this ordinance are met.
   i.   Variance runs with the land. A variance is not a personal right, but
runs with the land for which the variance has been granted. As such, the
provisions of an approved variance shall continue with the transfer of
ownership of land.
   j.   Minor deviation. A minor deviation to a conceptual site plan or
approved conditions shall not be considered as an amendment, and shall be
approved by the Ordinance Administrator. A minor deviation shall be limited to
technical considerations which could not be reasonably anticipated during the
approval process, or any other change which has no material effect on the
character of the approved development or any if its approved conditions. Minor
deviations include, but are not limited to, small shifts in the location of
structures, parking areas, landscaping, utilities, driveways and other site
features in order to accommodate the existence of circumstances found during
construction that could not have been anticipated as the conceptual site plan
was developed. Changes that materially affect the basic configuration or intent
of the conceptual site plan or approved conditions are not considered to be
minor deviations, and shall be amendments that may only be considered in
accordance with the procedure for a special use permit application.
   k.   Appeals. Any appeal from the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall
be to the Superior Court for Carteret County by petition for a writ of
certiorari. Any petition to the Superior Court shall be filed with the Clerk of
Court within 30 days after the date the decision of the Board of Adjustment is
filed with the Town Clerk, or after the date a written copy of the decision is
delivered (via personal delivery or by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested) to every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for
such copy with the Board of Adjustment at the public hearing, whichever is
later.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 3-4.6 APPEALS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
   a.   Right of appeal. Any aggrieved party affected by a decision or
interpretation of the Ordinance Administrator or other administrative official
may appeal such decision or interpretation to the Board of Adjustment in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
   b.   Procedure.
      (1)   Initiation. The owner or other party has 30 days from receipt of
the written notice of the determination within which to file an appeal. Any
other person with standing to appeal has 30 days from receipt from any source
of actual or constructive notice of the determination within which to file an
appeal. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given pursuant to
G.S. § 160D-403(b) by first-class mail is deemed received on the third business
day following deposit of the notice for mailing with the United States Postal
Service.
      (2)   Contents of appeal. The written notice of appeal shall specify the
grounds for the appeal, a statement of the improper decision or interpretation,
the date of that decision or interpretation, and all supporting materials
related to the decision.
      (3)   Record. Upon receipt of the written notice of appeal, the Town
Clerk shall transmit all the papers, documents, and other materials relating to
the decision or interpretation appealed to the Board of Adjustment. These
materials shall constitute the record of the appeal.
      (4)   Schedule of notice and hearing.
         i.   Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the Town Clerk shall schedule
a public hearing, and provide public notification in accordance with the
standards in §
3-3, Common Review Procedures.
         ii.   The Board of Adjustment shall hear the appeal at its next
regularly scheduled meeting, based upon established scheduling policy, or as
soon as is reasonably possible.
      (5)   Hearing and decision by Board of Adjustment. At the hearing, the
person making the appeal may appear in person, by agent, or attorney, and shall
state the grounds for the appeal and identify any materials or evidence from
the record to support the appeal. The official who made the decision or the
person currently occupying that position, if the decision maker is no longer
employed by the town, shall be present at the evidentiary hearing as a witness.
The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in a notice
of appeal. If any party or the town would be unduly prejudiced by the
presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board shall
continue the hearing. The Ordinance Administrator shall be given an opportunity
to respond, as well as any other Town of Newport staff or other person the
Board of Adjustment deems necessary. In making its determination, the Board of
Adjustment shall consider the application, the relevant support materials, and
the testimony given at the public hearing. Within 30 days following the close
of the hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall, by a simple majority vote of all
members present and qualified to vote, approve, approve with conditions, or
deny the application based on the standards in this section. All decisions by
the Board of Adjustment shall be reduced to writing, reflect the Board's
determination of contested facts and their application to the applicable
standards, and be approved by the Board and signed by the chairperson or other
duly authorized member of the Board (see § G.S. § 160D-406(e)).
   c.   Effect of appeal. An appeal of a notice of violation or other
enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of
any fines assessed unless the official who made the decision certifies to the
Board of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that, because of the
facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property or, because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would
seriously interfere with enforcement of the development regulation. In that
case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining
order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not
stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited
hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the
appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a development approval or otherwise
affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the development
regulation shall not stay the further review of an application for development
approvals to use such property; in these situations, the appellant or Town of
Newport may request and the Board of Adjustment may grant a stay of a final
decision of development approval applications, including building permits
affected by the issue being appealed.
   d.   Appeal of decision. Any appeal from the decision of the Board of
Adjustment shall be to the Superior Court for Carteret County by petition for a
writ of certiorari. Any such petition to the Superior Court shall be filed with
the Clerk of Court no later than 30 days after the date the decision of the
Board of Adjustment is filed with the Town Clerk, or after the date a written
copy of the decision is delivered (via personal delivery or by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested) to every aggrieved party who has
filed a written request for such copy with the Board of Adjustment at the
public hearing, whichever is later.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 3-4.7 SITE-SPECIFIC VESTING PLANS.
   a.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of
G.S. § 160D-108(c)(3) for the establishment of a statutory vested right upon
the approval of a site-specific vesting plan.
   b.   Phased development. A multi-phased development, long term projects of
at least 25 acres, is vested for the entire development with the land
development regulations then in place at the time a site plan approval is
granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development. A right which
has been vested as provided for in this subsection remains vested for a period
of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial
phase of the multi-phased development.
   c.   Applicability. Vested rights shall only be available to the property
owner(s) with a legally established and approved site-specific vesting plan.
For the purposes of this ordinance, a site-specific vesting plan shall include
the following:
      (1)   Development subject to an approved special use permit;
      (2)   Development subject to a preliminary subdivision plat;
      (3)   Development subject to a site development plan; or
      (4)   Land subject to a Conditional Zoning District classification.
   d.   Procedures. If a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval
required by this ordinance, the Town of Newport shall provide whatever notice
and hearing is required for that underlying approval. If the site-specific
vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with
notice as required by §
3-3.10, Public Notification shall be held. Following the close of the hearing,
the deciding board shall, by a simple majority vote of all members present and
qualified to vote, approve a vested right for a site-specific vesting plan for
a period exceeding two years, but not exceeding five years, approve a vested
right for a site-specific vesting plan for a period exceeding two years, but
not exceeding five years with conditions, or deny a vested right.
   e.   Exceptions. A vested right, once established, under this ordinance,
precludes any zoning action by the Town of Newport that would change, alter,
impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the
property as set forth in an approved vested right, except when any of the
following conditions are present:
      (1)   The written consent of the affected landowner;
      (2)   Findings made, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that
natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if
uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and
welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the approved vested
right;
      (3)   The extent to which the affected landowner receives compensation
for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including,
but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all
architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consulting fees incurred
after approval by the decision-making body, together with interest as is
provided in G.S. § 160D-106. Compensation shall not include any diminution in
the value of the property that is caused by such action;
      (4)   Findings made, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that the
landowner or the landowner's representative intentionally supplied inaccurate
information or made material misrepresentations that made a difference in the
approval by decision-making body of the vested right; or
      (5)   The enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or
regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the approved vested
right, in which case the local government may modify the affected provisions,
upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect
on the plan, after notice and an evidentiary hearing.
   f.   Conditions. The decision-making body may approve a site-specific
vesting plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall
result in a vested right, although failure to abide by its terms and conditions
will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. The decision-making body shall
not attach a condition that requires a landowner to waive a vested right.
   g.   Approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon
the effective date of the decision-making body's decision approving the plan or
such other date as determined by such body upon approval.
   h.   Vested rights runs with the land. A vested right, obtained under this
ordinance, is not a personal right, but runs with the land for which the vested
right has been granted. As such, the provisions of an approved vested right
shall continue with the transfer of ownership of land.
   i.   Minor deviation. A minor deviation to a conceptual site plan or
approved conditions shall not be considered as an amendment, and shall be
approved by the Ordinance Administrator. A minor deviation shall be limited to
technical considerations which could not be reasonably anticipated during the
approval process, or any other change which has no material effect on the
character of the approved development or any if its approved conditions. Minor
deviations include, but are not limited to, small shifts in the location of
structures, parking areas, landscaping, utilities, driveways and other site
features in order to accommodate the existence of circumstances found during
construction that could not have been anticipated as the conceptual site plan
was developed. Changes that materially affect the basic configuration or intent
of the conceptual site plan or approved conditions are not considered to be
minor deviations, and shall be amendments that may only be considered in
accordance with the procedure for a special use permit application
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)

      Conceptual site plans associated with an application for a Conditional
Zoning District classification to a Planned Unit Development District shall
also include sufficient information to establish the development standards for
the PUD.
   f.   Amendment. A conceptual site plan may only be amended or modified in
accordance with the procedures set forth for its initial approval
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 3-4.9 SITE PLAN.
   a.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish the procedures and

   e.   Site plan development standards. A site development plan shall be
approved only upon a finding that it adequately depicts the precise design,
location, and profile of all structures, site features, and public facilities
proposed for development, as well as all other technical considerations. In
addition, the site development plan shall demonstrate that all of the following
standards are met:
      (1)   The use is allowed in the zoning district in accordance with
Article VII, District Regulations;

at the end of two years following initial approval if a building permit has not
been issued and construction pursuant to that permit has not commenced for at
least one building in the proposed development. A change in ownership shall not
affect this time frame.
   h.   Amendments. A site development plan may be amended, extended, or
modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards established for
its original approval. Changes to any approved site development plan following
the issuance of a land development permit shall require a re-review of a site
development plan, may void the land development permit, and may require
additional review fees at the discretion of the Ordinance Administrator. If the
amended site development plan was approved as a conceptual site plan, any
significant departure must be amended in accordance with the procedures set
forth for its initial approval.

(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 3-4.11 CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE .
   a.   Purpose. Certificates of compliance are required to ensure that
previously authorized development has taken place in conformance with approved
plans, permits, conditions, and the general provisions of this ordinance.
   b.   Applicability. All land development activity which was authorized by
the issuance of a land development permit for nonresidential use must receive a
certificate of compliance prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy from

Administrator shall submit the deficiencies to the applicant in writing and
deny the issuance of a certificate of compliance. The applicant may then
correct any deficiencies and reapply for a certificate of compliance.
   d.   Phased development. Where development of a site is conducted in phases,
certificates of compliance may be issued for those specific portions of the
development which have been completed to that point, provided that all required
infrastructure and all site features, such as parking and landscaping, related
to that portion of the development have been installed.
   e.   Temporary certificates authorized. The Ordinance Administrator is
authorized to grant a temporary certificate of compliance when it has been
determined that substantial compliance with all approved plans, permits, and
conditions exists, but uncontrollable circumstances will prevent the immediate
completion of the development, such as weather impacting the installation of
landscaping materials. A temporary certificate of compliance may be granted for
a period not to exceed 90 days. One extension, not to exceed 30 days may be
granted upon demonstration by the developer that conditions outside of their
control have precluded the completion of the development. In no case shall a
temporary certificate of compliance be in effect for a periods of more than 120
days.

3-4.12(c), Exemptions, the following forms of development shall be required to
have land subdivided in accordance with the procedures and standards of this
section prior to the transfer of title or sale of any lots, the issuance of a
land development permit or the issuance of a building permit for development:
      (1)   The division of land into two or more lots, building sites, or
other divisions for the purpose of immediate or future sale, lease or
development;
      (2)   All divisions of land involving the creation of a new street or the
change or modification of an existing street;
      (3)   Re-subdivision involving the further division or relocation of lot
lines of any lot or lots within an already approved subdivision; and
      (4)   The combination or consolidation of existing lots of record.
   c.   Exemptions (G.S. § 160D-802). The following actions shall be exempt

of the exempt subdivision plat with the Carteret County Register of Deeds.
   d.   Sketch plat review.
      (1)   General. The sketch plat review process allows applicants for
subdivision approval to submit their initial development proposal to the
Ordinance Administrator for review and comment prior to making a formal
application for subdivision approval. This process is intended to reduce the

a finding that the application complies with the standards in Article XVI
Subdivisions, as well as all other relevant provisions of this ordinance, and
all other relevant ordinances and regulations.
      (5)   Certification. No minor subdivision plat may be recorded unless all
relevant certificates, as identified in
Appendix A-3, have been signed by the appropriate authorities.
      (6)   Recordation. The applicant shall file the approved minor
subdivision plat with the Carteret County Register of Deeds within 90 days
after the date of approval or such approval be null and void.
   f.   Preliminary plat (major subdivision).
      (1)   General. A preliminary plat (major subdivision) establishes the
general layout and design for the subdivision. Upon the approval of a
preliminary plat, applicants may begin to install streets, public utilities,
and other infrastructure. Following installation and approval of all required
infrastructure, applicants may submit an application for a final plat. Building
permits may be issued before approval and recordation of a final plat, but no
certificate of occupancy shall be issued.
      (2)   Applicability. The subdivision preliminary plat (major subdivision)
procedures shall be utilized for the subdivision of land where any of the
following apply:
         i.   New public streets are proposed;
         ii.   Changes to existing public rights-of-way are proposed;
         iii.   New public utilities are required to serve the proposed lots;
         iv.   Flag lots are created or modified;
         v.   Part of the tract or parcel to be divided has been divided in the

         vi.   More than three lots are proposed.
      (3)   Required content of preliminary plats. A preliminary plat shall
contain all information as shown in
Appendix A-2, Subdivision Plat Content Standards.
      (4)   Review and approval procedures.
         i.   Review and recommendation by the Ordinance Administrator.
Following the review of the sketch plat, the applicant shall prepare a
preliminary plat that reflects the configuration depicted in the finalized
sketch plat along with any other required information. Once the complete
application and preliminary plat are submitted, the Ordinance Administrator
shall review the application and submit his recommendation and comments to the
Planning Board prior to the meeting at which they will review the application.
         ii.   Review and recommendation by the Planning Board. Following the
receipt of comments and a recommendation from the Ordinance Administrator, the
Planning Board shall review the proposed preliminary plat for compliance with
the provisions of this ordinance. Within 45 days following its initial review,
the Planning Board shall make a recommendation to the Board of Commissioners to
approve, conditionally approve, or deny approval of the preliminary plat based
on the standards in §
3-4.12(f)(5).
         iii.   Review and action by the Town Council. Following the receipt of
comments and a recommendation from the Ordinance Administrator and the Planning
Board, the Town Council shall review the proposed preliminary plat for
compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. Within 45 days following its
initial review, the Council shall make its decision to approve, conditionally
approve or deny approval of the preliminary plat based on the standards in §
3-4.12(f)(5).
      (5)   Standards of approval. A preliminary plat shall only be approved
upon finding that the application complies with the standards in Article XVI,
Subdivisions, all other relevant provisions of this ordinance, and all other
relevant ordinances, plans and regulations.
      (6)   Effect of approval. Approval of a preliminary plat shall constitute
approval of the development with the general lot shapes and alignments of
streets identified in the phases depicted on the approved preliminary plat.
Phases not depicted on an approved preliminary plat shall not have preliminary
plat approval. Approval of a preliminary plat allows the applicant to proceed
with the installation of the required infrastructure and utilities. Approval of
a preliminary plat does not constitute or guarantee approval of a final plat.
The approval of a subdivision preliminary plat is not a personal right, but one
which runs with the land, and, therefore, changes in ownership of the subject
property shall not alter the effect of the approval.
      (7)   Amendment. A preliminary plat may be amended or modified only in
accordance with the procedures and standards established for its original
approval.
      (8)   Installation and inspection of required improvements. Following the
construction of all required improvements, or the posting of a performance
guarantee for required improvements that are not installed or completed, the
applicant shall submit a written request for inspection of those improvements
to the Ordinance Administrator. When all required public improvements and/or
performance guarantees have been approved by the Town of Newport, the applicant
may apply for final plat approval.
      (9)   Performance guarantees. In lieu of meeting the requirements for the
completion, installation, and dedication of any and all public infrastructure
improvements (e.g., underground utilities, streets, sidewalks, storm drainage,
trees, landscaping, buffer plantings, street lights, etc.). Prior to final plat
approval, the Town of Newport may accept a performance guarantee in accordance
with the standards in this section.
         i.   Form of performance guarantees. Where required, the applicant
shall furnish a performance guarantee in any form acceptable to the Town
Attorney. Such forms may include any of the following:
            (a.)   Cash or equivalent security. The applicant shall deposit
cash, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other instrument readily convertible
into cash at face value, either with the Town of Newport or in escrow with a
financial institution designated as an official depository of the town. The
amount of deposit shall be equal to 125% of the entire cost, as certified in an
estimate by a licensed design professional and verified by the town, of
installing all required improvements.
            (b.)   Surety performance bonds. The developer shall obtain a
performance bond from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in
North Carolina, and approved by the Town Attorney. The bond shall be payable to
the Town of Newport and shall be in an amount equal to 125% of the entire cost
of installing all required improvements, as certified in an estimate by a
licensed design professional and verified by the town. The duration of the bond
(s) shall be until such time as the improvements are approved by the town. Any
expenses associated with the cost verification by the town shall be paid
entirely by the applicant.
            (c.)   Escrow guarantee. If cash or other instrument is deposited
in escrow with a financial institution, then the applicant shall file with the
Town of Newport an agreement with the financial institution guaranteeing the
following:
               1.   Exclusivity of funds. That the escrow amount will be held
in trust until released by the town and may not be used or pledged by the
applicant in any other transaction during the term of the escrow; and
               2.   Immediate release of funds. That in case of a failure on
the part of the applicant to complete the guaranteed improvements, the
financial institution shall, upon notification by the town of an estimate of
the amount needed to complete the improvements, immediately pay to the town the
funds estimated to complete the improvements, up to the full balance of the
escrow account, or deliver to the town any other instruments fully endorsed or
otherwise made payable in full to the town.
         ii.   Default. Upon failure on the part of the applicant to complete
the required improvements in the time required by this ordinance or as spelled
out in the performance bond or escrow agreement, the surety, or financial
institution holding the escrow account, shall, if required by the Town of
Newport, pay all or any portion of the bond or escrow fund to the town up to
the amount required to complete the improvements based on an estimate by the
town. Upon payment, the town, in its discretion, may expend such portion of
these funds, as it deems necessary to complete all or any portion of the
required improvements. The town must return any funds not spent in completing
the improvements to the applicant.
         iii.   Release of security guarantee. The Town of Newport may release
a portion of any security posted after the improvements are completed to the
satisfaction of the town. When the town approves the improvements, it shall
immediately release the portion of the security posted which covers the cost of
the improvements approved by the town, as shown in the detailed cost estimate.
      (10)   Expiration of approval. Preliminary plat approval shall be valid
for a period of two years from the date of approval of the preliminary plat
unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Town Council, or
unless a longer time period is established under applicable vested rights
provisions. Preliminary plats which have expired shall be resubmitted in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
   g.   Final plat (major subdivision).
      (1)   General. After the inspection and approval of the required public
improvements or the posting of a performance guarantee for improvements that
are not installed or completed, the applicant shall prepare a final plat for
review in accordance with this section. Where a subdivision is developed in
phases, only that phase which has been completed may be included in the final
plat. The applicant shall receive approval of a final plat prior to the
issuance of any certificate of occupancy for structures on newly created lots.
      (2)   Required contents of the final plat. A final plat shall contain all
information as shown in
Appendix A-2, Subdivision Plat Content Standards.
      (3)   Review and approval procedures.
         i.   Preliminary procedures. See §
3-3, Common Review Procedures.
         ii.   Review by the Ordinance Administrator. Following the submission
of a complete application for final plat approval, the Ordinance Administrator
shall review the application and submit a recommendation to the Town Council
prior to the meeting at which they will review the application.
         iii.   Review and action by the Town Council. Following the receipt of
a recommendation from the Ordinance Administrator, the Town Council shall
review the proposed final plat. The Town Council shall review the application
for consistency with the standards of this ordinance and with the approved
preliminary plat. Within 45 days following its initial review, the Town Council
shall make its decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny approval of
the final plat. In those cases where the applicant has submitted a performance
security in lieu of installing all required improvements, the Town Council may
only grant approval of the final plat if it has received a positive
recommendation from the Town Attorney with regard to the sufficiency of the
posted security.
      (4)   Standards of approval.
         i.   The final plat complies fully with the standards in Article XVI,
Subdivisions;
         ii.   The final plat is in substantial conformity with the approved
preliminary plat;
         iii.   The final plat indicates the installation, or financial
guarantee of the installation, of all required improvements; and
         iv.   The final plat contains all required certificates, signed by the
appropriate authorities.
      (5)   Certification. No minor subdivision plat may be recorded unless all
relevant certificates, as identified in
Appendix A-3, have been signed by the appropriate authorities.
      (6)   Recordation. The applicant shall file the approved minor
subdivision plat with the Carteret County Register of Deeds within 90 days
after the date of approval or such approval be null and void.

renovated, altered, or repaired in violation of any applicable provision of
this ordinance, the Ordinance Administrator may order the revocation of the
land development permit for such work and request a stop work order be issued
by the Town of Newport Building Inspector. The stop work order shall be in
writing, directed to the person doing the work, and shall state the specific

necessary to lawfully resume work.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 4-6.3 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   The Ordinance Administrator may revoke any land development permit by
written notification to the permit holder when violations of this ordinance
have occurred. Permits may be revoked when false statements or
misrepresentations were made in securing the permit, work is being or has been
done in substantial departure from the approved application or plan, there has
been a failure to comply with the requirements of this ordinance or a permit
has been mistakenly issued in violation of this ordinance.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 4-6.4 INJUNCTION.

all costs of the proceeding and posting a bond for compliance with the order.
The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court
in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be
conditioned upon the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of
abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of
abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction
therewith.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 4-6.9 DENY OR WITHHOLD PERMITS.

ARTICLE V: NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES
§ 5-1 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this ordinance there may exist
structures and uses of land, which were lawful before this ordinance was passed
but will be prohibited under the terms of this ordinance. It is the intent of
this ordinance to provide for their gradual elimination or improvement in order
to further the general plan and overall goals of the town for orderly community
development.
(Ord. Z2013-01, passed 9-12-2013)
§ 5-2 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any building or structure devoted in whole or in part to any
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary fixtures, wiring or plumbing,
providing that the cubic content of the building shall not be increased.
Repairs may be made as required to keep the building or structure in a safe
condition provided that no structural alteration or replacement shall be made.
(Ord. Z2013-01, passed 9-12-2013)
§ 5-3 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   a.   Where a lawful structure exists at the date of adoption of this
ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason
of some characteristic of the structure or its placement on the lot, such
structure may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful.
   b.   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity.
   c.   Where a structure or building containing a nonconforming use is damaged
or destroyed by any natural disaster, fire or accident, and repair or
replacement exceeds 50% of the cost of construction of a comparable new
building or structure, as determined by the Building Inspector, it shall not be
reconstructed or enlarged to accommodate a nonconforming use. It may only be
restored and used in conformity within the provisions of the district.
   d.   All nonconforming shipping containers, truck bodies, buses, mobile
homes, semitrailers, or variations thereof, are prohibited as accessory
structures, except as provided herein, and shall be removed 18 months from the
date of this regulation. An extension of six months may be granted if progress
has been and is being made at correcting the nonconformity. Any nonconforming
accessory building remaining on property shall be removed or be subject to code
enforcement action.
(Ord. Z2013-01, passed 9-12-2013; Ord. 2019-01, passed 6-13-2019)
§ 5-4 CONTINUANCE AND CHANGE OF NONCONFORMING USE.
   a.   Nothing in this ordinance shall allow a change from one nonconforming
use to another.
   b.   Any legal nonconforming use of a building, structure, mobile home or
premises may be continued; provided, however, that if the use is discontinued
for a period of 180 calendar days, said use shall be considered abandoned and
said building, structure or premises shall thereafter be used only for uses
permitted within the district in which the use is located. A mobile home shall
be removed from the district within 90 days after its abandonment. One-hundred
eighty days shall be allowed to remove from the premises all debris, equipment,
etc., that was associated with the nonconforming use. Three years shall be
given for the removal or conversion of structures and buildings.
(Ord. Z2013-01, passed 9-12-2013)
§ 5-5 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   Nonconforming signs, in addition to this section, shall be regulated by the
provisions of Article XIV of this ordinance.
(Ord. Z2013-01, passed 9-12-2013)
§ 5-6 RESERVED FOR FUTURE CODIFICATION.
§ 5-7 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   a.   When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the
regulations (other than area, depth or width requirements) applicable to the
district in which the lot is located, such use may be made as of right.
Otherwise, the nonconforming lot may be used only in accordance with a special
use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall
issue such permit if it finds that: (i) the proposed use is one permitted by
the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located;
and (ii) the property can be developed as proposed without any significant
negative impact on the surrounding property or public health, safety or
welfare. In issuing the permit authorized by this paragraph, the Board may
allow deviations from applicable dimensional requirements (such as setback
lines and yard minimums) if it finds that no reasonable use of the property can
be made without such deviations.
   b.   Whenever this ordinance creates a nonconforming lot and the owner of
the nonconforming lot also owns land adjacent to it, and a portion of this
other land can be combined with the nonconforming lot to create a conforming
lot (without thereby creating other nonconformities), the owner of the
nonconforming lot, or his or her successors in interest, may not take advantage
of the provisions of paragraph a. of this section.
(Ord. Z2013-01, passed 9-12-2013)
§ 5-8 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   a.   Except as specifically provided in this subsection, it shall be
unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in
the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation.
   b.   Subject to paragraph d. of this subsection, a nonconforming use may not
be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use
was made nonconforming by this ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged
to accommodate such use. However, subject to §
5-9 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain
circumstances), a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings
or to land outside the original building.
   c.   Subject to §
5-9 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain
circumstances), a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover
more land that was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except
that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a
quarry) may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was
established at the time it became nonconforming, if 10% or more of the earth
products had already been removed at the effective date of this ordinance.
   d.   The volume, intensity or frequency of use of property where a
nonconforming situation exists and may be increased and equipment or processes
used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if
these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity
rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this
subsection occur.
   e.   Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on
open land is unlawful if it results in:
      1.   An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming
use;
      2.   Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such
as yard requirements, height limitations or density requirements; or
      3.   The enclosure of previously unenclosed areas, even though those
areas were previously used in connection with the nonconforming activity. An
area is unenclosed unless at least 75% of the perimeter of the area is marked
by a permanently constructed wall or fence.
   f.   For the purpose of determining whether a right to continue a
nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this subsection, all of the
buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally
considered as a whole. For example, failure to rent one apartment in a
nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming mobile home
park for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that
apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or mobile home
park as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is
maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a
nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain
it thereafter. And so, if a mobile home is used as a nonconforming use on a
residential lot where a conforming residential structure also is located,
removal of the mobile home for 180 days terminates the right to replace it.
(Ord. Z2013-01, passed 9-12-2013)
§ 5-9 COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.
   a.   All work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date
of this ordinance, and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming
projects shall be revoked as of that date. Thereafter, work on nonconforming
projects may begin, or may be continued, only pursuant to a special use permit
issued by the Board of Adjustment (except as provided in paragraph b. of this
section). The Board shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant
has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding
obligations or otherwise changed his or her position in such substantial way in
reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date
of this ordinance and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed
to complete his or her project as proposed. In considering whether these
findings may be made, the Board shall be guided by the following.
      1.   All expenditures made pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked
building or zoning permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable
reliance on the land use law that existed before this ordinance became
effective.
      2.   Except as provided in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph, no
expenditures made between 180 days and the effective date of this ordinance
shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that
existed before this ordinance became effective. An expenditure is made at the
time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure.
      3.   To the extent that expenditures are reasonable with a reasonable
effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those
expenditures. For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having
made expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property
obtained is just as valuable under the new classification as it was under the
old, for the expenditure can be recovered by resale of the property.
      4.   An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant
both in dollar amount and in terms of: (i) the total estimate cost of the
proposed project; and (ii) the ordinary business practices of the developer.
      5.   A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual
knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed
development site could not be attributed to him or her.
      6.   Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in
the land use law affecting a development site, the Board may still find that he
or she acted in good faith if he or she did not proceed with his or her plans
in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance,
the Board may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to
undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that: (i) at the time the
expenditures were made, either there was considerable doubt about whether any
ordinance would ultimately be passed, or it was not clear that the proposed
ordinance would prohibit the intended development; and (ii) the developer had
legitimate business reasons for making expenditures.
      7.   Nothing in this section shall interfere with the provisions in §
1-11 (Vested Right) of this ordinance. The requirements of paragraph a. of this
section shall not apply to a nonconforming project if the Zoning Administrator
certifies that actual construction of the project began at least 180 days
before the effective date of this ordinance and that the work is at least 75%
complete at the effective date of this ordinance, notwithstanding the two-year
vested rights, §
1-11 of this ordinance.
   b.   The Board of Adjustment shall not consider any application for the
special use permit authorized by paragraph a. of this section that is submitted
more than 60 days after the effective date of this ordinance, unless it waives
this requirement for good cause shown.
   c.   If the Board of Adjustment issues a special use permit pursuant to
paragraph a. of this section, it may attach such reasonable conditions to the
permit as it finds necessary to reduce the extent to which the nonconforming
project is incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood. In particular, the
Board may require that work on the nonconforming project be continuously
maintained, if possible, and that the project be completed as expeditiously as
possible.
   d.   The Zoning Administrator shall send copies of this subsection to owners
(and developers, if different from the owners) of all properties in regard to
which permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in regard to which
a nonconforming project is otherwise known to be under construction. This
notice shall be personally delivered or sent by registered or certified mail
not less than 15 days before the effective date of this ordinance.
   e.   The Board of Adjustment shall establish expedited procedures for
hearing applications for special use permits under this subsection. These
applications shall be heard, whenever possible, before the effective date of
this ordinance, so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted.
   f.   When it appears from the developer’s plans, or otherwise, that the
nonconforming project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in
phases, segments or other discrete units, the Board of Adjustment shall
determine and not allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or
completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to
allow the developer to recoup and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the
expenditures he or she has made in connection with that nonconforming project.

§ 6-2 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
§ 6-2.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   A Conditional Zoning District allows particular uses to be established only
in accordance with specific standards and conditions pertaining to each
individual development project. Some land uses are of such a nature or scale
that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and
on the entire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by
general district standards. There are also circumstances in which a general
district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for
a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be
appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these
regulations and the adopted Core CAMA Land Use Plan.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-21)
§ 6-2.2 DESIGNATION.
   Conditional Zoning Districts shall be established only in accordance with
the procedures set forth in § 3.4.2, Conditional Zoning District
Classification, and may not contain conditions which are less restrictive than
this ordinance or other applicable regulation.
Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-21)
§ 6-2.3 ALLOWED USES.
   No use shall be permitted within a Conditional Zoning District except
pursuant to the conditions imposed as part of the approval. The permitted uses
shall be limited to those permitted in the corresponding base zoning district
unless otherwise restricted in the conditions set forth in the approval of the
Conditional Zoning District.
Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-21)
§ 6-2.4 STANDARDS.
   a.   Base zoning district standards apply. All standards and requirements
that apply to the corresponding base zoning district shall also apply to the
Conditional Zoning District.
   b.   No less restrictive than base district. Conditions imposed on a
conditional zoning district may be no less restrictive than the standards that
apply to the corresponding base zoning district.
   c.   Stricter standards adopted. Existing conditions or limitations
associated with an approved Conditional Zoning District classification shall
become null and void if future amendments to this ordinance require stricter
standards than those imposed under the Conditional Zoning District
classification.
   d.   Application of conditions. In cases where the ability to implement an
approved Conditional Zoning District condition is impossible or impractical
(e.g. a condition requiring trees to be preserved when the trees have
subsequently died due to natural causes), the Ordinance Administrator shall
enforce the condition in a way that most closely meets the condition's original
intent.

§ 6-2.5 PARALLEL CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   Each base zoning district shall have a corresponding "parallel" Conditional
Zoning District. Conditional Zoning District classifications shall be indicated

§ 9-4 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.
§ 9-4.1 ANTI-SKID ROW REGULATIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to provide reasonable regulations to prevent
the adverse effect of the concentration or clustering of certain uses of real
property, specifically adult entertainment establishments. Such uses have
serious objectionable characteristics when several of them are located in close
proximity to each other. Such concentration tends to create a “skid row”
atmosphere and has a detrimental effect upon the adjacent area. Regulation of
the locations of these uses is necessary to ensure that such adverse effects
will not contribute to the blight or downgrading of neighborhoods or deter or
interfere with the development and operation of other businesses which are
needed and desirable in the town.

§ 9-4.2 PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES.
   a.   In addition to the uses permitted in the CH Commercial Highway
District, there shall also be allowed subject to the provisions of the
following subsections as special uses, adult entertainment establishments as
defined. In all other districts, adult entertainment establishments are a
prohibited use.
   b.   The regulations set forth in this entire section are intended to be in
addition to and not in lieu of any other regulations of this code applicable to
any of the adult uses. Unless otherwise specifically approved, the regulations
shall not be deemed to repeal or amend any other provisions of this code which
are applicable to the adult uses nor be deemed to excuse noncompliance with any
such other provisions.

§ 9-4.3 PROXIMITY RESTRICTIONS.
   a.   The purpose of this subsection is to prevent the adverse effects of
location of certain uses of real property, specifically adult entertainment
establishments, in close proximity to one another, or in a district which is in
close proximity to and which serves residentially zoned property; or PUD which
is designated for residential use; or nursery schools, elementary schools,
junior high schools, high schools, churches or public playgrounds. Regulations
restricting the location of such uses with reference to residentially zoned
property or PUD which is designated for residential use, nursery schools,
elementary schools, junior high schools, high schools, churches or public
playgrounds are reasonable and necessary for the prevention of said deleterious
effects.
   b.   Notwithstanding anything elsewhere in this ordinance to the contrary,
except in the provisions of subparagraph
9-4.4 of this section, no building, structure or any portion thereof or any
portion of a lot or parcel of property in any zoning district, shall be used
for an adult entertainment establishment at a location closer than 2,640 feet
to any other adult entertainment establishment; or closer than 1,500 feet to
any residentially zoned property, PUD or parcel of property which is designated
for residential use, nursery schools, elementary schools, junior high schools,
high schools, churches or public playgrounds situated within the zoning
jurisdiction of the town.

blade tip, nacelle/turbine housing, or tower/pole edge) that is nearest the
subject property line adjacent to private property, public or private right-of-
way. There is a setback of 1,000 feet from the Croatan National Forest, so as
to minimize the adverse effect of catastrophic failure from debris and fire
hazard to the forest.
      2.   No portion of any wind turbine blade shall be closer than 25 feet
from any part of the ground that surrounds any WEF.
   b.   North Carolina Building Code requirements. All structures within and

§ 9-6.1c LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.
   Note
   Environmental issues associated with shadow flicker, blade glint,
catastrophic tower, turbine or blade failure or fire are perceived not to be a
significant concern so long as the setback requirements required herein are
adhered to.
   a.   Noise. No WEF or its generators, equipment or apparatus shall produce
noise above 35 decibels (dba) for more than five times within seven consecutive
days as measured at any property line of non-participating landowners, the
applicant and/or owner shall shut down the WEF within one business day of being
informed to do so by the Town Planning Director or designee. The facility shall
remain shut down until it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Planning Director or designee that the facility can be operated so as to not
exceed 35 decibels (dba) as measured at any non- participating property line.
   b.   Decommissioning or abandonment. Separate and apart from the escrow
account requirement herein, the owner/operator or his, her or its successors
shall provide surety for the guarantee of decommissioning, removal of the
facilities and restoring the property back to an acceptable condition after
removal:
      1.   Should the owner/operator decide to decommission any turbine, he,
she or it shall send written notification to the town, within 30 days of making
such a decision;
      2.   If any turbine does not produce electricity for 180 consecutive
days, said turbine is automatically considered to be decommissioned. It is the
responsibility of the owner/operator to inform the town when such a situation
arises. The owner/operator may appeal that determination to the Board of
Adjustment;
      3.   Absent any waver by the Board of Adjustment, the decommissioning
process will start for any decommissioned turbine, within 120 days of it being
decommissioned; and
      4.   Any violation of the decommissioning procedure for any individual
turbine will result in the loss of the special use permit for the WEF, until
the Board of Adjustment determines that the owner/operator is in compliance.
   c.   Surety for decommissioning of WEFs.
      1.   The applicant shall place with the town an acceptable letter-of-
credit, bond or other form of security that is sufficient to cover the cost of
removal and restoration at the end of the WEF’s useful life.
      2.   Such surety shall be at least $500,000 for each wind turbine and
$75,000 for each associated building.
      3.   The surety shall be used by the town to assure faithful performance
of the terms and conditions of the permit, as well as to serve as a surety to
prevent the taxpayers from bearing the cost of removal and restoration in the
event of the abandonment or cessation of use.
      4.   The full amount of surety shall remain in full force and effect
until any and all necessary site restoration is completed to restore the site
to a condition comparable to that which existed prior to the WEF, as determined
by the Town Planning Department.

§ 9-6.1e REAL PROPERTY VALUE PROTECTION REQUIREMENT.
   a.   The WEF owner (applicant) or his, her or its successor shall assure the
Town of Newport that there will be no loss in real property value due to the
WEF.
   b.   To legally support this claim, the applicant shall hereby consent to
this real property value protection agreement (“agreement”). This agreement
provides assurance to nonparticipating real property owners near the WEF (not
lessors to the applicant), that they have some protections from real property
values losses due to the WEF.
   c.   The applicant guarantees that the property values of all real property
partially or fully within two miles of the WEF, will not be adversely affected
by the WEF. The two miles shall be within the town zoning and planning
jurisdiction. Any real property owner(s) included in that area who believe that
their property may have been devalued due to the WEF, may elect to exercise the
following option.
   d.   All appraiser costs are paid by the applicant from the escrow account.
The applicant and the property owner shall each select a licensed appraiser.
Each appraiser shall provide a detailed written explanation of the reduction in
value to the real property (“diminution value”), if any, caused by the
proximity to the WEF. This shall be determined by calculating the difference
between the current fair market value of the real property (assuming no WEF was
proposed or constructed), and the fair market value at the time of exercising
this option.
      1.   If the higher of the diminution valuations submitted is equal to or
less than 25% more than the other, the two values shall be averaged (“average
diminution value”: ADV).
      2.   If one of the diminution valuations submitted is more than 25%
higher than the other, then the two appraisers will select a third licensed
appraiser who shall present to the applicant and property owner a written
appraisal report as to the diminution value for the real property. The parties
agree that the resulting average of the two highest diminution valuations shall
constitute the ADV.
      3.   In either case, the property owner may elect to receive payment from
the WEF owner of the ADV. The applicant is required to make this payment within
60 days of receiving said written election from property owner, to have such
payment made.
   e.   Other agreement conditions.
      1.   If a property owner wants to exercise this option, he, she or it
must do so within ten years of the WEF receiving final approval from the town.
      2.   A property owner may elect to exercise this option only once.
      3.   The applicant and the property owner may accept mutually agreeable
modifications of this agreement, however, the applicant is not allowed to put
other conditions on a financial settlement (e.g., confidentiality). If the
property owner accepts some payment for property value loss, based on an
alternative method, then that is considered an exercise of this option.
      4.   This agreement applies to the property owner of record as of the
first notification of intent to apply for a WEF permit by the applicant to
DENR, as required by HB-484, is not transferable to subsequent property owners.
      5.   The property owner of record as of the first notification of intent
to apply for a WEF permit by the applicant to DENR, as required by HB-484, must
reasonably maintain the property from that time, until he, she or it chooses to
elect this option.
      6.   The property owner must permit access to the property by the
appraisers, as needed to perform the appraisals.
      7.   The property owner must inform the appraisers of all known defects
of the property as may be required by law, as well as all consequential
modifications or changes to the property subsequent to the first notification
of intent to apply for a WEF permit by the applicant to DENR, as required by
HB-484.
      8.   This agreement will be guaranteed by the applicant (and all its
successors and assigns), for ten years following the WEF receiving final
approval from the town, by providing a bond (or other surety), in an amount
determined to be acceptable by the town.
      9.   Payment by the applicant (per § 9-6.1(e)d.3.) not made within 60
days will accrue an interest penalty. This will be 12% annually, from the date
of the written election from the property owner.
      10.   For any litigation regarding this matter, all reasonable legal fees
and court costs will be paid by the applicant.

   d.   Whenever construction or maintenance is being conducted at the WEF, the
owner/operator shall assure that properly trained and equipped personnel are on
site to perform rescue and emergency aid to anyone working within the facility.
   e.   In order for the Newport Fire and Rescue Squad to provide emergency aid
for rescue and/or fire to the WEF, the owner/operator shall offer semi-annual
training to the Fire and Rescue Squad at no cost to the town. If any special
equipment is needed for the Fire and Rescue Squad to provide reasonable service
to the WEF, the owner/operator of the WEF shall provide such equipment and
training for its use at no cost to the town. The Newport Fire Chief may elect
to coordinate with the Carteret County Emergency Manager to have other fire and
rescue units join in with the training.

ARTICLE XIII: OFF-STREET PARKING AND ACCESS REQUIREMENTS
§ 13-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   a.   Scope of provisions. Except as provided in this section, an application
for a building permit for a multi-family, commercial or industrial use shall
include a site plan showing the required space reserved for off-street parking
and access. The plan may include landscaping. An occupancy permit shall not be
issued unless the required off-street parking and access have been provided in
accordance with those shown on the approved plan.
   b.   Off-street parking required. In all districts at the time any building
or structure is constructed or enlarged, or the use is changed or increased in
intensity, off-street parking spaces for automobiles and/or bicycles shall be
provided in accordance with the requirements herein. Said spaces shall be
located on the lot containing the use itself; provided, however, in unusual or
extraordinary circumstances the Zoning Administrator may grant approval to
allow a portion or all of the required spaces to be located on a lot which is
accessible to the lot containing the use itself. The approval shall be based on
the accessibility of the lot. In order to merit favorable consideration, the
applicant must provide evidence to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator
that a suitable long-term lease or other legal agreement can be executed and
recorded which would guarantee that the lot containing the use has the
irrevocable right to utilize the adjacent lot for off-street automobile and/or
bicycle parking purposes.
(Ord. Z2013-01, passed 9-12-2013)
§ 13-2 PROHIBITION OF REDUCTION IN SIZE AND NUMBER OF SPACES.
   Parking space requirements of this article shall not be reduced in size or
number, modified or transferred to another use without proper zoning and/or
building permits. When parking spaces are a special use permit, the owner must
have received a variance from the Board of Adjustment. In order to receive a
variance, the lot owner must demonstrate that the tenant(s) or occupant(s) of
the subject lot will not: (1) need the number of parking spaces required by
this article for that general type of use(s); and (2) that the area subject to
the reduction in size and/or number of parking spaces can be utilized for
landscaping or other aesthetic amenities not otherwise required by this
article.
   Exception
   The off-street parking requirements within the CD District may be exempted
in part where it is found that it is impracticable to provide all parking
requirements of this part.
(Ord. Z2013-01, passed 9-12-2013)
§ 13-3 REQUIRED BICYCLE SPACES.
   Bicycle parking spaces, as set forth in the design criteria shall equal in
number to 2% of the total number of parking spaces required as set forth in §
13-5 with a minimum of one bicycle parking space. This requirement shall be in
addition to the requirement for automobile parking. This requirement may be
administratively waived by the Zoning Administrator in those unique instances
where it is clearly demonstrated that bicycle parking is inappropriate.

Supreme Court opinion.
         a.   There are limited exceptions to the “content neutral” opinion
such as, but not limited to, signs dealing with urgent public matter, safety
and public information.
         b.   To summarize the Supreme Court’s ruling, this list is not all
inclusive and is provided as examples of rules that may distinguish among signs
based on content-neutral criteria:
            1.   Rules regulating the size of signs;
            2.   Rules regulating the locations in which signs may be placed.
These rules may distinguish between freestanding signs and those attached to

incurred shall be at the expense of the owner, lessee and/or property owner to
which the sign is located or the Zoning Administrator may impose civil or
criminal penalties as provided by this ordinance.

§ 16-4.5.4 FORMULA FOR AREA SET ASIDE.
   The following formula which addresses number, type and density of dwelling
units will be used to determine the amount of area to be set aside for park and
recreational purposes:
 
(NDU) x (2.4 3 AFS) x (.008) x (VDF) = Acres Set Aside
Example 1. For a 33 lot, 12-acre subdivision.
33 x 2.43 x 0.008 x 1.2 = 0.76 acres (33,105 sq. ft.)
NDU = Number of dwelling units.
AFS = Average family size (latest census).
VDF = Variable density factor.
 
VARIABLE DENSITY FACTOR TABLE
Acreage Average per Dwelling Unit VDF
0.0-0.1                           1.8
0.1-0.2                           1.6
0.2-0.3                           1.4
0.3-0.4                           1.2
0.4-0.5                           1.0
0.5-0.6                           0.9
0.6-0.7                           0.8
0.7-0.8                           0.7
0.8-0.9                           0.6
0.9 over                          0.5
 
      1.   The average acre per dwelling unit is computed by dividing the
combined total acreage of all dwelling units or lots by the number of dwelling
units or lots. For computation purposes, land dedicated or reserved for
purposes such as streets, alleys and purposes other than residential shall not
be used in determining average acreage. In no case shall a developer be
required to dedicate more than 30% of the acreage of a development.
         Example 1. For a 33 lot 12 acre subdivision.
         12 acres ÷ 33 = 0.36 acre average. Reference to the chart shows a 1.2
VDF
      2.   Variable density factor is designed to provide an adjustment to
subdivision plats which contain average lot sizes of one-half acres and above.
This adjustment is used since subdivisions with larger lots contain more open
space and thus fewer lots and greater park acreage. Conversely, those
subdivision plats that create lots or units which average less than two-fifths
acres are adjusted due to the density of development and the inherent increased
demand for more public recreation and park land. The adjustments for large lots
or for small lots are based on a sliding scale reflecting degree of density.

§ 16-4.5.5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING SUITABILITY.
   Criteria for evaluating suitability of proposed recreation, parks and open
space areas shall include, but not be limited to, the following as determined
by the Council.
   a.   Unity. The dedicated land shall be a single parcel except where it is
determined that two or more parcels would be in the public interest. The
Planning Board may request that the parcels be connected and may also require
at least a 30-foot path width in addition to the land requirements.
   b.   Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to serve the
recreation needs of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision. General
public access shall not be restricted from the recreation area.
   c.   Shape. Topography and soils of the dedicated land shall be such as to
be suitable for parking and active recreation. Lakes and marsh may not be
included in computing dedicated land area unless acceptable to the Planning
Board. Land area less than two and one-half contiguous acres shall not be
considered as suitable for land set aside.
   d.   Accessibility. Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided
either by an abutting street or public easement. Such public easement shall be
at least 30 feet in width. The proposed land set aside shall be located as
remote from a building lot as possible. Consideration shall be given to the
location, screening, or buffering so as not to cause a nuisance to the
residential area. If adequate protection to the residential area can not be
provided, then the offer for land set aside shall be denied and a fee in lieu
of land set aside shall be required.
(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)
§ 16-4.5.6 FEES IN LIEU OF LAND SET ASIDE.
   In the event that it is determined by the town that the area, topography,
geology, access or location of the area to be set aside does not conform to the
park and recreational objectives of the town or appropriately meet the
immediate and future needs of the residents due to the availability of adjacent
facilities, the town may elect to waive the set aside of land for dedication by
accepting a fee in lieu of the dedication of land subject to the following:
   a.   Determination of fee. The amount of the fee to be accepted in lieu of
land dedication shall be determined by multiplying the required acreage times
the tax value of the land to be subdivided.
         Example 1. Tax value at the time of submittal of preliminary plat to
the Planning Board:
         $6,000 per acre x 0.76 acres = $4,560
   b.   Payment of required fees shall be by cash or certified check, payable
to the town. Payment must be made before final plat approval is granted by the
town.
   c.   Funds collected in lieu of land set aside shall be maintained in a
separate interest bearing account by the town in a recreation reserve fund for
use only to acquire additional land or expand or improve existing recreational
facilities.

(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)
§ 1-3 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these regulations is to establish procedures and standards
for the regulation and control of the subdivision of land within the
jurisdiction of the town in order to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare of the community. They are designed to promote the orderly

traffic to avoid congestion and overcrowding; provide adequate light, air and
open space; provide greater safety from fire, flood and other dangers; and

§ 7-2 GUARANTEES.
§ 7-2.1 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   a.   The developer shall provide one of the following performance guarantees
for an amount adequate to cover the estimated construction costs of a portion
of the required improvements at preliminary plat consideration and approval.
   b.   The developer shall provide the guarantee adequate to cover
construction cost of all grading and land disturbing.
   Note
      This guarantee is intended to pay for any mitigation of damage repair or
improvements that may be born by the town should the development be abandoned,
sold to other parties or otherwise stopped and the construction has or may
adversely affect adjacent properties or other town systems.
   c.   The conditions and the amount of the performance guarantee shall be
determined by the Council with advice of the town’s consulting engineer, Town
Manager and/or Town Attorney. The conditions and form can either be:
      1.   A cashier’s check or official bank check payable to the town, or a
savings account or certificate of deposit all naming the town as owner, for the
establishment of an escrow account, as provided for in § 4. below;
      2.   Performance bond payable to the town issued by a surety company,
approved by the Town Manager and Town Attorney, as provided for in § 5. below;
      3.   An irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution
establishing funding for the construction of the development, from which the
town may draw if construction is inadequate, approved by the Town Manager and
Town Attorney, as provided for in § 6. below;
      4.   Escrow account. A cash contribution to the establishment of an
escrow account shall be made by either a cashier’s check or official bank check
made out To the town, the direct deposit into a savings account, or the
purchase of a certificate of deposit. For any account opened by the developer,
the town shall be named as owner or co-owner, and the consent of the town shall
be required for a withdrawal. Any interest earned on the escrow account shall
be returned to the developer unless expended to finish construction as provided
below;
      5.   Performance bond (surety bond). A performance bond shall detail the
conditions of the bond, the method for release of the bond or portions of the
bond to the developer, and the procedures for collection by the town. The bond
documents shall specifically reference the subdivision for which
approval is sought; or
      6.   Letter of credit. An irrevocable letter of credit from a bank or
other lending institution shall indicate that funds have been set aside for the
construction of the development and may not be used for any other project or
loan. If construction is not complete within 320 days of the date of the letter
of credit, a new (renewal) letter of credit for not less than 365 days must be
furnished to the town within 20 calendar days, and this must be repeated until
construction is complete. If the renewal letters of credit are not timely
furnished, the town will make demand upon the then current letter of credit for
payment to the town of the estimated costs of completing construction, plus 20%
thereof. Failure of the town to make such demand shall not waive the town’s
rights under the letter of credit.
   d.   Contents of guarantee. The performance guarantee executed by the
developer and approved by the town shall contain a construction schedule, cost
estimates for each major phase of construction taking into account inflation,
provisions for inspections of each phase of construction, provisions for the
release of part or all of the performance guarantee to the developer, and a
date after which the developer will be in default allowing the town access to
the funds to finish construction, as provided below.
   e.   The town, at its discretion, may provide for the developer to enter
into a binding agreement with the town for approval of the final plat on the
condition that some lots may be sold and built upon if:
      1.   It is certified by the Town Manager, after advice from the
consulting engineer and for such other persons as he or she may deem
appropriate, that adequate improvements have been installed in accordance with
this ordinance and the regulations of the appropriate utilities; and
      2.   A performance guarantee of the type specified in c.1. through c.6.
above, as selected by the developer, and acceptable to the town, is submitted
in an amount necessary to cover the completion of the required improvements at
an amount adjusted for inflation and prorated for the portions of the required
improvements already installed plus 20% of this figure. Notice of the agreement
and any conditions shall be on the final plat which is recorded at the Register
of Deeds. Release from the agreement shall follow the procedures for release of
the performance guarantees contained in §
7-2.1g.
   f.   Phasing of development. The Council may approve plans to develop a
major subdivision in separate and distinct phases. This may be accomplished by
limiting final approval to those lots or buildings abutting that section of the
proposed development’s road or roads covered by a performance guarantee. When
development is phased, road construction shall commence from an existing public
way. All deadend roads shall be provided with a permanent or temporary cul-de-
sac. Final approval of lots in subsequent phases shall be given only upon
satisfactory completion of all requirements pertaining to previous phases.
   g.   Release of guarantee. Prior to the release of any part of the
performance guarantee, the Council shall determine to its satisfaction, in part
upon the report of the town’s consulting engineer and whatever other agencies
and departments may be involved, that the proposed improvements meet or exceed
the design and construction requirements for that portion of the improvements
for which the release is requested.
   h.   Default. If, upon inspection, the town’s consulting engineer finds that
any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with
the plans and specifications filed as part of the application, he or she shall
so report in writing to the Building Inspector, the Town Manager, the Council,
and the subdivider or developer. The Town Manager shall take any steps
necessary to preserve the town’s rights.
   i.   Failure to construct in accordance with approved plans and
specifications shall be a violation of this ordinance.
(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)
§ 7-2.2 INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS GUARANTEES.
   a.   Inspection of improvements. If the Town Manager finds that any of the
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the applicable
construction standards and specifications, the owner shall be responsible for
completing the improvements to the required standards. Whenever the cost of
improvements is covered by a performance bond, the owner and the bonding
company shall be liable severally and jointly for said improvements to be made
according to specifications and requirements of law and ordinances.
   b.   Release or reduction of performance bond. The Town Manager shall not
release nor reduce a performance bond until all departments or agencies provide
written confirmation that all required improvements have been satisfactorily
completed and all associated and/or surplus construction materials are removed
from the site. There shall be no reduction or release of a bond if any
outstanding administrative penalties or violations related to the bonded site
exist.
   c.   Reduction of performance bond. A performance bond may be reduced upon
demonstration of satisfactory completion of public improvements, including
installation of asphalt surface binder course, and then only to the ratio that
the installed improvement bears to the total public improvements for the
subdivision. In no event shall a performance bond be reduced below 10% or
$5,000, whichever is greater, of the original principal amount. The bond shall
remain in effect for a minimum of two years after final plat approval.
   d.   Extension of performance bond. The Town Manager, upon finding
extenuating circumstances may extend the completion date set forth in such bond
and may require an extension and/or an increase in the bonded amount to cover
increases in costs.
   e.   Refer to Town Council. The Town Manager may refer decisions to release,
reduce or extend a bond to the Town Council.
   f.   Maintenance of improvements. The owner shall be required to maintain
all improvements including all lot improvements until acceptance of such
improvements by the town.
   g.   Expiration of bond. Should the bond lapse or expire for any reason
prior to completion of all required improvements, no additional building
permits shall be issued and the Town Manager shall take any and all appropriate
legal action necessary to assure completion of improvements. The developer may
be declared in default and the bond proceeds shall be held by the town. Only
after completion of all improvements or posting of a new bond shall building
permits again be issued.
   h.   Disposition of liquidated securities. Funds derived from liquidation of
securities, as a result of performance agreement default, shall be used by the
town to complete the required work, based upon the stage of development when
work ceased. Project administrative fees may be charged by the town against
liquidated funds to offset actual personnel or equipment costs utilized in the
accomplishment of required work. Any surplus funds shall be returned to the
security provider after all charges and expenses are paid and required work is
accepted.

§ 7-3.5.3 AREA DEVOTED TO PARKS AND RECREATION.
   The area devoted to parks and recreational purposes is equal to or exceeds
the area required under these regulations.
   Exemptions:
   a.   The division of a parcel of land into one new lot is exempt from this
part; and
   b.   Industrial and commercial subdivisions, without any residential, are
exempt from this part.
(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)
§ 7-3.5.4 FORMULA FOR AREA SET ASIDE.
   The following formula which addresses number, type and density of dwelling
units will be used to determine the amount of area to be set aside for park and
recreational purposes:
 
(NDU) x (2.4 3 AFS) x (.008) x (VDF) = Acres Set Aside
 
   Example 1. For a 33 lot, 12-acre subdivision.
 
33 x 2.43 x 0.008 x 1.2 = 0.76 acres (33,105 sq. ft.)
 
   NDU = Number of dwelling units.
   AFS =   Average family size (latest census).
   VDF = Variable density factor.

Variable Density Factor Table
Acreage Average per Dwelling Unit VDF
0.0—0.1                         1.8
0.1—0.2                         1.6
0.2—0.3                         1.4
0.3—0.4                         1.2
0.4—0.5                         1.0
0.5—0.6                         0.9
0.6—0.7                         0.8
0.7—0.8                         0.7

0.9 over                          0.5
 
      1.   The average acre per dwelling unit is computed by dividing the
combined total acreage of all dwelling units or lots by the number of dwelling
units or lots. For computation purposes, land dedicated or reserved for
purposes such as streets, alleys and purposes other than residential shall not
be used in determining average acreage. In no case shall a developer be
required to dedicate more than 30% of the acreage of a development.
 
Example 1. For a 33 lot 12 acre subdivision.
12 acres ÷ 33 = 0.36 acre average. Reference to the chart shows a 1.2 VDF
 
      2.   Variable density factor is designed to provide an adjustment to
subdivision plats which contain average lot sizes of 0.5 acres and above. This
adjustment is used since subdivisions with larger lots contain more open space
and thus fewer lots and greater park acreage. Conversely, those subdivision
plats that create lots or units which average less than 0.4 acres are adjusted
due to the density of development and the inherent increased demand for more
public recreation and park land. The adjustments for large lots or for small
lots are based on a sliding scale reflecting degree of density.

§ 7-3.5.5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING SUITABILITY.
   Criteria for evaluating suitability of proposed recreation, parks and open
space areas shall include, but not be limited to, the following as determined
by the Council.
   a.   Unity. The dedicated land shall be a single parcel except where it is
determined that two or more parcels would be in the public interest. The
Planning Board may request that the parcels be connected and may also require
at least a 30-foot path width in addition to the land requirements.
   b.   Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to serve the
recreation needs of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision. General
public access shall not be restricted from the recreation area.
   c.   Shape. Topography and soils of the dedicated land shall be such as to
be suitable for parking and active recreation. Lakes and marsh may not be
included in computing dedicated land area unless acceptable to the Planning
Board. Land area less than two and one-half contiguous acres shall not be
considered as suitable for land set aside.
   d.   Accessibility. Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided
either by an abutting street or public easement. Such public easement shall be
at least 30 feet in width. The proposed land set aside shall be located as
remote from a building lot as possible. Consideration shall be given to the
location, screening, or buffering so as not to cause a nuisance to the
residential area. If adequate protection to the residential area can not be
provided, then the offer for land set aside shall be denied and a fee in lieu
of land set aside shall be required.

geology, access or location of the area to be set aside does not conform to the
park and recreational objectives of the town or appropriately meet the
immediate and future needs of the residents due to the availability of adjacent
facilities, the town may elect to waive the set aside of land for dedication by
accepting a fee in lieu of the dedication of land subject to the following:
   a.   Determination of fee. The amount of the fee to be accepted in lieu of
land dedication shall be determined by multiplying the required acreage times
the tax value of the land to be subdivided.
 
Example 1. Tax value at the time of submittal of preliminary plat to the
Planning Board:
$6,000 per acre x 0.76 acres = $4,560
 
   b.   Payment of required fees shall be by cash or certified check, payable
to the town. Payment must be made before final plat approval is granted by the
town.
   c.   Funds collected in lieu of land set aside shall be maintained in a
separate interest bearing account by the town in a recreation reserve fund for
use only to acquire additional land or expand or improve existing recreational
facilities.
(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)
§ 7-3.6 PAVING AND STREET IMPROVEMENT.

the Division of Highways, North Carolina Department of Transportation,
Subdivision Roads, Minimum Construction Standards Manual, current edition.
   c.   Streets within the corporate limits shall be provided with curb and
gutter except where, at the option of the Town Council, engineering design
philosophy recommends against curb and gutter because environmental and storm
water controls would be best managed with other types of street design. The
town may require streets within the extraterritorial jurisdiction to have curb
and gutter.
   d.   The subdivider may be required to provide street/road(s) connection to
the property line to serve an adjacent tract of land for future development and
may be required to interconnect with an adjacent development’s road system.
   e.   The subdivider shall be responsible for the cost and installation of
the road foundation, paving and/or any other road improvements.
   f.   If a street has a potential for being a collector street, or minor
street, the Council may require the installation of traffic calming devices.

   a.   Municipal or community system. For subdivisions within the corporate
limits of the town, the subdivider shall connect to the sewer system of the
town in order to provide sewer service to every lot within the subdivision.
Sewer systems shall be designed and installed in accordance with Public
Utilities Handbook Technical Specifications Water/Sewer Improvements for the
Town of Newport, state and federal environmental rules and other such
specifications as may be required by the town.
   b.   Where it is necessary to construct sewage lift stations, the developer
shall also provide the necessary land. The station shall be floodproofed,
fenced and landscaped to the satisfaction of the town. The design of the
station not limited solely to the size of pumps, alarm system and the like,
shall be to the satisfaction of the town. All sewage lift stations shall be
provided with an auto-start, standby power generator of sufficient capacity to
operate the lift station during power outages. The fuel type and capacity will
be determined by the town. Should the developer desire to utilize an existing
lift station, the developer shall pay for any engineering and/or increased
capacity costs to the lift station, to include any new alarm system and an
auto-start standby power generator.
   c.   Individual disposal systems. Where the subdivision is not serviced by
the town or a community system, the individual disposal system shall be
approved by the County Environmental Health Department or appropriate state
agency. All proposed lots shall be evaluated for approval and a letter shall
indicate by lot number its potential for approval and where improvements will
be required for final approval.
(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)
§ 7-3.8 SIDEWALKS.
   Sidewalks shall be required along any street where considerable pedestrian
traffic is expected, as determined by the Town Planning Board or Town Council,

the dead end of cul-de-sacs and within 500 feet of each other. Public street
lighting fixture installation fees, if any, shall be paid by the developer.
Rental fees on the fixtures inside the town limits shall be paid by the town.
(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)
§ 7-3.10 STREET NAME MARKERS.
   a.   The developer shall provide street name markers at all subdivision
street intersections and at any other point within the subdivision deemed
necessary by the town. Approved regulation street name signage consists of
metal pipe poles with street names on metal plates. Material specifications,
attachment devices and coloration shall be those officially adopted for use by
the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
   b.   Use of non-regulation street signs.
      1.   The Town Council may approve non-regulation street signs where the
developer desires to use distinctive street signage as a tenant of initial
marketing and aesthetics design under the following conditions. The developer
will provide for the funding and eventual erection of regulation street name
signs.
      2.   Compliance options.
         a.   Prior to final approval, the developer may:
            1.   Deposit with the town the amount of money required to purchase
the regulation street signs necessary for the subdivision or phase for which
plat approval is required. The amount of money to be deposited with the town
shall be based on the estimated cost of materials as determined by the Town
Manager; or
            2.   Deliver to the Town Manager the poles, mounting apparatus and
street name plates required for the subdivision or phase for which plat
approval is required.
(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)
§ 7-3.11 TREES AND PRESERVATION OF NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.
   It is required that trees be planted in all subdivisions where there is a
lack of natural trees along the streets. The plan for tree planting shall be
submitted to the Planning Board at the time of presentation of the preliminary
plan. Trees planted should be located inside the property lines where they are
less subject to injury, decrease the chance of motor accidents and enjoy more
favorable conditions for growth. At least one tree planted every 30 lineal feet
along the front property line generally will be accepted. The size and type of
trees are specified in
Appendix A Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)
§ 7-3.12 SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROLS.
   a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage.
   b.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   d.   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivisions that

control permit from the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and
Community Development. In addition, the developer shall comply with other
conditions that may be more stringent as specified in this ordinance.
   f.   Surface water drainage shall not empty into a sanitary sewer. Where in
the opinion of the Planning Board a public storm water sewer is reasonably
accessible (within 100 feet of an existing storm water sewer and feasible from
an elevation viewpoint upon the recommendation of a registered engineer), and
before a subdivision is approved and accepted, the subdivider shall connect
with the public storm sewer system. He or she shall provide all grading and all
structures necessary to carry the water to the storm drainage system.
   g.   Where a storm drainage system is not accessible, the subdivider shall
do all grading and provide all drainage structures necessary to properly carry
the water to locations which are acceptable to the town.
   h.   When consistent with the minimum requirements of the Division of
Environmental Management for storm water controls, all drainage ditches shall
be paved, approved conduit construction and/or otherwise enclosed. Exceptions
that may be considered by the Town Council are:
      1.   Where good engineering data suggests and recommendations are made
not to enclose or pave;
      2.   Where an open ditch is to have side slopes of three to one or
greater, prove that vegetation can be maintained on the ditch slopes and it
will not become a high maintenance item;
      3.   Where an open ditch will not be an attractive nuisance; and
      4.   Where the open ditch will not adversely detract from the appearance
of the subdivision, such as the possibility of noxious weeds, snakes, vermin or
other nuisances.
   i.   Where the possibility exists for the subdivision drainage water to
adversely affect other drainage ditches down stream, such as to load the
ditches beyond their design capacity which may cause flooding or erosion, the
developer shall provide sufficient engineering study to determine the impact.
Where an adverse impact is determined to exist, as substantiated by the Town
Engineer and the Public Works Department, the subdivider shall mitigate, at his
or her expense, the drainage problem to the satisfaction of the town.

SECTION EIGHT: ADMINISTRATION
§ 8-1 VARIANCES.
   a.   Where topography or other existing physical conditions are such that
compliance with the requirements of this ordinance would cause unusual and
unnecessary hardship on the subdivider above and beyond what other subdividers
would meet, the minimum requirements as set forth in these regulations may be
varied by the Planning Board, provided that such variations will not have the
effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations.
   b.   The Town Council may approve subdivision plats which vary from the
requirements of design, but not from the requirements of procedure or
improvements, contained in this chapter upon the recommendation of the Planning
Board.
(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)
§ 8-2 EXCEPTIONS.
   The standards and requirements of this chapter may be modified by the
Planning Board and the Town Council in cases of a plan and program for a group,
cluster or planned unit development. Exceptions may be considered where in the
judgment of the Planning Board, adequate public spaces and improvements for the
circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully
developed and populated, are provided and such covenants or other legal
provisions as will assure conformity to any achievement of the land use plan
are imposed.
(Ord. passed 5-5-2009)

at the width specified in the plan.
   b.   If the Town Council has approved a comprehensive land use plan, which
has located sites for public schools, and a developer has submitted a
subdivision plan which includes one of these sites, the subdivider can be
required to reserve the land for such schools, provided that the school board
has indicated that it is interested in buying the land. The school board then
