(Ord. passed 10-21-2008)
DRUG TESTING POLICY
§ 33.20 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this policy is to provide all applicants for employment with
the Town Police Department with notice of the provisions of the department’s
drug testing program.
(Prior Code, § 33.20) (Ord. passed 11-19-1990)
§ 33.21 POLICY.
   (A)   Due to the critical mission of criminal justice officers and the
reliance by the citizens of the community upon this department for law
enforcement and general safety and protection, it is the policy of this
department to maintain a drug-free work environment through the use of an
applicant and lateral transferee testing program.
   (B)   The criminal justice profession has several uniquely compelling
interests that justify the implementation of a drug testing program. The public
has a right to expect that those who are sworn to protect them are at all times
both physically and mentally prepared to assume these duties. There is
sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of controlled substances and other
forms of drug abuse will seriously impair an employee’s physical and mental
health and, thus, job performance.
   (C)   Where criminal justice officers participate in illegal drug use and
drug activity, the integrity of the criminal justice profession and public
confidence in the profession are destroyed. This confidence is further eroded
by the potential for corruption created by illegal drug use. This department
has a compelling interest in ensuring that every criminal justice officer,
sworn to uphold the law, has unimpeachable integrity.
   (D)   This department also has a compelling interest in preventing any
unwarranted risk to the life of the citizens of the community posed by the
potential use of deadly force by armed officers suffering from impaired
perception and judgment.
   (E)   Local confinement personnel routinely have regular access to inmate
populations and are responsible for the general health, safety and security of
prisoners. These officers must work at “optimum mental and physical levels” in
order to effectively deal with and control prisoners, to prevent breaches of
the peace and/or escape and to prevent prisoners and others from smuggling
drugs, weapons or other contraband into the local confinement facility.
   (F)   This department places a great deal of trust and confidence in the
integrity and loyalty of each of its employees. Illegal drug use by employees
of this department evidences less than the complete reliability, stability and
good judgment that is consistent with law enforcement employees and creates the
possibility of coercion, influence and irresponsible action under pressure that
may pose a threat to effective enforcement of the law and maintenance of the
peace. Additionally, employees who use illegal drugs, on or off duty, tend to
be less productive, less reliable and prone to greater tardiness and
absenteeism than their fellow employees who do not use drugs.
   (G)   Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of this department, to
protect the citizens of this community, and to preserve public trust and
confidence in a fit and drug-free criminal justice profession, this department
shall implement a drug testing program. This program is designed to reduce the
likelihood that drug-dependent applicants and lateral transferees will be
employed by this department.
(Prior Code, § 33.21) (Ord. passed 11-19-1990)
§ 33.22 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPLICANT. A person, other than a lateral transferee, who applies for
employment or appointment as a criminal justice officer.
   CRIMINAL JUSTICE OFFICER. A sworn law enforcement officer with power of
arrest, and officers, supervisors and administrative personnel at local
confinement facilities.
   DRUG TEST. The compulsory production and submission of urine by an applicant
or lateral transferee in accordance with departmental procedures for chemical
analysis to detect drug use.
   LATERAL TRANSFEREE. A criminal justice officer who applies for employment or
appointment where the officer has previously held general certification and has
been separated by an agency in good standing or transferred to this agency, and
the officer has been separated from a criminal justice officer position for no
more than twelve months.
(Prior Code, § 33.22) (Ord. passed 11-19-1990)
§ 33.23 APPLICANT AND LATERAL TRANSFEREE DRUG TESTING; PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Applicants and lateral transferees applying for criminal justice
officer positions shall be required to take a drug test as a condition of
employment during the application process, but not more than 60 days prior to
the date of employment as a criminal justice officer.
   (B)   Applicants and lateral transferees shall be disqualified from further
consideration for employment under the following circumstances:
      (1)   Refusal to submit to a required drug test; or
      (2)   A confirmed positive drug test indicating drug use prohibited by
this policy.
(Prior Code, § 33.23) (Ord. passed 11-19-1990)
§ 33.24 SPECIMEN COLLECTION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The testing procedures and safeguards provided in this policy to
ensure the integrity of department drug testing shall be adhered to by all
personnel administering drug tests.
   (B)   The individual to be tested (hereinafter referred to as “donor”)
should be positively identified by presenting one of the following:
      (1)   North Carolina driver’s license;
      (2)   Division of Motor Vehicles Identification Card; and
      (3)   Other government-issued picture ID.
   (C)   The donor will be required to complete an Applicant Consent Form.
   (D)   The donor will have completed an Applicant Medication Information
Form.
   (E)   The room where the sample is to be obtained must have been checked to
ensure that it is private, secure and free of any foreign substance.
   (F)   A toilet bluing agent should be placed in the toilet bowl to ensure
that the donor does not use toilet water to dilute the specimen.
   (G)   The donor should be asked to remove any unnecessary outer garments
such as a coat or jacket.
   (H)   All personal belongings such as a purse or briefcase should be left
outside the collection room. A donor should be allowed to retain his or her
wallet.
   (I)   Donor should be instructed to wash and dry hands.
   (J)   Donor should be provided with a new and/or unadultered specimen
collection bottle/container. The donor should be instructed that a specimen of
60 milliliters or two ounces is necessary for urinalysis.
   (K)   Donor should be instructed that, while alone in the collection room,
he or she may not run any water, flush the toilet or handle anything else in
the room.
   (L)   Donor enters the collection room and the collector stands outside the
door. Collector should note on the urine specimen collection checklist if he or
she hears any unusual activity. If the donor runs water or flushes the toilet
while alone in the collection room, then the specimen is invalid and the
process must begin anew.
   (M)   Collector should receive the sample from the donor. Should the
specimen need to be transferred from the collection container to other
containers, the donor should make such transfer while under observation by the
collector. The specimen should be kept in full view of both the collector and
donor until it is sealed.
   (N)   Collector should check to see that a specimen of sufficient quantity
has been collected.
      (1)   Should a specimen of insufficient quantity be presented to the
collector, that specimen should be discarded and another specimen should be
collected in a new container.
      (2)   If a donor is unable to provide a specimen at that time, it is
recommended that the donor be given eight ounces of liquid (water, coffee, soft
drink) every 30 minutes. This should enable the donor to produce a sample
within two hours.
      (3)   The donor must stay at the collection site until a specimen of
sufficient quantity is obtained.
   (O)   If the specimen is of sufficient quantity, the collector should check
the temperature of the specimen. Temperature must fall between 90.5°F and
99.8°F and time from urination to temperature measurement shall not exceed four
minutes.
   (P)   Collector should inspect the specimen’s color and look for any signs
of contaminants. Any concerns should be noted on the urine specimen collection
checklist. Should there be reasonable suspicion that the donor tampered with
the specimen, the collector must notify the employing agency and send the
specimen to the laboratory for testing.
   (Q)   Collector should seal the specimen container and be sure that
appropriate identification is added to the container’s other label(s).
   (R)   Donor may now wash hands.
   (S)   Collector should see that the specimen is appropriately safeguarded
until such time as it is prepared for and delivered to the laboratory.
(Prior Code, § 33.24) (Ord. passed 11-19-1990)
§ 33.25 DRUG TESTING METHODOLOGY.
   (A)   The testing or processing phase shall consist of a two-step procedure:
      (1)   Initial screening test using an immunoassay testing method; and
      (2)   Confirmation test using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/
MS) method.
   (B)   When the lab receives a urine sample it will conduct an initial
screening test to check for the presence of illegal drugs. This initial
screening test involves using an immunoassay testing method.
   (C)   The drugs whose use shall be tested for shall include cannabis,
cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), opiates and amphetamines or their metabolites.
   (D)   The threshold levels established by the Department of Health and Human
Services for Federal Workplace Drug Testing programs are hereby adopted by
reference, and shall automatically include any later amendments and editions of
said adopted matter.
   (E)   The laboratory conducting the test must be certified for federal
workplace drug testing programs and must adhere to applicable federal rules,
regulations and guidelines pertaining to the handling, testing, storage and
preservation of samples.
   (F)   Should the initial test produce a positive result for the presence of
an illegal drug, the lab will automatically perform a second test. Known as a
confirmation test, the second screening involves using a technologically
different and more sensitive gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
testing method.
   (G)   The laboratory will report a test result as positive if, and only if,
both the initial test and the confirmation test show the presence of an illegal
drug.
   (H)   The laboratory will report all test results directly to the Medical
Review Officer.
(Prior Code, § 33.25) (Ord. passed 11-19-1990)
§ 33.26 MEDICAL REVIEW OFFICER.
   (A)   In order to provide the greatest extent possible for the privacy and
confidentiality of applicants who are required to submit to drug testing, all
laboratory results will be sent directly to the Medical Review Officer. All
specimens reported by the laboratory as negative will in turn be reported to
the agency by the Medical Review Officer as negative.
   (B)   With respect to confirmed positive results, the Medical Review
Officer:
      (1)   May conduct medical interviews with the applicant;
      (2)   May review applicant medical histories or any other biomedical
factors;
      (3)   Shall review all medical records made available by the tested
employee when a confirmed positive could have resulted from legally prescribed
medication; and
      (4)   May deem the results scientifically insufficient for further action
and declare the result to be negative based on a review of such data or facts
as he or she may deem appropriate.
(Prior Code, § 33.26) (Ord. passed 11-19-1990)
§ 33.27 CHAIN OF EVIDENCE; STORAGE.
   (A)   Each step in the collecting and processing of the urine specimens
shall be documented to establish procedural integrity and the chain of custody.
   (B)   Where a positive result is confirmed, urine specimens shall be
maintained by the laboratory in secured, refrigerated storage for an indefinite
period.
(Prior Code, § 33.27) (Ord. passed 11-19-1990)
§ 33.28 CONFIDENTIALITY OF TEST RESULTS.
   (A)   A positive result which the Medical Review Officer justifies by
appropriate medical or scientific documentation to account for the result as
other than the intentional ingestion of an illegal drug will be reported as a
negative result and may not be released for purposes of identifying illegal
drug use. Records of the Medical Review Officer shall only be released to the
agency head or appropriate agency coordinator and, when necessary, to the State
Criminal Justice Education and Training Standards Commission.
   (B)   All records and information of personnel actions taken on applicants
with verified positive test results shall be maintained in accordance with
state and local personnel policies and procedures.

COUNTY HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION
§ 34.20 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The historical heritage of the county is one of its most valued and
important assets. Conservation of historic districts and landmarks will
stabilize and increase the values in their areas and strengthen the overall
economy of the county and state.
   (B)   By means of listing, regulation and acquisition of historic districts
and landmarks, the county, Monroe, Indian Trail, Marshville, Stallings, Waxhaw,
Weddington and Wingate seek within their respective zoning jurisdictions:
      (1)   To safeguard its heritage by preserving any district or landmark
therein that embodies important elements of its culture, history, architectural
history or prehistory; and
      (2)   To promote the use and conservation of such district or landmark
for the education, pleasure and enrichment of the residents of the county and
state as a whole.
(Ord. passed 12-21-1992)
§ 34.21 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Creation.
      (1)   There is hereby established by authority of G.S. Chapter 160A,
Article 19, Part 3C, the County Joint Historic Preservation Commission,
hereafter referred to as the Historic Preservation Commission or Commission, to
consist of 13 members with four appointed by the County Commissioners, three
appointed by the Monroe City Council, and one appointed by the Town Councils of
each of Indian Trail, Marshville, Stallings, Waxhaw, Weddington and Wingate.
      (2)   The Historic Preservation Commission members shall serve without
monetary compensation. In establishing the Historic Preservation Commission and
making appointments to it, the above-named Board and Councils may seek the
advice of such state or local historical agencies, societies or organizations
as it may deem necessary.
   (B)   Joint ordinance.
      (1)   Pursuant to the provisions of state law, the county, the City of
Monroe, and the Towns of Indian Trail, Marshville, Stallings, Waxhaw,
Weddington and Wingate do hereby adopt this subchapter as a joint ordinance. It
is the intent of this subchapter that the county and each city or town
subscribing to this subchapter shall have complete control of all historic
districts or landmarks located within its incorporated municipal limits, at the
present and in the future, except to the extent that any functions are
specifically delegated to the Historic Preservation Commission. Any references
in this subchapter to all of the subscribing parties shall be construed to be
in the disjunctive rather than the conjunctive, it not being the intent of this
subchapter that any governmental entity have any authority beyond its municipal
limits. At the present time, the City of Monroe, and the Towns of Stallings,
Waxhaw and Weddington exercise zoning jurisdiction independent of the county.
The Towns of Indian Trail, Marshville and Wingate do not exercise independent
zoning jurisdiction, with all zoning matters within those towns being
administered by the county. To the extent that this subchapter requires acts to
be performed incident to a zoning ordinance, the county shall perform those
functions on behalf of Indian Trail, Marshville and Wingate, until such time as
those towns shall adopt their own zoning ordinances. It is the intent of this
subchapter that upon the adoption of zoning ordinances by Indian Trail,
Marshville and Wingate that those towns would assume full authority as to all
acts required under this subchapter.
      (2)   To the extent that any prior ordinances adopted by any governmental
entity is inconsistent with this subchapter, then such prior ordinances are
hereby repealed.
   (C)   Representation. All members of the Historic Preservation Commission
shall be residents of the county and each shall reside within the jurisdiction
of the Board or Council appointing them representative. A majority of the
members shall have demonstrated special interest, experience or education in
history, architecture, archaeology or related fields.
   (D)   Tenure. Members of the Historic Preservation Commission shall serve
overlapping terms of four years. Initially, two appointees by the county, and
one appointee each from Monroe, Indian Trail, Marshville and Stallings shall be
for two years. Thereafter, all appointments shall be for a term of four years.
A member may be reappointed for a second consecutive term, but after two
consecutive terms a member shall be ineligible for reappointment until one
calendar year has elapsed from the date of the termination of his or her second
term. Appointments to any vacancy shall be for the remainder of the term of the
vacant position for which the appointment is made. For purposes of
reappointment to the Historic Preservation Commission, an initial two-year
term, or serving the balance of an unexpired term of two years or less shall
not be considered to be one of the two consecutive terms, and such person would
be eligible to serve two consecutive full terms in addition to the partial
term.
   (E)   Attendance of meetings. Any member of the Historic Preservation
Commission who misses more than three consecutive regular meetings or one-half
the regular meetings in a calendar year without excuse granted by the Historic

the Historic Preservation Commission as well as any budget requests or
recommendations. The Historic Preservation Commission shall keep a record of
its members’ attendance, and of its resolutions, findings and recommendations,
which record shall be a public record.
   (H)   Quorum and vote required for recommendation. Seven members of the
Historic Preservation Commission shall constitute a quorum. The concurrence of
at least a majority of those members present will be required before any
recommendation or action is made on any matter considered.
   (I)   Private interest of members. No member of the Historic Preservation
Commission may discuss, advocate or vote on any matter in which he or she has a
separate, private or monetary interest, either direct or indirect, and no
member may discuss before a governing Board or Council any matter which has
been, is, or will be considered by the Historic Preservation Commission on
which he or she serves, and in which he or she has a separate, private or

and districts within its jurisdiction;
      (7)   Cooperate with the state, federal and local governments in

(Ord. passed 12-21-1992)
§ 34.22 DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Adoption of an ordinance of designation of an Historic District. Upon
compliance with the procedures set out in division (C) below, the County Board
of Commissioners, the Monroe City Council, or the Indian Trail, Marshville,
Stallings, Waxhaw, Weddington or the Wingate Town Councils may as part of a
zoning or other ordinance enacted or amended pursuant to this subchapter
designate and from time to time amend one or more historic districts within the
area subject to the ordinance. Such ordinance may treat historic districts
either as a separate use district classification or as districts which overlay
other zoning districts. Where historic districts are designated as separate use
districts, the zoning ordinance may include as uses by right or as conditional
or special uses those uses found by the Historical Preservation Commission to
have existed during the period sought to be restored or preserved, or to be
compatible with the restoration or preservation of the district.
   (B)   Definition of character of an Historic District. Historic Districts
established pursuant to this subchapter shall consist of areas which are deemed
and found by the Historic Preservation Commission to be of special significance
in terms of their history, prehistory architecture and/or culture, and to
possess integrity of design, setting, materials, feeling and association.
   (C)   Required procedures.
      (1)   No historic district or districts shall be designated until:
         (a)   An investigation and report describing the significance of the
buildings, structures, features, sites or surroundings included in any such
proposed district, and a description of the boundaries of such district has
been prepared; and
         (b)   The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State
Historic Preservation Officer or his or her designee, shall have made an
analysis of and recommendations concerning such report and description of
proposed boundaries. Failure of the department to submit its written analysis
and recommendations to the governing board within 30 calendar days after a
written request for such analysis has been received by the Department of
Cultural Resources shall relieve the governing board of any responsibility for
awaiting such analysis, and said board may at any time thereafter take any
necessary action to adopt or amend its zoning ordinance.
      (2)   The governing board may also, in its discretion, refer the report
and the proposed boundaries to any other interested body for its recommendation
prior to taking action to amend the zoning ordinance. With respect to any
changes in the boundaries of such district subsequent to its initial
establishment, or the creation of additional districts within the jurisdiction,
the investigative studies and reports required by division (C)(1)(a) above
shall be prepared by the commission and shall be referred to the local planning
agency for its review and comment according to procedures set forth in the
zoning ordinance. Changes in the boundaries of an initial district or proposal
for additional districts shall also be submitted to the Department of Cultural
Resources in accordance with the provisions of division (C)(1)(b) above.
      (3)   On receipt of these reports and recommendations, the governing
board may proceed in the same manner as would otherwise be required for the
adoption or amendment of any appropriate zoning ordinance provisions.
(Ord. passed 12-21-1992)
§ 34.23 DESIGNATION OF LANDMARKS.
   (A)   Adoption of an ordinance of designation of landmarks.
      (1)   Upon complying with the landmark designation procedures as set
forth in this subchapter, the County Board of Commissioners, the Monroe City
Council, or the Indian Trail, Marshville, Stallings, Waxhaw, Weddington or
Wingate Town Councils may adopt and from time to time amend or repeal an
ordinance designating one or more historic landmarks. No property shall be
recommended for designation as a landmark unless it is deemed and found by the
Historic Preservation Commission to be of special significance in terms of its
historical, prehistorical, architectural or cultural importance and to possess
integrity of design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling and/or
association.
      (2)   The ordinance shall describe each property designated in the
ordinance, the name or names of the owner or owners of the property, those
elements of the property that are integral to its historical, architectural or
prehistorical value, including the land areas of the property so designated and
any other information the governing board deems necessary. For each building,
structure, site, area or object so designated as a historic landmark, the
ordinance shall require that the waiting period set forth in G.S. Part 3C be
observed prior to its demolition. For each designated landmark, the ordinance
may also provide for a suitable sign on the property indicating that the
property has been so designated. If the owner consents, the sign shall be
placed upon the property. If an owner objects, the sign shall be placed on a
nearby public right-of-way.
   (B)   Inventory of landmarks. As a guide for the identification and
evaluation of landmarks, the Historic Preservation Commission shall undertake
at the earliest possible time and consistent with the resources available to it
an inventory of properties of historical, architectural, prehistorical and
cultural significance within its jurisdiction. Such inventories and any
additions or revisions thereof shall be submitted as expeditiously as possible
to the Division of Archives and History.
   (C)   Required procedures. No ordinance designating a historic building,
structure, site, area or object as a landmark nor any amendment thereto may be
adopted, nor may any property be accepted or acquired by the Historic
Preservation Commission or the County Board of Commissioners, the Monroe City
Council, or the Indian Trail, Marshville, Stallings, Waxhaw, Weddington or Town
Councils until all of the following procedural steps have been taken.
      (1)   The Historic Preservation Commission shall prepare and adopt rules
of procedure and principles and guidelines for altering, restoring, moving or
demolishing properties designated as landmarks.
      (2)   The Historic Preservation Commission shall make or cause to be made
an investigation and report on the historic, architectural, prehistorical,
educational or cultural significance of each building, structure, site, area or
object proposed for designation or acquisition. The investigation and report
shall be forwarded to the Division of Archives and History, North Carolina
Department of Cultural Resources.
      (3)   The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State
Historic Preservation Officer, shall either upon request of the department or
at the initiative of the Historic Preservation Commission be given an
opportunity to review and comment upon the substance and effect of the
designation of any landmark. Comments shall be provided in writing within 30
days following receipt by the Department of the investigation and report. The
County Board of Commissioners, the Monroe City Council, or the Indian Trail,
Marshville, Stallings, Waxhaw, Weddington or Wingate Town Councils shall be
relieved of any responsibility to consider Department comments if such comments
are not received within 30 days.
      (4)   The owner of the property proposed to be designated as a “landmark”
shall have filed an application with the Historic Preservation Commission
requesting that the property be designated as a landmark.
      (5)   The Historic Preservation Commission and the local Board or Council
shall hold a joint public hearing or separate public hearings on the proposed
ordinance. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the public hearing shall be
mailed to all adjoining property owners (including the owners of properties
located across any street or road from the property proposed to be a
“landmark”) at least two weeks prior to the hearing, by first class mail.
Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper having general
circulation in the area once a week for two successive weeks, the first notice
to be published not less than ten days nor more than 25 days prior to the date
established for the hearing. In computing such time, the date of publication is
not to be included, but the date of the hearing shall be included.
      (6)   Following the public hearing, the local board or council may adopt
the ordinance as proposed, adopt the ordinance with any amendments it deems
necessary, or reject the proposed ordinance.
      (7)   Upon adoption of the ordinance, the owners and occupants of each
designated landmark shall be given written notification of such designation
insofar as reasonable diligence permits. One copy of the ordinance and all
amendments thereto shall be filed by the Historic Preservation Commission in
the office of the Register of Deeds for the county. Each designated landmark
shall be indexed according to the name of the owner of the property in the
grantee and grantor indexes in the Register of Deeds office. The Historic
Preservation Commission shall pay a reasonable fee for filing and indexing. In
case of any property lying in the county, a second copy of the ordinance and
all amendments thereto shall be kept on file in the office of the County Clerk
and shall be available for public inspection at any reasonable time. In case of
any property lying within the cities or municipalities of Monroe, Indian Trail,
Marshville, Stallings, Waxhaw, Weddington or Wingate, a second copy of the
ordinance and each amendment thereto shall be kept on file in the Office of the
City or Town Clerk, and be made available for public inspection at any
reasonable time. A third copy of the ordinance and all amendments thereto shall
be given to the County Building Inspector. The fact that a building, structure,
site, area or building has been designated a landmark shall be clearly
indicated on all tax maps maintained by the county for such time as the
designation remains in effect.
      (8)   Upon the adoption of the landmarks ordinance or any amendment
thereto, it shall be the duty of the Historic Preservation Commission to give
notice thereof to the tax supervisor of the county. The designation and any
recorded restrictions upon the property limiting its use for preservation
purposes shall be considered by the tax supervisor in appraising it for tax
purposes.
(Ord. passed 12-21-1992)
§ 34.24 ALTERATION OR DEMOLITION OF DESIGNATED LANDMARK OR HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   (A)   Certificate of appropriateness.
      (1)   From and after the designation of a landmark or a historic
district, no exterior portion of any building or other structure (including
masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant
features), nor any above-ground utility structure nor any type of outdoor
advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished on
such landmark (or within such district) until after an application for a
certificate of appropriateness as to exterior features has been submitted to
and approved by the commission. Such a certificate is required to be issued by
the Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit or other permit
granted for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving or demolishing
structures, which certificate may be issued subject to reasonable conditions
necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. A certificate of
appropriateness shall be required whether or not a building or other permit is
required.
      (2)   For purposes of this subchapter, EXTERIOR FEATURES shall include
the architectural style, general design and general arrangement of the exterior
of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the
building material, the size and scale of the building, and the type and style
of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and other appurtenant features. In
the case of outdoor advertising signs, EXTERIOR FEATURES shall be construed to
mean the style, material, size and location of all such signs. Such “exterior
features” may, in the discretion of the County Board of Commissioners, the
Monroe City Council, or the Indian Trail, Marshville, Stallings, Waxhaw,
Weddington or Wingate Town Councils include historic signs, color and
significant landscape, archaeological and natural features of the area.
      (3)   Except as provided in division (B) below, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall have no jurisdiction over interior arrangement and shall take
no action under this section, except to prevent the construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of buildings,
structures, appurtenant features, outdoor advertising signs or other
significant features in the district or of the landmark which would be
incongruous with the special character of the landmark or district.
   (B)   Limitation on jurisdiction over interior spaces. Notwithstanding
division (A) above, the jurisdiction of the Historic Preservation Commission
over interior spaces shall be limited to specific interior features of
architectural, artistic or historical significance in publicly owned landmarks;
and of privately owned historic landmarks for which consent for interior review
has been given by the owner. Said consent of any owner for interior review
shall bind future owners and/or successors in title, provided such consent has
been filed in the office of the Register of Deeds of the county and indexed
according to the name of the owner of the property in the grantee and grantor
indexes. The landmark designation shall specify the interior features to be
reviewed and the specific nature of the Historic Preservation Commission’s
jurisdiction over the interior.
   (C)   Application for certificate of appropriateness. An application for a
certificate of appropriateness shall be obtained from the Historic Preservation
Commission, and when completed, filed with the Historic Preservation
Commission.
   (D)   Contents of an application for certificate of appropriateness. The
application for a certificate of appropriateness shall, in accordance with the
Historic Preservation Commission’s rules of procedure, contain data that is
reasonably necessary to determine the nature of the application. An application
for a certificate of appropriateness shall not be considered complete until all
required data has been submitted.
   (E)   Time for hearing applications of certificate of appropriateness.
Applications shall be considered by the Historic Preservation Commission at its
next regular meeting, provided they have been filed, complete in form and
content, at least 30 calendar days before the regularly scheduled meeting of
the Commission. Otherwise, they shall be deferred until the next meeting or
considered at a special called meeting of the Commission. Nothing shall prevent
the applicant from filing with the application additional relevant information
bearing on the application.
   (F)   Notification by Historic Preservation Commission of Affected Property
Owners. Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness,
the Historic Preservation Commission shall notify the owners of any property
likely to be materially affected by the application, in writing at least ten
days before the regularly scheduled meeting at which the application is to be
heard. Notice to property owners likely to be materially affected by the
application shall include all adjoining property owners and the owners of
properties located across any roadway from the affected property. Such owners
shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
   (G)   Public hearing. When an application for a certificate of
appropriateness is presented to the Historic Preservation Commission a public
hearing shall be held. All meetings of the commission shall be open to the
public in accordance with the North Carolina Open Meetings Law, G.S. Chapter
143, Article 33C.
   (H)   Action on an application for a certificate of appropriateness.
      (1)   The action on an application for a certificate of appropriateness
shall be approval, approval with modification or denial.
      (2)   Prior to any final action on an application the review criteria in
division (I) below shall be used to make findings of fact indicating the extent
to which the application for a certificate of appropriateness is or is not
congruous with the historic aspects of the district or landmark.
      (3)   All applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be
reviewed and acted upon within a reasonable time as defined by the rules of
procedure, and not exceeding 60 days from the date the application is filed. As
part of its review procedure the commission may view the premises and seek the
advice of the Department of Cultural Resources or other such experts as it may
deem necessary under the circumstances.
   (I)   Review criteria for certificates of appropriateness.
      (1)   It is the intent of these criteria, and the design guidelines, to
insure, insofar as possible, that changes to a designated landmark (or
structures in a historic district) shall be in harmony with the reasons for
designation.
      (2)   When considering a certificate of appropriateness the Historic
Preservation Commission shall take into account the historic or architectural
significance of the structure under consideration and the exterior form and
appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that structure, as
well as the effect of such change or additions upon other structures in the
vicinity. In a historic district it is not the intention of these criteria or
the guidelines to require the reconstruction or restoration of individual or
original buildings or prohibit the demolition or removal of same or to impose
architectural styles from particular historic period. In considering new
construction in a historic district the Historic Preservation Commission shall
encourage contemporary design which is harmonious with the character of the
district.
      (3)   The following criteria shall be considered, when relevant, along
with companion design guidelines and the guidelines of the Secretary of the
Interior in reviewing for a certificate of appropriateness:
         (a)   Lot coverage, defined as the percentage of lot area covered by
primary structures;
         (b)   Setback, defined as the distance from the lot lines to the
building(s);
         (c)   Building height;
         (d)   Spacing of buildings, defined as the distance between adjacent
buildings;
         (e)   Building materials;
         (f)   Proportion, shape, positioning, location, pattern and sizes of
any elements of fenestration;
         (g)   Surface textures;
         (h)   Roof shapes, form and materials;
         (i)   Use of local or regional architectural traditions;
         (j)   General form and proportions of buildings and structures, and
relationship of any additions to the main structure;
         (k)   Expression of architectural detailing, such as lintels,
cornices, brick bond and decorative elements;
         (l)   Orientation of the building to the street;
         (m)   Scale, determined by the size of the units of construction and
architectural details in relation to the human scale and also by the
relationship of the building mass to adjoining open space and nearby buildings
and structures;
         (n)   Proportion of width to height of the total building facade;
         (o)   Archaeological sites and resources associated with standing
structures;
         (p)   Major landscaping efforts that would impact known archaeological
sites;
         (q)   Appurtenant features and other features such as lighting; and
         (r)   Structural condition and soundness.
   (J)   Minor work. A certificate of appropriateness application when
determined to involve minor work, may be reviewed and approved by an
administrative official according to specific review criteria and guidelines.
MINOR WORK is defined as those exterior changes that do not involve substantial
alterations, additions or removals that could impair the integrity of the
property (and/or the district as a whole). Such minor works shall be limited to
those listed in the Commission’s rules of procedure. No application involving a
minor work may be denied without the formal action of the Historic Preservation
Commission.
   (K)   Certain changes not prohibited.
      (1)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent the
ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature of a
historic landmark or in a historic district which does not involve a change in
design, materials or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration or demolition of any such feature which
the Building Inspector or similar official shall certify is required by the
public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Nothing herein shall
be construed to prevent a property owner from making any use of his property
not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.
      (2)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent the
maintenance or in the event of an emergency, the immediate restoration of any
existing above-ground utility structure without approval by the Commission.
   (L)   Appeals. An appeal may be taken to the appropriate Board of Adjustment
from the Historic Preservation Commission’s action in granting or denying any
certificate. Appeals from decisions of the Historic Preservation Commission for
properties lying in the towns having no Board of Adjustments shall lie to the
County Board of Adjustment. The appeals may be taken by any aggrieved party,
shall be taken within times prescribed by the commission in the rules of
procedure, and shall be in the nature of certiorari. Any appeal from the
appropriate Board of Adjustment’s decision in any such case shall be heard by
the Superior Court of the county.
   (M)   Submission of new applications. If a certificate of appropriateness is
denied, a new application affecting the same property may be submitted only if
substantial change is made in plans for the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration or moving.
(Ord. passed 12-21-1992)
§ 34.25 DELAY IN DEMOLITION OF LANDMARKS AND BUILDINGS WITHIN HISTORIC
DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Delay by Historic Preservation Commission.
      (1)   An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the
demolition or destruction of a designated landmark or a building, structure or
site within the district may not be denied, except as provided in division (C)
below; however, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for a
period of up to 180 days from the date of approval.
      (2)   The maximum period of delay authorized this section shall be
reduced by the Historic Preservation Commission where it finds that the owner
would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use
or return from such property by virtue of the delay.
      (3)   During such period, the Historic Preservation Commission shall
negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a
means of preserving the buildings or site. If the Historic Preservation
Commission finds that a building or site within the historic district has no
special significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district,
it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or
removal.
   (B)   Delay Pending Designation as District or Landmark. If the Historic
Preservation Commission has voted to recommend designation of a property
proposed by an owner to be so designated as a landmark or designation of an
area as a district, and final designation has not been made by the County Board

sanitary sewers whenever, in the opinion of the Board of Commissioners, such
action is necessary for the purpose of determining the effect of such wastes
upon the sewers, sewage treatment works or sewage treatment plants.
(Prior Code, § 51.65) (Ord. passed - -)
§ 51.071 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   (A)   The volume of flow used in computing industrial waste surcharges shall
be based upon metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter
reading maintained by the Public Works Department. In the event that a person
discharging wastes into the sanitary sewer system produces evidence to the
Approving Authority that more than 10% of the total annual volume of water used
for all purposes does not reach the town sanitary sewer, an estimated
percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be
agreed upon between the Approving Authority and the persons discharging
industrial wastes into said sewer.
   (B)   Where the person discharging industrial wastes into the sanitary
sewers of the town procures any part or all of his or her water supply from
sources other than the Public Works Department, all or part of which is
discharged into the sanitary sewer, the person discharging said waste shall
install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a type approved by
the Approving Authority for the purpose of determining the proper volume of
flow to be charged.
(Prior Code, § 51.66) (Ord. passed - -)
§ 51.072 DETERMINING OF CHARACTER AND CONCENTRATION OF WASTES.
   (A)   The industrial waste of each person discharging same into the town
sanitary sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and a determination of
character and concentration of said wastes shall be made quarterly, or as often
as may be deemed necessary by the Approving Authority or his authorized
assistants.
   (B)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of
the actual quality of the wastes. The laboratory methods used in the
examination of said wastes shall be those set forth in the most recent edition
of “Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage”, as published by
the American Public Health Association, dated 1971, a copy of which is on file
with the Town Clerk for inspection by any interested parties.
   (C)   The determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastes by the Approving Authority or his authorized assistants shall be binding
as a basis for charges.
   (D)   Total costs incident to the supervision, inspection, sampling and
analyzing of wastes shall be included in the surcharge made to persons
discharging wastes into the town sanitary sewers.
(Prior Code, § 51.67) (Ord. passed - -)
§ 51.073 SURCHARGE FOR TREATMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (A)   Explanation of surcharges. All persons discharging industrial wastes
into the town sanitary sewer system shall be rendered a monthly bill as a
surcharge covering the entire costs to the town incurred by treating all wastes
having a B.O.D. in excess of 250 parts per million by weight. Said surcharge
shall be evoked as herein provided in addition to any sewer charge imposed
after the adoption of this subchapter (effective date, January 30, 1973). The
aforesaid surcharge shall include:
      (1)   All fixed charges and amortization costs of additional plant
capacity required for treating said industrial wastes; and
      (2)   A charge covering the cost incurred to the town in treating said
wastes in the municipal sewage treatment plants.
   (B)   Amount of surcharge. A surcharge per 1,000 pounds of biochemical
oxygen demand, from time to time to be determined by the Board of
Commissioners, shall be made to cover the fixed charges and amortization cost
of additional plant capacity as hereinbefore described (see division (A)(1)
above).
   (C)   Procedure. The surcharge covering the costs of the treatment (see
division (A)(2) above) of said industrial wastes shall be arrived at in the
following manner: the Board of Commissioners shall fix the rate to be charged
during the new fiscal year at the beginning of said fiscal year for the weight
of biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 250 parts per million which is
discharged into the town sanitary sewers. This rate shall be computed from the
actual costs per 1,000 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand removed from the
combined sewage and industrial wastes as experienced at the municipal treatment
plants during the preceding fiscal year.
   (D)   Billed. The combined surcharge, as set forth in divisions (B) and (C)
above, shall be billed and payable monthly on a separate bill rendered to the
proper persons by the Public Works Department.
      (1)   Said bills will be sent through the United States mail notifying
all persons of the amount and date due. Failure to receive notice is not an
excuse for nonpayment of bills.
      (2)   Persons not having paid their bill within ten days of the date of
billing will be delinquent. Notice shall be sent them through the United States
mail, and if after five days notice, given as above, the bills remain unpaid,
the water connection serving the premises will be severed and will not be
turned on again until said bill is paid.
      (3)   In case a person discharging wastes into the town sanitary sewer
system does not procure his or her water supply from the town and becomes
delinquent in his or her payment of the aforesaid surcharge, his or her
connection with the town sewer system will be severed and will only be
reconnected at his or her expense.
(Prior Code, § 51.68) (Ord. passed - -)
§ 51.074 PROTECTION FROM DAMAGES.
   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any equipment or materials
belonging to the town used for the purpose of making tests or examinations and
left upon the premises of a person discharging wastes into the sewers.
(Prior Code, § 51.69) (Ord. passed - -) Penalty, see §
51.999
§ 51.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provisions of this chapter for which no other
penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §

   (B)   Whoever violates any provision of §
51.031 shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor, and shall be fined not more
than $500, or imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Each day that this section
is violated shall be a separate and distinct offense.
   (C)   (1)   Penalty.
         (a)   Violation of any provision of §
51.032 may subject the offender to a civil penalty to be recovered by the town
in a civil action in the nature of debt if the offender does not pay the
penalty within 30 days after the assessment has become final by exhaustion of
the appeal process established by §
51.032, or by failure to appeal the assessment.
         (b)   The civil penalty for violation of any provision of §
51.032 shall not exceed $500 per day for each day of continuous violation, or a
cumulative or single civil penalty of $10,000. The civil penalty for willful
violation of any provision of §
51.032 shall not exceed $1,000 per day for each day of a continuous violation,
or a cumulative or single civil penalty of $20,000.
      (2)   Assessment. Any civil penalty shall be assessed by the Town
Manager, upon the recommendation of the person in responsible charge, and shall
be based upon the reasonable estimated cost of correcting the cited violation,
the magnitude of the potential risk posed to the public health, safety and
welfare by the violation, and the cost of the public safety or other emergency
response caused by the violation. The Town Manager shall serve written notice
of the civil penalty assessment to the offender and set out with reasonable
care the basis of the amount so assessed.
      (3)   Equitable relief. An appropriate equitable remedy, including a
mandatory or prohibitory injunction, issued from a court of competent
jurisdiction may endorse the provisions of §
51.032.
      (4)   Enforcement option. The penalties and enforcement provisions
established by this division may be applied in addition to or instead of the
penalties established by other sections of this code.
   (D)   The violation of §§
51.020 through
51.031 and §§
51.045 through
51.051 shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine not
exceeding $50 or by imprisonment not exceeding 30 days as provided in G.S. §
14-4.

§ 52.01 PURPOSE.
   Water conservation is deemed to be necessary when water demand by customers
connected to the town water system reaches the point where continued or
increased demand will equal or exceed the treatment and/or transmission
capacity of the system. When water demand results in the condition whereby
customers cannot be supplied with adequate water to protect their health,
safety or property, then the demand must be substantially curtailed to relieve
the water shortage.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008)
§ 52.02 DECLARATION OF WATER SHORTAGE.
   (A)   In the event it appears there is a sustained demand of 80% of the town
water system treatment and/or transmission capacity (average daily flow); or
Duke Power Company LLC, doing business as Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, declares
a Stage 1 Low Inflow Condition pursuant to the Comprehensive Relicensing
Agreement for the Catawba-Wateree Hydro Project (FERC Project No. 2232) dated
December 22, 2006, to which the town’s water supplier, the county, is a party,
thus compelling certain voluntary water use restrictions by the county, then in
either such event the Director of the Town Public Works Department, hereinafter
referred to as the “Director”, may recommend to the Town Manager that voluntary
water conservation measures be implemented. The Town Manager, following
consultation with the Board of Commissioners, may declare a Stage I Voluntary
Water Shortage Condition requesting voluntary water conservation by consumers.
The Town Manager, following consultation with the Board of Commissioners, may,
with or without the recommendation of the Director, declare that a Stage II,
Stage III or Stage IV Mandatory Water Shortage Condition exists and require
mandatory conservation measures upon occurrence of any conditions precedent for
declaring such Condition, as hereinafter set forth. In declaring any Water
Shortage Condition pursuant to this chapter, the Town Manager may limit the
applicability of the requirements of this chapter to certain sections of the
town. For purposes of this chapter, the phrase “following consultation with the
Board of Commissioners” shall mean consultation during a regular or special
meeting of the Board of Commissioners when possible, but where delay would
endanger the public health, safety or welfare, as determined by the Town
Manager, such consultation may be made by the Town Manager with members of the
Board of Commissioners on an individual basis outside the confines of a formal
meeting. The Town Manager shall report the declaration of a Water Shortage
Condition to the Board of Commissioners at its next regular meeting.
   (B)   The declaration of a Water Shortage Condition becomes effective
immediately upon issuance by the Town Manager. Upon declaration of any stage of
Water Shortage Condition, the Town Manager shall issue press releases to local
television, radio and/or print media to inform the public of the voluntary or
mandatory water use restrictions. Upon declaration of a Stage II, Stage III or
Stage IV Mandatory Water Shortage Condition, the Town Manager shall also cause
notice of such restrictions to be either inserted into customers’ water bills
or separately mailed to customers as soon as reasonably practicable.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008)
§ 52.03 STAGE I VOLUNTARY WATER SHORTAGE CONDITION.
   (A)   In the event a Stage I Voluntary Water Shortage Condition is declared,
the following guidelines shall apply.
      (1)   An extensive publicity campaign will be initiated using public
media to inform the public of an impending or existing water shortage.
      (2)   Conservation measures will be encouraged and recommended.
   (B)   In the event a Stage I Voluntary Water Shortage Condition is declared,
the following guidelines shall apply, and the public shall be encouraged to
adhere to the following:
      (1)   Limit car washing to the minimum;
      (2)   Limit lawn and garden watering to that which is necessary for
plants to survive;
      (3)   Do not wash down outside areas such as sidewalks, patios, parking
lots, service bays or aprons and the like;
      (4)   Do not leave faucets running while shaving or rinsing dishes;
      (5)   Water shrubbery to the minimum required, reusing household water
when possible;
      (6)   Limit use of clothes washers and dish washers and when used,
operate fully loaded;
      (7)   Use of showers for bathing, rather than bathtub, and limit showers
to no more than four minutes;
      (8)   Limit flushing of toilets by multiple usage;
      (9)   The use of disposable and biodegradable dishes is encouraged;
      (10)   The use of flow-restrictive and water-saving devices is
encouraged;
      (11)   Limit hours of operation of water-cooled air conditioners;
      (12)   All residents, businesses and institutions are requested to
temporarily delay new landscape work until the water shortage has ended; and
      (13)   Use only hoses with spring-activated nozzles when watering lawns
and gardens.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 52.04 STAGE II MANDATORY WATER SHORTAGE CONDITION.
   (A)   In the event the Town Manager issues a declaration of a Stage II
Mandatory Water Shortage Condition, then it shall be unlawful for any person,
firm or corporation to use or permit the use of water from the town water
system in a manner inconsistent with the declaration until such time as the
declaration of a Stage II Mandatory Water Shortage Condition has been
rescinded. In exercising the authority for declaring a Stage II Mandatory Water
Shortage Condition, consideration shall be given, as applicable, to water
shortage levels and available sources of supply, available usable storage on
hand, drawn-down rates, the projected supply capability, outlook for
precipitation, daily water use patterns and availability of water from other
sources.
   (B)   In the event a Stage I Voluntary Water Shortage Condition declaration
is ineffective in adequately reducing demand; maintenance of the system
(whether preventive or breakdown maintenance, or due to an event of force
majeure) requires a reduction in demand; mandatory restrictions are required to
comply with any permit for the system issued by applicable state or federal
authorities; sustained water demand exceeds 95% of the county water system
treatment and/or transmission capacity (average daily flow); or Duke Power
Company LLC, doing business as Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, declares a Stage 2
Low Inflow Condition pursuant to the Comprehensive Relicensing Agreement for
the Catawba- Wateree Hydro Project (FERC Project No. 2232) dated December 22,
2006, to which the county is a party, thus compelling certain mandatory water
use restrictions by town, then upon occurrence of any such event the Town
Manager may issue a declaration that a Stage II Mandatory Water Shortage
Condition exists. Such declaration may prohibit any one or more of the types of
water uses regulated under a Stage I, Stage III or Stage IV Water Shortage
Condition, provided that the Town Manager , in his or her discretion and acting
in the best interests of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens, may
further regulate usage on the following bases: time of day; day of week;
customer type, including without limitation, residential, commercial,
industrial and institutional; and physical attribute, such as address. After
consultation with the Board of Commissioners, the Town Manager may also take
such other measures as deemed necessary to give effect to the intent of this
chapter.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 52.05 STAGE III MANDATORY WATER SHORTAGE CONDITION.
   (A)   In the event the Town Manager issues a declaration of a Stage III
Mandatory Water Shortage Condition, then it shall be unlawful for any person,
firm or corporation to use or permit the use of water from the Town of Wingate
water system for any purpose hereinafter set forth until such time as the
declaration of a Stage III Mandatory Water Shortage Condition has been
rescinded. In exercising the authority for declaring a Stage III Mandatory
Water Shortage Condition, consideration shall be given, as applicable, to water
shortage levels and available sources of supply, available usable storage on
hand, drawn-down rates, the projected supply capability, outlook for
precipitation, daily water use patterns and availability of water from other
sources.
   (B)   In the event a Stage II Mandatory Water Shortage Condition is in
effect and the system demand still exceeds system capacity; or Duke Power
Company LLC, doing business as Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, declares a Stage 3
Low Inflow Condition pursuant to the Comprehensive Relicensing Agreement for
the Catawba-Wateree Hydro Project (FERC Project No. 2232) dated December
22,2006, to which the county is a party, thus compelling certain mandatory
water use restrictions by the county, then in either such event a Stage III
Mandatory Water Shortage Condition may be declared. In addition to any
voluntary and mandatory guidelines already in effect, it shall be unlawful to
use water supplied by the town water system in the following manner:
      (1)   To water lawns; provided that shrubbery, trees, flowers and
vegetable gardens may be watered by hand or by drip irrigation;
      (2)   To conduct residential vehicle washing;
      (3)   To wash public buildings, sidewalks and streets, except as required
for safety and/or to maintain regulatory compliance;
      (4)   To use water for dust control during construction;
      (5)   To conduct flushing or hydrant testing programs, except to maintain
water quality or other special circumstances approved by the Director in
advance;
      (6)   To fill new swimming pools; and
      (7)   To serve drinking water in restaurants, cafeterias or other food
establishments, except upon request.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 52.06 STAGE IV MANDATORY WATER SHORTAGE CONDITION.
   (A)   In the event the Town Manager issues a declaration of a Stage IV
Mandatory Water Shortage Condition, then it shall be unlawful for any person,
firm or corporation to use or permit the use of water from the town water
system for any purpose hereinafter set forth until such time as the declaration
of water shortage has been rescinded. In exercising the authority for declaring
a water shortage condition, consideration shall be given, as applicable, to
water storage levels and available sources of supply, available usable storage
on hand, draw-down rates, the projected supply capability, outlook for
precipitation, daily water use patterns and availability of water from other
sources.
   (B)   In the event: a Stage III Mandatory Water Shortage Condition exists
and the system demand still exceeds system capacity; or Duke Power Company LLC,
doing business as Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, declares a Stage 4 Low Inflow
Condition pursuant to the Comprehensive Relicensing Agreement for the Catawba-
Wateree Hydro Project (FERC Project No. 2232) dated December 22, 2006, to which
the county is a party, thus compelling certain mandatory water use restrictions
by the county, then in either such event a Stage IV Mandatory Water Shortage
Condition may be declared. In addition to the restrictions for Stage I, Stage
II and Stage III Water Shortage Conditions, the following restrictions shall
also apply:
      (1)   To induce water into any pool;
      (2)   Use water outside a structure for any use other than an emergency
involving a fire;
      (3)   Fire protection to be maintained by drafting of ponds, rivers and
the like, wherever possible;
      (4)   The use of throw-away utensils and plates is encouraged and
recommended at all eating establishments;
      (5)   To operate an evaporative air conditioner which recycles water
except during operating hours of business; and
      (6)   Use potable water for road construction practices, i.e., compaction
and washing.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008)
§ 52.07 LIFTING OF RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED.
   During a water shortage:
   (A)   Water shortage conditions will expire when the Town Manager, after
consultation with the Board of Commissioners and, upon recommendation of the
Director, deems that the condition which caused the water shortage condition
has abated; and
   (B)   The expiration or cancellation of a water shortage declaration shall
be promptly and extensively publicized.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008)
§ 52.08 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be enforced by
personnel of the Town Public Works Department, hereinafter referred to as
“WPW”, independent contractors engaged by WPW for such purpose, and such other
personnel as designated by the Town Manager.
   (B)   The use of water from the town water system by a customer in violation
of any mandatory water conservation control imposed pursuant to this chapter is
unlawful. For purposes of this chapter, the term CUSTOMER shall mean any person
or entity in whose name the town maintains an account for water use. Further,
the refusal or failure of a customer or other person acting on the customer’s
behalf to cease immediately a violation of a water conservation control, after
being directed to do so by a person authorized to enforce the provisions of
this chapter, is unlawful. Each customer is responsible for any use of water
that passes through the service connection associated with the customer’s
account or otherwise passes through the customer’s private water system.
   (C)   Any customer who violates or permits the violation of any mandatory
water conservation control imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to
civil penalties as follows:
      (1)   A warning for the first offense;
      (2)   A civil penalty in the amount of $1 for the second offense; and
      (3)   A civil penalty in the amount of $500 for the third and subsequent
offenses. Each day that a violation of a mandatory water conservation control
occurs shall be considered to be a separate and distinct offense.
   (D)   Violations shall be accumulated by customers so long as this chapter,
in any of its stages, is continuously in effect and until no stage of this
chapter has been in effect for a period of one calendar year. Violations of any
mandatory water conservation control of any stage shall accumulate with
violations of other stages. Should a customer move, or cease and renew service,
during the period described herein, the customer’s violations shall continue to
accumulate as if such move or cessation had not occurred.
   (E)   Each civil penalty assessed against a customer pursuant to this
chapter shall be added to the customer’s water bill and shall be paid in the
same manner as the payment of water bills. A customer’s partial payment of a
water bill shall be applied first to satisfaction of the civil penalties.
Failure to pay all or any portion of a water bill, including any civil penalty
assessed pursuant to this chapter, in a timely manner may result in the
termination of water service.
   (F)   The violation of any water conservation control or provision of this
chapter may be enforced by all remedies authorized by law for noncompliance
with town ordinances, including, without limitation, the assessment of a civil
penalty and action for injunction, order of abatement or other equitable
relief; provided, however, that no violation of any water conservation control
or provision of this chapter shall be a basis for imposing any criminal remedy.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008)
§ 52.09 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   (A)   In addition to the payment of any civil penalty assessed pursuant to §
52.08, a customer shall be subject to termination or restriction of water
service following four or more violations of any water conservation control
imposed pursuant to this chapter. Water service will not be restored at such
service connection until the customer agrees to such terms as determined by the
Director to be reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure the customer’s
compliance with such water conservation controls as are then in effect or may
be imposed pursuant to this chapter and the payment of all the customer’s
obligations, including, without limitation, all outstanding charges for water
service, civil penalties and all other fees, amounts and penalties charged in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If a customer violates such a
term or condition, the customer shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to
$1,000 in addition to any other remedy authorized pursuant to this chapter and
termination of water service through such service connection for up to a
minimum period of 15 days. Service may be restored thereafter in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   A customer whose water service is terminated pursuant to this section
shall not be entitled to notice and an opportunity for a hearing in advance of
such termination. Although service of notice and an opportunity for hearing are
not conditions precedent to termination of service, WPW will endeavor to
provide such notice as soon as reasonably practicable after a decision is made
to terminate such service. A customer whose service is terminated pursuant to
this section or who receives notice of such a termination shall have five
calendar days after termination of service or receipt of notice of termination,
whichever is later, to appeal such termination to the Director, or his or her
designee, by delivering a written notice of appeal. A hearing shall be held on
such appeal within three business days of receipt of the notice of appeal, or
by such other date as approved by the Director, or his or her designee, and the
customer.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008)
§ 52.10 IRRIGATION REQUIREMENTS WHICH APPLY AT ALL TIMES.
   The following shall apply at all times to the outdoor sprinkling of lawns,
shrubbery, trees, flowers, gardens and other outside irrigation systems. By
July 1, 2009, all irrigation systems equipped with a timer shall be equipped
with rain sensors as approved by WPW. Rain sensors shall be activated to
prevent the system from operating after one-fourth inch of rain has fallen.
(Ord. passed 9-16-2008)
§ 52.11 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (A)   This chapter originally became effective on August 12, 2002. It was
subsequently amended and restated effective on the following date: September
16, 2008.
   (B)   This second amendment and restatement of this chapter shall become
effective upon adoption by the Board of Commissioners on September 16, 2008
(the effective date). This chapter is restated in this manner solely to
facilitate review by the reader by obviating the need to integrate multiple
documents. Any declaration of a water shortage condition made prior to the
effective date and not rescinded shall remain in full force and effect. Though
amended, this chapter shall be deemed to be continuously in effect such that
enforcement of violations committed prior to the effective date shall continue
unaffected.

(see G.S. § 20-309) by the state of North Carolina. Registration of utility
vehicles, as defined herein, is not within the scope of local governments to
regulate because they are not included within G.S. § 160A-300.6.

install such facilities and make such arrangements as may be necessary to
accommodate those persons who may nevertheless attend or be present at the mass
gathering despite its cancellation and to restore the site to a safe and
sanitary condition. In the event the permittee fails to comply with the order
of the County Health Director, the County Health Director may immediately
proceed to install such facilities and make such other arrangements and
provisions for clean-up as may be minimally required in the interest of public
health and safety, utilizing such local funds and resources as may be available
to him or her. Prior to or within 60 days after such action, the County Health
Director may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to order forfeiture of
the permittee’s performance bond or surety for violation of this section. The
Court may order that the proceeds shall be applied to the extent necessary to

   (A)   The purpose of this chapter shall be to establish a response for the

upbringing of their children. Furthermore, there is a need to protect
businesses and other persons from vandalism committed by minors.
   (D)   This section will assist parents in the difficult task of child

the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and to the peace and dignity of

   (C)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve
or to vacate and close the nonresidential structure, the Board of Commissioners
may adopt an ordinance ordering the Enforcement Officer to proceed to
effectuate the purpose of this chapter with respect to the particular structure

§ 151.13 LIMITATION ON ORDERS AND ORDINANCES.
   (A)   Historic landmark or district. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this chapter, if the nonresidential structure is designated as a local
landmark, listed in the National Register of Historic Places or is designated a
historical property by the Board of Commissioners of the town and the Board
determines, after a public hearing, that the structure is of individual
significance or contributes to maintaining the character of the district, and
the structure has not been condemned as unsafe, the order of the Enforcement
Officer issued pursuant to §
151.10 may only require that the structure be vacated and closed until it is
brought into compliance with the minimum requirements established in this
chapter by removing the conditions set forth in §
151.06.
   (B)   Vacant manufacturing facility or vacant industrial warehouse.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the order of the

§ 151.14 VACATED AND CLOSED NONRESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES; ORDINANCE.
   (A)   If the Board of Commissioners has adopted an ordinance or the
Enforcement Officer has issued an order requiring the nonresidential structure
to be repaired or vacated and closed and the structure has been vacated and
closed for a period of two years pursuant to the ordinance or order, the board
may make findings that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to
repair, alter or improve such structure and that the continuation of the
structure in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health,
safety and welfare of the town in that it would continue to deteriorate, would
create a fire or safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants,
would attract persons intent on criminal activities or would cause or
contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area. Upon
such findings, the Board may, after the expiration of the two-year period enact
an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the
following:
      (1)   If the cost to repair the nonresidential structure to bring it into
compliance with the minimum requirements by removing the conditions set forth
in §
151.06 is less than or equal to 50% of its then current value, the ordinance
shall require that the owner either repair or demolish and remove the structure
within 90 days; or
      (2)   If the cost to repair the nonresidential structure to bring it into
compliance with the minimum requirements by removing the conditions set forth
in §
151.06 exceed 50% of its then current value, the ordinance shall require the
owner to demolish and remove the structure within 90 days.

the same priority, and be enforced and the costs collected as the lien for
special assessment in G.S. 160A, Art. 10. Such costs is also a lien on any
other real property of the owner located within the town limits except for the
owner’s personal residence. The additional lien provided in this subsection is
inferior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a money judgment.

Enforcement Officer, the Enforcement Officer shall offer for sale the
recoverable materials of the structure and any personal property, fixtures or
appurtenances found in or attached to the structure and shall credit the
proceeds of the sale, if any, against the cost of the removal or demolition and

§ 151.17 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the
power of the town to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or
abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise, nor shall enforcement of one
remedy provided herein prevent the enforcement of the other remedies provided
in this chapter or in other chapters or articles of the town code or any other
laws.

§ 151.18 EJECTMENT.
   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a nonresidential
structure, the Enforcement Officer may cause a civil action to be filed in the
name of the town to remove such occupant. The action to vacate shall be in the

magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten days from the
issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint
shall be served as provided in G.S. § 42-29. The summons shall be returned
according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly
served, and if at the hearing the Enforcement Officer produces a certified copy
of an ordinance adopted by the Board of Commissioners pursuant to §
151.12 authorizing the Enforcement Officer to proceed to vacate the occupied
structure, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the nonresidential
structure and premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The judgment
ordering that the structure and premises be vacated shall be enforced in the
same manner as the judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be taken as
provided in G.S. § 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be stayed as
provided in G.S. § 7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a nonresidential
structure who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary

with notice at least 30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment
proceeding that the Board has ordered the Enforcement Officer to proceed to
exercise his or her duties under §
151.12 to vacate and close or remove and demolish the structure.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has in G.S. Chapter 143, Article 21, Part 6;
G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 19, Parts 3, 5 and 8 and G.S. Chapter 160A, Article
8, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare.
Therefore, the Board of Commissioners does ordain as follows.
(Ord. passed 11-18-2008)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. passed 11-18-2008)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 11-18-2008)
§ 152.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect human life, safety and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets and bridges)
that are located in flood-prone areas;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special
flood hazard area.

   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or
      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.
   (G)   Temporary nonresidential structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning
notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval:
      (1)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be

following provisions, in addition to the provisions of §
152.40, shall apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet
each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is
greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be determined- based on the following criteria.
      (1)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or flood-proofed in accordance with standards in §§
152.40 and
152.41.
      (2)   When floodway data is available from a federal, state or other
source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway areas
shall also comply with the requirements of §§
152.41 and
152.44.
      (3)   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such
base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance
with §
152.07 and utilized in implementing this chapter.
      (4)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be
elevated or flood-proofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in §
152.05. All other applicable provisions of §
152.41 shall also apply.
(Ord. passed 11-18-2008)
§ 152.43 STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS WITH BFE BUT WITHOUT ESTABLISHED
FLOODWAYS OR NONENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available
from another source but neither floodway nor nonencroachment areas are
identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report,
the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
   (A)   Standards of §§
152.40 and
152.41; and
   (B)   Until a regulatory floodway or nonencroachment area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.
(Ord. passed 11-18-2008)
§ 152.44 FLOODWAYS AND NONENCROACHMENT AREAS.
   (A)   Areas designated as floodways or nonencroachment areas are located
within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.07. The floodways and nonencroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of flood waters that have erosion potential and carry
debris and potential projectiles.
   (B)   The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in §§
152.40 and
152.41, shall apply to all development within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         (b)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion
of the proposed encroachment.
      (2)   If §
152.44(A) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
provided the following provisions are met:
         (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
152.41(C); and
         (b)   The no encroachment standard of §
152.44(A).
(Ord. passed 11-18-2008)
§ 152.45 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO).
   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate.
   (B)   In addition to §§
152.40 and
152.41, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements.
      (1)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four feet
above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      (2)   Nonresidential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be flood-
proofed to the same level as required in §
152.45(A) so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below that level shall be water-tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required in accordance with §
152.26 and §
152.41(B).
      (3)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
(Ord. passed 11-18-2008)
LEGAL STATUS PROVISIONS
§ 152.60 EFFECT ON RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES UNDER THE EXISTING FLOOD DAMAGE
PREVENTION CHAPTER.
   This chapter in part comes forward by re-enactment of some of the provisions
of the flood damage prevention ordinance enacted January 1, 2002 as amended,
and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue to
enforce without interruption of such existing provisions, so that all rights
and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are reserved and may be enforced.
The enactment of this chapter shall not affect any action, suit or proceeding
instituted or pending. All provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance
of the town enacted on January 1, 2002, as amended, which are not reenacted
herein are repealed.
(Ord. passed 11-18-2008)
§ 152.61 EFFECT UPON OUTSTANDING FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMITS.
   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans,
construction, size or designated use of any development or any part thereof for
which a floodplain development permit has been granted by the Floodplain
Administrator or his or her authorized agents before the time of passage of
this chapter; provided, however, that when construction is not begun under such
outstanding permit within a period of six months subsequent to the date of
issuance of the outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 11-18-2008)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
