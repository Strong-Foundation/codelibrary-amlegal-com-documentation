CHAPTER 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1.1   Titles; Effective Date
   This Ordinance shall be known as the Development Ordinance of the Village of
Pinehurst, North Carolina and may be known as the "Pinehurst Development
Ordinance" (PDO). This Ordinance shall become effective on October 8, 2014.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 1.2   Statement of Intent of This Ordinance
   The following Statement of Intent shall apply to and guide the
implementation and enforcement of the entire Ordinance. All following sections
of this Ordinance shall be interpreted as being in furtherance of and
consistent with this Statement of Intent.
   The Village of Pinehurst is a residential and resort community, the major
industries of which are recreation, tourism, and a regional medical center
along with the land uses that provide the needed goods and services for the
convenience of the community. It shall be the primary goal of this Ordinance to
preserve the Village's unique visual content. In all decisions affecting land
use, it shall be Village policy to encourage adherence to this goal by
protecting its Village Center with its shops and homes and by encouraging any
further development of the Village of Pinehurst as a residential, and resort
community. To this purpose, those activities and land uses not compatible with
a residential and resort area, such as intense industrial uses, extensive
commercial districts, structures and signs that are not in context with the
Village, shall be prohibited. Managed growth is desirable but protection of the
desirable qualities of the Village is paramount to continue meeting the primary
goals as defined in this Section. The continued conservation of the
environmental and aesthetic character of Pinehurst as it grows and develops
will be controlled and accomplished by land use regulations made with
reasonable consideration given to, among other things, the character of the
various areas of the Village and its environs and the unique suitability of
these areas for particular uses, conservation and enhancement of property
values, and encouraging the use of land in a manner which is most appropriate
in view of this Statement of Intent.
   The regulations contained in this Ordinance have been adopted in accordance
with the Existing Comprehensive Long Range Plan for the Village of Pinehurst,
North Carolina, and all other adopted village plans and policies, in order to
accomplish the following goals:
   (A)   Preserve and enhance the unique historic character and ambience of the
community, especially the historic Village Center.
   (B)   Guide development in an appropriate and sustainable way that will
protect natural resources, reduce waste and climate impacts, and promote
overall environmental health.
   (C)   Support fiscally sustainable development patterns that generate new
jobs and tax revenues with lower economic and social costs.
   (D)   Provide adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools,
parks and other public infrastructure.
   (E)   Ensure that the transportation system supports community structure,
enhances community character and operates effectively.
   (F)   Preserve and enhance Pinehurst's residential neighborhoods while
addressing the housing needs of current and future residents.
   (G)   Establish meaningful open space and trails system that supports
pedestrian and bicycle connectivity throughout the community and allows
residents to become active participants in the public realm.
   (H)   Promote the health, wellness, and safety of Pinehurst's residents.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)

Restrictions
   (A)   This Ordinance is not intended to abrogate any other law, ordinance,

provisions of such statute, ordinance, or regulation shall govern;
   (B)   This Ordinance is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or
other private agreement. However, where the regulations of this Ordinance are
more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easement,
covenant, or other private agreement, then the requirements of this Ordinance
shall govern. Nothing in this Ordinance shall modify or repeal any private
covenant or deed restriction, but such covenant or restriction shall not excuse
any failure to comply with this Ordinance.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 1.7   The Comprehensive Long Range Plan

CHAPTER 2. ADMINISTRATIVE RULES; NONCONFORMITIES
Section 2.1   Transitional Rules

with the requirements of this Ordinance, then upon adoption of this Ordinance
any noncompliance with or violation of the predecessor ordinance is deemed to
be of no effect;
   (B)   Uses Rendered Non-Conforming: When a lot is used for a purpose which
was a lawful use before the effective date of this Ordinance, and this
Ordinance or any amendment thereto no longer classifies such use as either a

such use is hereby deemed a nonconforming use and shall be controlled by the
provisions of Section
2.3  of this Chapter;
   (C)   Buildings, Structures and Lots Rendered Non-Conforming: Where any
building, structure, or lot which existed on the effective date of this

nonconforming and shall be controlled by the provisions of Section
2.3  of this Chapter;
   (D)   Non-Conforming Uses Generally: In order to qualify as a non-conforming
use, the way in which the use was actually conducted as well as the purpose of

(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 2.2   General Rules for Interpreting Words, Terms, and Illustrations
   The following rules shall apply for construing or interpreting the terms and
provisions of this Ordinance:
   (A)   In their application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held
to be the minimum requirements for the promotion and protection of the public
health, safety and general welfare, and shall be construed to achieve the
purposes for which this Ordinance is adopted;
   (B)   In the event of any conflict between the limitations, requirements, or
standards contained in different provisions of this Ordinance applying to an
individual use or structure, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
However, the regulations for overlay zoning districts which are set forth in

and the regulations which are set forth in
Chapter 8 for the general zoning district, regardless of whether they are more
strict or less strict than the regulations for the general use district;

an obligation or duty to comply with the particular provision. The word "may"
is permissive in nature. Words used in the present tense include the future
tense. Words used in the singular number include the plural number and the
plural number includes the singular number, unless the context of the
particular usage clearly indicates otherwise. When the term" in writing" is
used, it shall also constitute electronic mail, unless State law or this
ordinance prohibits. Words used in the masculine gender include the feminine
gender, and vice versa;
   (E)   Any act authorized by this Ordinance to be carried out by a specific
official of the Village is impliedly authorized to be carried out by a designee
of such official;
   (F)   Notwithstanding Subsection (E) above, elected and appointed officials

Chapter 3 of this Ordinance and The Code of the Village of Pinehurst. Such
officials include, but are not limited to: the Village Council, the Planning
and Zoning Board, the Zoning Board of Adjustment, and the Historic Preservation
Commission.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 2.3   Nonconformities
2.3.1   Purpose and Scope
   The purpose of this Section is to regulate and limit the development and
continued existence of uses, structures, and lots established prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance that do not conform to the requirements of
this Ordinance. Many nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this
Section are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities and
to bring about their eventual improvement or elimination in order to preserve
the integrity of this Ordinance and the character of the Village and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction. Any nonconforming use, structure, or lot which
lawfully existed as of the effective date of this Ordinance and which remains
nonconforming, and any use, structure, or lot which has become nonconforming as
a result of the adoption of this Ordinance or any subsequent rezoning or
amendment to the text of this Ordinance, may be continued or maintained only in
accordance with the terms of this Section.
2.3.2   Nonconforming Uses
   (A)   Within the Village there are some uses which may be nonconforming, the
use was allowed when it was constructed and first used but does not meet the
current zoning regulations. These nonconforming uses may have a right to remain
and continue to be used as they were originally constructed and/or used,
provided the original use has not been discontinued for longer than the periods
set forth in subsection (G) as to particular types of nonconforming uses.
   (B)   Nonconforming Use Certificate: A Nonconforming Use Certificate is an
official declaration issued by the Village confirming the legal nonconforming
use status that is attached to the property for the benefit of current and
future property owners to be assured that the current and/or original use may
lawfully continue and are afforded the benefits identified in this subsection.
The Certificate shall describe the nature and extent of the nonconformity and
is an acknowledgement by the Village that the use was legal at the time of
construction and original lawful use and was lawful prior to the adoption of
the new zoning ordinance and is therefore allowed to lawfully remain so long as
it is not discontinued under the provisions of subsection (G), or enlarged,
extended, or intensified as proscribed by subsection (C).
      (1)   Issuance: Within 365 days of any use being made a nonconforming use
as defined by Section
10.2  of this Ordinance, or within 365 after adoption of this Ordinance,
whichever is later, such nonconforming uses may apply for a Nonconforming Use
Certificate that shall be issued by the Village Planner upon the property owner
providing documentation acceptable to the Village establishing the legal
existence, nature, and extent of the original nonconforming use, and
documentation that the original use has not been discontinued for the
applicable periods set forth in subsection (G). As to requests for
Nonconforming Use Certificates from owners of short term rental dwelling units
in existence and operated prior to effective date of this Ordinance, proof
sufficient to establish the lawful nonconforming status may include, among
other forms of documentation, Moore County tax records, rental agreements and/
or leases, occupancy tax records, and other similar types of documentation
confirming and establishing the pre-existence of the nonconforming use for
short term rental purposes. In all cases, the burden of establishing the
nonconforming use lawfully exists shall be the responsibility of the property
owner of the claimed nonconforming use and not upon the Village.
   (C)   Extension of Use: A nonconforming use of land shall not be enlarged,
extended, or intensified in any way except as provided below;
   (D)   Continuation, Maintenance and Minor Repair: The continuation of a
nonconforming use of land and the maintenance or minor repair of a structure
containing a nonconforming use are permitted, provided that the continuation,
maintenance, or minor repair does not extend, expand, or increase the intensity
of the nonconforming use. For the purposes of its Section, maintenance or minor
repair shall mean:
      (1)   Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or
deterioration to the structural soundness or interior and exterior appearance
of a building or structure without expanding or altering the building or
structure;
      (2)   Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and
promote the safety of surrounding land uses;
      (3)   The addition of landscaping that increases the visual
attractiveness of the property;
      (4)   Repairs which are required to remedy unsafe conditions which cause
a threat to public safety; and
   (E)   Damage or Destruction: If a nonconforming use of land or a structure
containing a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means other than Acts of
God, to an extent greater than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at
the time of destruction, then such use shall not be reestablished in any way
that does not conform to the requirements of this Ordinance. However, if the
destruction is a result of acts of God the use and or structure can be
reestablished to the previous extent;
   (F)   Change of Use: Any nonconforming use of land may be changed to a
conforming use by securing all approvals and permits that this Ordinance
requires for the intended or resulting use, building, structure, or lot. No
nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use unless the
Village Council determines, after a public hearing is held, it is a change in
use of a nonconforming use to a different, less intensive nonconforming use or
a use more compatible with the Village Comprehensive Long Range Plan and
Section 
1.2 , Statement of Intent of this Ordinance;
   (G)   Cessation of Use: If a nonconforming use is discontinued for one
hundred twenty (120) consecutive days or more, then the property shall
thereafter be occupied and used only for a conforming use. If a nonconforming
use of property is discontinued, but reestablished within one hundred twenty
(120) days, then the nonconforming use may continue, provided that the nature
and degree of the nonconformity will not be changed or increased from that
which existed before the nonconforming use was discontinued. Nonconforming
Banks, Credit Unions, Financial Services and Professional Services located
within the VC (Village Commercial) Zoning District shall not be afforded the
same one hundred twenty (120) days but rather a thirty (30) day cessation in
use shall result in the discontinuation of that use and the space may only be
re-occupied by a conforming use. If a nonconforming short term rental dwelling
unit is not used for three hundred sixty-five (365) days or more, the use shall
be deemed to have been discontinued and shall thereafter be used only for a
conforming use.
   (H)   Signs for Nonconforming Uses: Wall signs shall not be erected on any
nonconforming use in any residential district. Nonconforming uses may repair
and maintain their existing signage in accordance with Section
2.3.4  and construct new signage in accordance with Section
9.7 .
(Ord. 22-15, passed 10-26-2022)
2.3.3   Nonconforming Structures
   (A)   Expansion or Enlargement: A nonconforming structure shall not be
enlarged, extended or intensified in any way so as to increase the existing
nonconformity or nonconformities, except as provided below;
   (B)   Maintenance or Minor Repair: The maintenance or minor repair of a
nonconforming structure is permitted, provided that it does not extend or
expand the nonconforming structure nor increase its size or intensity. For the
purposes of this Section, maintenance or minor repair shall mean:
      (1)   Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or
deterioration to the structural soundness or interior and exterior appearance
of a building or structure without expanding or altering the building
structure;
      (2)   Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and
promote the safety of surrounding land uses;
      (3)   The addition of landscaping that increases the visual
attractiveness of the property;
      (4)   Repairs which are required to remedy unsafe conditions which cause
a threat to public safety;
   (C)   Damage or Destruction: If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by
any means other than acts of God to an extent greater than fifty percent (50%)
of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, then such structure shall
not be restored, nor any use of the structure be reestablished in any way which
does not conform to the requirements of this Ordinance. However, if the
destruction is a result of acts of God the use and or structure can be re-
established to the previous extent. However, with respect to structures located
within a multi-family development, the fifty percent (50%) shall be measured
with reference to the development as a whole and not an individual multi-family
dwelling.
      Notwithstanding the aforesaid, existing legally constructed nonconforming
single family and duplex dwellings located within the Historic Preservation
Overlay District may be rebuilt if they are destroyed by any means as long as
the heated and unheated enclosed square footage of the structure is not
increased. If the existing structure is also nonconforming in regard to
setbacks it shall comply with the setback regulations at the time it is
reconstructed. These dwellings shall also be allowed to construct additional
outdoor living spaces, porches and decks so as to be afforded the same
opportunity to improve the livability and appearance as conforming single
family homes in the Historic Preservation Overlay District.
   (D)   Section Not Applicable to Nonconforming Signs: This Section shall not
apply to nonconforming signs, the continuation, replacement, removal,
expansion, maintenance, and repair of which are governed by Section
2.3.4 .
   (E)   Existing Single Family Dwellings: Single-family dwellings and their
accessory structures with setbacks made legal nonconformities by the adoption
of this Ordinance are exempt from the requirements of this Section if the
proposed addition or alteration will either meet the current setback
requirements or will not further encroach into any required setback than the
existing structure. This shall not apply to enclosing existing nonconforming
decks and patios not under roof if the deck or patio is the furthest projection
into the setback. All other requirements including impervious surface shall be
met.

damaged to the extent that more than fifty percent (50%) of its surface area
requires replacement, the sign shall be removed or made to conform to the

located at the entrance to the development made nonconforming by their
placement within Village of Pinehurst Public Rights of Way may be replaced.
These replacement signs shall conform to all other regulations including size
and height and shall be constructed to meet NCDOTs and Village of Pinehurst
requirements for vehicular safety. No sign shall be replaced under this
provision without the approval of the Pinehurst Village Council. The Village
Council may dictate a location that deviates from the original location if in
their opinion this would be in the best interest of the public. The individual
or entity desiring to construct the new signage shall also be required to
obtain a Right of Way Encroachment.
   (F)   Non-Conforming signs serving multi-tenant developments may change out
tenant names if no more than one-third (1/3) of the message is changing.
2.3.5   Nonconforming Lots of Record
   (A)   Development Prohibited: No use or structure shall be established on a
lot of record which does not conform to the lot area and lot width requirements
established in this Ordinance for the zoning district in which it is located,
except as otherwise set forth in (B) below.
   (B)   Residential Use: Notwithstanding the limitation in Subsection (A)
above, a nonconforming lot may be used provided that:

requirements of the applicable zoning districts with the exception of minimum
lot size and minimum lot width. All other dimensional criteria must be met.

Section 4.1   Quasi-Judicial and Legislative Public Hearings
4.1.1   Quasi-Judicial Hearings
   Board shall follow quasi-judicial procedures in determining appeals of
administrative decisions, special use permits, certificates of appropriateness,
variances, or for any other quasi-judicial decision.
   (A)   Notice of Hearing. Notice of evidentiary hearings shall be mailed to
the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request is the subject of
the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if
the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land
abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to any
other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by this Chapter. In the
absence of evidence to the contrary, the Village may rely on the county tax
listing to determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice
must be deposited in the mail at least ten (10) days, but not more than twenty-
five (25) days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time period,
the local government shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the
site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway
right-of-way. The board may continue an evidentiary hearing that has been
convened without further advertisement. If an evidentiary hearing is set for a
given date and a quorum of the board is not then present, the hearing shall be
continued until the next regular board meeting without further advertisement.
   (B)   Administrative Materials. Staff to the board shall transmit to the
board all applications, reports, and written materials relevant to the matter
being considered. The administrative materials may be distributed to the
members of the board prior to the hearing if at the same time they are
distributed to the board a copy is also provided to the appellant or applicant
and to the landowner if that person is not the appellant or applicant. The
administrative materials shall become a part of the hearing record. The
administrative materials may be provided in written or electronic form.
Objections to inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials may be made
before or during the hearing. Rulings on unresolved objections shall be made by
the board at the hearing.
   (C)   Presentation of Evidence. The applicant, the local government, and any
person who would have standing to appeal the decision under Section 4.1.3 shall
have the right to participate as a party at the evidentiary hearing. Other
witnesses may present competent, material, and substantial evidence that is not
repetitive as allowed by the board. Objections regarding jurisdictional and
evidentiary issues, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal
or the standing of a party, may be made to the board. The board chair shall
rule on any objections, and the chair's rulings may be appealed to the full
board. These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to NCGS §
160D-1402.
   (D)   Appearance of Official New Issues. The official who made the decision
or the person currently occupying that position, if the decision maker is no
longer employed by the local government, shall be present at the evidentiary
hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to
matters stated in a notice of appeal. If any party or the local government
would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the
notice of appeal, the board shall continue the hearing.
   (E)   The chair of the board or any member acting as chair and the clerk to
the board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter coming
before the board. Any person who, while under oath during a proceeding before
the board determining a quasi-judicial matter, willfully swears falsely is
guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (F)   Subpoenas. The board making a quasi-judicial decision through the
chair or, in the chair's absence, anyone acting as chair may subpoena witnesses
and compel the production of evidence. To request issuance of a subpoena, the
applicant, the local government, and any person with standing under NCGS §
160D-1402(c) may make a written request to the chair explaining why it is
necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The chair shall
issue requested subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in
nature and scope, and not oppressive. The chair shall rule on any motion to
quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the chair may
be immediately appealed to the full board. If a person fails or refuses to obey
a subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection, the board or the party seeking
the subpoena may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order requiring
that its subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue
these orders after notice to all proper parties.
   (G)   Appeals in Nature of Certiorari. When hearing an appeal pursuant to
NCGS § 160D-947(e) or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing
shall be based on the record below, and the scope of review shall be as
provided in NCGS § 160D-1402(j).
   (H)   Voting. The concurring vote of four-fifths of the board shall be
necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to
decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the
nature of certiorari. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on
the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial
matter under NCGS § 160D-109(d) shall not be considered members of the board
for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates
available to take the place of such members.
   (I)   Decisions. The board shall determine contested facts and make its
decision within a reasonable time. When hearing an appeal, the board may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from
and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to
be made. The board shall have all the powers of the official who made the
decision. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent,
material, and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision
shall be reduced to writing, reflect the board's determination of contested
facts and their application to the applicable standards, and be approved by the
board and signed by the chair or other duly authorized member of the board. A
quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the
clerk to the board or such other office or official as the development
regulation specifies. The decision of the board shall be delivered within a
reasonable time by personal delivery, electronic mail, or first-class mail to
the applicant, landowner, and any person who has submitted a written request
for a copy prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person
required to provide notice shall certify to the local government that proper
notice has been made, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the
absence of fraud.
   (J)   Judicial Review. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to
review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari
pursuant to NCGS § 160D-1402. Appeals shall be filed within the times specified
in NCGS § 160D-1405(d).

than was allowed under its previous usage.
      (2)   By reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in a
zoning ordinance or land development regulation to fewer uses than were allowed

   (A)   It is the intent of the Village to accommodate the simultaneous
processing of applications for different permits and approvals, which may be
required for the same development project, in order to make the review process
as reasonable as possible for a development project. Even though this Section
establishes an intent to accommodate the simultaneous processing of different
types of applications, the applicant should note that each of the permits and
approvals set forth in this Ordinance has its own timing and review sequence
and should take this into consideration in planning the development;
   (B)   Notwithstanding (A) above, no application for the rezoning of property
shall be accepted or processed while an application for a development permit is
pending for the same property, nor shall an application for a development
permit be accepted or processed while an application for rezoning is pending
for the same property.
4.2.8   Simultaneous Processing of Voluntary Annexation Petitions
   (A)   Where the Property is Located Within the Extraterritorial
Jurisdiction: Where the owner or developer of a property located in the
extraterritorial jurisdiction, but not within the Village limits, wishes the
Village to annex the property into the Village's corporate boundaries, as well
as to approve proposed development on the property, then a voluntary annexation
petition shall be submitted at the same time as an application for all
development permits and must be submitted prior to the Village Council's
approval of the site plan or preliminary subdivision plat;
   (B)   Where a Property is Located Outside of the Jurisdiction of the
Village: Where the owner or developer of a property located outside of the
jurisdiction of this Ordinance, wishes the Village to annex the property into
the Village's corporate boundaries, then a voluntary annexation petition shall
be submitted at the same time as an application for rezoning and/or a
development permit. Final action by the Village Council must be taken on the
annexation petition prior to any final action being taken on the initial zoning
or development.
4.2.9   Processing Fees
   Requests for approval of the different permits and approvals required by
this Ordinance are subject to the payment of the appropriate application
processing fee(s) as specified in the most recent Village of Pinehurst Fee
Schedule.
4.2.10   Property Owned by Applicant
   An application for approval of any permit required by this Ordinance may be
filed only by the owner of the property on which the use is to be located, an
agent of the owner, or contract purchaser specifically authorized by the owner
to file such application, or any unit of government which is not the owner of
the property but proposes to acquire the property by purchase, gift, or
condemnation. Where an agent, lessee, or contract purchaser files the
application, the agent, lessee, or contract purchaser shall provide the Village
with written documentation that the owner of the property has authorized the
filing of the application.
4.2.11   Village Planner to Determine the Completeness of All Initial
Applications

the applicant of any deficiencies and shall take no further steps to process
the application until the applicant remedies the deficiencies. Once the
application is complete, the Village Planner shall schedule the application for
consideration before the appropriate body and/or schedule a public hearing, if
required.
   (C)   An application shall be deemed complete if it is submitted in the
required number and form, includes all requested information, and is
accompanied by the applicable fee. A determination of application completeness
shall be made within thirty (30) working days of application filing. If an
application is determined to be incomplete, written notice shall be provided to
the applicant along with an explanation of the application’s deficiencies. No
further processing of the application shall occur until the deficiencies are
corrected. If the deficiencies are not corrected by the applicant within twenty
(20) working days, the application shall be considered withdrawn.

4.2.12   Revocation of Development Permit
   A development permit may be revoked by the Village Planner after notifying
the permit holder in writing and stating the reason for the revocation. The
permit revocation shall follow the same process required for issuance of the
development permit, including any required notice or hearing, in the review and
approval of any revocation of that approval. Terms under which a development
permit may be revoked include:
   (A)   Any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or
specifications; or
   (B)   Refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of this ordinance
or any applicable local development regulation or any State law delegated to
the Village for enforcement purposes in lieu of the State; or

provided in
Chapter 5 and pursuant to G.S. 160D-405.
(Ord. 22-15, passed 10-26-2022)
Section 4.3   Vested Rights and Permit Choice
Purpose
   NCGS § 160D-108 provides mechanisms by way of statutory vested rights for a
project to move forward as originally approved. Statutory vested rights run
with the land and are not affected by changes in ownership. These rights are
subject to development progressing in accordance with all applicable terms and
conditions of approval.
   Permit choice is provided as an option for establishing the development
standard to be used when regulations are in the process of changing during
application review.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
4.3.1   Permit Choice
   (A)   If an application is submitted for development subject to this
Chapter, and the Chapter is amended between the time the application is
submitted and a development approval decision is made, the applicant may choose
which version of the ordinance will apply.
   (B)   If this Chapter is amended after a development permit is wrongfully
denied or after an illegal condition is imposed, as determined in a proceeding
challenging the permit denial or the condition imposed, the development permit
applicant may choose which adopted version of the rule or ordinance will apply.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
4.3.2   Establishment of Vested Right
   A person claiming a common law or statutory vested right shall submit
information to the Village Planner to substantiate that claim.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
4.3.3   Duration of Vested Rights
   (A)   The following table establishes the term of duration of specific
statutory vested rights.
   (B)   Except where a longer vesting period has been granted, if a statutory
vested right is established and work intentionally and voluntarily ceases for a
period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months, the statutory vesting expires.
   (C)   Terms may only be extended by action of the Village Council in a
Legislative Hearing upon demonstration that a project has or will continue to
make substantial progress towards completion. Any extension of time granted
under this provision shall not place any other additional conditions on the
approval.
   (D)   A Site-Specific Vesting Plan is a plan that describes with reasonable
certainty the type and intensity of use for specific parcel(s) and includes
information such as site boundaries; topographic and natural features; location
of proposed buildings, structures and improvements; and dimensional
requirements. Site-Specific Vesting Plans include the following: plans approved
subject to conditional zoning, preliminary plats, plans approved as part of
planned developments, commercial and multifamily site plans, plans associated
with special use permits.
   (E)   For the purposes of this section, a multi-phased development is one
that 1) contains at least twenty-five (25) acres and 2) is to occur in more
than one phase, and 3) is subject to a master development plan showing the type
and intensity of each phase.
   (F)   The Village Council may provide for rights to be vested for a period
exceeding two years but not exceeding five (5) years where warranted due to
circumstances such as size and phasing of the project, market and economic
conditions, and the level of investment made.
   (G)   The establishment of a vested right does not preclude vesting by
application of common law principles.

(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
4.3.4   Subsequent Changes Prohibited; Exceptions
   (A)   Once established, a vested right precludes any zoning action which
would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the
development or use of a property set forth in a site-specific vesting plan
except under the following circumstances.
      (1)   Written consent of the landowner.
      (2)   Upon findings by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary hearing,
that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the
property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health,
safety and welfare if the project proceeds according to the site-specific
vesting plan.
      (3)   To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for
all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred, including but not limited to
all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning,
marketing, legal and other consulting fees incurred after Village approval,
together with interest provided under NCGS § 160D-106. Compensation shall not
include any diminution in value caused by the action.
      (4)   Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary
hearing, that the landowner or the landowner’s representative intentionally
supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations that made a
difference in the approval of the site-specific vesting plan or the phased
development plan.
      (5)   Upon the enactment or promulgation of a State or Federal law or
regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site-specific
vesting plan or the phased development plan, in which case the local government
may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in law has a
fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary
hearing.
   (B)   The establishment of a vested right does not preclude the application
of overlay zoning or other development regulations which impose additional
requirements but do not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or
ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all
property subject to development regulation including, but not limited to,
building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes.
   (C)   The establishment of a vested right does not preclude, change, or
impair the authority to adopt and enforce development regulations governing
nonconforming situations or uses.

4.3.5   Reserved
4.3.6   Reserved
4.3.7   Reserved
4.3.8   Reserved

NCGS § 160A-58.1 shall contain a signed statement declaring whether or not any
zoning vested right with respect to the properties subject to the petition has
been established under NCGS§ 160D-202(k). A statement that declares that no
zoning vested right has been established or the failure to sign a statement
declaring whether or not a zoning vested right has been established, shall be
binding on the landowner and any such zoning vested right shall be terminated.

Section 4.4   Temporary Uses Permit
4.4.1   Development Permit for Temporary Uses Required
   No use that is classified as a temporary use in the zoning district in which
it is located shall be placed or established on the property without first
receiving a temporary use development permit from the Village Planner.
4.4.2   Required Permit
   No tent, trailer, or other temporary structure governed by the State
Building Code shall be occupied or used in conjunction with a temporary use
until and unless the applicant has received a temporary use development permit
and then received a building permit for each separate structure or building
from the Planning and Inspections Department.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 4.5   Special Uses Permit
4.5.1   Purpose and Applicability; Special Uses
   (A)   The classification of special uses is established to provide for the
location of those uses which are generally compatible with the other land uses
permitted in a zoning district but which, because of their unique
characteristics or potential impacts on the surrounding neighborhood and the
Village as a whole, require individual consideration of their location, design,
configuration, and/or operation at the particular location proposed. Such
individual consideration may also call for the imposition of individualized
conditions in order to ensure that the use is appropriate at a particular
location;
   (B)   Accordingly, any use designated as a special use in an individual
zoning district as shown on use table in
Chapter 8 shall not be established without the approval of the Village Council
in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in this Section.
Final approval of special use permits shall be the responsibility of the
Village Council
   (C)   Process for Special Use Permits.

4.5.2   Special Uses Requiring Variances
   If the proposed special use involves one or more structures or elements
which do not conform to the regulations of the district in which the special
use is to be located, then no special use approval shall be granted unless the
applicant has corrected such nonconforming elements or the Zoning Board of
Adjustment has first granted variances with respect to such nonconforming
features pursuant to
Chapter 5 of this Ordinance.
4.5.3   Application Requirements; Determination of Completeness
   (A)   The application shall contain or be accompanied by such information
and plans as required on the application form. Where the proposed special use
will require site plan approval pursuant to Section
9.16, the application shall also be accompanied by a General Concept Plan (See
Appendix C);
   (B)   After determining that the application is complete, the Village
Planner and the Technical Review Committee shall review the general concept
plan. Once the Technical Review Committee has deemed the application complete
and found to be in general conformance with all applicable regulations it will
be sent forward to the Village Council for consideration.
   (C)   Required information to be included on the general concept plan is
outlined in
Appendix C.
4.5.4   Lapse of Special Use Approval for Failure to Obtain Site Plan Approval
   Approvals of special uses shall be automatically conditioned on the
subsequent approval of the site plan when required under Section
9.16 of this Ordinance. Accordingly, the approval of any special use shall
lapse and become null and void where the applicant has failed to receive final
site plan approval within twelve (12) months of the date of approval of the
special use. At the request of the applicant the Village Council may grant an
additional six (6) months.
4.5.5    Action on Special Uses
   (A)   Review by the Village Council: The Village Council shall review the
application and conduct a quasi-judicial public hearing. Notice of public
hearing shall be provided and the public hearing shall be conducted in
accordance with Section
4.1 of this Ordinance. The Village Council shall review the application
materials and General Concept Plan if required, the general purpose and
standards set forth in this Section for the approval of special uses, any
additional standards set forth in this Ordinance for approval of the proposed
use, and all evidence and testimony received by the Village Council at the
public hearing;
   (B)   Action by the Village Council: At the conclusion of the quasi-judicial
public hearing, the Village Council shall approve, approve with conditions,
deny or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure on
the Special Use Permit Application. Any approval or denial of the application
shall state the findings of fact that establish whether the proposed use meets
or does not meet each of the standards set forth in Section
4.5.6 below and all other requirements set forth by this Chapter for the
proposed special use. The decision on the application shall be by a simple
majority vote of the members of the Village Council. The Council is required to
take action within sixty (60) days from the date of the public hearing;
   (C)   Conditions Attached to Approval: In approving the special use, the
Village Council may attach such conditions to the approval as it deems
necessary to have the proposed use meet the standards set forth for the
proposed special use in Section
4.5.6 below and elsewhere in this Ordinance, and to protect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. All such conditions shall be stated on the form
for approving the application;
   (D)   Nature of Conditions: Such conditions may be stricter than any
requirement or limitation stated elsewhere in this Ordinance for the proposed
use. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Limitations on the size, bulk and location of structures;
      (2)   Requirements for landscaping, signs and outdoor lighting;
      (3)   The provision of adequate site ingress and egress;

      (8)   The mitigation of environmental impacts;
      (9)   Other conditions deemed reasonable.
   (E)   Appeals to Courts: Appeal from the decision of the Village Council in
regard to special use permits shall be by petition for certiorari to the Moore
County Superior Court. Any such petition to the Superior Court shall be filed
with the court clerk no later than thirty (30) days after the date the decision
of the Village Council is filed with the Village Planner, or after the date a
written copy of the decision is delivered to every aggrieved party who has
filed a written request for such copy with the Village Council at the public
hearing, whichever is later. The copy of the decision shall be delivered to the
aggrieved party either by personal service or registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
4.5.6   Standards of Review
   The Village Council shall not approve the special use unless and until it
makes the following findings, based on the evidence and testimony received at
the quasi-judicial public hearing or otherwise appearing in the record of the
case:
   (A)   The proposed special use meets all required conditions and
specifications.
   (B)   The proposed special use is in harmony with the area, or compatible
with the neighborhood.
   (C)   The proposed special use will not materially endanger public health or
safety.
   (D)   The proposed special use will not substantially injure the value of
adjoining property or be a public necessity.

Comprehensive Long Range Plan.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
4.5.7   Effect of Approval or Denial
   (A)   Subsequent Permits and Approvals: Approval of the application for a
special use by the Village Council constitutes approval of the special use and
authorizes the applicant to apply for site plan approval, if required, and such
other permits or approvals which the Village may require for the proposed
development. The Village Planner shall review applications for these permits
for compliance with the terms of the special use approval granted by the
Village Council. A development permit, certificate of appropriateness, or other
approval shall be issued or valid only for work that complies with the terms of
the special use approval;
   (B)   Transferability of Approval: A special use approval is not
transferable from one (1) property to another, but may be transferred to a
successor-in-interest to the property;
   (C)   Resubmission of Denied Applications: No application for approval of a
special use shall be filed with, or accepted by, the Village Planner, which is
identical or substantially similar to an application, which has been denied by
the Village Council within the previous three hundred sixty-five (365) days.
This waiting period requirement may be waived in an individual case, for good
cause shown, by the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the members of the
Village Council.
4.5.8   Changes to Terms and Conditions of Approval
   Any changes to the terms or conditions of approval of the special use shall
require separate review by the Village and approval of a new special use permit
by the Village Council if the changes are considered to be major. Any
application for approval of such a change shall be filed, processed, reviewed,
and approved or denied in the manner set forth in this Section.
   (A)   Approval of Phasing: Proposed phases of development shall be shown on
the General Concept Plan. Each phase of development shall adhere to all
applicable provisions and standards of this section and the applicable Special
Use General Concept Plan. Each completed phase shall comply with the minimum
standards of this ordinance where practical and any conditions attached to the
special use permit.
   (B)   Major Changes: Any major change to an approved General Concept Plan as
noted below shall be reviewed and approved or denied by the Village Council as
an amended Special Use Permit. The following changes to a Special Use General
Concept Plan are considered major, and shall require approval by the Village
Council:
      (1)   When land area being added or removed from the Special Use Permit.
      (2)   When modification of special performance criteria, design
standards, or other requirements specified by the special use permit are being
made.
      (3)   When a change in land use or development type beyond that permitted
by the approved special use permit is being made.
      (4)   When there is introduction of a new vehicular access point to an
existing street, road or thoroughfare not previously designated for access.
      (5)   When there is an increase in the total number of residential
dwelling units originally authorized by the approved General Concept Plan.
      (6)   When the total floor area of a commercial or industrial
classification is increased by more than ten percent (10%) beyond the total
floor area last approved by Village Council.
      (7)   When the total height of a structure is increased more than ten
percent (10%) beyond the total height last approved by the Village Council.
      (8)   When perimeter buffers and shown perimeter landscape areas are
modified in any way except for replacements of like materials, like planting
stock or increasing the buffer widths.
      (9)   When open space is decreased or impervious area is increased by
more than five percent (5%).
      (10)   When, in the opinion of the Village Planner, the proposed change
has a discernible impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or
those intended to occupy or sue the proposed development.
   (C)   Additional Changes: All other changes to a Special Use General Concept
Plan shall receive approval by the Technical Review Committee and the Village
Planner. However, if in the judgment of the Village Planner, the requested
changes alter the basic development concept of the Special Use Permit, the
Village Planner may require concurrent approval by the Village Council
following the same process as the original Special Use approval.

   The Building Inspector may issue a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy, which
shall be valid only for the period of time stated in the certificate, for a
specified portion or portions of a building, which may safely be occupied prior
to final completion of the entire building and/or site. Conditions that are
attached to the temporary Certificate of Occupancy must be completed prior to
the expiration of the certificate. When such conditions have not been completed
prior to the expiration date of the conditional certificate, the Certificate of
Occupancy shall immediately expire. Upon receipt of a written application to
the Building Inspector stating satisfactory reasons for the failure to complete
work within the given time period, the Inspector may renew the certificate for
a specified period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days.
4.7.3   Approval Procedure

CHAPTER 5. VARIANCES AND ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS
Section 5.1   Variances
5.1.1   Purpose and Scope
   The variance process administered by the Zoning Board of Adjustment is
intended to provide relief from the zoning requirements of this Ordinance in
those cases where strict application of a particular zoning requirement will
create an unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner
otherwise allowed under this Ordinance. It is not intended that variances be
granted merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the zoning
requirements of this Ordinance may impose on property owners in general.
Rather, it is intended to provide relief where the zoning requirements of this
Ordinance render the land difficult or impossible to use because of some unique
physical attribute of the property itself, or some other factor unique to the
property for which the variance is requested.
   (A)   Process for Variances:

IMAGES/0-0-0-31.png]
5.1.2   Provisions Which May Not be Varied by the Zoning Board of Adjustment
   In no event shall the Zoning Board of Adjustment grant a variance:
   (A)   That would allow the establishment of a use which is not otherwise
allowed in a zoning district or which would change the zoning district
classification of any or all of the affected property;
   (B)   From any written conditions attached by the Village Council to its
approval of a special use, subdivision plat, site plan, and conditional
district or from the stated terms of an approved master land use plan for a
planned development.
5.1.3   Application Requirements; Determination of Completeness
   (A)   An application for a variance may be filed only by the owner of the
land affected by the variance; an agent or contract purchaser specifically
authorized by the owner to file such application; or any unit of government
which is not the owner of the lot but proposes to acquire the lot by purchase,
gift, or condemnation. Where an agent, or contact purchaser files the
application, the agent, or contract purchaser shall provide the Village with
written documentation the owner of the property has authorized the filing of
the application;
   (B)   An application for a variance shall be filed with the Village Planner
on a variance application form using the Village’s Online Permit Center along
with the associated fee.
   (C)   The application shall contain, or be accompanied by, such information
and general concept plans (
Appendix C) (may be modified by Village Planner as appropriate) in electronic
format as required on the application form;
   (D)   The Village Planner shall determine whether the application for a
variance is complete. If the Planner determines that the application is not
complete, then he or she shall notify the applicant in writing of any
deficiencies and shall take no further steps to process the application until
the deficiencies are remedied. Once the application is complete, the Village
Planner shall schedule the application for consideration at a quasi-judicial
public hearing before the Zoning Board of Adjustment;
   (E)   After determining that the application is complete, the Village
Planner shall transmit to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, prior to the hearing
on the application, the application pertaining to such variance.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021; Ord. 21-14, passed 10-26-2021)
5.1.4   Action by the Zoning Board of Adjustment
   (A)   Upon receiving the application materials from the Village Planner, the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hold a quasi-judicial public hearing on the
proposed variance. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided and the
public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Section
4.1 of this Ordinance;
   (B)   In considering the application, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall
review the application materials, the general purpose and standards set forth
in this Section for the granting of variances, and all testimony and evidence
received by the Zoning Board of Adjustment at the quasi-judicial public
hearing;
   (C)   After conducting the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Adjustment
may:
      (1)   Have the authority to subpoena witnesses and may request additional
information;
      (2)   Continue the public hearing on the requested variance;
      (3)   Conduct an additional public hearing on the requested variance;
      (4)   Grant the requested variance;
      (5)   Deny the requested variance;
       (6)   Grant the requested variance with conditions. In granting any
variance, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach appropriate conditions,
provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the purpose and
objectives of this ordinance. The board may also attach conditions in order to
reduce or minimize any injurious effect of such variance upon other property in
the neighborhood and to ensure compliance with other terms of this ordinance.
   (D)   Any approval or denial of the request shall be by resolution,
accompanied by written findings of fact that the variance meets or does not
meet each of the standards set forth in Section
5.1.5. below, stating the reasons for such findings. The decision of the board
shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class
mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person who has submitted a
written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective;
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
5.1.5   Standards of Review
   When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter
of this ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of
this ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:
   (A)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the
ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;
   (B)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability;
   (C)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the
property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship;
   (D)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial
justice is achieved.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
5.1.6   Previously Granted Variances
   (A)   Any development for which a variance has been granted prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance, or prior to the effective date of any
amendment hereto which renders the development nonconforming, may be carried
out in accordance with the granted variance and shall be deemed lawfully
existing under the terms of this Ordinance, provided that:
      (1)   A building permit has been validly issued for the development prior
to the effective date of this Ordinance, or the amendment thereto which renders
the development non-conforming, and has not expired or been revoked;
      (2)   All features of the development that are not the specific subject
of the variance shall conform to all applicable requirements of this Ordinance.
   (B)   If the requirements of (A) above have not been met, then the
previously granted variance shall become null and void. Development of the
property therefore must meet all applicable requirements of this Ordinance,
except where the person has applied for and received a new variance pursuant to
the procedures and standards set forth in
Chapter 5 of this Ordinance.
5.1.7   Effect of Approval or Denial
   (A)   After the Zoning Board of Adjustment approves a variance, the
applicant shall follow the procedures set forth in
Chapter 4 and
Chapter 9 for the approval of all permits, certificates, and other approvals
required in order to proceed with development of the property. All orders,
decisions, determinations, and interpretations made by administrative officers
under those procedures shall be consistent with the variance granted to the
applicant by the Zoning Board of Adjustment;
   (B)   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall refuse to hear a variance request
that has previously been denied, unless it finds that there have been
substantial changes in the conditions or circumstances relating to the matter.
5.1.8   Appeals
   Appeals from the decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment in variance
decisions shall be to the Superior Court of Moore County by petition for a writ
of certiorari. Any such petition to the Superior Court shall be filed with the
court clerk no later than thirty (30) days after the date the decision of the
Zoning Board of Adjustment is filed in the Village Planner's office or after
the date a written copy of the decision is delivered to every party who has
filed a written request for such copy with the Zoning Board of Adjustment at
the public hearing, whichever is later. The copy of the decision shall be
delivered to the party by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 5.2   Administrative Modification of Dimensional Standards
   In keeping with the purpose of these regulations to accomplish coordinated,
balanced, and harmonious development in a manner which will best promote the
health, safety, and general welfare while avoiding undue and unnecessary
hardships, the Village Planner is authorized to approve certain requests for
deviation from dimensional standards.
   (A)   Required Application Information: General Concept Plan (
Appendix C ) (may be modified by Village Planner as appropriate) and any other
relevant information to demonstrate undue and unnecessary hardship.
   (B)   Conditions for Modification of Setbacks: Requests for deviation from
required setbacks set forth in this ordinance by up to ten percent (10%) of the
required setbacks or twenty-four (24) inches, whichever is less, may be
considered upon determination that one (1) or more of the following conditions
exists:
      (1)   There are site or structural conditions that preclude strict
adherence to the setback requirements, such as, but not limited to: the lot
does not meet the dimensional standards established for the zoning district in
which it is located; the lot has topographic limitations that require placement
of the structure into the required setback area; or the structure is physically
in line with an existing, legally established wall or walls of a principal
structure already within the minimum setback area.
      (2)   Any part of the proposed structure that would encroach into the
minimum setback area is less than fifty percent (50%) of the width of the
affected building facade(s).
      (3)   The part of the proposed structure that encroaches into the minimum
setback area is necessitated by a life-safety code, flood hazard reduction,
Americans with Disabilities Act standard, or other public safety code
requirements.
      (4)   The proposed structure will allow the preservation of significant
existing vegetation.
      (5)   A good faith error was made in the location of a building
foundation not exceeding one (1) foot due to either field construction or
survey error.
   (C)   Limitation on Administrative Discretion: The Village Planner has no
discretion to modify any requirements found in PDO
Chapter 8 Supplemental Requirements.
   (D)   All Decisions to be in Writing: Prior to rendering a decision, the
Village Planner shall notify the Village Manager in writing of any minor
deviation for approval.
   (E)   Administrative Authority is Permissive Only: The authority given to
the Village Planner to grant such modification shall be construed to be
permissive and not mandatory and the Village Planner may decline to make such
modification. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the
Village Planner's duties and rights under this chapter, or an applicant's right
to appeal the decision of the Village Planner to the Board of Adjustment.
   (F)   Public Notification: None required
   (G)   Appeals: In the event that the Village Planner declines to make a
modification to the dimensional standards, the applicant shall have the right
to submit an application to the Board of Adjustment to grant a variance to
these requirements or to submit an application to appeal the Village Planner's
ruling in accordance with
Chapter 5.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 5.3   Appeals of Administrative Decisions
5.3.1   Purpose and Scope
   Appeals to the Zoning Board of Adjustment from the decisions of the
Village's administrative staff on actions and/or decisions pursuant to this
ordinance or other ordinances that regulate land use or development are allowed
under this Ordinance in order to ensure that any enforcement action taken by
such an administrative office pursuant to duties assigned by this Ordinance, is
consistent with the terms and purposes of this Ordinance and any related
policies or ordinances adopted by the Village. It is the intention of this
Section that all questions arising in connection with the enforcement of the
zoning provisions of this Ordinance shall be presented first to the Village
Planner, that such questions shall be presented to the Zoning Board of
Adjustment only on appeal from the decisions of those departments, and that
recourse from the decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be to the
courts. It is further the intention of this Section that the duties of the
Village Council in connection with this Ordinance shall not include the hearing
or passing upon disputed questions that may arise in connection with the
enforcement thereof.
   (A)   Process for Administrative Appeals:

IMAGES/0-0-0-33.png]
5.3.2   Decisions Which May Be Appealed
   Any order, requirement, permit, decision, determination, or refusal made by
any administrative officer in enforcing the provisions of this Ordinance may be
appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The official who made the decision
shall give written notice to the owner of the property.
5.3.3   Persons Who May File An Appeal
   An appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment may be brought by any person of
standing under North Carolina General Statute § 160D-405(b).
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
5.3.4   Filing of Appeal
   (A)   An application for an appeal shall be filed with the Village Clerk on
an appeal form using the Village’s Online Permit Center along with the
associated fee as prescribed on the most recent Village of Pinehurst fee
schedule;
   (B)   The application shall be filed no later than thirty (30) days after
the date of the contested action has been provided in writing. Any other person
with standing to appeal shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt from any
source of actual or constructive notice of the decision in which to file;
   (C)   The application shall contain or be accompanied by the information
required on the application form and shall state the grounds for the appeal;
   (D)   The Village Planner shall determine whether the appeal application is
complete. If the Village Planner determines that the application is not
complete, then he or she shall notify the applicant in writing of any
deficiencies and shall take no further steps to process the application until
the deficiencies are remedied. Once the application is complete, the Village
Planner shall schedule the appeal for consideration at a quasi-judicial public
hearing before the Zoning Board of Adjustment;
   (E)   The official who made the decision shall transmit to the board all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the
appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if
the appellant is not the owner;
   (F)   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays
enforcement of the action appealed from unless the official who made the
decision certifies to the board of adjustment after notice of appeal has been
filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in
nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In
that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining
order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not
stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited
hearing of the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the
appeal within fifteen (15) days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming
that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay
the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such
property; in these situations the appellant may request and the board may grant
a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected
by the issue being appealed;
   (G)   Subject to the provisions of subdivision (F) of this subsection, the
board of adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time;
   (H)   The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as
a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated
in the notice of appeal. If any party or the Village would be unduly prejudiced
by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the board
shall continue the hearing. The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any
order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The board
shall have all the powers of the official who made the decision;
   (I)   The parties to an appeal that has been made under this subsection may
agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. The
ordinance may set standards and procedures to facilitate and manage such
voluntary alternative dispute resolution.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021; Ord. 21-14, passed 10-26-2021)
5.3.5   Action by the Zoning Board of Adjustment
   (A)   Upon receiving the application materials from the Village Planner, the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hold a quasi-judicial public hearing on the
appeal. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided and the public hearing
shall be conducted in accordance with Section
4.1 of this Ordinance;
   (B)   Either at the public hearing or a subsequent meeting, the Zoning Board
of Adjustment shall adopt a resolution reversing, affirming, or modifying the
contested action;
   (C)   In reversing, affirming, or modifying the contested action, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall have all relevant powers of the administrative
officer from whom the appeal was taken;
   (D)   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall not reverse or modify the
contested action unless it finds that the administrative officer erred in the
application or interpretation of the terms of this Ordinance or related
policies adopted by the Village;
   (E)   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall not reverse or modify the
contested action unless there is a concurring vote of a majority of the
members.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
5.3.6   Effect of Reversal or Modification
   In the event that the Zoning Board of Adjustment reverses or modifies the
contested action, all subsequent actions taken by administrative officers with
regard to the subject matter shall be in accordance with the reversal or
modification granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
5.3.7   Appeal from the Zoning Board of Adjustment
   Any appeal from the decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment in regards to
administrative review shall be to the Superior Court of Moore County by
petition for a writ of certiorari. Any such petition to the Superior Court
shall be filed no later than thirty (30) days after the date the decision of
the Zoning Board of Adjustment is filed in the Village Planner's office. The
copy of the decision shall be delivered either by personal delivery, electronic
mail or first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person
who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision
becomes effective. When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three (3)
days shall be added to the time to file the petition.

CHAPTER 6. TEXT AMENDMENTS AND REZONINGS
Section 6.1   General Provisions
6.1.1   Purpose and Scope
   The Village Council, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Chapter, may amend the text of this Ordinance and rezone property (that is,
amend the classifications of property appearing on the Official Zoning Map).
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide the procedures for doing so. The
purpose is not to relieve particular hardships, nor to confer special
privileges or rights on any person, but only to make adjustments to the text of
this Ordinance and to the Official Zoning Map that are necessary in light of
changed conditions, adopted plans or changes in public policy, or that are
necessary to advance the general welfare of the Village and are in furtherance
of Section

IMAGES/0-0-0-35.png]
6.1.2   Initiation of Amendments
   An amendment to the text of this Ordinance or a rezoning may be initiated by
the Village Council, Planning and Zoning Board, or by anyone who owns property
or resides in the jurisdiction of this Ordinance or their agent, lessee, or any
contract purchaser specifically authorized by all of the owners to file such
application for such amendment, or any owner of a legal equitable interest in
land located in the jurisdiction of this ordinance. An application for rezoning
to a conditional district may only be initiated by the owner(s) of all of the
property included or upon their written authorization.
6.1.3   Filing and Content of Applications

time and place;
      (2)   The applicant submits a summary report indicating the results of
the meeting;
      (3)   No member of the Planning and Zoning Board or Village Council may
participate in a neighborhood meeting in an official capacity. The applicant
may conduct additional neighborhood meetings during the amendment process at
the applicant's discretion.
   (D)   The Village Planner shall determine whether the application is
complete. If the Village Planner determines that the application is not
complete, then he or she shall notify the applicant in writing of any
deficiencies and shall take no further steps to process the application until
the deficiencies are remedied. Once the application is complete, the Village
Planner shall schedule the application for consideration at a public meeting
before the Planning and Zoning Board and legislative public hearing before the
Village Council;
   (E)   An application for rezoning to a general use district shall not be
converted into an application for rezoning to a conditional district at any
point in the application review process, nor shall an application for rezoning
to a conditional district be converted into an application for rezoning to a
general use district. Rather, the applicant must submit a new application for
rezoning to the other district in accordance with the requirements of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021; Ord. 21-14, passed 10-26-2021)
6.1.4   Staff Review
   Prior to the public meeting, the Village Planner and other appropriate
Village Staff shall prepare a report to the Planning and Zoning Board and the
Village Council. This report shall include a discussion of all plans and
policies that have been adopted by the Village and are relevant to the proposed
amendment, a summary of any neighborhood meetings (if required), along with a
recommendation by the Village Planner regarding whether to approve or deny the
proposed amendment.
6.1.5   Review by Planning and Zoning Board
   The Planning and Zoning Board shall consider each proposed amendment and map
amendment and shall make recommendations to the Village Council regarding
whether to approve or deny each proposed amendment. In considering each
proposed amendment, the Planning and Zoning Board shall conduct a meeting
Public Hearing on the application. After review, the Planning and Zoning Board
will formulate a recommendation and forward it to the Village Council for
consideration. At the time of recommendation the Planning and Zoning Board
shall make a statement on if the proposed amendment is consistent with the
Comprehensive Long Range Plan.
6.1.6   Review and Action by the Village Council
   (A)   A text amendment or rezoning may be adopted only after the Village
Council has conducted a legislative public hearing on the proposed amendment,
at which parties interested in the proposed amendment shall have an opportunity
to be heard. Notice of the hearing shall be provided and the legislative public
hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Section
4.1 of this Ordinance and as required by this Ordinance;

(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
6.1.7   Waiting Period for Subsequent Applications
   (A)   When a rezoning application has been denied by the Village Council, or
withdrawn, after notice has been given of the public hearing on the
application, no rezoning application covering the same property for the same
district shall be accepted or considered within twelve (12) months after the
date of the denial or withdrawal;
   (B)   The waiting period required by this Section may be waived in an
individual case, for good cause shown, by the affirmative majority vote of the
members of the Village Council.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
6.1.8   Development Agreements
   Development agreements provide for a written agreement between a developer
and the village to address the challenges and timing of build-out of large-
scale projects. Agreements are appropriate for multi-phase projects requiring
long-term commitment for public and private resources requiring careful
coordination for planning, financing, and construction, but are not size-
restricted. A development agreement is not a mechanism for a variance from the
standards of this ordinance.
   (A)   Concurrent Submittal. The agreement may be considered concurrently
with a zoning map or text amendment affecting the property and development
subject to the development agreement. A development agreement may be
concurrently considered with and incorporated by reference with a sketch plan
or preliminary plat required under a subdivision regulation or a site plan or
other development approval required under a zoning regulation. If incorporated
into a conditional district, the provisions of the development agreement shall
be treated as a development regulation in the event of the developer's
bankruptcy.
   (B)   Content. A development agreement shall contain the following.
      (1)   A description of the property and the names of legal and equitable
property owners.
      (2)   Length of the agreement.
      (3)   Development uses permitted including population densities,
intensities, building types, placement on site and design.
      (4)   A description of public facilities defining:
         (a)   Who will provide the facility;
         (b)   When the facility will be provided;
         (c)   A schedule demonstrating services will be provided concurrent
with the development requiring the service;
         (d)   Determination of project deliverables by the developer that
trigger successful performance for the requirement of the service.
      (5)   A description of land reserved or dedicated for public purposes.
      (6)   Any other terms regarding public health, safety, or welfare.
      (7)   Any provisions for the preservation and restoration of historic
structures.
      (8)   A development schedule may be provided including commencement and
completion dates.
      (9)   The agreement may contain penalties for material breach of the
agreement.
      (10)   Other matters agreed to by the parties within the scope consistent
with this ordinance.
   (C)   Parties to the agreement. The agreement may include other local
government or regional utility authorities but must specify which local
government is responsible for overall administration.
   (D)   Procedural Requirements.
      (1)   Before entering into a development agreement, Village Council shall
conduct a legislative hearing on the proposed agreement subject to the notice
provisions of NCGS § 160D-602 for zoning map amendments. The notice shall
contain the following:
         (a)   Location of the subject property.
         (b)   Proposed uses.
         (c)   Where a copy of the proposed agreement may be obtained.
      (2)   The applicant is encouraged to move the development agreement
concurrent with other project approvals such as zoning amendments. No
development approvals may be issued until such time as the agreement is
recorded.
      (3)   Upon approval, the development agreement shall be recorded at the
Moore County Register of Deeds within fourteen (14) days of execution.
   (E)   Breach and Cure.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to periodically review the
agreement annually to ensure good-faith compliance with the agreement.
      (2)   If the developer has committed a material breach of the agreement,
the developer shall be notified in writing the nature of the breach, the
evidence supporting the finding and a time-period in which to correct the
breach.
      (3)   If the developer fails to correct the material breach within the
time given, the local government may unilaterally terminate or modify the
agreement subject to appeal to the Board of Adjustment.
      (4)   The agreement is enforceable by any party to the agreement, and
action for injunctive relief may be filed to enforce the terms of the
agreement.
   (F)   Amendment or Termination. A development agreement may be amended or
terminated by mutual consent of the parties.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
Section 6.2   Special Provisions for Conditional Districts
   It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be
inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of special conditions.
Conditional District rezonings are provided as a voluntary alternative method
of petitioning the Village Council for a zoning map amendment. In accordance
with NCGS § 160D-703(b), the owner or their authorized agent is authorized to
submit a rezoning application that proposes conditions and/or use limitations
that are more restrictive than would otherwise be allowed in the corresponding
general use zoning district. Requests for the rezoning of property to a
Conditional District shall be considered and treated the same as any other
rezoning in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.1, except as
modified by this section.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
6.2.1   Application Procedures

district shall be met as minimum standards for any Conditional District except
as specified in Section
6.2.4(B).

permitted except those allowed in the corresponding general use district as
permitted uses, uses permitted with special requirements, or uses permitted
with a Special Use Permit as indicated in Section
8.5.1a, Table of Permitted Special Uses and Special Requirements. Where an
intended use is a special use, the authorization of a Conditional District
pursuant to this section shall preclude any requirement for obtaining a Special
Use Permit in a separate procedure. The intended special uses shall be made
part of the application.
   (D)   Content of Application: A Conditional District application shall
consist of a General Concept Plan (
Appendix C); as well as any other plans, drawings, renderings, elevations, maps
and documents specifically included by the applicant as development documents
for approval by the Village Council. The General Concept Plan, as a site-
specific conditional zoning plan, is itself a condition of the Conditional
District rezoning. All materials shall be submitted electronically using the
Village’s online Permit Center. The provisions of the Conditional District
General Concept Plan shall replace all conflicting development regulations set
forth in this ordinance which would otherwise apply to the development site.

      (1)   After required public notice for a legislative public hearing has
been given, no changes shall be made to the conditions associated with the
Conditional District General Concept Plan and the application which are less
restrictive than those stipulated in the application. However, more restrictive
conditions may be added to the General Concept Plan and the application during
the public hearing upon the mutual agreement of the applicant and the body
conducting the public hearing or meeting.
      (2)   An application for rezoning to a Conditional District shall not be
converted into an application for rezoning to a general use district at any
point in the application review process, nor shall an application for rezoning
to a general use district be converted into an application for rezoning to a
Conditional District. Rather, the applicant must submit a new application for
rezoning to the other district in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter.
   (C)   Fair and Reasonable Conditions: In approving a Conditional District
rezoning, the Village Council may impose such additional reasonable and
appropriate safeguards upon the Conditional District General Concept Plan and
application as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of
this ordinance are served. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to,
the location, nature, hours of operation, and extent of the proposed use(s).
The applicant will have a reasonable opportunity to consider, respond and agree
to any conditions and site-specific standards proposed by the Village Council
prior to final action.
(Ord. 21-12, passed 07-27-2021)
6.2.3   Effect of Approval/Changes
   The applicant may proceed with development only after approval of the
Conditional District General Concept Plan by Village Council, followed by
approval of any necessary Site Plans or Subdivision Plats, except that all
subsequent approvals shall be completed by the Village Planner. The development
and use of all land within the Conditional District shall be in keeping with
the approved General Concept Plan and all applicable provisions therein.
   (A)   Approval of Phasing: Proposed phases of development shall be shown on
the General Concept Plan. Each phase of development shall adhere to all
applicable provisions and standards of this section and the applicable
Conditional District General Concept Plan. Each completed phase shall comply
with the minimum standards of this ordinance where practical.
   (B)   Substantial Changes: Any substantial change to an approved General
Concept Plan as noted below shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Board
and approved or denied by the Village Council as an amended Conditional
District. The following changes to a CD General Concept Plan shall require
approval by the Village Council:
      (1)   Land area being added or removed from the Conditional District.
      (2)   Modification of special performance criteria, design standards, or
other requirements specified by the enacting ordinance.
      (3)   A change in land use or development type beyond that permitted by
the approved General Concept Plan.
      (4)   When there is introduction of a new vehicular access point to an
existing street, road or thoroughfare not previously designated for access.
      (5)   When there is an increase in the total number of residential
dwelling units originally authorized by the approved General Concept Plan.
      (6)   When the total floor area of a commercial or industrial
classification is increased more than ten percent (10%) beyond the total floor
area last approved by Village Council.
      (7)   When the total height of a structure is increased more that ten
percent (10%) beyond the total height last approved by the Village Council.
      (8)   When perimeter buffers and shown perimeter landscape areas are
modified in any way except for like replacements of materials or planting
stock.
      (9)   When open space is decreased or impervious area is increased.
      (10)   When the proposed change has a discernible impact on neighboring
properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or sue the proposed
development.
   (C)   Additional Changes: All other changes to a CD General Concept Plan
shall receive approval by the Village Planner. However, if in the judgment of
the Village Planner, the requested changes alter the basic development concept
of the CD, the Village Planner may require concurrent approval by the Village
Council following the same process as the original Conditional District
approval.
   (D)   Revocation of Conditional Districts
      (1)   The Applicant shall secure a valid building or development permit
(s) within two (2) years from date of approval of the Conditional District
unless otherwise specified. If such project is not complete or a valid building
or development permit is not in place at the end of the two (2) year period,
the Village Planner shall notify the applicant of either such finding. Within
sixty (60) calendar days of notification, the Village Planner shall make a
recommendation concerning the revocation of the Conditional District to the
Village Council. The Village Council may then revoke the Conditional District,
or extend the life of the Conditional District for a specified period of time.
The revocation of a Conditional District shall follow the same procedure as was
needed for approval as outlined in
Chapter 6. Upon revocation the subject property zoning shall revert back to its
previous zoning classification.
      (2)   If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these
regulations is found to be illegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail
to comply with any condition, the project shall be remanded back to the Village
Council for a new proceeding.
6.2.4   Standards for Conditional Districts (CD)
   (A)   Standards: Within a Conditional District (CD), petitioners may place
additional requirements or standards onto themselves and their property or ask
that certain use allowances identified in the specific zoning category or
provisions in Chapters 2-12 be decreased. If no specific request is made by the
petitioner to the change in the development standards or if the petition is
silent on the point, it shall be understood that the underlying zoning district
guidelines and standards shall apply.

the specific provisions detailed in Chapters 8 & 9 as part of a Conditional
District application except as stipulated in the following table:

upon proposed amendments to or repeal of this Ordinance or parts thereof.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 7.2   Penalties for Violations
   (A)   Liabilities for Violations: Any person who erects, constructs,
reconstructs, demolishes, alters, repairs, converts, or maintains any building
or structure in violation of this Ordinance, and any person who uses any
building, structure, or land in violation of the Ordinance, shall be subject to
civil and criminal penalties in accordance with this Section.
      (1)   Civil Penalties: Violation of this Ordinance through the acts
listed in Subsection (A) above shall subject the offender to a civil penalty in
the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) per day for each day the violation

debt if the offender does not pay the penalty within the prescribed period of
time after he or she has been cited for violation;
      (2)   Criminal Penalties: In addition to, or in lieu of, such civil
penalties or other remedies listed above, violation of this Ordinance shall
constitute a misdemeanor, pursuant to North Carolina NCGS §160A-175 and North
Carolina NCGS §14-4, as amended, punishable for each day the violation
continues by a fine of up to five hundred ($500) dollars and/or incarceration
for up to thirty (30) days.

(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 7.3   Notice of Violation and Citation Procedure
   (A)   Notice Required Before Penalty: No penalty shall be assessed pursuant
to Section
7.2  above unless and until the person or property owner alleged to be in
violation has been notified of the violation in accordance with this Section;
   (B)   Notice of Violation and Opportunity to Cure: Whenever the Planning and
Inspections Department or Village Planner has reasonable cause to believe that
a person is violating or a property is in violation of any of the provisions of
this Ordinance or any plan, order, or condition which has been approved,
issued, or imposed pursuant to this Ordinance, the Department shall promptly
notify that person or property owner of the violation. If the property appears
to be occupied by someone other than the owner notice shall also be sent to the
physical address of the property and addressed to "current resident", however
the property owner is still the responsible entity for compliance and legal
action. Such notice of violation shall be in writing and shall be served by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested or by posting notice on
the property in a conspicuous place on the property. The notice of violation
shall describe the violation, shall identify the provision or provisions of
this Ordinance which are being violated, shall specify what actions must be
taken to correct the violation (including an order to stop any and all work
which violates this Ordinance), shall direct the person to correct the
violation within a specified reasonable time period (beginning on the date such
notice is received), and shall warn that more severe measures (such as a civil
penalty or criminal prosecution) may be assessed or brought against the person
if he or she fails to take appropriate action to cure or correct the violation.
If the violator cannot be ascertained, then the notice of violation shall be
sent to the record owner of the land on which the violation occurs. If the
violation is cured or corrected within the time period specified in the notice
of violation, then the Village shall take no further action against the person;
   (C)   Extension of Time to Cure: Upon receipt of a written or verbal request
from the alleged violator or the property owner for an extension of time to
cure or correct the violation, the Village Planner or Planning and Zoning
Department may grant a single extension of time, not to exceed a period of
thirty (30) days, in which the alleged violator may cure or correct the
violation before the Village issues a citation pursuant to Subsection (D)
below. Such extension of time shall not be granted unless the alleged violator
or the property owner can demonstrate to the Department that the violation
cannot be cured or corrected within the time period specified in the notice of
violation because the labor or materials needed to take appropriate action are
unavailable due to circumstances beyond the control of the alleged violator or
the property owner;
   (D)   Citation for Violation: Any person who, after being given a notice of
violation pursuant to Subsection (B) above, does not comply with this Ordinance
within the time period set forth in the notice of violation, and who continues
such violation, shall be subject to the civil and/or criminal penalties set
forth in Section
7.2  above. The Village shall serve a written citation on the alleged violator
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested or by posting notice
on the property in a conspicuous place on the property. If the violator cannot
be ascertained, then the notice of violation shall be sent to the record owner
of the land on which the violation occurs. The citation shall again describe
the nature of the violation and any actions that the alleged violator must take
to cure or correct the violation, and shall specify the amount of any civil
penalty that shall be levied against the alleged violator. The civil penalty
shall be paid, or the violation shall be cured or corrected, within seventy-two
(72) hours of receipt of the citation by the alleged violator, or such other
time period, not to exceed thirty (30) days, as the citation may specify;
   (E)   Action for Recovery of Penalty and for Corrective Action: If payment
is not made, or the violation is not cured or corrected, within that time, then
the matter shall be referred to the Village Attorney for institution of a civil
action in the name of the Village, in a court of competent jurisdiction, for
recovery of the penalty, for an order of abatement, and for initiation of a
criminal prosecution. Any sums recovered in such actions shall be used to carry
out the purposes and requirements of this Ordinance. When a violation occurs
and an order of abatement is obtained, if the violator fails or refuses to
comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed
by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the Village may execute the
order of abatement. The Village shall have a lien on the property for the cost
of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and material
man's lien as provided for by N.C. NCGS §160A-175;
   (F)   Summary Removal of Dangerous Signs: In the case of a sign or sign
structure which the Planning and Inspections Department or the Village Planner
reasonably deems to be in danger of falling or otherwise creating an immediate
safety hazard, the Department or Planner is hereby authorized to promptly cause
the removal of such sign or sign structure at the expense of the property
owner.

Section 7.4   Injunctive Relief and Other Remedies
   (A)   This Ordinance also may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy
issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In any event where a building
or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired,
converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or land is used in
violation of the Ordinance, the Village Engineer, the Planning and Inspections
Department, the Village Planner or any other appropriate agency of the Village
in addition to other remedies, may institute an injunction action, court order,
or other appropriate proceeding to prevent the completion or occupation of such
building, structure, or land and/or to stop and correct any development,
situation, or other activity that violates this Ordinance.
   (B)   Upon determining that an alleged violation is occurring or is
threatened, the court may enter such orders and/or judgments as are necessary
to abate or prevent the violation;
   (C)   The institution of an action for injunctive or other relief under this
Section shall not relieve any party to such proceeding from any civil or
criminal penalty prescribed by this Chapter for violations of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014)
Section 7.5   Violations of Approved Plans
   (A)   A stop work order may be issued by any appropriate authority for
violations of approved plans and the owner of the property may be subject to
any other penalties described in this Chapter, until compliance is met.
Violations include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Failure to install or maintain protection measures;
      (2)   Disturbance of existing grade beyond the proposed limits of grading
as indicated on the approved landscaping and appearance plans so as to disturb
the root zone of any significant vegetation indicated for preservation;

chemicals, or excessive temperatures, such as from fire;
      (5)   Cutting or wounding of plants;
      (6)   Damaging and/or destroying significant vegetation, buffers or tree
save areas;
      (7)   Any development not in accordance with the approved site plan.
   (B)   Conditional or Temporary Violations of Certificates of Occupancy: If a
conditional or temporary Certificate of Occupancy expires, or if the required
work is not completed within the allowed time, then the conditional or
temporary permit is void and any continued operation shall be in violation of
this Ordinance;
   (C)   Violations after Development: If a final Certificate of Occupancy is
issued and the required work is later found to be out of compliance by the
Village, then the owner will be subject to all of the penalties of this
Ordinance.

8.3.3.7   Stream Buffers
   (A)   In all developments under this Section, a stream buffer of minimum
width of one hundred (100) feet is hereby established along all perennial
waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S. Geologic Survey 1:24,000
(7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by local government
studies located within the Watershed Protection Districts. The width of each
stream buffer, measured perpendicular to the banks of the stream, shall be
equal to one hundred (100) feet on each side of the stream;
   (B)   No land-disturbing activities shall take place within any stream
buffer, except for required streets and associated facilities, utility mains
and easements, greenways and pedestrian paths. Where no practicable alternative
exists, roads and golf courses may cross a buffer, provided that they do not
cross at a horizontal angle of less than 60 degrees. Nothing in this Section
shall be construed to prevent desirable artificial stream banks shoreline
stabilization;
   (C)   Stream buffers shall be shown on all site plans and subdivision plats
approved within the Watershed Protection District.
8.3.3.8   Street Construction

Pinehurst Engineering Standards and Specifications Manual; provided that such
projects shall, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize built-upon surface
area, direct storm water away from surface waters and incorporate Best
Management Practices to minimize water quality impacts by:
      (1)   Installing outlets to convey all storm water to grass swales or
vegetated areas meeting NCDENR design standards for Best Management Practices
prior to the runoff discharging to waters;
      (2)   Obtaining from the Village Engineer approval for any site-specific
proposal to minimize the impact of the proposed street on water quality in any
site-specific area where option 1 cannot be practicably implemented. Any site-
specific proposal to be employed in a water supply watershed area as part of
this standard shall be accompanied by adequate computations and documentation
to demonstrate that the proposal will provide at least eighty-five percent
(85%) TSS removal in accordance with the design standards of the NCDWQ "BMP
Design Manual".

Section 8.4   Conditional Zoning Districts
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/cc72933236219e250de7fc7e2923c6895958ed66/
IMAGES/0-0-0-781.jpg]Publisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new
legislation (Ord. 23-13, adopted 5-28-2023). The text of the amendment will be
incorporated below when the ordinance is codified.
8.4.1   Purpose and Intent
   It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be
inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of special conditions. Where
the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in
such situations, the Conditional District is a means by which such special
conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the purposes of this Ordinance.
In addition, Conditional Districts ensure that development is consistent with
adopted plans including the Comprehensive Plan, Small Area Plans and Form Based
Guidance Plans. The Conditional District classification will be considered for
rezoning only upon request of a property owner. If for any reason any condition
imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if
the applicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this
Ordinance that the authorization of such Conditional District Permit shall be
null and void and of no effect and that proceedings shall be instituted to
rezone the property to its previous zoning classification.
(Ord. 23-13, passed 5-23-2023)
8.4.2   Conditional Districts
   For each General Use and Form Based District establish in    Section
8.2, there is also established a corresponding Conditional District as follows:
   (A)   PC-CD - Public Conservation Conditional District;
   (B)   R-210 CD - Residential Conditional District;
   (C)   R-15 CD - Residential Conditional District;
   (D)   R-20 CD - Residential Conditional District;
   (E)   R-30 CD - Residential Conditional District;
   (F)   R-5 CD - Residential Conditional District;
   (G)   R-8 CD - Residential Conditional District;
   (H)   R-10 CD - Residential Conditional District;
   (I)   R-MF-CD - Residential Multi-Family Conditional District;

(Ord. 14-35, passed 09-24-2014; Ord. 23-13, passed 5-23-2023)
Section 8.5   Tables of Permitted and Special Uses and Special Requirements
   The Tables of Permitted and Special Uses and Special Requirements which
follow contain a listing of uses which may be permitted in one (1) or more of
the various General Use Zoning Districts established by this Ordinance.
(Ord. 23-13, passed 5-23-2023)
8.5.1   Symbols Used on Table of Uses
   An "X" or "SU" or "SR" opposite the listed use in the District column(s)
indicates the District or Districts in which a particular listed use may be
permitted. The meanings of the entries in the Table are as follows:
   (A)   "X" indicates the use is permitted by right and a Development Permit
may be obtained, subject to meeting all the requirements of this Ordinance for
a Development Permit;
   (B)   SU indicates the use requires approval of a Special Use Permit by the
Village Council in accordance with the procedures of Section
4.5 before obtaining a Development Permit;
   (C)   “CZ” indicates that a specific use, development or subdivision may
only be permitted through a conditional zoning district that is parallel to the
underlying zoning district (see Section 8.2 and 8.4). The conditional zoning
district designation must be approved before the use may be established,
development permit issued, and conformance with all applicable development and
design standards achieved as provided in this ordinance. All nonconforming uses
and structures shall be governed under Section 2.3 of this ordinance.
   (D)   The column on the far right, labeled "SR" (Special Requirements) means
that there are additional special requirements for the development or use for
compliance. These requirements are contained in Section 8.6, "Special
Requirements to the Table of Permitted and Special Uses." For any use subject
to a Special Use Permit, the Special Requirement along with the requirements of
this Ordinance shall represent the minimum conditions for issuance of a Special
Use Permit; when "SR" appears for use within a zoning district, special
requirements shall apply. The Special Requirements (SR's) are numbered by the
Table of Uses categories. Numbers SR-1 through SR-99 are Principal Uses,
numbers SR-100 through SR 199 are Accessory Uses; and numbers SR 200 through SR
299 are Temporary Uses. The "SR" will also appear in the column of the general
use district in which the special requirements apply.
   (E)   The listing of a use in the Table of Permitted and Special Uses and
Special Requirements in no way relieves that use of having to meet all local,
State and Federal laws pertaining to the establishment and operation of that
use;
   (F)   In the event a use is not listed, the Village Planner may determine if
a materially similar use exists and is defined by this ordinance. If a
materially similar land use is determined by the Village Planner, the
determination shall be made in writing and all applicable regulations and
standards with that use shall apply to the unlisted use. Such determinations by
the Village Planner may be appealed pursuant to
Chapter 5 of this ordinance. If a use is not listed and a materially similar
use does not exist, an application may be filed to amend this ordinance
pursuant to
Chapter 6.

ensure the proper and uniform development of parking areas throughout the
jurisdiction of the Village, off-street parking for each land use shall be
provided in accordance with the standards established in this Chapter. The
provision of off-street parking shall not be required in the VC, and PC

comply with this Section.
9.4.1.1   Off-Street Parking Space Requirements
   (A)   Parking Spaces Required: Permanent off-street parking spaces shall be
provided as specified by this Section: (1) at the time a building is erected;
(2) at the time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity,
such as by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, floor area, or other
units of measurement used in Table of Required Parking 9.4 or; (3) before
conversion from one type of use or occupancy to another if the new use requires
additional parking space. Such parking spaces may be provided in a parking
garage or in an improved open area, shared parking may be permitted in
accordance with section
9.4.1.3 . In the VMU District credit will be given to count toward the minimum
amount of parking required for each on street parking space located within one

This information shall be in sufficient detail to indicate whether or not the
requirements of this Section are met;
   (C)   Minimum Number of Required Spaces: Each principal and accessory use of
land shall be provided with the number of off-street parking spaces indicated
for that use in Table 9.4a;
   (D)   The Required Number of Parking Spaces Shall Be Calculated on the Use
(s) of the Site: The number of parking spaces on a given piece of property
shall be based on all of the principal and accessory uses of that property. If
a property is used for several uses, all uses shall be taken into account. The

9.4.1.2   Location and Design of Parking Areas/Stacking Lanes
   (A)   All parking areas shall be located and designed so as to avoid undue
interference with the use of public streets and alleys;
   (B)   A minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of all parking areas shall be
paved. Twenty-five percent (25%) of parking areas may be graded gravel. All
parking areas shall be in accordance with the Village of Pinehurst Engineering
Standards and Specifications Manual. Parking areas serving public park
facilities as defined in the Village of Pinehurst Comprehensive Parks and
Recreation Master Plan may consist of one hundred percent (100%) graded gravel.
   (C)   Each parking area shall meet all applicable landscaping, screening,
and buffering requirements set forth in this Ordinance;
   (D)   All parking areas shall be separated at least ten (10) feet from
buildings and all associated driveways and aisles shall be separated at least
five (5) feet from buildings in order to allow room for sidewalks, landscaping,
and other plantings between the building and the parking area;
   (E)   Each parking space shall be provided with curbing, a tire stop, or, in
the case of unpaved spaces, railroad ties or similar material as set forth in
the Village of Pinehurst Engineering Standards and Specifications Manual;
   (F)   The parking area may be used only for parking and not for any type of
loading, sales, dead storage, repair work, dismantling, or servicing of
vehicles except as otherwise may be permitted by this Ordinance;
   (G)   All entrances, exits, and drainage plans shall be reviewed and
approved by the Village Engineer in accordance with the Village of Pinehurst
Engineering Standards and Specifications Manual and shall be constructed before
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy;
   (H)   All parking spaces, aisles between parking spaces, and parking space
modules, shall meet the minimum dimensional requirements and geometric design
standards set forth in the Village of Pinehurst Engineering Standards and
Specifications Manual.
   (I)   Parking associated with Village of Pinehurst passive recreation
facilities may be provided as on- street parking. This on-street parking must
be approved by the Village Council.
   (J)   Where drive-thrus or drive up facilities are provided, appropriate
space shall be provided to accommodate not less than three (3) cars per
stacking lane.
   (K)   Up to twenty percent (20%) of the total number of parking spaces
required may be provided by compact or alternative transportation spaces.
Compact parking spaces shall be not less than eight (8) feet in width.
   (L)   Alternate paving systems for parking areas may be allowed based on
site conditions, performance factors and emergency access requirements.
9.4.1.3   Shared Parking
   (A)   One parking area may contain required spaces for several different
uses, but except as otherwise provided in this Section, the required space
assigned to one use may not be credited to any other use.
   (B)   The Village Planner may approve the joint use of parking spaces for
uses generating parking demands at different times subject to the Applicant's
demonstration that the available parking will be sufficient for both uses and
the provision of a shared parking agreement pursuant to paragraph (D) of this
Section. For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office
building on Monday through Friday but is generally ninety percent (90%) vacant
on weekends, another development that operated only on weekends could be
credited with ninety percent (90%) of the spaces on the lot. Or if a church
parking lot is generally occupied only to fifty percent (50%) of capacity on
days other than Sunday, another development could make use of fifty percent
(50%) of the church lot's spaces on those other days. To qualify as shared
parking for an establishment, spaces must be within five hundred (500) feet of
the main entrance as one would walk.
   (C)   Shared parking is permitted by agreement only. The agreement must:
      (1)   Be in writing and executed by all owners of the properties
affected;
      (2)   Specify the parking being shared and the hours of operation by the
uses involved.
      (3)   Be enforceable by the Village and approved by the Village Planner
and the Village Attorney.
      (4)   Be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds for Moore County
by the owner(s) of the property affected and a recorded copy furnished to the
Village Planner.
   (D)   An affidavit stating that the shared parking agreement is valid shall
be submitted to the Village Planner if any change in use or hours of operation
of the affected properties has occurred or at the request of the Village
Planner to the Village Planner.
   (E)   A violation shall occur if a use is operated at a time other than
during the hours of operation specified in the shared parking agreement. The
Village Planner may revoke the Certificate of Use or Occupancy for any use
operated in violation of a shared parking agreement.

Section 9.5   Landscaping and Buffering Requirements
Part 1.   General Standards
9.5.1.   Purpose and Scope
   The regulations of this Section are intended to establish buffer yards
associated with development activity within the Village of Pinehurst and its
ETJ. Buffer yards help to moderate visual contact, create spatial separation,
and minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties resulting from development.
Buffer yards also help to reduce the visual effects and the impacts of traffic,
noise, dust, and odor as well as to protect the privacy of neighbors. The
Village values its existing tree canopy, and these regulations also provide
incentives that allow existing qualifying trees to be used as part of the
buffers required by this Section. By doing so, these regulations will preserve
and enhance the visual character of Village and the ETJ and lessen the impacts
of the development.
(Ord. 21-06, passed - -)
9.5.1.1 Buffer Yards Established
   Buffer Yards: for the purposes of Sections
9.5 and
9.14.6, buffer yards are established and defined as follows. Yard lengths are
based on the most interior length of the setback line.
   (A)   Front Buffer: is equal to the depth of the front yard setback of the
zoning district extended to the side property lines.
   (B)   Rear Buffer: is equal to the depth of the rear yard setback of the
zoning district extended to the side property lines.
   (C)   Side Buffer: is equal to the width of the side yard setback from where
it intersects both the front and the rear yard.
   (D)   Side Street Buffer: is equal to the width of the side street setback
from where it intersects both the front and the rear yard.

(Ord. 21-06, passed - -)
9.5.1.2   Development Permit for Land Disturbing Activity
   A development permit is required prior to land disturbing activity when
there is no other active development application in process pursuant to this
Ordinance (e.g. Major or Minor Site Plan, Major or Minor Subdivision, Single
Family Development). The development permit application shall be accompanied by
a landscape plan when the applicant intends to plant the required buffer yard
trees or a tree survey if the applicant proposes to use qualifying trees to
meet the buffer yard requirements.
(Ord. 21-06, passed - -)
9.5.1.3   Landscape Plans and Tree Surveys
   (A)   Landscape plans shall contain the following information:
      (1)   Dimensions of the property lines;
      (2)   Location and dimensions of all required buffer yards;
      (3)   Location of construction access/driveways;
      (4)   Location of trees to be planted;
      (5)   Types of trees to be planted;
      (6)   Size and caliper of trees to be planted;
      (7)   Tree spacing; and
      (8)   Summary calculation table of required plantings by buffer yard.
   (B)   Tree surveys shall be prepared by a surveyor licensed in the state of
North Carolina. Tree surveys shall include the following:
      (1)   Dimensions of the property lines;
      (2)   Location and dimensions of all required buffer yards;
      (3)   Location of construction access/driveways;
      (4)   Location, diameter breast height, and species of all trees to be
retained within required buffer yards; and
      (5)   Summary calculation table of required plantings by buffer yard.
(Ord. 21-06, passed - -)
9.5.1.4   Buffer Yard Standards
   (A)   When a land disturbing activity requires issuance of a Development
Permit, and there is no other active development application in process
pursuant to this Ordinance (e.g. Major or Minor Site Plan, Major or Minor
Subdivision, Single Family Development) perimeter buffer yards must be
established per this Section. Planting credits may be used to satisfy buffer
yard requirements per 9.5.1.4(D) using existing qualifying trees.
 
Table 9.5.1.4 Buffer Yard Standards
Location                Number of Required Trees
Front Buffer Yard       1 qualifying tree per 25 linear feet of street frontage
Side Street Buffer Yard 1 qualifying tree per 25 linear feet of street frontage
Side Buffer Yard        1 qualifying tree per 35 linear feet
Rear Buffer Yard        1 qualifying tree per 25 linear feet
 
 
Planted Tree Type           Minimum Planting Height Minimum Planting Caliper
Evergreen Trees             6 feet                  2 inches
Tall Trees from Appendix F  8 feet                  2 inches
Short Trees from Appendix F 6 feet                  1.25 inches
 
   (B)   The number of required trees shall be measured in whole numbers. The
applicant may round down when calculating the number of trees.
   (C)   Driveway Allowance. Each parcel shall be provided a deduction for one
(1) 20 (twenty) foot wide driveway connection. In the event a driveway
intersects two different yards, the property owner shall select which yard
receives the credit. This deduction shall be applied by subtracting twenty (20)
feet from the linear foot calculation for number of required trees as shown in
Table 9.5.1.4 for the yard through which the connection is made.

         125' - 20' =105'
   105'/25' = 4 trees required for Front Buffer Yard
   (D)   Tree Planting Credits. To promote maintenance of the existing tree
canopy and preservation of specimen trees, planting credits may be provided
toward the requirements of
Table 9.5.1.4 for qualifying trees as follows:
      (1)   Tree planting credits apply to the buffer yard in which the tree is
located.
      (2)   One additional tree planting credit may be granted for every four
(4) inch increase in tree girth above twelve inches (12") DBH in the buffer
yard where the tree is located.
         Example: The front buffer yard is one hundred twenty-five (125) feet
in length and requires five (5) trees to comply with buffer yard planting
requirement. The front buffer yard contains a healthy twenty-four inches (24")
oak tree that will be retained per the landscape plan. Preservation of this
tree grants four (4) planting credits of the five (5) required trees. Note:
Maximum spacing requirements still apply within the front and side street
buffer yards.
      (3)   Trees subject to the planting credit may be grouped and are not
required to meet spacing requirements in the side and rear yards. In order to
ensure adequate street yard buffer and to maintain street tree canopy, trees
may be grouped in the front and side street buffer yards, however, there shall
be no distance less than one tree per every fifty (50) linear feet across the
frontage of the buffer yard.
   (E)   Planting Credit for Trees Less than eight (8) inches DBH. Where there
are insufficient trees present on the property to meet the requirements of
Table 9.5.1.4, planting credit may be provided for trees smaller than eight (8)
inches DBH but not less than three (3) inches DBH.
   (F)   Minor Modifications for Alternate Spacing and Grouping. The Village
Planner may authorize modifications to encourage preservation of existing trees
in lieu of planting subject to the following standards:
      (1)   To satisfy tree credits described in
9.5.1.1(D).
      (2)   To allow preservation of trees within a building envelope within a
distance no greater than the required buffer yard depth when insufficient trees
are available for preservation.
(Ord. 21-06, passed - -)
9.5.1.5   Exemptions from Buffer Yard Planting Requirements
   (A)   This article shall not restrict public utilities and electric
suppliers from maintaining safe clearance around existing utility lines, and
existing easements in accordance with applicable state laws.
   (B)   Dead, diseased or naturally fallen or severely damaged trees or
vegetation, or trees or vegetation that are a threat to the public health,
safety, or welfare based on photographic documentation, observation by the
Village Planner, or by the submittal of a report prepared by an arborist or
other landscape professional, should be removed. Replacement of the tree(s)
would only be subject to buffer requirements to maintain compliance with a
required landscape plan.
   (C)   Bona fide agricultural and forestry operations shall be exempt from
the provisions of this Article. This exemption applies to forestry activity on
forestland that is taxed on the basis of its present-use value as forestland
under G.S. Chapter 105, Article 12 and activities conducted in accordance with
an approved forestry management plan subject G.S. Chapter 89B and extends to
any activity defined as a bona fide farm operation in G.S. 160D-903 within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village.
   (D)   The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) shall be
exempt from buffer requirements of this Ordinance within NCDOT rights-of-way.
Tree removal in the Village rights-of-way must be approved by the Village
Manager or designee.
   (E)   All real properties owned by the Village of Pinehurst.
(Ord. 21-06, passed - -)
9.5.1.6   Noncompliance with Buffer Yard Standards
   (A)   On properties where land disturbing activity has occurred without a
development permit, buffer yards shall be established pursuant to this Section.
A landscape plan and development permit shall be submitted demonstrating
compliance with this Section.
   (B)   In addition, other remedies up to and including penalties may apply in
accordance with Chapter 7 of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 21-06, passed - -)
Part 2.   Landscaping Requirements for All Development Requiring
a Permit Other than Single-Family Residential
9.5.2.1   Purpose and Scope
   The natural landscape conditions within the Village of Pinehurst and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction typifies the North Carolina Sandhills and
Longleaf Pine Ecosystems. These natural conditions (topography, vegetation, and
wildlife) are unique within North Carolina and are the strongest visual aspects
defining the character of the Village. The purpose of the landscaping standards
in this Section shall be to create an appearance in which manmade development
is situated within a forest or naturalized setting all zoning districts. All
size standards in this section shall conform to the American Standards for
Nursery Stock.
(Ord. 21-06, passed - -)
9.5.2.2   Landscape Plan Required
   A landscape plan shall be submitted to the Village Planner and its approval
is a prerequisite for the issuance of a development permit where required.
(Ord. 21-06, passed - -)
9.5.2.3   Planted Buffers
   (A)   Permitted Uses Within Planted Buffer Areas: Planted buffers should be
left in an undisturbed natural vegetative state and provided with supplemental
plantings. Selective thinning of vegetation and removal of dead vegetation may
be permitted as long as the intent of the planted buffer requirement is
maintained. Driveways and utilities may cross a planted buffer at or as near a
perpendicular angle as practical. Paths and walkways may pass through the
planted buffer and pedestrian walkways (greenways) may be installed within the
buffer area. Grading in the designated planted buffer may be allowed with site
plan approval, if the re-vegetation plan is determined to meet the intent of
this Section;
   (B)   Location of Planted Buffers: Required planted buffers shall be
provided along the perimeter of development unless alternate locations are
approved by the Village Planner. Planted buffers shall be designated and
dimensioned on all site plans and subdivisions plans, where applicable;
   (C)   Public Pedestrian Easement Required: The full width of all buffer
areas shall be designated as a public pedestrian easement and shown on a
recorded plat;
   (D)   Application:
      (1)   These standards apply to all non-residential and multi-family uses
(including townhouse unit development) located within the Village of Pinehurst
and its extraterritorial jurisdiction except for properties containing only
museums and/or libraries as the primary use and located within the PC Zoning
District. Additionally, the Village Council may waive some or all of these
standards for developments and uses located within the VC, VMU, VCP and VR
Zoning Districts when determined to be in the best interest of the public. In
waiving these standards, the Village Council may require an alternate means of
buffering if agreed upon by the property owner. When nonresidential and multi-
family uses submit a site plan for locations next to property zoned for
primarily residential use, planted buffers shall be provided near the perimeter
of the nonresidential or multi-family property. One half of the planted buffers
requirements shall apply when a public street or railroad right-of-way
separates a nonresidential or multi-family uses from a residential property. If
a greenway passes through a landscape buffer the area of the greenway shall be
subtracted from the total buffer area for plant count purposes.
      (2)   The required planted buffer width is based on the classification
shown on
Table 9.5.1.2;
      (3)   If said project is adjacent to property that is zoned non-
residential or multi-family but is used for single family purposes, half the
required planted buffer width along the perimeter of the property adjoining
that property shall be required;
      (4)   A class 3 planted buffer shall be installed along and adjacent to
NC 2, Midland Road east of the traffic circle to the zoning jurisdictional
boundary of Pinehurst, on the west side of Hwy. 15/501 from the northern extent
of the zoning jurisdictional boundary of Pinehurst southward to the western

      (2)   The required setbacks may be used to meet landscape planted buffer
width requirements in all districts. When planted buffers are required for
residential uses, the planted buffer requirements shall be designated open
space, or common area;
      (3)   Planted buffer widths and required plantings may be reduced by
thirty percent (30%) if the site plan indicates a berm, alternate landscaping,
walls, opaque fencing in combination with landscaping or topographic features
which will, in the opinion of the Village Planner, achieve the intent of this
Section as outlined in Section 9.5.1 and result in equal or better performance.
In no case shall a buffer width be less than ten (10) feet. Berms may not have
a slope steeper than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical and must have a
crown width of at least two (2) feet and a minimum height of two (2) feet.
   (F)   Requirements for Planted Buffer Areas:
      (1)   Existing Vegetation. Existing vegetation, regardless of species,
shall be used to meet all or part of the requirements of this Section wherever
possible, if it provides the same level of obscurity as the planted buffer
required below. Vegetation to be saved shall be identified on site plans, along
with protection measures to be used during grading and construction. (See
Section
9.5.2.8 for protection measures and calculation of credits for existing trees);
      (2)   Planting requirements: Planting requirements for planted buffers
include both trees (large and small) and shrubs as described below. (See
Appendix F for a listing of native/water conserving trees and shrubs.) In
calculating buffer planting requirements, areas of driveways are excluded.
         (a)   Tree Standards: This requirement may be satisfied as follows:
            1.   One longleaf pine tree with a minimum size of three (3) inch
caliper at planting are required per two hundred (200) square feet of buffer
area.
            2.   Two understory trees a minimum of two-inch caliper are
required per five hundred (500) square feet of buffer area, one of which is to
be an evergreen species that is not a pine tree.
            3.   Trees shall be distributed along the entire length and width
of the planted buffer. Due to unique characteristics of a site, or design
objectives, alternative plant mixes and spacing may be approved by the Village
Planner.
         (b)   Shrub Standards: Shrubs, a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches in
height, of a variety that can be expected to reach four (4) to five (5) feet in
height and three (3) feet in width within three (3) years of planting, shall be
provided. Shrubs shall not be planted closer than six (6) feet to newly planted
trees, nor within the drip line of existing hardwood trees. Shrubs shall be
distributed along the entire length and width of the planted buffer, preferably
in naturalistic groupings so as not to create a hedge-like condition. Shrubs
shall be provided at one per seventy-five (75) square feet of buffer area.

9.5.2.4   Landscape Screens
   (A)   The purpose of a screen is to use plants and/or other landscape or
architectural elements to obscure views from all corridors or adjacent
properties.
      (1)   Structures such as loading docks, mini-warehouses, service courts,
dumpster areas, mechanical equipment, and outside storage of material stocks or
equipment, either for sale or not for sale on the premises, such as, but not
limited to, motor vehicles, equipment, or construction equipment shall be
screened from unobstructed off-site views. Uses requiring screening as noted in
this Ordinance shall be screened according to the requirements of this Section.
This screening requirement does not pertain to outdoor display of merchandise
located within the Historic Preservation Overlay District that complies with
the regulations and design guidelines of that district.
      (2)   Landscape Screen Standards: Features and uses specified above and/
or others requiring screens shall provide a visual obstruction from all
corridor and adjacent properties in conformance with the following standards:
The screen may be composed of view obscuring vegetation, wall, fence, or berm.
The items may be used individually or in combination. The minimum result shall
be a semi- opaque seventy-five percent (75%) screen that obscures views from
the ground to a height of the object being screened. Evergreen screening plants
shall be at least five (5) feet tall at the time of installation and reach the
desired height within three (3) years of planting. Additionally, screen areas
shall be sufficient size to allow for the mature growth of plant materials when
used.

9.7.1   General Purpose and Intent
   The purpose of this section and the other sign standards contained in this
chapter, is to support and complement the various land uses allowed in the
Village of Pinehurst by the adoption of standards concerning the placement of
signs. These standards are adopted under the zoning authority of the Village to
achieve the following:
   (A)   To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in
the Village while preserving the rights of free speech under the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution.
   (B)   To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the Village's
ability to attract sources of economic development and growth.
   (C)   To improve pedestrian and traffic safety.
   (D)   To minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and
private property.
9.7.1.1   Applicability
   (A)   Permits Required
      (1)   Except as otherwise stated in this section, signs which are allowed
under this section shall not be erected until and unless the person erecting
the sign or the property owner has obtained a development permit pursuant to
this Ordinance and, where required by the State Building Code, a building
permit from the Planning and Inspections Department. All signs requiring a
development permit shall be reviewed and approved by the Village Planner prior
to the issuance of a development permit, with the exception of proposed signage
located within the Historic Preservation Overlay district, which also shall be
reviewed and approved by the Historic Preservation Commission or designated
staff (COA required).
      (2)   Where the land use which the sign serves requires site plan
approval or subdivision plat approval, a temporary or permanent sign denoting
the name of the development shall not be permitted or erected on any tract or
parcel of land until and unless the site plan or subdivision has received
approval from the village in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Ordinance.
   (B)   Alteration of Sign Face
      Repainting of a sign, if in conformance with the applicable standards of
this chapter, shall be considered maintenance or repair and shall not require a
permit. The changing of tenant name panels on multiple-tenant development
signage shall not require a permit.
   (C)   Compliance Required
      Existing nonconforming signs shall be brought into full compliance
subject to the requirements of Section
2.3.
9.7.1.2   Computation of Signage Area
   (A)   Computation of Height
      The height of a sign shall be measured from the highest point of a sign
or its support whichever is greater, to the base of the sign at the highest
adjacent grade. If said sign is placed in raised planter box or on a berm
exceeding a 3/1 slope the base of the planter box or berm shall be used to
determine height.
   (B)   Computation of Sign Face
      (1)   The area of a sign face shall be deemed to be the entire
rectangular area within the smallest polygon that will encompass the extreme
limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display on the sign
that can be reasonably calculated. (See diagram below.)
      (2)   Individual channel letters or free-floating elements shall be
measured as individual elements. The area shall also include any material or
color forming an integral part of the background of the display is used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed.
      (3)   Frames or structural members not bearing informational or
representational matter shall not be included in computation of the area of a
sign face.
      (4)   Signs attached to walls or fences shall be treated as monument
signs and allowed only where monument signs are permitted. Only that portion of
that wall or fence onto which the sign face or letters are placed shall be
calculated in the sign area.

Section 9.9   Water and Sewer Requirements
   (A)   General: All subdivisions and all developments (including single-
family dwellings) shall be designed for and connected to Public water or sewer
or meet applicable Health Department requirements for on-site systems where
Public water or sewer is not required to be provided. The developer shall be
responsible for obtaining all necessary permits and approvals for any water or
sewer system extensions;
   (B)   Oversized Water and Sewer Facilities: The Village, Moore County
Utilities or other public utility provider may, in order to serve future
development, require the developer to install certain oversized water and sewer
improvements and/or to increase such improvements to a size and/or extent
beyond that necessary for the needs created by the developer. In such cases,
the Village, Moore County Utilities or other public utility provider shall
enter into an agreement to reimburse the developer for the over-sizing and/or
extension based upon rates as agreed to by the Village, Moore County Utilities
or other public utility provider;
   (C)   Water Requirements: Any subdivision or development that has Public
water system lines available shall be required to extend the Public water
system throughout the development or the subdivision to each lot located
therein. All required water line extensions shall include appropriate valves,
hydrants, taps, related utility appurtenances and capped service to the
property line of each lot as required by the Village Engineering Standards and
Specifications Manual and/or other public utility provider. Such systems shall
be designed and installed to allow for future extension to adjoining property
as determined by the Village Engineer in consultation with the Pinehurst Fire
Department.
      The term "available" shall mean that there is an existing public water
line of adequate size and water flow and/or pressure within three hundred (300)
feet of the outside boundary line of the subdivision or development; or the
Village, Moore County Utilities or other public utility provider, at its
option, indicates its commitment to extend such a water line within three
hundred (300) feet of the property line of the subdivision or development at no
cost to the developer and there are no legal or topographic problems that
prevent the developer from connecting onto and extending the existing system to
the subdivision or development. In the event there are phases to the
subdivision or development, or the subdivision or development is a part of a
larger tract of land owned or under the control of the developer, then in that
case Public water service shall be deemed to be available if an existing or
proposed Public water system line extends or will be extended within three
hundred (300) feet to the larger tract of land.
      In the event the Village, Moore County Utilities or other public utility
provider elects not to extend a water line of sufficient size, flow, and/or
pressure within three hundred (300) feet of the subdivision or development
boundary because of topographic features, legal obstacles, or financial
reasons, then the developer shall not be required to extend Public water lines
to each lot nor provide Public water service to the subdivision or development;
   (D)   Sewer Requirements: Any subdivision or development that has Public
sewer system lines available shall be required to extend the Public sewer
system throughout the subdivision or development to each lot located therein.
All required sewer line extensions shall include appropriate manholes, lift
stations, pumps, clean outs, taps, other related appurtenances and service to
the property line of each lot as required by the Village Engineering Standards
and Specifications Manual and/or other public utility provider.
      The term "available" shall mean that there is an existing public sewer
line of adequate size and sufficient capacity within three hundred (300) feet
of the outside boundary line of the subdivision or development or the Village,
Moore County Utilities or other public utility provider, at its option,
indicates its commitment to extend such a sewer line within three hundred (300)
feet of the property line of the subdivision or development at no cost to the
developer and there are no legal or topographic problems that prevent the
developer from connecting onto and extending the existing system to the
subdivision or development. In the event there are phases to the subdivision or
development, or the subdivision or development is a part of a larger tract of
land owned or under the control of the developer, then in that case Public
sewer service shall be deemed to be available if an existing or proposed Public
sewer system line extends or will be extended within three hundred (300) feet
to the larger tract of land.
      In the event the Village, Moore County Utilities or other public utility
provider elects not to extend a sewer line of sufficient size and capacity
within three hundred (300) feet of the subdivision or development boundary
because of topographic features, legal obstacles, or financial reasons, then
the developer shall not be required to extend Public sewer lines to each lot
nor provide Public sewer service to the subdivision or development.

encroach up to twenty percent (20%) into the required golf course and lake
setback. When using this encroachment only picket or wrought iron fence types
may be used;
      (3)   If a property owner's rear lot line borders on the side lot line of
another property owner, the side yard height limitation of six (6) feet applies
to any fence erected on such property line for the length contiguous to said
side yard;
      (4)   Fences, walls, and similar structures not over three and one-half
(3.5) feet in height may project into or enclose any front setback. The three

required setback. Such fence or wall shall not be built in or through a
required buffer unless the fence or wall has been designed as an integral part
of the buffer and approved as such. Fence, walls, and similar structures are
prohibited in the RD zoning district except that a chain link fence that
conforms with SR-18(j)(4)(f) may be installed on the property lines of a lot in
the RD district if the classification of such a lot as RD is because of the
existence of a lake or other body of water on or abutting the lot and such lake
or other body of water is available for use in connection with a semi-public
recreation area;
   (D)   Residential and Non-Residential Fences: Those fences or similar
structures not authorized or approved as provided in this Section are
prohibited. The finished side of a fence or wall shall always face out towards

   (E)   Fencing for a Temporary Use: Fencing for a Temporary Use is allowed
when such fencing is necessary to secure a site provided that such fencing is
not erected more than two (2) weeks prior to commencement of the event and is
removed within seven (7) days following the completion of the event. However,
the Village Planner is authorized to allow fencing to be erected earlier than
two (2) weeks prior to the commencement of the event or removed later than
seven (7) days following the completion of the event provided: 1) such fencing
does not abut a residence, and 2) the applicant has provided in writing clear
evidence that additional time is needed. Such fencing shall not exceed a height
of six (6) feet unless such fencing is used to screen a "work area," such as a
catering facility, from abutting properties or rights-of-way. In cases where
the fencing is used to screen a "work area," such fencing shall not exceed a
height of eight (8) feet. If eight (8) foot tall chain link fencing is used,
such fencing shall have a green mesh cover to further screen the "work area."
If chain link fencing is used and such fencing abuts a residence, residentially
zoned land, or a right-of-way, such fencing must have a green or brown vinyl
coating. At the discretion of the Village Planner, the fence may be required to
be setback from the property line, particularly if the fencing abuts a
residence or residentially zoned land. At no point shall a setback encroach
beyond the golf course out-of-bounds lines. If the fence is erected prior to an
allowed date or not removed by the specified date, the Village reserves the
right to enter onto the premises and remove the fence at the expense of the
property owner. Temporary fencing may be erected only upon receiving a
temporary fence permit from the Village Planner. The Village Planner shall
issue such a permit only after the Police and Fire Chiefs have reviewed the
application and found that the proposal has adequate provisions for emergency
access and egress so as to ensure health, welfare, and safety for the general
public. A Temporary Use Permit must be issued for all temporary fencing. The
Village Council, after conducting a public hearing, shall have the right to
suspend or modify the application of this subsection for major events as part
of the issuance of a temporary use permit issued under section 94.14 of the
Pinehurst Municipal Code.
   (F)   Retaining Walls
      (1)   A development permit is required for a retaining wall eighteen (18)
inches or taller in height.
      (2)   Retaining walls located in the front yard setback shall not exceed
three and a half (3.5) feet in height.
      (3)   Retaining walls up to six (6) feet in height may project into the
side and rear setbacks, excluding golf course/lake front and side street
setbacks.
      (4)   Retaining walls located in the golf course or lakefront accessory
building setback shall not exceed eighteen (18) inches in height.
      (5)   Retaining walls eighteen (18) inches or taller in height shall not
be closer than five (5) feet to a property line or right of way line.
      (6)   Retaining wall height shall be measured from the lowest ground
elevation to the top of the wall.
      (7)   Retaining walls constructed in a series of two (2) or more shall
provide a minimum of twelve (12) inches of horizontal separation planted in
grass or other vegetation.
      (8)   Retaining walls shall be solid cement, masonry, or wood and
constructed to the standards of the North Carolina State Building Code where
required.
      (9)   A finished side of a retaining wall shall face outwards towards the
street or adjacent property.
   (G)   Fences in Rights of Ways
      No fences, walls, columns or retaining walls shall be located within any
public or private right-of-way unless approved by the Village and only for
purposes of preserving specimen trees or desirable vegetation as determined by
the Village Planner or when required for public purposes, i.e. retaining walls
for sidewalk construction, storm water management, etc. In such cases, for
structures proposed within the public right-of-way, the Village reserves the
right to require submittal of an application for a Right-of-Way Encroachment
permit by the applicant, and approval by the Village prior to the encroaching
structure being constructed. All structures are limited to a maximum height of
thirty (30) inches above grade. These structures do not require a development
permit.

Section 9.15   Reserved
Section 9.16   Site Plan Development Standards
9.16.1   Site Plan Approval Required; Minor Site Plans and Major Site Plans
   (A)   A site plan showing the proposed development of the property must be
approved by the Village Council or Village Planner in accordance with the
procedures and requirements of this Section before a development permit may be
issued:
      (1)   Uses Requiring Site Plan Approval Before Development: Any use or
development of property except for:
         (a)   Temporary uses that are regulated by this Ordinance;
         (b)   A change in use which does not:
            1.   Require any physical changes to the building exterior or
property;
            2.   Cause any change in utility infrastructure;
            3.   Require street or sidewalk construction.
   (B)   Three Types of Site Plans Required–Single Family Dwelling, Minor and
Major:
      (1)   Single Family Dwelling: Single family site plan for the development
of property for single family residential purposes including accessory uses to
the principal use of the single family dwelling, approval of which shall be the
responsibility of the Village Planner as outlined in Section
9.14 .
      (2)   Minor Site Plans: Site plans for any non-residential development or
multi-family development with a land disturbing activity not exceeding two (2)
acres shall be deemed minor site plans, approval of which shall be the
responsibility of the Village Planner upon recommendation of the Technical
Review Committee as outlined in Section
9.16.1.4 ;
      (3)   Major Site Plans: All other site plans shall be deemed major site
plans, approval of which shall be the responsibility of the Village Council in
accordance with the requirements of Section
9.16.1.5  below. Major Site Plans that are in accordance with an approved
General Concept Plan shall be reviewed as Minor Site Plans.
9.16.1.2   Coordination of Site Plan Approval With Other Review Processes
   It is the intention of this Section to provide processes for reviewing and
approving site plans along with other required reviews at the same time to the
maximum extent possible. Therefore, an application for the approval of a site
plan may be submitted at the same time as an application for the approval of
other development permit requirements for the same development. The review and
processing of the applications shall be coordinated and consolidated as much as
possible. However, the Village Planner and the Planning and Zoning Board shall
render separate reports and recommendations.
    The Village Council may render a separate decision on each individual
application, recognizing the applications as distinct and subject to different
standards for approval.
9.16.1.3   Application Requirements for Both Minor and Major Site Plans
   (A)   The applicant shall submit a major site plan application in order to
obtain approval for a major site plan. The requirements for a major site plan
application are found in
Appendix D (See Section
9.16.1.5 for General Concept Plan submittal). The applicant shall submit a
minor site plan application in order to obtain approval for a minor site plan.
The requirements for a minor site plan application are found in
Appendix D;
   (B)   During the review of the site plan, the Village Planner, the Planning
and Zoning Board, or the Village Council, may require such additional
information as may be necessary to review the submitted site plan.
9.16.1.4   Consideration of Minor Site Plans
   (A)   Village Planner Review:
      (1)   The application and site plan shall be reviewed by the Village
Planner and the Technical Review Committee for compliance with the standards
and requirements set forth in this Ordinance. The developer at their discretion
may submit a sketch plan for initial review and comment. The comments of the
Village Planner and the TRC shall be provided to the applicant by the Village
Planner;
      (2)   The applicant may resubmit the site plan along with a written
response to these comments for further review by the Village Planner and the
Technical Review Committee. The Village Planner and other Village Staff shall
review the resubmitted site plan, and then submit its comments about the
resubmitted site plan to the applicant;
      (3)   The process continues until the site plan is determined to be
approved or denied. If the Village Planner denies approval of the site plan,
the reasons shall be stated in writing.
   (B)   Action by the Village Planner on Minor Site Plans:
      (1)   Failure of the Village Planner to act or provide comments on a
minor site plan within forty- five (45) days of receiving the site plan and
recommendations from the Technical Review Committee shall be deemed approval of
the site plan, authorizing the applicant to proceed with development of the
property in accordance with the site plan submitted to the Village Planner.
This time limit shall not apply where the delay in site plan approval is caused
by the applicant's failure to obtain any special use approval required for the
proposed development. Resubmission of a minor site plan restarts the forty-five
(45) day period for the Village Planner to act;
      (2)   In the event the Village Planner disapproves a minor site plan, an
appeal may be filed with the Village Council within ten days of disapproval. If
an appeal is filed, the Planning and Zoning Board shall render an opinion on
the merits of the appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Planning
and Zoning Board's opinion shall be forwarded to the Village Council, which
shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedural provisions for major site
plans. The Village Council shall affirm, reverse, or modify the Village
Planner's disapproval at the Council's next regularly scheduled meeting.

9.16.1.5   Consideration of Major Site Plans
   (A)   Review by Staff and the Planning and Zoning Board on Major Site Plans:
      (1)   The application and General Concept Plan shall be reviewed by the
Village Planner and the Technical Review Committee for general compliance with
the standards and requirements set forth in this Ordinance. The developer at
their discretion may submit a sketch plan for initial review and comment. The
comments of the Village Planner and the TRC shall then be provided to the
applicant;
      (2)   The applicant may resubmit the General Concept Plan along with a
written response to these comments for further review by the Village Planner
and Technical Review Committee. The Village Planner shall review the
resubmitted plan and then submit its comments about the resubmitted site plan
to the applicant;

accordance with section
4.1.2 of this ordinance and review the General Concept Plan, the
recommendations of the Village Planner and the Technical Review Committee, and
the requirements of this Ordinance, and formulate a recommendation to the
Village Council for appropriate action on the site plan. Failure of the
Planning and Zoning Board to make a recommendation to the Village Council
within ninety (90) days of the first public meeting in which the item is on the
agenda for consideration by the Board shall be considered a favorable
recommendation.
   (B)   Action by Village Council on Major Site Plans: The application, the
General Concept Plan, the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board,
along with the staff report of recommendation of the Village Planner and other
pertinent materials shall then be forwarded to the Village Council for action
after a public hearing is held by the Village Council in accordance with
section
4.1.2 of this ordinance. The Village Council shall review this information and
either approve, approve with conditions, or reject the site plan:
      (1)   The Village Council may approve a General Concept Plan only if it
meets the standards and requirements set forth in this Ordinance and provides
for the dedications and improvements, or payments and guarantees in lieu
thereof, required by this Section;
      (2)   If the Village Council rejects a General Concept Plan, then the
reasons therefor shall be stated in the record of action on the General Concept
Plan;
      (3)   Failure of the Village Council to act on the General Concept Plan
within ninety (90) days of being placed on an agenda for consideration, the
General Concept Plan and recommendations from the Planning and Zoning Board
shall be deemed approval of the General Concept Plan, authorizing the applicant
to proceed with preparing full site plan (
Appendix D) drawings of the property in accordance with the General Concept
Plan submitted to the Village Council. This time limit shall not apply where
the delay in General Concept Plan approval is caused by the applicant's failure
to obtain any special use approval required for the proposed development or
where the applicant consents to such a delay.
      (4)   Upon approval of the General Concept Plan by the Village Council,
the applicant shall prepare and submit site plans in accordance with
Appendix D. Said site plans shall be reviewed using the minor site plan
process. Upon Village Planner approval of the site plan, the major site plan
shall be deemed approved.

9.16.1.6   Effect and Duration of Major and Minor Site Plan Approval
   (A)   Approval of the site plan and final construction drawings shall
authorize the applicant to proceed with any applications for permits and
approvals required in order to develop the property in conformity with the
approved site plan. A permit, certificate, or other approval may be issued by
the Village only if it conforms to the approved site plan and final
construction drawings;
   (B)   A development permit and building permit may be issued for any
building or structure on the property, and a building or structure on the
property may be occupied, only where the applicant has complied with the
approved site plan and final construction drawings, and made all dedications
and improvements required by this Ordinance. A Certificate of Occupancy shall
be issued only upon completion of the terms of the development permit and the
building permit;
   (C)   An approved site plan shall become null and void if the applicant has
failed to make substantial progress on the site within two (2) years after the
date of approval by the Village Planner or Village Council. Substantial
progress means at least one-half of the gross floor area of the site-planned
development must be completed within the first two (2) years. The entire site
must be completed within five (5) years of the first approval date of the site
plan. Failure to complete construction by these deadlines automatically voids
the undeveloped portions of the site plan unless the approving body finds that
all of the following have been met:
      (1)   A written request for extension has been made to the approving
authority at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the approved site
plan;
      (2)   Unconstructed portions of the site plan conform to all Ordinances,

   (A)   Approval Required: All plats for major subdivisions shall be reviewed
and approved pursuant to the procedures and requirements set forth in Sections
9.17.1.3  through
9.17.1.6  below. A major subdivision is any subdivision that does not qualify
as an exempt or minor subdivision as defined herein;
   (B)   Summary of Procedures: The approval of plats for major subdivisions is
a multi-step process. A proposed preliminary plat (
Appendix E ) is first submitted to the Village Planner. The Village Planner and
TRC reviews the application for completeness and errors and provides written
comments to the applicant. The applicant then makes revisions and corrections
to the preliminary plat in response to the comments of the Village Planner. The
Planning and Zoning Board shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with
section
4.1.2  of this ordinance and then review the preliminary plat along with the
comments and recommendations of the Village Planner. This process continues
until compliance is determined. The Planning and Zoning Board then submit its
recommendations regarding the preliminary plat to the Village Council. Once the
Planning and Zoning Board has submitted its recommendation on a proposed
subdivision to the Village Council, the Village Council shall conduct a public
hearing in accordance with section
4.1.2 of this ordinance and then review the preliminary plat and the Planning
and Zoning Board's recommendations, and approves, conditionally approves, or
rejects the preliminary plat; Prior to the submittal of the preliminary plat to
the Village Planner, the subdivider, at their discretion may submit a sketch
plan (
Appendix A) for initial review and comment.
   (C)   After the Village Council approves the preliminary plat and the
Village Engineer approves construction plans for all proposed public
improvements, the applicant then proceeds to make land dedications and install
improvements on the property in accordance with the approved preliminary plat.
Upon carrying out the improvements, the applicant submits a final plat for
approval by the Village Planner. The final plat is approved when the applicant
has properly made all dedications and properly installed all improvements that
are required by this Ordinance and the approved preliminary plat and
construction plans.

requests to the Technical Review Committee in order to determine the potential
impact of the requested change in any requirement or code administered by other
agencies of the Village;
   (D)   Standards of Review: Before approving any such change, the Village
Planner shall make the following findings:
      (1)   That all changes conform to the minimum required standards for the
zoning district in which the property is located;
      (2)   That all additions, alternations, and expansions shall be
compatible with the existing or approved lots, easements and infrastructure,
open space and common areas;
      (3)   That any additional required landscaping shall be comparable to the
approved subdivision plat and shall follow Village specifications and
guidelines;

Ordinance, the Village Code, or other applicable laws;
      (9)   That the use and development of the property is otherwise in full
compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
   (E)   Appeal: The applicant shall have the right to appeal to the Village
Council the decision of the Village Planner regarding any such change. Before
the Village Council makes a decision, the Planning and Zoning Board shall
render its opinion on the merits of the appeal to the Village Council.
9.17.1.11   Required Open Space
Purpose
   The Purpose of the Required Open Space is to manage the subdivision of land
for residential development in a manner that results in more effective
conservation of the natural environment and the preservation of a Village's
community character. Required Open Spaces are designed to function as a
municipal land use management tool that will enable the conservation and
protection of a site's important features, including natural, historical and
archaeological resources and community character, such as scenic vistas, view
sheds, and greenway connections. At the same time, required open spaces enable
a property to be developed for single family detached housing at the same gross
density as is permitted under existing underlying zoning. All major
subdivisions of land in the following residential zoning districts shall comply
with the following required open space regulations and all structures in the
zoning districts shall comply with the following dimensional requirements,
except as may be otherwise provided by this Ordinance:

9.17.1.27   Substitute Performance Guarantees
   This Ordinance applies only where all of the following requirements are met:
   (A)   A subdivision of land achieved final plat approval based on the
posting of financial guarantees in lieu of completing required public
infrastructure; and
   (B)   A financial guarantee was issued by a financial institution that has
failed and been closed and the FDIC, as receiver, has disaffirmed and
repudiated such financial guarantee(s); and
   (C)   The developer has failed or refused to provide a replacement financial
guarantee(s) or to complete such required public infrastructure; and
   (D)   The developer sold and conveyed lots to third parties prior to the
date on which the Village was notified by the FDIC that the financial
guarantees were disaffirmed and repudiated ('Notification Date'); and
   (E)   Sufficient infrastructure has been installed by the developer in such
phase or phases such that acceptable access is provided and adequate utilities
are installed for fire protection, potable water and sewer service. This shall
be determined by the village engineer and the fire marshal.
   If all of the requirements set forth above are met, then, in such
developments or phases thereof, lot owners who purchased lots before the
notification date wishing to build new heated square footage or additions of
heated square footage may provide a substitute financial guarantee (SFG) on a
per lot basis. The SFG shall be determined by Council based on the amount of
the repudiated letters of credit issued for phase of development and the number
of undeveloped lots in that phase.
   Once the SFG is determined, the Village may issue a building permit upon
receipt of the SFG. Certificates of occupancy shall not be withheld by the
Village based on incomplete public infrastructure or the failure to provide or
maintain a financial guarantee if a SFG was provided for such lot, although
other PDO requirements will continue to apply.
   Half of the SFG will be collected at or prior to issuance of a building
permit and half will be collected prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy. Such SFG shall be maintained by the Village and shall be used by the
Village to complete the infrastructure in that particular phase of the
subdivision. In the event the infrastructure in that phase of the development
is completed by the developer or their successor without cost to the Village,
or in the event the Village completes the infrastructure and discovers that it
does not need all of the SFG funds provided for, the Village shall refund a
proportionate share of such SFG's not needed to the persons who provided them.
   This regulation shall not obligate the Village to complete public
infrastructure for which SFG's have been provided until such time as adequate
funds exist to complete the public infrastructure, although the Village, in its
sole discretion, may undertake such completion at any time.
   The Village reserves the right to transfer these funds to a third party to
ensure completion and acceptance by the Village.

supervision. Designated, trained staff may administer medication in an adult
care home. Adult care homes that provide care to two (2) to six (6) unrelated

allow nursing service exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Settings in which
services are delivered may include self-contained apartment units or single or
shared room units with private or area baths. Assisted living residences are to

   (H)   Multi-Unit Independent Housing with Services: an assisted living
residence in which hands-on personal care services and nursing services which
are arranged by housing management are provided by a licensed home care or
hospice agency, through an individualized written care plan. The housing
management has a financial interest or financial affiliation or formal written
agreement that makes personal care services accessible and available through at
least one (1) licensed home care or hospice agency. The resident has a choice
of any provider, and the housing management may not combine charges for housing
and personal care services. All residents, or their compensatory agents, must
be capable, through informed consent, of entering into a contract and must not
be in need of twenty-four (24)-hour supervision. Assistance with self-
administration of medications may be provided by appropriately trained staff
when delegated by a licensed nurse according to the home care agency's
established plan of care. Multi-unit assisted housing with services programs

ORDER FOR INCORPORATION
VILLAGE OF PINEHURST
   Whereas two petitions have been received pursuant to Article 1A of Chapter
160A of the General Statutes of North Carolina for incorporation of the
proposed Village of Pinehurst and said petitions being found to be in order, a
hearing was scheduled and held in the Village of Pinehurst on Monday, March 24,
1980 upon proper notice to the Board of County Commissioners of Moore County
and to the governing boards of all other cities and towns in the county which
are located within three miles of the area to be incorporated. Whereas the
Municipal Board of Control has considered whether incorporation is necessary or
expedient and in the public interest, and has considered the appraised value of
property subject to taxation in the area, the county's assessment ratio, and
the ability of the proposed Village to provide municipal services to its
citizens and the probable effect of the incorporation on existing cities and
towns and the extent to which the area is already developed for urban purposes
and other matters coming to its attention. Now, therefore, the Board of
Municipal Control upon the information and evidence it received at the public
hearing and by other proper means makes the following findings.
      1.   An incorporation of the area is necessary and expedient and in the
public interest.
      2.   That the area has a permanent resident population of at least 500
people.
      3.   That the appraised value of property subject to taxation by the
Village will be sufficient to enable it to provide appropriate municipal
services to its citizens.
      4.   That no portion of the area lies within one mile of the corporate
limits of any other city having a population of 5,000 or more according to the
most recent decennial census of population taken by order of Congress, or
within three miles of the corporate limits of any other city having a
population of 10,000 or more according to the most recent decennial census of
population taken by order of Congress, or within four miles of the corporate
limits of any other city having a population of 25,000 or more according to the
most recent decennial census of population taken by order of Congress, or
within five miles of the corporate limits of any other city having a population
of 50,000 or more according to the most recent decennial census of population
taken by order of Congress.
      5.   That at least sixty percent (60%) of the area within the proposed
Village is already developed for residential, commercial, industrial,
institutional, or governmental uses, and that the remaining area is not
separated from the developed area by natural barriers to urban growth.
   Based upon these findings, the Board hereby orders the incorporation of the
Village of Pinehurst effective on July 1, 1980. The first municipal election
shall be held by August 1, 1980 and shall be conducted by the Moore County
Board of Elections. From July 1, 1980 until the new Council is installed, after
the first municipal election, G. Bevins Cameron, Harry Lash and Robert L. Luhrs
shall serve as the interim governing body as provided for in G.S. § 160A-9.4
(4).
   The members of the Village Council selected in the first election shall
serve until the next regular election which shall be held on Tuesday after the
first Monday in November in 1981, as per G.S. § 163-279(1).
   This the 8th day of May, 1980
                                                
   Municipal Board of Control by
   J.D. Foust, Chairman
The North Carolina Municipal Board of Control, having approved an Order of

Director is authorized to require service in addition to the once per week
minimum, if, in the opinion of the Public Services Director, either the
condition of the solid waste, the proximity of the nonresidential property to
residential properties, the location of the garbage receptacles or dumpsters,

Services Director shall subject the property owner, tenant or other agent to
the enforcement procedures, including penalties, described in but not limited
to §

entitled to the possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee, or occupant of
the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be ascertained in the

as contained in the records of the village. The person who mails the notice
shall retain a written record to show the name and address to which mailed, and
the date mailed. If the names and addresses cannot be ascertained or if the
vehicle to be removed is an abandoned motor vehicle, notice shall be given by
affixing on the windshield or some other conspicuous place on the vehicle a
notice indicating that the vehicle will be removed by the village on a specific
date (no sooner than two days after the notice is affixed). The notice shall

pursuant to division (A) of this section that the vehicle will be removed may
appeal the determination. In the case of notice for removal of a junked motor
vehicle where the determination has been made that the aesthetic benefits of
removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens on the private property owner, in
accordance with §
90.06(A), the registered owner or person entitled to possession of the junked
motor vehicle may appeal that determination. Any appeal shall be made within
ten days upon receipt of the notice for removal of the vehicle as provided in
division (A) of this section. All appeals shall be made to the Village Council
in writing. Appeals held pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the

held in conjunction with one of the following criteria. Only events meeting the

   (B)   The Parks and Recreation Department, upon a recommendation from
appropriate village departments, may issue a temporary event permit only upon
finding that the temporary event satisfies the following requirements:
      (1)   If the property is undeveloped, it contains sufficient open space
to support the temporary use;
      (2)   If the property is developed, it contains an area that is not
actively used but which would support the proposed temporary use without
encroaching into or creating a negative impact on existing buffers, open space,
landscaping, traffic movements, or parking space availability;
      (3)   Tents and other temporary structures will be located so as to not
interfere with the normal operations of any permanent use located on the
property;
      (4)   Off-street parking is adequate to accommodate the proposed
temporary event. Available public parking and other off-site parking
accommodations may be considered to count toward the proposed temporary event.

not likely cause interference with the movement of emergency vehicles to such
an extent that adequate police, fire, or other emergency services cannot be
provided throughout the village and will not likely cause unreasonable or
unwarranted disruption to vehicular or pedestrian traffic;
      (9)   All inspections and permits required by applicable construction
codes have been met and approved by the Planning and Inspections Department and
the Fire Department;
      (10)   The temporary event meets all other applicable requirements of the

appropriate village departments, may deny a temporary event permit for any of
the following reasons:
      (1)   When there are numerous and competing requests for temporary event
permits, the Parks and Recreation Department may select one application over
another based on the following criteria:
         (a)   Previous performance of similar activities within the village;
         (b)   Other and/or prior demonstration of ability to produce a high-
quality event;
         (c)   Superior ability to mitigate potential disruption to neighboring
uses; and
         (d)   Deference to application first received.
      (2)   Previous poor performance when issued a temporary event permit;
      (3)   Proposed temporary event is not compatible with community standards
and norms;
      (4)   Proposed temporary event strains village resources, including
staffing or use of facilities, roads or equipment;

of prescribing regulations governing conditions detrimental to the health,
safety and welfare of its citizens, it shall be unlawful for any person to

prohibit the discharge of firearms by any law enforcement officer in the
discharge of his or her official duties, by any law enforcement officer during
a course of instruction, or by any person in the lawful defense of persons or
property. The provisions of this section, however, would allow the discharge of

§ 130.02 POSTING OF SIGNS PROHIBITING CARRYING OF CONCEALED WEAPONS.
   (A)   Findings. Chapter 398 of the 1995 Session Laws made changes to the
laws governing concealed weapons by establishing a system that will allow
private citizens to obtain permits to carry concealed handguns. This change
will significantly increase the number of individuals who may legally carry
concealed handguns. It is necessary to restrict the carrying of concealed
handguns on certain village property in order to protect the health and safety
of municipal employees and the community at large. G.S. § 14-415.23 authorizes
municipalities to adopt ordinances to permit the posting of a prohibition
against carrying a concealed handgun, in accordance with G.S. § 14-415.11(c),
on local government buildingsand their appurtenant premises. It is the intent
of this section to direct the posting of municipal property so that, pursuant
to G.S. § 14-415.11(c), the carrying of concealed handguns on the posted
premises will constitute a violation of G.S. Chapter 14, Article 54B.
(1986 Code, § 3-7.1)
   (B)   Posting of signs required. The Village Manager is hereby authorized
and instructed to post conspicuous signage at appropriate locations on or
within each building or portion of a building owned, leased as lessee,
operated, occupied, managed or controlled by the village, as well as the
appurtenant premises to the buildings indicating that carrying a concealed
handgun is prohibited therein.
(1986 Code, § 3-7.2)
   (C)   Location of signs. Signs on buildings shall be visibly posted on the
exterior of each entrance by which the general public can access the building.
The Village Manager shall exercise discretion in determining the number and
appropriate location of signs to be placed on or within appurtenant premises.

lighted pipe, cigar, cigarette or other combustible tobacco product of any
kind.
(1986 Code, § 3-6.1)

person to smoke in any building or facility or portion of a building or
facility now or hereafter owned, leased, operated, occupied, managed or
controlled by the village, except in specially designated smoking areas. The
Village Manager shall have the authority to designate smoking areas within each
village building or facility. An area within any building or facility may be
designated as a smoking area only if the ventilation of the area is sufficient,
any adverse impact on the ventilation of the area is sufficient, any adverse
impact on municipal employees and members of the public is minimal, and no fire
or other safety hazard will be created by smoking in the area.
(1986 Code, § 3-6.2)
   (C)   Smoking in municipal vehicles. Smoking in village assigned vehicles is
prohibited.

for the private gain of the solicitor or any other private person.
(1986 Code, § 3-5.1)
   (B)   Begging in public places prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any
person to beg or solicit alms while in or on public streets, sidewalks or the

residents of the village, charging that any dwelling, dwelling unit or the
premises thereof is unfit for habitation, or whenever it appears to the
Inspector, upon inspection, that any dwelling, dwelling unit or the premises
thereof is unfit for human habitation, he shall, if his preliminary
investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served
upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling, dwelling unit or
premises thereof a complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing
a notice that a hearing will be held before the Inspector at a place therein
fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of the
complaint. The owner or any party in interest shall have a right to file an
answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give

such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness
established by this chapter within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90
days. Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close such
dwelling or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations, and improvements
have been made. The order may require that the property be vacated and closed
only if continued occupancy during the time allowed for repair will present a
significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of the
necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current state of the
property; and any additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors
under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. The
order shall state that the failure to make timely repairs as directed in the
order shall make the dwelling subject to the issuance of an unfit order under §
153.34.
      (3)   If the Inspector determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is
dilapidated, he or she shall state in writing his findings of fact to support
such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner
thereof an order directing and requiring the owner either to repair, alter, or
improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of
fitness established by this chapter, or else to vacate and remove or demolish
the same within a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days. If the order
permits the owner to repair the dwelling, the order may require that the
property be vacated and closed only if continued occupancy during the time
allowed for repair will present a significant threat of bodily harm, taking
into account the nature of the necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements;
the current state of the property; and any additional risks due to the presence
and capacity of minors under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental
disabilities. If repairs are allowed, the order shall state that the failure to
make timely repairs as directed in the order shall make the dwelling subject to
the issuance of an unfit order under §
153.34.
      (4)   If the dwelling is located in a historic district of the village or
has been designated a landmark by the village and the Historic District
Commission determines, after a public quasi-judicial hearing that the dwelling
is of particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the
historic district, and the dwelling has not been condemned as unsafe, an order
issued pursuant to §
153.32(B)(3) may require that the dwelling be vacated and closed consistent
with G.S. § 160A-400.14(a).
      (5)   If the dwelling is located in a historic district of the village or
has been designated a landmark by the village, the Inspector may, but is not
required to, issue an order pursuant to §
153.32(B)(2) or (3) that extends beyond 90 days the time the owner of the
property has to comply with the order, provided that during such additional
time the owner actively seeks the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness
from the Historic Preservation Commission to authorize repairs or other work
mandated by the order.
      (6)   If the Village Council shall have adopted an ordinance pursuant to
§
153.34, or the Inspector shall have issued an order, ordering a dwelling to be
repaired or vacated and closed, as §
153.32(B)(2), and if the owner has vacated and closed such dwelling and kept
such dwelling vacated and closed for a period of one year pursuant to the
ordinance or order, then if the Village Council shall find that the owner has
abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the dwelling in
order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the
dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health,
safety, morals and welfare of the village in that the dwelling would continue
to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to
children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities,
would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in
the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might
otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent
and affordable housing in this state, then in such circumstances, the Village
Council may, after the expiration of such one year period, enact an ordinance
and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
         (a)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days; or
         (b)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days. This ordinance shall be
recorded in the Moore county Registry and shall be indexed in the name of the
property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with this
ordinance, the public officer shall effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.
      (7)   Whenever a determination is made pursuant to §
153.32(B)(2) or (3) that a dwelling must be vacated and closed, or removed or
demolished, notice of the order shall be given by first-class mail to any
organization involved in providing or restoring dwellings for affordable
housing that has filed a written request for such notices. A minimum period of
45 days from the mailing of such notice shall be given before removal or
demolition by action of the Inspector, to allow the opportunity for any
organization to negotiate with the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase
the property for the purpose of providing affordable housing. The Inspector or
Village Clerk shall certify the mailing of the notices, and the certification
shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. Only an organization that has
filed a written request for such notices may raise the issue of failure to mail
such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order requiring the public
officer to wait 45 days before causing removal or demolition.
(Ord. 14-16, passed 4-8-2014)
§ 153.33 METHODS OF SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)   Complaints or orders issued by the Inspector pursuant to an ordinance
adopted under this chapter shall be served upon persons either personally or by
registered or certified mail. When service is made by registered or certified
mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also be sent by regular mail.
Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered or certified mail is
unclaimed or refused, or if the regular mail is not returned by the post office
within 10 days after the mailing. If regular mail is used, a notice of the
pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises
affected.
   (B)   If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Inspector in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, or, if the owners are known but have refused to accept
service by registered or certified mail, and the Inspector makes an affidavit
to that effect, then the serving of the complaint or order upon the owners or
other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general
circulation in the village at least once no later than the time at which
personal service would be required under the provisions of this chapter. When
service is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be
posted in a conspicuous place on the premises thereby affected.
(Ord. 14-16, passed 4-8-2014)
§ 153.34 IN REM ACTION BY INSPECTOR; PLACARDING.
   (A)   After failure of an owner of a dwelling or dwelling unit to comply
with an order of the Building Inspector issued pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter, and upon adoption by the Village Council of an ordinance
authorizing and directing him to do so, as provided by G.S. § 160A-443(5) and §
153.32(B) of this code, the Inspector shall proceed to cause such dwelling or
dwelling unit to be repaired, altered, or improved to comply with the minimum
standards of fitness established by this chapter, or to be vacated and closed
and removed or demolished, as directed by the ordinance of the Village Council,
and shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of such dwelling or dwelling
unit a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human
habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is
prohibited and unlawful." Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a
misdemeanor.
   (B)   Each ordinance so adopted shall be recorded in the Moore County
Registry, and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor
index, as provided by G.S. § 160A-443(5).
(Ord. 14-16, passed 4-8-2014)
§ 153.35 COSTS, A LIEN ON PREMISES.
   (A)   That the amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or improvements,
or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the Inspector shall be a
lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred, which lien
shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected as the lien for
special assessment provided in G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10.
   (B)   If the real property upon which the cost was incurred is located
within the corporate limits of the Village, then the amount of the cost is also
a lien on any other real property of the owner located within the village
limits or within one mile thereof except for the owner's primary residence. The
additional lien provided in this subsection is inferior to all prior liens and
shall be collected as a money judgment.
   (C)   If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the Inspector, he shall
sell the materials of the dwelling, and any personal property, fixtures or
appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall credit the
proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition, and any
balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the Inspector,
shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall be disbursed by
the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree
of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in
any way the power of the village to define and declare nuisances and to cause
their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or otherwise.
(Ord. 14-16, passed 4-8-2014)
§ 153.36 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
   (A)   In addition to the remedies provided in §§
153.32,
153.34, and
153.35, the remedies provided in Code of Ordinances §
10.99 may also be used to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Neither this chapter nor any of its provisions shall be construed to
impair or limit in any way the power of the village to define and declare
nuisances and to cause their abatement by summary action or otherwise, or to
enforce this chapter by criminal process as authorized by G.S. § 14-4, and the
enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the enforcement of
any other remedy or remedies provided herein or in other ordinances or laws.
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to otherwise abrogate or
impair the other powers of the village to enforce any provisions of its charter
or its ordinances or regulations, nor to prevent or punish violations thereof;
and the powers conferred by this chapter shall be in addition and supplemental
to the powers conferred by any other law.
(Ord. 14-16, passed 4-8-2014)
§ 153.37 OTHER PROVISIONS.
   In the event any provision, standard, or requirement of this chapter is
found to be in conflict with any provision of any other ordinance or code of
the town, the provision which establishes the higher standard or more stringent
requirement for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the
residents of the village shall prevail.
(Ord. 14-16, passed 4-8-2014)
§ 153.38 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling or dwelling unit to
fail, neglect, or refuse to repair, alter, or improve the same, or to vacate
and close and remove or demolish the same, upon order of the Inspector duly
made and served as herein provided, within the time specified in such order.
Each day that any such failure, neglect, or refusal to comply with such order
continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling or dwelling unit,
with respect to which an order has been issued pursuant to §
153.32, to occupy or permit the occupancy of the same after the time prescribed
in such order for its repair, alteration, or improvement or its vacation and
closing. Each day that such occupancy continues after such prescribed time
shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.
