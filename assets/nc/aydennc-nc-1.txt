paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the
order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the clerk of superior
court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and
shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the
order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge.
      (4)   Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel
an injunction issued in conjunction therewith.

neglect of duty, fail to discover, report, and take appropriate action in the
cases of homicide, burglary, accident, fire, serious breach of the peace, or
other act or condition while on duty requiring police attention during his tour
of duty, or who shall neglect to take proper measures to arrest any person or
persons guilty of such offenses. Failure to discover, report, and take
appropriate action in any of such cases within a reasonable time after arriving
on duty shall be regarded as neglect of duty.
      (2)   While on duty each police officer shall be constantly alert,
observing everything that takes place within his sight or hearing. He should

shall immediately report to the Chief of Police anything of a dangerous
character or likely to occasion public inconvenience or anything irregular or
offensive.
      (3)   While on duty at night a patrol officer shall patrol the business
districts and residential area; learn the time of closing of business places;
where lights are ordinarily left burning and the location of safes and valuable
merchandise in such premises; be particular to note the time of all persons of
known bad character; investigate all suspicious circumstances that may present
themselves to him, such as automobiles parked with motor running, or passing
over the town streets without headlights lighted, persons passing late at night
with bundles, or persons loitering about or acting in a suspicious manner.
      (4)   Members of the Police Department shall immediately notify the Town
Clerk's office of any street lamps not burning or burning dimly and the time at
which such lamps are observed. They will also report any street markers or
traffic lights or signs needing attention.
      (5)   Radio car patrol officers shall be required to signal police
headquarters by radio at the times and manner prescribed by the Chief of
Police.
      (6)   The records shall be under the immediate supervision of the Chief
of Police and shall consist of such personnel as may be deemed necessary for
the proper functioning thereof.
      (7)   All personnel while on detective duty shall be subject to and
governed by the rules and regulations of the Department and the orders of the
Chief of Police.
      (8)   All grievances or differences shall be handled first by the Chief
of Police, second by the Town Manager, and third by the Board of Commissioners.
In no case shall a member of the Police Department go to a member of the Board
of Commissioners or the Mayor.
   (B)   The following rules of conduct shall govern all Police officers:
      (1)   Each officer and member in his conduct and department must be
quiet, civil, and orderly. In the performance of his duties he must maintain
decorum, command of temper, patience, and discretion. He must at all times
refrain from harsh, coarse, profane, or insolent language yet be firm,
resolute, and energetic. He must not use unnecessary force or violence. He must
be punctual in attendance to all the calls and requirements of duty and at all
times yield prompt obedience to the orders of the Chief of Police or other
superior officers.
      (2)   Any officer or member of the Department while on duty shall not
take drink of any kind of intoxicating liquor. If proven guilty of drinking on
duty or of being under the influence of intoxicants or narcotics whether on
duty or not, he shall be dismissed from the Department. Any officer or member
of the Department who reports for duty showing evidence of having consumed
intoxicants shall be subject to similar disciplinary measures.
      (3)   No officer or member shall make a false official report, make a
false statement, or gossip about any officer or member of the Department or the
business of the Department to the discredit or to the detriment of any such
officer or member of the Department or the Department as a whole.
      (4)   No officer or member of the Department shall upon the street, in
any business house, or other place whatever, to any officer or member of the
Department, or to any citizen make any remark in regard to any officer or
member thereof in disrepute of, or subject it or them to any ridicule. Any such
matter should be brought to the attention of the Chief of Police and then to
the Town Manager.
      (5)   All officers and members of the Department, whether on duty or not,
who shall in any way disturb the peace by being engaged in any brawl or who
shall be seen intoxicated shall upon conviction be subject to suspension or
dismissal.

      (7)   No officer or member of the Police Department shall receive any
present, fee, or regard for his services as a police officer other than regular
salary.
      (8)   The fact of an arrest is, in itself, of very little importance.
Officers and members of the Department shall bear in mind the important fact
that prisoners cannot be convicted without evidence. Criminals, especially old
offenders, do not usually tell all they know about themselves; therefore,
during the arrest and while on the way to the police station with an important
prisoner, police officers will note carefully the conversation and action of
the prisoner and get all admissions possible relative to the case; but police
officers must not make promises of immunity to a prisoner to get information as
information so obtained is not evidence.
      (9)   Loyalty to duty, government (national, state, and city), and to
your officers and brother officers is required and must be rendered by all
members of the Department. Prompt and energetic assistance and support must be
rendered to one another.

recommending or suggesting to prisoners any attorney or bondsman nor shall they
recommend or suggest any attorney to any person interested in criminal or civil
proceeding. A list can be kept of all attorneys and bondsmen available from
which the prisoner may select one of his choice.
      (11)   Any member of the Department failing to make any report to the
Chief of Police when ordered to do so in a specified time shall be subject to
disciplinary action. All official reports and communications shall be sent
through the regular channels, which shall be the Chief of Police and then the
Town Manager.
      (12)   Officers and members of the Department, when appearing in court
officially, shall appear promptly when court convenes and remain present as
long as their presence is required. When testifying they will give their
testimony in a quiet, unassuming manner but in a tone of voice sufficiently
loud to be heard by the court. They shall be explicit in their testimony,
confining themselves strictly and solely to the facts in the case, avoiding any
exaggeration or the appearance of prejudice and vindictiveness, always bearing
in mind that in bringing a case before the court, they are performing an
official function and that in no event should personal feeling enter into the
case. In preparing a case for court they will see that all pertinent witnesses
as may be necessary are summoned to appear. All officers and members of the
Department appearing officially in court will be attired in uniform prevailing
at the time or in full civilian dress. In either event, their appearance shall
be neat and their clothing properly worn.
      (13)   Officers of the Department shall willingly carry out all lawful
orders and instructions of the Chief of Police as quickly as possible and shall
not quibble or argue about the soundness of such orders or instructions.
      (14)   Officers and members of the Department shall not publicly
criticize the actions of any judge, justice, or officer of any court of justice
by word or deed.
      (15)   Officers and members of the Department shall not engage in
political or religious discussions to the detriment of discipline and shall not
utter statements in public which would in any way slight the race, color,
creed, ancestry, nationality, or religious or political views of any person.
      (16)   At any time it becomes necessary for any officer to discharge
firearms in performance of his official duty, he will complete a detailed
report of the circumstances surrounding such use immediately to the Chief of
Police.
      (17)   Loitering during working hours will not be tolerated. Officers are
expected to work and produce during the period of duty.
   (C)   The foregoing set of rules and regulations shall not be held to alter
or change any duties vested upon any police officer by virtue of general law,
or to limit his rights, privileges, and duties as they are defined and
established. The general purpose of the present rules and regulations are to
create a more efficient and cooperative Police Department.
   (D)   Any officer or member of the Department shall be subject to reprimand,
forfeiture of furlough, deduction of pay, suspension from duty, reduction in
rank, dismissal from the Department, or any one or more of the foregoing
penalties according to the nature and aggravation of his offense for any of the
following causes or for any violation of the regulations governing the
Department:
      (1)   Conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman.
      (2)   Conduct subversive to the good order and discipline of the
Department.

regulations of the Department; of Department orders and instructions; or of
conduct to the prejudice of good order, efficiency, or discipline of the
Department shall immediately file same with the Town Manager. The Town Manager
on behalf of the Board of Commissioners will render action within three days.

main which the pipeline will directly serve (by a customer connecting to the
pipeline).
   (C)   Extensions.
      (1)   Extensions initiated by and paid for by town.
         (a)   Water. The Board of Commissioners may at its discretion extend
water mains along streets, through dedicated right-of-ways, and through
easements, both permanent and temporary. It may elect to do so in order to
connect to an additional source of supply or storage tank, to loop lines to
improve water pressure and water quality, to improve fire flows, to serve a
facility owned by the town, to reach unserved property within the town limits
and extra-territorial jurisdiction, to save money in anticipation of higher
construction costs later, or to serve a facility it deems is in the best
interests of the citizens of the town to serve.
         (b)   Sanitary sewer. The Board of Commissioners may at its discretion
extend sanitary sewer mains along streets, through dedicated right-of-ways, and
through easements, both permanent and temporary. It may elect to do so in order
to connect to another disposal area, improve transmission of sewage for the
existing system, to serve a facility owned by the town, to reach unserved
property within the town limits and extra-territorial jurisdiction, to save
money in anticipation of higher construction costs later, or to serve a
facility it deems in the best interest of the citizens of the town to serve.
         (c)   Streets. The Board of Commissioners may at its discretion extend
streets in dedicated right-of-ways. It may elect to do so in order to alleviate
high volume traffic in undesired areas, to alleviate safety hazards caused by
road alignment, to reduce response times for police, fire, and rescue by
providing a more direct route, or to connect existing streets to new streets
within town limits which would otherwise be unconnected (such as the entrance
road to a subdivision not contiguous to the existing street system).
      (2)   Extensions petitioned for by citizen or land owner and paid for by
town.
         (a)   Within town limits.
            1.   Water - within town limits. Upon receipt of a valid petition,

dedicated right-of-ways to route the main. However, the town will not extend
lines at the town's own expense into a subdivision which is being privately
developed.
            2.   Sanitary sewer - within town limits. Upon receipt of a valid
petition, the town shall, at its expense, extend sanitary sewer to the near
property line of any property within the town limits. This is subject to the
availability of existing dedicated right-of-ways to route the main. If not
feasible because of physical barriers, lack of right-of-way, topography, or
economics, alternate sewage disposal may be arranged. The town will not extend
lines at the town's expense into a subdivision which is being privately
developed.
            3.   Streets - within town limits. Upon receipt of a valid
petition, the town may, at its expense, extend streets to the near property
line of any property within the town limits. This is subject to the

will not extend streets at the town's expense into a subdivision which is being
privately developed.
         (b)   Outside town limits.

to extend water lines outside the town limits. Upon receipt of a valid
petition, extensions of water mains at the town's expense may be made at the
discretion of the Board of Commissioners. The petition must be signed by a
majority of the owners of the property within the Service Area and must
represent a majority of all the linear feet of frontage of the property within
the Service Area. Voluntary annexation by 100% of the property owners
subscribing to the service is required, except for areas remote from the town
limits. The extension is subject to the economic feasibility and the
availability to town funds. The town will not extend lines at the town's
expense into a subdivision which is being privately developed.
            2.   Sanitary sewer - outside town limits. The town is under no
obligation to extend sanitary sewer lines outside the town limits. Upon receipt
of a valid petition, extension of sanitary sewer lines at the town's expense
may be made at the discretion of the Board of Commissioners. The petition must
be signed by a majority of the owners of the property within the Service Area
and must represent a majority of all the linear feet of frontage of the
property within the Service Area. Voluntary annexation by 100% of the property
owners subscribing to the service is required. The exemption is subject to the
economic feasibility and the availability to town funds. The town will not
extend lines at the town's expense into a subdivision which is being privately
developed.
            3.   Streets - outside town limits. The town is under no obligation
to extend streets outside the town limits. Upon receipt of a valid petition,
extensions of streets at the town's expense may be made at the discretion of
the Board of Commissioners. The petition must be signed by a majority of the
owners of the property to be served and must represent a majority of all the
linear feet of frontage of the property to be served. Voluntary annexation by
100% of the property owners is required as well as an adequate dedicated right-
of- way. The extension is subject to the economic feasibility and the
availability to town funds. The town will not extend streets at the town's
expense into a subdivision which is being privately developed.
      (3)   Extensions initiated and paid for by others.
         (a)   Water, sanitary sewer and streets within town limits. The town

BACKFLOW PREVENTION AND CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL
§ 51.60 WATER CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this cross- connection control ordinance is:
      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply of the town from the
possibility of contamination or pollution, due to back siphonage or back
pressure, by isolating within the consumer's internal distribution system or
the consumer's private water systems such contaminants or pollutants which
could backflow into the public water system;
      (2)   To define the authority of the town as the water purveyor entitled
to eliminating all cross-connections, new or existing, within its public water
system;
      (3)   To provide a continuing inspection program of cross-connection
control which will systematically and effectively control all actual or
potential cross-connections which may be installed in the future.
   (B)   Responsibility: Town.
      (1)   The Department of Water Resources will be primarily responsible for
preventing any contamination or pollution of the public water system. This
responsibility begins at the point of origin of the public water supply and
includes all of the public water distribution system, and ends at the service
connection under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Backflow Administrator, or
his/her designee shall exercise vigilance to ensure that the consumer/customer
has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water system.
      (2)   When it has been determined that a backflow protection assembly is
required for the prevention of contamination of the public water system, the
Backflow Administrator, or his/her designee, shall notify the owner, in
writing, of any such building or premises, to correct within a time set by this
subchapter, any plumbing installed or existing that is in violation of this
subchapter.
      (3)   After surveying the private water system, the Backflow
Administrator, or his/her designee, will select an approved backflow prevention
assembly required for containment control to be installed at service entrance.
      (4)   Prior to the installation of any backflow prevention assembly, the
owner of the private water system must be notified that the installation of a
backflow prevention assembly may create a closed system, and as a result
thermal expansion may occur. Under such circumstances, the customer must
understand and assume all liability and responsibilities for that phenomenon.
   (C)   Responsibility: Customer.
      (1)   The customer has the responsibility of preventing contaminants and
pollutants from entering the customer's private water system or the public
water system operated by the Town. The customer, at his/her own expense, will
install, operate, and maintain all backflow prevention assemblies specified
within this subchapter.
      (2)   If a tenant customer does not maintain the private water system and
has no authority to bring the system into compliance with the provisions of
this subchapter, the Town may assert any available action against tenant to
assure the private water system is brought into compliance with this
subchapter.

§ 51.71 FACTORS LEADING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WATER SHORTAGE RESPONSE
PLAN.
   (A)   Several parameters will require the town to begin the Response Plan.
The primary parameter is when the Neuse Regional Water and Sewer Authority
(NRWSA) declares a water shortage. If this occurs, the town will do so as well.
When both organizations are under a declared shortage, the Public Works and
Utilities Director will communicate frequently with NRWSA staff and follow
their determining factors. Other factors include, but are not limited to,
significant reduction in well water levels, a significant increase in the
average pump run times for predetermined total flows at the wells, contaminants
in the water system and/or water main breaks.
   (B)   If the determining factors causing the implementation of the Water
Shortage Response Plan are related to well water levels or pump run times,
certain tiers will be enacted in the following order:
      (1)   Tier I: Enacted if a 20% reduction in normal well water levels is
noted or if pump run times increase 20% in order to maintain previous rates.
      (2)   Tier II: Enacted if a 40% reduction in normal well water levels is
noted or if pump run times increase 40% in order to maintain previous rates.
      (3)   Tier III: Enacted if a 60% reduction in normal well water levels is
noted or if pump run times increase 60% in order to maintain previous rates.

§ 51.73 PHASED RESPONSE/REDUCTION GOALS.
   When the Water Shortage Response Plan is implemented, it may be in a phased
process as outlined below:
   (A)   Phase I: Voluntary Conservation.
      (1)   This phase will be enacted when it is determined that one or more
of the parameters outlined in §
51.71 is met. If this occurs, the consumers will be notified promptly by any or
all of the following: mailers, door hangers, postings on the town’s web site
(www.ayden.com), local news media, public postings at the Town Hall, Post
Office, and the like. During this Phase, the public will be asked to begin
voluntary conservation measures by following the recommended conservation
methods that will be made available by the above listed notification avenues.
      (2)   If the determining parameter(s) return to seasonal norms, the
measures will be lifted. However, failure of the determining parameter(s) to
return to a state of seasonal normalcy may require the initiation of Phase II.
      (3)   During Phase I, industrial facilities will be required to submit to
the Town Public Works and Utilities Director a water shortage response program.
This program should include methods that will allow the facilities to reduce
their water usage by 25%.
   (B)   Phase II: Mandatory.
      (1)   This phase will begin when the Town Public Works and Utilities
Director issues a water shortage advisory. Consumers will be notified by one or
all of the methods noted in Phase I. All users will be required to adhere to
the voluntary conservation measures as noted in Phase I. Class III uses will be
banned. Class II uses will allowed although outdoor vegetative watering will be
limited according to the resident’s street address. Even numbered addresses
will be allowed to water on even days of the month. Odd numbered addresses will
be allowed to water on odd days of the month. Allowable times for watering will
be limited to the hours between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.
      (2)   Failure to adhere to required conditions will result in a written
notice of violation for the first offense and/or a $50 fine. Thereafter, the
town may impose a fine of $50 per violation for the second and third offense. A
fourth offense will result in a $250 fine. Further offenses may require the
offending party to have his or her water service disrupted.
      (3)   During Phase II industrial users will be required to evaluate their
Water Shortage Response Plan with the town’s Public Works and Utilities
Director as it relates to their 25% reduction goal.
      (4)   If Phase II action fails to alleviate the water shortage, the town
will enter into the third and final phase.
   (C)   Phase III: Emergency.
      (1)   This phase will commence with the issuance of a water shortage
emergency declaration from the Town Manager. Users will be notified by any or
all of the methods noted in Phase I. All users will be required to uses
voluntary conservation measures outlined in Phase I. Class III uses will be
banned and Class II uses will be allowed although commercial vegetative
watering (i.e. nurseries, livestock and the like) may be further reduced.
      (2)   Industrial users will be required to implement their water
reduction program immediately.
      (3)   Failure to comply with mandates during Phase III will require the
offending party to pay a $100 fine for the first offense, a $350 fine for the
second offense and the disruption of water service for the third offense.
      (4)   In addition, residential users will be allotted 1,000 gallons per
month per bedroom per structure. If the user uses 1,001 - 1,250 gallons per
month per bedroom a surcharge of 25% will be added to the monthly water bill.
If the user consumes 1,251 - 1,500 gallons per month per bedroom a surcharge of
75% will be added to the monthly water bill. If the user consumes any amount in
excess of 1,501 gallons per month per bedroom a surcharge of 150% will be added
to the monthly water bill.
      (5)   Commercial, industrial and institutional facilities will be
required to reduce their monthly water consumption by 25% of the previous 12-
month water consumption average to maintain the current water rate for that
month. The average water use can be evaluated on an individual basis for
facilities with seasonal water demand fluctuations. A 10 - 24% water use
reduction from the previous 12-month water use average will require the town to
impose a 25% surcharge on the monthly water bill. A 0 - 9% water use reduction
from the previous 12-month water uses average will require the town to impose a
50% surcharge on the monthly water bill. An increase of 1 - 25% above the
previous 12-month water use average will result in a surcharge of 100% on the
monthly water bill. Any amount used above 25% of the previous 12-month average
water bill. Any amount used above 25% of the previous 12-month average water
use will require a monthly water bill surcharge of 150%.

§ 51.74 ENFORCEMENT.
   Enforcement of mandatory conservation and associated fines will be the
responsibility of the Public Works and Utilities Director under direction of
the Town Manager. Failure to pay penalties accrued under the Water Shortage
Response Plan will lead to the disruption of water service.
(Ord. 05-06-22, passed 12-12-05; Am. Ord. 09-10-25, passed 6-14-10)
§ 51.75 VARIANCES.
   Applications for water use variance requests are available from the Town
Public Works Office. All applications must be submitted to the Public Works
Office for review by the Public Works and Utilities Director or his or her
designee. A decision to approve or deny individual variance requests will be
determined within two weeks of submittal after careful consideration of the
following criteria: impact on water demand, expected duration, alternative
source options, social and economic importance, purpose (i.e. necessary use of
drinking water) and the prevention of structural damage.
(Ord. 05-06-22, passed 12-12-05; Am. Ord. 09-10-25, passed 6-14-10)
§ 51.76 PUBLIC COMMENT.
   Customers will have multiple opportunities to comment on the provisions of
the Water Shortage Response Plan. A public hearing will be scheduled to receive
public comment at a regular business meeting of the Town Governing Board.
Notice of the public hearing will be advertised in a local paper with general
circulation. Notice will also be given to the public that the Water Shortage
Response Plan will be available at the Town Hall for public review at least 30
days prior to the scheduled public hearing.
(Ord. 09-10-25, passed 6-14-10)
§ 51.77 EFFECTIVENESS.
   (A)   The effectiveness of the Water Shortage Response Plan will be
determined by comparing the stated water conservation goals with observed water
use reduction data. Other factors to be considered include frequency of plan
activation, any problem periods without activation, total number of violation
citations, desired reductions attained and evaluation of demand reductions
compared to the previous year's seasonal data.
   (B)   As the determining parameter(s) decrease in severity and return to
acceptable levels (seasonal norms), the Town Manager will lift the Water
Shortage Response Plan.
(Ord. 09-10-25, passed 6-14-10)
§ 51.78 RETURN TO NORMAL.
   When water shortage conditions have been abated and the situation is
returning to normal, water conservation measures employed during each phase
should be decreased in reverse order of implementation. Permanent measures
directed toward long-term monitoring and conservation should be implemented or
continued so that the community will be in a better position to prevent
shortages and respond to recurring water shortage conditions.
(Ord. 09-10-25, passed 6-14-10)
§ 51.79 REVISION.
   The Water Shortage Response Plan will be reviewed and revised as needed to
adapt to new circumstances affecting water supply and demand, following
implementation of emergency restrictions, and at a minimum of every five years
in conjunction with the updating of our Local Water Supply Plan. Further, a
water shortage response planning work group will review procedures following
each emergency or rationing stage to recommend any necessary improvements to
the Plan to the Town Governing Board. The Public Works and Utilities Director
is responsible for initiating all subsequent revisions.

§ 90.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "ABANDONED VEHICLE." As authorized and defined in G.S. § 160A-303, an
abandoned motor vehicle is one that:
      (1)   Is left upon a public street or highway in violation of a law or
ordinance prohibiting parking; or
      (2)   Is left on a public street or highway for longer than seven days;
or
      (3)   Is left on property owned or operated by the town for longer than
24 hours; or
      (4)   Is left on private property without the consent of the owner,
occupant or lessee thereof, for longer than two hours.
   "AUTHORIZED OFFICIAL." The supervisory employee of the Police Department or
the Town Code Enforcement Officer respectively, is designated to authorize the
removal of vehicles under the provisions of this chapter.
   "AUTO REPAIR PERMIT." A permit granting a period of time to allow the owner
of a vehicle to get that vehicle back into normal operating condition or to
provide time to otherwise bring the code violation into compliance. With a
purchase of a $25 permit, obtained at the Town of Ayden Operations Center, a
vehicle owner will have 30 days to repair a vehicle and disqualify it as a junk
vehicle as defined in §
90.02. The vehicle will be tagged by the Code Enforcement Department with a 30
day permit sticker. If after the 30 day permit period the vehicle is still
defined as a junk vehicle, then the vehicle will be in violation and will be
processed by the rules as defined in §
90.05.
   "CURRENTLY AWAITING REPAIRS." A period of time during which active effort is
expended to place a vehicle back in operation through replacement of parts,
repair of operation systems and circuits, fabrication and repair of broken
structural members and testing. If parts or materials are not available or not
on order, the item is not currently under repair. A vehicle which has remained
unrepaired for 30 days is considered unrepairable unless procurement of long
lead time replacement parts can be demonstrated or unless the vehicle is
subject to pending litigation and/or awaiting an insurance settlement. (The
property owner/tenant must provide documentation to substantiate "currently
awaiting repairs" over 30 days).
   "DURABLE SURFACE." Four inches of concrete, two inches of asphalt or other
materials approved by the town. Gravel or crushed stone shall not qualify as a
"DURABLE SURFACE".
   "JUNKED MOTOR VEHICLE." As authorized and defined in G.S. § 160A-303.2 the
term, "JUNKED MOTOR VEHICLE" means a vehicle that does not display a current
license plate lawfully upon that vehicle and that:
      (1)   Is partially dismantled or wrecked; or
      (2)   Cannot be self-propelled or moved in the manner in which it
originally was intended to move; or
      (3)   Is more than five years old and appears to be worth less than $500.
   "MANUFACTURED CAR COVER." A cover that is manufactured to be used to cover a
vehicle. This cover can be a cover specially designed for a particular vehicle
or type of vehicle or can be a generic cover. The cover must be completely
opaque and conceal the vehicle in its entirety.
   "MOTOR VEHICLE" or "VEHICLE." All machines designed or intended to travel
over land or water by self-propulsion or while attached to any self-propelled
vehicle.
   "NUISANCE VEHICLE." As authorized in G.S. § 160A-193 to regulate public
nuisances, a motor vehicle on public or private property shall be determined
and declared to be a health or safety hazard, a public nuisance, and unlawful,
including a vehicle found to be:
      (1)   A breeding ground or harbor for mosquitoes, other insects, rats or
other pests; or
      (2)   A point of heavy growth of weeds or other noxious vegetation over
eight inches in height; or
      (3)   A point of collection of pools or ponds of water; or
      (4)   A point of concentration of quantities of gasoline, oil or other
flammable or explosive materials as evidenced by odor; or
      (5)   One so offensive to the sight as to diminish adjoining property
values, or degrade the community, neighborhood or area appearance; or
      (6)   So situated or located that there is a danger of it falling or
turning over; or
      (7)   One being used for storage or a point of collection of any items
defined in §
95.01 or any other garbage, food, waste, animal waste, or any other rotten or
putrescible matter of any kind; or
      (8)   One which has sharp parts thereof which are jagged or contain sharp
edges of metal or glass; or
      (9)   Any other vehicle specifically declared a health and safety hazard
and a public nuisance by the Board of Commissioners.

of a junked motor vehicle, or for the owner, lessee, or occupant of the real
property upon which a junked motor vehicle is located to fail to comply with
the locational requirements or the concealment requirements of this section.
   (D)   Subject to the provisions of division (E), upon investigation, the
Town Code Enforcement Officer may order the removal of a junked motor vehicle
as defined in this chapter after finding in writing that the aesthetic benefits
of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens imposed on the private property
owner. Such finding shall be based on a balancing on the monetary loss of the
apparent owner against the corresponding gain to the public by promoting or
enhancing community, neighborhood or area appearance. The following among other
relevant factors may be considered.
      (1)   Protection of property values;
      (2)   Promotion of tourism and other economic development opportunities;
      (3)   Indirect protection of public health and safety;
      (4)   Preservation of the character and integrity of the community; and
      (5)   Promotion of the comfort, happiness and emotional stability of area
residents.
   (E)   Exceptions; permitted concealment.
      (1)   One junked motor vehicle, in its entirety, can be located in a
residential rear yard, as defined by the Zoning Ordinance, if the junked motor
vehicle is covered with a manufactured car cover or is enclosed by an opaque
fence so that it is not visible from any adjacent property or right-of-way and
it is parked on a durable surface. The location and size of the durable surface
shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
The manufactured car cover and fence shall remain in good condition and will
not be allowed to deteriorate.
      (2)   One junked motor vehicle is allowed in an enclosed building that
must be maintained and free from deterioration and/or collapse. The building

permit must be obtained from junked motor vehicles that are being repaired so
that they will no longer qualify as a junked motor vehicle or to provide time
to otherwise bring the code violation into compliance.
      (4)   Vehicles in a bona fide auto storage yard or junk yard as defined
and permitted in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (F)   The Town's Zoning Administrator has the authority to determine whether
any junked motor vehicle is adequately concealed as required by this provision.

The covering or enclosure must be compatible with the objectives stated in the
preamble of this chapter. Any other junked motor vehicle(s) must be kept in a
garage or building structure that provides a complete enclosure so that the
junked motor vehicle(s) cannot be seen from a public street or abutting
property. A garage or building structure means either a lawful, nonconforming
use or a garage or building structure erected pursuant to the lawful issuance

dangerous pending the appeal.
         (a)   In any case, where an animal has bitten any person or other

the likelihood that the animal might bite again.
         (b)   The provisions of this section do not apply to a dog being used
by a law enforcement officer to carry out the law enforcement officer’s
official duties. A dog shall not be considered a dangerous dog or potentially

      (1)   If the Police Chief or his or her designee determines that a dog
that was previously determined to be dangerous either bit a person so as to
cause a break in the skin or was at large on two or more separate occasions
after such determination, the Police Chief or Pitt County Animal Control or a
designee may seek a court order for the dog to be humanely destroyed.
      (2)   If the Police Chief or his or her designee in determining that a
dog is dangerous also determines that the dog without provocation has killed or
inflicted severe injury on a person, the Police Chief or his or her designee
may seek a court order that the dog be humanely destroyed.
   (G)   A dog that has been determined to be dangerous may not be disposed of
by adoption from the Pitt County Animal Control or the police department.

or her designee, Pitt County Animal Control, or by the Police Chief or his or
designee to be dangerous or vicious, and the dog has been either left with or
returned to its keeper, the keeper shall maintain the dog in an enclosure
meeting the requirements of this division (J) on the keeper’s property or, with
the consent of the Police Chief or his or her designee in such an enclosure on
the property of another, except that the dog may be taken out of the enclosure
when necessary if leashed and muzzled or in a secure carrying cage. The
enclosure for a dangerous dog shall be indoors within a building from which the
animal cannot escape or in a securely enclosed and locked pen or structure
suitable to prevent the entry of young children and designed to prevent the dog
from escaping. The pen or structure shall have minimum dimensions of five feet
by ten feet and shall have secure sides and a secure top. If it has no bottom
secured to the sides, the sides shall be embedded into the ground no less than
two feet. The pen or structure shall also provide protection from the elements
for the dog. The premises where the dangerous dog is kept shall be posted with
warning signs at places likely to be seen by persons entering the premises. A
warning sign shall advise of the presence on the premises of a dangerous dog
and shall also contain a picture symbol of a dangerous dog as a warning to
children. Unauthorized removal of a warning sign posted in compliance with this
division (J) is unlawful. Any dangerous dog found at- large after the owner
thereof has previous knowledge or notice that such dog is dangerous may be
killed by any police officer or animal control officer of the town without such
officer having to catch or impound such dog.

such powers as may be necessary to carry out the intent and provisions of this
chapter.
(Ord. 08-09-32, passed 3-9-09)
§ 96.21 NUISANCES ABATEMENT PROCEDURES.
   When any public nuisance as set out in §§
96.01 or 96.10 is found to exist on any property within the town’s corporate
limits, the following procedures shall be followed.
   (A)   The Town Manager and Code Enforcement Officer shall have the following
authority:
      (1)   To enter upon property;
      (2)   To obtain an administrative search and inspection warrant, if
necessary, as provided in G.S. § 15-27.2;
      (3)   To issue a notice of violation and impose civil penalties;
      (4)   To enter upon or authorize an agent to enter upon and clean up
premises in violation of this section;
      (5)   To utilize the services of an outside contractor to clean up
premises in violation of this section; and
      (6)   To summarily remove, abate, or remedy everything in the town limits
that is considered by ordinance to be either dangerous or prejudicial to the
public health or which has been declared to be a nuisance.
   (B)   Where any public nuisance as set out in §§
96.01 or
96.10 requires immediate abatement to avoid and prevent an immediate and
dangerous threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the
town and would degrade adjoining properties as determined by the Town Manager
or Code Enforcement Officer, the nuisance may be summarily removed and abated
by the town without prior notice to the property owner. The owner as determined
from the tax records of County of Pitt shall be responsible for all abatement
costs, administrative fees, and civil penalties as provided in §
96.99.
   (C)   Notices or orders issued by the Town Manager or Code Enforcement
Officer under this chapter shall be served on the owner or the property manager
of the identified property by either hand delivery or by registered or
certified mail and regular mail. Service by mail shall be deemed complete by
depositing the notice or order in the mail at the address listed in the County
of Pitt tax records postage prepaid. When the manner of service is by
registered or certified mail and regular mail and the registered or certified
mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the Post
Office within ten days of mailing, service is deemed sufficient. The person
mailing the notice or order by regular mail shall certify that fact and the
date of the mailing and the certification shall be conclusive evidence of
service in the absence of fraud.
   (D)   Except in situations identified in division (B) above, notification to
the property owner will advise that the conditions that exist on the identified
property constitute a public nuisance and shall be abated within ten days of
the date of the notification and that failure to abate or remove the nuisance
shall result in the owner’s assessment of the costs of abatement or removal,
imposition of administrative fees and the assessment of a civil penalty as
identified in §
96.99. The Town Manager or Code Enforcement Officer may afford the owner
additional time to remove or abate the nuisance if the failure was caused by
weather conditions or other factors as determined by the Town Manager or Code
Enforcement Officer not to have been within the control of the owner.
   (E)   Upon abatement of the nuisance, the Town Manager or Code Enforcement
Officer shall create a written statement of the actual costs incurred by the
town, including time and materials expended by the town, the amounts charged by
private contractors, administrative fees and civil penalty, if applicable, to
the owner of the property with instructions that the charges are due and
payable within 30 days of the date that the statement is mailed. The written
statement shall be delivered in the same manner as provided by division (C)
above. If the charges are not paid within 30 days, then the Town Tax Collector
shall cause the costs associated with the abatement as provided in the
statement to be filed as a lien on the subject property with the charges to be
collected and enforced in the same manner as unpaid taxes.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Town Manager
or Code Enforcement Officer may notify a chronic violator that if the chronic
violator’s property is determined to be a nuisance as defined in §
96.10, the town shall, without further notice in the calendar year in which the
notice is given, take action to remedy the violation. The expense of the
action, including the actual cost to remedy the violation and an administrative
fee and civil penalties as provided in §
96.99, shall become a lien upon the property, and shall be collected as unpaid
taxes. For the purpose of this section, a chronic violator is a person who owns
property whereupon, in the previous calendar year, the town gave notice of
violation at least three times under any provision of this chapter.
   (G)   In addition to the nuisances abatement procedures provided by this
chapter, the town reserves the right to utilize any other remedies available
under applicable law, including, but not limited to, proceeding in a criminal
action against any person, firm, or corporation violating the provisions of
this chapter as provided in G.S. § 14-4.
(Ord. 08-09-32, passed 3-9-09; Am. Ord. 09-10-26, passed 6-28-10)
§ 96.99 PENALTY.
   Any owner of a property whose property shall be declared a public nuisance
as provided in this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty in the amount
of $50 per day for each day the nuisance exists beginning on the first day
following the ten day abatement period provided in §
96.21(D). If a person fails to pay the civil penalty within 30 days after being
notified of the amount due, the city may recover the penalty together with all
costs by filing a civil action in the general court of justice in the nature of
a suit to collect a debt.

disturbing noises heard upon the pubic streets, in any public park, in any
school or public building or upon the grounds thereof while in use, in any
church or hospital or upon the grounds thereof while in use, upon any parking

UNSAFE BUILDINGS
§ 150.30 REPAIR, CLOSING, OR DEMOLITION OF ABANDONED OR UNSAFE STRUCTURES.
   [Reserved]
§ 150.31 FINDING; INTENT.
   It is hereby found that there exist within the town abandoned structures
which the Town Board finds to be hazardous to the health, safety, and welfare
of the residents of the town due to the attraction of insects or rodents,
conditions creating a fire hazard, dangerous conditions constituting a threat
to children, or frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the absence of
sanitary facilities. Therefore, pursuant to the authority granted by state law,
it is the intent of this subchapter to provide for the repair, closing, or
demolition of any such abandoned structures in accordance with the same
provisions and procedures as are set forth by law for the repair, closing, or
demolition of dwellings unfit for human habitation.
(Ord. 04-05-19, passed 5-9-05)
§ 150.32 DUTIES OF TOWN MANAGER OR DESIGNEE.
   (A)   The Town Manager or his or her designee is hereby designated as the
town officer to enforce the provisions of this subchapter.

      (1)   To locate abandoned structures within the town and determine which
structures are in violation of this subchapter;
      (2)   To take such action pursuant to this subchapter as may be necessary
to provide for the repair, closing, or demolition of the structures.
      (3)   To keep an accurate record of all enforcement proceedings begun

   (A)   Authorization. The Town Manager or his or her designee is authorized
to exercise such powers as may be necessary to carry out the intent and
provisions of this subchapter, including the following powers set forth in
division (B) of this section in addition to others herein granted:

receive evidence; and
      (4)   To designate such other officers, agents, and employees of the town
as he or she deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. 04-05-19, passed 5-9-05)
§ 150.34 STANDARDS FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Every abandoned structure within the town shall be deemed in violation
of this subchapter whenever such structure constitutes a hazard to the health,
safety, or welfare of the town citizens as a result of:
      (1)   The attraction of insects or rodents;
      (2)   Conditions creating a fire hazard;
      (3)   Dangerous conditions constituting a threat to children; or
      (4)   Frequent use by vagrants as living quarters in the absence of
sanitary facilities.
   (B)   In making the preliminary determination of whether or not an abandoned
structure is in violation of this subchapter, the Town Manager or his or her
designee may, by way of illustration and not limitation, consider the presence
or absence of the following conditions:
      (1)   Holes or cracks in the structure’s floors, walls, ceilings, or roof
which might attract or admit rodents and insects or become breeding places for
rodents and insects;
      (2)   The collection of garbage or rubbish in or near the structure which

insects;
      (3)   Violations of the state building code, the state electrical code,
or the fire prevention code, which constitute a fire hazard in such structure;
      (4)   The collection of garbage, rubbish, or combustible material, which
constitutes a fire hazard in such structure;
      (5)   The use of such structure or nearby grounds or facilities by
children as a play area;

to children using the structure or nearby grounds or facilities by children as
a play area; and
      (7)   Repeated use of such structure by transients and vagrants, in the
absence of sanitary facilities, for living, sleeping, cooking, or eating.
(Ord. 04-05-19, passed 5-9-05)
§ 150.35 PROCEDURE FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is
filed with the Town Manager or his or her designee by at least five residents
of the town charging that any structure exists in violation of this subchapter
or whenever it appears to the Town Manager or his or her designee, upon
inspection, that any structure exists in violation hereof, he or she shall, if
the preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and
cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such structure
a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be
held before the Town Manager or his or her designee at a place therein fixed,
not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint. The
owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the
complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the place
and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of such hearing shall also be given to
at least one of the persons signing a petition relating to such structure. Any
person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to
the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or
equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the Town Manager or his or
her designee.
   (B)   Procedure after hearing. After such notices and hearing, the Town
Manager or his or her designee shall state in writing his or her determination
whether such structure violates this subchapter. If the Town Manager or his or
her designee finds that the dwelling is in violation, he or she shall state in
writing findings of fact to support such determination and shall issue and
cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the
owner to either repair, alter, and improve such structure or else remove or
demolish the same within a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days.
   (C)   Failure to comply with order.
      (1)   In personam remedy. If the owner of any structure shall fail to
comply with an order of the Town Manager or his or her designee within the time
specified therein, the Town Manager or his or her designee may submit to the
Town Board at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney
to petition the superior court for an order directing such owner to comply with
the order of the Town Manager or his or her designee, as authorized by state
law.
      (2)   In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a structure to comply
with an order of the Town Manager or his or her designee within the time
specified therein, if injunctive relief has not been sought or has not been
granted as provided in division (C)(1) of this section, the Town Manager or his
or her designee shall submit to the Town Commissioners an ordinance ordering
the Town Manager or his or her designee to cause such structure to be removed
or demolished, as provided in the original order of the Town Manager or his or
her designee and, pending such removal or demolition, to placard such dwelling
as provided by state law.
   (D)   Petition to superior court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the Town Manager or his or her designee shall have the right, within
30 days after issuance of the order, to petition the superior court for a
temporary injunction restraining the Town Manager or his or her designee,
pending a final disposition of the case, as provided by state law.
(Ord. 04-05-19, passed 5-9-05)
§ 150.36 VACATED AND CLOSED STRUCTURES.
   (A)   If the Town Board shall have adopted an ordinance, or the Town Manager
or his or her designee shall have issued an order, ordering an abandoned
structure to be repaired, altered, or improved as provided in §
150.35, and if the owner has vacated and closed such structure and kept such
structure vacated and closed for a period of six months pursuant to the
ordinance or order, then if the Town Board shall find that the owner has
abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the structure and
that the continuation of the structure in its vacated and closed status would
be inimical to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the town in that the
structure would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard,
would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on
criminal activities, and would cause or contribute to blight and the
deterioration of property values in the area, then in such circumstances the
Town Board may, after the expiration of such one-year period, enact an
ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
      (1)   If it is determined that the repair of the structure can be made at
a cost not exceeding 50% of the then current value of the structure, the
ordinance shall require that the owner either repair or demolish and remove the
structure within 90 days.
      (2)   If it is determined that the repair of the structure cannot be made
at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then current value of the structure, the
ordinance shall require that the owner demolish and remove the structure within
90 days.
   (B)   An ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall be recorded in the
office of the register of deeds of the county and shall be indexed in the name
of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with
this ordinance, the Town Manager shall effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.
The cost to repair or demolish and remove the dwelling shall be a lien against
the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall be filed,
have priority, and be collected in the same manner as the lien for special
assessments established by G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10.
(Ord. 04-05-19, passed 5-9-05; Am. Ord. 07-08-20, passed 1-14-08)
§ 150.37 METHODS OF SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   (A)   Complaints and orders issued by the Town Manager or his or her
designee under this subchapter shall be served upon persons either personally
or by registered or certified mail and, in conjunction therewith, may be served
by regular mail. When the manner of service is by regular mail in conjunction
with registered or certified mail, and the registered or certified mail is
unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post office
within ten days after mailing, service shall be deemed sufficient. The person
mailing the notice or order by regular mail shall certify that fact and the
date thereof, and such certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud.
   (B)   If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Town Manager or his or her designee in
the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the Town Manager or his or her
designee makes an affidavit to that effect, then the serving of the complaint
or order upon the unknown owners or other persons may be made by publication in
a newspaper having general circulation in the town at least once no later than
the time at which personal service would be required under the provisions of
this subchapter. When service is made by publication, a notice of the pending
proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises thereby
affected.
   (C)   Authorized agent. Each owner of rental property located within the
town shall authorize a person residing in the county to serve as his or her
agent for the purpose of accepting service of process under this section. The
Town Manager may choose to consider allowing a non-county resident to serve as
a designee on a case by case basis. The owner shall provide the authorized
agent's name and address in writing to the Town Manager or his or her designee.
The owner shall notify the Town Manager or his or her designee of any changes
in the information provided not less than ten days after such changes have
occurred. Nothing in this division (C) shall be interpreted to require an owner
to designate an agent to accept service of process where the owner of the
rental property resides within the county. The initial failure of an owner to
authorize an agent, as required in this division (C), will not result in the
imposition of a civil penalty as hereinafter authorized; however, a civil
penalty will be imposed if an owner fails to authorize an agent and fails to
provide to the Town Manager or his or her designee the authorized agent's name
and address not less than ten days after being notified by the Town Manager or
his or her designee that such a designation is required under this division
(C). Any violation of the provisions of this division (C) or a failure to
comply with any of its requirements will subject the offender to a civil
penalty in the amount of $50. Each ten day period or part thereof in which a
violation continues shall be considered a separate violation for the purpose of
the civil penalty provided by this division (C).

§ 150.38 IN REM ACTION BY TOWN MANAGER OR HIS OR HER DESIGNEE; PLACARDING.
   (A)   After failure of an owner of a structure to comply with an order of
the Town Manager or his or her designee issued pursuant to the provisions of
this subchapter, and upon adoption by the Town Board of an ordinance
authorizing and directing him or her to do so, as provided by state law and §
150.35(C) of this subchapter, the Town Manager or his or her designee shall
proceed to cause such structure to be removed or demolished, as directed by the
ordinance of the Town Board and shall cause to be posted on the main entrance
of such structure a placard prohibiting the use or occupation of the structure.
Use or occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a misdemeanor.
   (B)   Each such ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of
deeds of the county and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in
the grantor index, as provided by state law.
(Ord. 04-05-19, passed 5-9-05)
§ 150.39 COSTS; A LIEN ON PREMISES.
   As provided by state law, the amount of the cost of any removal or
demolition caused to be made or done by the Town Manager or his or her designee
pursuant to this subchapter shall be a lien against the real property upon
which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall be filed, have the same priority,
and be enforced and the costs collected as provided by G.S. Chapter 160A,
Article 10.
(Ord. 04-05-19, passed 5-9-05)
§ 150.40 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
   Neither this subchapter nor any of its provisions shall be construed to
impair or limit in any way the power of the town to define and declare
nuisances and to cause their abatement by summary action or otherwise, or to
enforce this subchapter by criminal process, and the enforcement of any remedy
provided herein shall not prevent the enforcement of any other remedy or
remedies provided herein or in other ordinances or laws.
(Ord. 04-05-19, passed 5-9-05)
§ 150.41 STANDARDS FOR BOARDING A VACANT BUILDING.
   (A)   Any temporary boarding of the doors, windows or other openings of any
building or structure or any means of securing such openings, other than by the
conventional method used in the original construction and design of the
building or structure, shall comply with the following minimum standards.
      (1)   Windows. Windows and similar openings shall be boarded with
exterior grade plywood of a minimum thickness of three-fourths inch (to be
consistent with door security standards) or its equivalent, and shall be cut to
match the dimensions of the window opening. Vent holes may be required, as
deemed necessary by the building official. The plywood shall be secured in
place, at a minimum standard approved by the minimum housing code official.
Bolts and nuts used to secure the cross members to the plywood must be
tightened enough to slightly deflect the wood so that it does not give purchase
for pliers or pry bars. The nuts are to be located on the interior side of the
structure.
      (2)   Exterior doors. The main exterior (required) residential exit door
(s) and all commercial exterior exit doors shall be boarded with exterior grade
plywood of a minimum thickness of three-fourths inch or its equivalent, fitted
to the entry door jamb with maximum one-eighth-inch clearance at each edge from
the door jambs and threshold, cut to match the dimensions of the door opening.
The existing door should be removed. The plywood shall be attached at a minimum
standard, approved by the minimum housing code official. Fasteners used to
attach the door hasp and hinges shall be the nonreversible type that do not
give a purchase for pliers or pry bars. All other unsecured residential doors
providing exterior access shall be removed and shall be secured in the same
fashion as windows noted above.
      (3)   Painting of boarded openings. All boarded openings shall be painted
with a minimum of one coat of oil-based exterior paint, in a color compatible
with the exterior color of the building or structure.
      (4)   Garages. Overhead garage doors shall be secured. Nailing the door
to the jamb or nailing pieces of two-by-four to the jamb are not acceptable.
The overhead door shall be padlocked with the existing garage lock or a newly
installed one. In an attached garage it is acceptable, as a minimum standard,
to insert a piece of Grade No. 2 Douglas fir two-by-four lumber through the
overhead mechanism on the inside of the door. The two-by-four shall be long
enough to go through both sides of the mechanism or shall be nailed in place on
the inside so that it cannot fall out. Secondary garage entrances to the
outside of the garage shall be secured with strong-backed plywood as described
for windows above. Access doors between the house and attached garage need not
be boarded. Detached garages shall be secured as separate structures. Access
shall be provided by padlock as described for doors above.
   (B)   Alternative methods of securing a building. Notwithstanding division
(A) of this section, the minimum housing code official may approve alternative
methods of securing doors, windows or other openings of any building or
structure. In making the determination to approve any alternative method, the
official shall consider its aesthetic and other impacts on the immediate
neighborhood, and the extent to which it provides adequate security against the
unauthorized entry to the property.
   (C)   During all times that persons are inside a boarded structure, all
exits and entries shall be made accessible; provided, that the structure must
be again secured when such persons are no longer inside.

PLANNING BOARD
§ 151.01 ESTABLISHMENT; POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (A)   Members.
      (1)   The Planning Board and Board of Adjustment shall be comprised of
ten regular members and two alternate members. Eight of the regular members and
one of the alternate members (Alternate #1) shall be appointed by the Board of
Commissioners of the town. Two of the regular members and one of the alternate
members (Alternate #2) shall be appointed by the Pitt County Board of
Commissioners under the authority set out in state law . The two regular
members and one alternate member (Alternate #2) appointed by the Pitt County
Commissioners shall be residents of the extraterritorial jurisdiction within a
one- mile area outside the corporate limits of the town.
      (2)   The extraterritorial (ETJ) members shall have equal rights,
privileges and duties with town members of the Board, and are required to vote
on each question, regardless of whether the matters at issue arise within the
town or within the extraterritorial jurisdiction.
      (3)   The number of members representing the extraterritorial
jurisdiction shall be at least proportional to the number of members
representing the Town of Ayden, as required by state law . Minimum
extraterritorial representation shall be calculated by dividing the total
population of the town and the extraterritorial jurisdiction by the number of
persons on the Planning Board to determine the minimum required per capita
proportional representation for the extraterritorial jurisdiction. For example:
town population of 5,000 plus extraterritorial jurisdiction population of 900 =
5,900 divided by 10 = one representative per 590 persons = one representative
for the extraterritorial jurisdiction. S tate law requires at least one
representative for the extraterritorial jurisdiction. The full fraction rule
expressed in state law provides that additional representation for the
extraterritorial jurisdiction is required for full tenths of the total
population of the town and extraterritorial jurisdiction.
      (4)   Each alternate member, while attending any meeting of the Board and
serving in the absence of any regular member, shall have and may exercise all
powers and duties of a regular member. Any alternate member may serve for any
regular member without regard to which jurisdiction the alternate or regular
member was originally appointed by.
      (5)   Alternate members may participate in discussions or proceedings,
but may not vote except in the absence or disqualification of a regular member.
Participation of alternate members shall not be deemed to increase the size of
the Boards. A vote shall not be delayed in order that the regular member may
vote instead of an alternate member. In the event that a choice must be made as
to which alternate member is to vote, Alternate #1 shall vote.
      (6)   No regular or alternate member shall be permitted to participate in
any matter, which he/she has either directly or indirectly any personal or
financial interest.
      (7)   The eight regular town members and two regular ETJ members
appointed by the Board of Commissioners of the town and county respectively
shall be appointed for terms of three years and shall serve without
compensation.
      (8)   The terms of the alternate members first appointed under this
subchapter shall be so determined that to the greatest practicable extent, the
expiration of such terms shall be distributed evenly over the first two years
after their appointment; provided that the initial term of no alternate member
shall exceed two years. Alternates #1 and #2 are to be appointed initially for
a term of two years.
      (9)   No member shall serve longer than three consecutive full terms.
Individuals serving three consecutive full terms must sit off the Board for one
calendar year before eligible for reappointment. This policy may be waived if
the Board of Commissioners determines that the removal of the individual made
ineligible by this statute would place the functioning of the Board at a
disadvantage or if the town does not receive any applications from qualified
individuals after advertising for two consecutive weeks.
      (10)   When filling vacancies caused by the resignation of existing
members, the Town Board of Commissioners and County Board of Commissioners may
appoint certain members for less than three years to the end that thereafter
the terms of all members shall not expire at the same time.
      (11)   Members and alternate members may, after a public hearing, be
removed by the Board of Commissioners for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or
malfeasance in office. The Board of Commissioners shall file a written
statement of reasons of such removal. Vacancies occurring for reasons other
than expiration of terms shall be filled as they occur for the period of the
unexpired term by the Board of Commissioners.
('70 Code, Ch. L, Art. I § 1) (Ord., passed 6-28-72; Am. Ord. 96-97-04, passed
10-14-96)
      (12)   If appointees have unexcused absences which constitute more than
25% of the Board meetings in any calendar year which they are required to
attend pursuant to their appointment, they are obligated to resign. Excused
absences are defined as absences caused by events beyond one's control, if
individuals refuse to resign, they may be dismissed by action of the Town Board
of Commissioners subject to state or local law. A calendar year is defined as a
12-month period beginning on the date of appointment.
   (B)   Meetings; officers. Within 30 days after appointment, the Planning
Board shall meet and elect a Chairman and create and fill such offices as it
may determine. The term of the Chairman and other officers shall be one year,
with eligibility for reelection. The Planning Board shall adopt rules for
transaction of its business and shall keep a record of its members' attendance
and of its resolutions, discussions, findings, and recommendations, which
record shall be a public record. The Planning Board shall hold at least one
meeting monthly, and all of its meetings shall be open to the public. Whenever
a regular meeting of the Planning Board falls on a town observed public
holiday, it is automatically rescheduled for the next week day or other date as
determined by the Planning Board. No regular or special meeting of the Planning
Board should be scheduled on a town observed public holiday.
   (C)   Duties. It shall be the duty of the Planning Board, in general:
      (1)   To acquire and maintain in current form such basic information and
materials as are necessary to any understanding of past trends, present
conditions, and forces at work to cause changes in these conditions;

      (6)   To keep the Town Board of Commissioners and the general public
informed and advised as to these matters; and
      (7)   To perform any other duties which may lawfully be assigned to it by
the Town Board of Commissioners.
   (D)   Powers. The Planning Board may conduct such public hearings as may be
required to gather information necessary for the drafting, establishment, and
maintenance of the comprehensive plan. Before adopting any such plan, the
Planning Board shall hold at least one public hearing thereon.
      (1)   The Planning Board may establish committees and subcommittees
consisting of members chosen from its own membership or from residents of the
town to assist in carrying out any and all of its planning functions and
implementation of the plans made. The Planning Board is authorized to expend
such funds for planning and implementation of such plans as the Board of
Commissioners of the town may appropriate, provided these are expended for
causes or purposes designated by the Board of Commissioners in its
appropriation.
      (2)   The Planning Board shall have power to promote public interest in
and an understanding of its recommendations, and to that end, it may publish
and distribute copies of its recommendations and may employ such other means of
publicity and education as it may determine.
      (3)   Members or employees of the Planning Board, when duly authorized by
the Planning Board, may attend planning conferences or meetings of planning
institutes or hearings upon pending planning legislation. The Planning Board
may, by formal and affirmative vote, pay, within the Planning Board's budget,
the reasonable traveling expenses incident to such attendance.

(Ord. 12-13-25, passed 5-13-13)
§ 156.09 COMPLAINT AND HEARING.
   If the preliminary investigation discloses evidence of a violation of §
156.04, the Code Enforcement Officer shall issue and cause to be served upon
the owner of and parties in interest, in the non- residential building or
structure, a complaint. The complaint shall state the following:
   (A)   The charges and a notice that a hearing will be held before the Code
Enforcement Officer at a place within the town, scheduled within 30 days after
the serving of the complaint;
   (B)   That the owner and parties in interest shall be given the right to
answer the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony
at the place and time fixed in the complaint; and
   (C)   That the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall
not be controlling in hearings before the Code Enforcement Officer.
(Ord. 12-13-25, passed 5-13-13)
§ 156.10 ORDER.
   If, after notice and hearing, the Code Enforcement Officer determines that
the non-residential building or structure has not been properly maintained so
that the safety or health of its occupants or members of the general public is
jeopardized for failure of the property to meet the minimum standards
established by the governing body, the Code Enforcement Officer shall state in
writing findings of fact in support of that determination and shall issue and
cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order. The order may require the
owner to take remedial action, within a reasonable time specified, subject to
the procedures and limitations herein.
   (A)   Limitations on orders.
      (1)   An order may require the owner to repair, alter, or improve the
non- residential building or structure in order to bring it into compliance
with the minimum standards established by the governing body or to vacate and
close the non-residential building or structure for any use.
      (2)   An order may require the owner to remove or demolish the non-
residential building or structure if the cost of repair, alteration, or
improvement of the building or structure would exceed 50% of its then current
value. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the non-residential
building or structure is designated as a local historic landmark, listed in the
National Register of Historic Places, or located in a locally designated
historic district or in a historic district listed in the National Register of
Historic Places and the governing body determines, after a public hearing as
provided by ordinance, that the non-residential building or structure is of
individual significance or contributes to maintaining the character of the
district, and the non-residential building or structure has not been condemned
as unsafe, the order may require that the non-residential building or structure
be vacated and closed until it is brought into compliance with the minimum
standards established by the governing body.
(Ord. 12-13-25, passed 5-13-13)
      (3)   An order may not require repairs, alterations, or improvements to
be made to vacant manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial warehouse
facilities to preserve the original use. The order may require such building or
structure to be vacated and closed, but repairs may be required only when
necessary to maintain structural integrity or to abate a health or safety
hazard that cannot be remedied by ordering the building or structure closed for
any use.
   (B)   Action by governing body upon failure to comply with order.
      (1)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or
improve or to vacate and close the nonresidential building or structure, the
governing body may adopt an ordinance ordering the Code Enforcement Officer to
proceed to effectuate the purpose of this section with respect to the
particular property or properties that the Code Enforcement Officer found to be
jeopardizing the health or safety of its occupants or members of the general
public. The property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. The
ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds and shall be
indexed in the name of the property owner or owners in the grantor index.
Following adoption of an ordinance, the Code Enforcement Officer may cause the
building or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and
closed. The Code Enforcement Officer may cause to be posted on the main
entrance of any non-residential building or structure so closed a placard with
the following words: "This building is unfit for any use; the use or occupation
of this building for any purpose is prohibited and unlawful." Any person who
occupies or knowingly allows the occupancy of a building or structure so posted
shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.
      (2)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish
the non- residential building or structure, the governing body may adopt an
ordinance ordering the Code Enforcement Officer to proceed to effectuate the
purpose of this section with respect to the particular property or properties
that the Code Enforcement Officer found to be jeopardizing the health or safety
of its occupants or members of the general public. No ordinance shall be
adopted to require demolition of a non-residential building or structure until
the owner has first been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into
conformity with the minimum standards established by the governing body. The
property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. The ordinance shall
be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds and shall be indexed in the
name of the property owner or owners in the grantor index. Following adoption
of an ordinance, the Code Enforcement Officer may cause the building or
structure to be removed or demolished.
   (C)   (1)   Action by governing body upon abandonment of intent to repair.
If the governing body has adopted an ordinance or the Code Enforcement Officer
has issued an order requiring the building or structure to be repaired or
vacated and closed and the building or structure has been vacated and closed
for a period of two years pursuant to the ordinance or order, the governing
body may make findings that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to
repair, alter, or improve the building or structure and that the continuation
of the building or structure in its vacated and closed status would be inimical
to the health, safety, and welfare of the municipality in that it would
continue to deteriorate, would create a fire or safety hazard, would be a
threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal
activities, or would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of
property values in the area. Upon such findings, the governing body may, after
the expiration of the two-year period, enact an ordinance and serve such
ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
         (a)   If the cost to repair the non-residential building or structure
to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards is less than or equal to
50% of its then current value, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the building or structure within 90 days;
or
         (b)   If the cost to repair the non-residential building or structure
to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards exceeds 50% of its then
current value, the ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the
building or structure within 90 days.
      (2)   In the case of vacant manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial
warehouse facilities, the building or structure must have been vacated and
closed pursuant to an order or ordinance for a period of five years before the
governing body may take action under this division. The ordinance shall be
recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds in the county wherein the
property or properties are located and shall be indexed in the name of the
property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with the
ordinance, the Code Enforcement Officer shall effectuate the purpose of the
ordinance.
(Ord. 12-13-25, passed 5-13-13)
§ 156.11 SERVICE OF COMPLAINTS AND ORDERS.
   Complaints or orders issued by the Code Enforcement Officer pursuant to an
ordinance adopted under this section shall be served upon persons either
personally or by registered or certified mail so long as the means used are
reasonably designed to achieve actual notice. When service is made by
registered or certified mail, a copy of the complaint or order may also be sent
by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the registered or
certified mail is refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post
office within ten days after the mailing. If regular mail is used, a notice of
the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises
affected. If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are
unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Code Enforcement Officer in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, and the Code Enforcement Officer makes an
affidavit to that effect, the serving of the complaint or order upon the owners
or other persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general
circulation in the town at least once no later than the time that personal
service would be required under this section. When service is made by
publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises affected.
(Ord. 12-13-25, passed 5-13-13)
§ 156.12 LIENS.
   (A)   Upon the Code Enforcement Officer effectuating the order to repair,
alter, improve, vacate, close, remove or demolish the non-residential property,
the amount of the cost shall be a lien against the real property upon which the
cost was incurred. This lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be
collected as the lien for special assessment provided in G.S.
   (B)   The amount of the costs shall also be a lien on any other real
property of the owner, except for the owner's primary residence. The additional
lien provided in this subdivision is inferior to all prior liens and shall be
collected as a money judgment.
   (C)   When a non-residential building or structure is removed or demolished
by the Code Enforcement Officer, the officer shall offer for sale the
recoverable materials of the building or structure and any personal property,
fixtures, or appurtenances found in or attached to the building or structure.
All proceeds of the sale shall be credited against the cost of the removal or
demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the Superior Court.
The proceeds shall be secured in a manner directed by the Court and shall be
disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final
order or decree. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit
in any way the power of the City Council to define and declare nuisances and to
cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
(Ord. 12-13-25, passed 5-13-13)
§ 156.13 CIVIL PENALTY.
   In addition to other available remedies provided in this chapter, any
violation of this chapter may subject the offender to a civil penalty in the
amount of $50 for each day the violation(s) continue to exist, as provided in §
10.99 of this code.
(Ord. 12-13-25, passed 5-13-13)
§ 156.14 APPEALS.
   Any appeals for an order or decision made by the Code Enforcement Officer
may be taken to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Any person aggrieved by a
decision or order of the Code Enforcement Officer shall have the remedies
provided in state law.
