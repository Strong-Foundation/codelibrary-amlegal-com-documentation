         (a)   Yard waste and household products less than five gallons (volume
based on best judgment of the village representative). First time offenders who
discharge into the MS4 yard waste of five gallons or less of domestic or
household products, where the quantity actually discharged is considered
ordinary for household purposes shall be assessed a Category I civil penalty in
the amount set forth in the schedule of civil penalties. Each day’s continuing
violation shall constitute a separate and distinct offense for the purpose of
assessing a civil penalty.
         (b)   Household products greater than five gallons, non-household
products and unknown volume and nature. First time offenders who discharge into
the MS4 more than five gallons of domestic or household products, who discharge

civil penalty.
         (d)   Repeat offenders. A User who discharges into the MS4 in
violation of this subchapter more than once within a 12-month period, shall be
assessed a civil penalty at one category level higher than the category
assessed for a first time offender of the substance discharged. Each day’s
continuing violation shall constitute a separate and distinct offense for the
purpose of assessing a civil penalty.
      (2)   Illicit connections. Any user or other person, including but not
limited to a designer, contractor, agent, or engineer, who allows, acts,
participates in, assists, or directs the establishment of an illicit
connection, either directly or indirectly, shall be subject to civil penalties
as follows:
         (a)   First time offenders shall be assessed a Category II civil
penalty in an amount set forth in the schedule of civil penalties. Each day’s
continuing violation shall constitute a separate and distinct offense for the
purpose of assessing a civil penalty.
         (b)   A user or person who is found to have violated division (B)(2)
(a) of this section more than once within a 12-month period shall be assessed a
Category III civil penalty in an amount set forth in the schedule of civil

         (b)   Category II: civil penalty to not exceed $500 per day per
violation.
         (c)   Category III: civil penalty to not exceed $1,000 per day per
violation.
      (6)   Penalty considerations. In determining the amount of the penalty,
the Stormwater Administrator or designee shall consider:
         (a)   The degree and extent of harm to the environment, public health
and public and private property.
         (b)   The cost of remedying the damage.
         (c)   The duration of the violation.
         (d)   Whether or not the violation was willful.
         (e)   The prior record of the person responsible for the violation in

         (f)   The village’s enforcement costs and the amount of money saved by
the violator through his, her or its noncompliance.
   (C)   Recovery of costs and fines. As authorized by G.S. § 160A-193, the
offender shall be liable to the village for the civil penalty, all costs
incurred by the village while enforcing this subchapter, including but not
limited to: abatement costs, remedying the damage caused by the illicit
discharge, restoring the facility, sampling, clean-up, the village’s
administrative costs, costs of court, and costs of litigation, to include
reasonable attorney’s fees. Within 30 days after the village has completed its
abatement of the violation, restoration of the facility and/or its
investigation and inspection, the violating user or person will be notified of
the village’s total costs and the civil penalty, if any. The total amount due
shall be paid within 30 days of the date of notice. If the amount due is not
paid within 30 days, the charges shall constitute a lien on the land or
premises where the nuisance occurred. A lien established pursuant to this
division shall have the same priority and be collected as unpaid ad valorem
taxes. The total amount due is also a lien on any other real property owned by
the user within the village limits, except for the person’s primary residence.
A lien established pursuant to this division is inferior to all prior liens and
shall be collected as a money judgment. The user may avoid the lien on any
other real property owned by the user within the village limits only if the
user can show that the accrual or threatened discharge was created solely by
another person. In the event that the user is able to pass the liability onto
another person, the other person shall be liable to the village pursuant to
this section.

of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent
peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Watershed
Review Board or by a court of record on application of notice of the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and upon due cause shown.
   (D)   The Watershed Review Board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the
appeal and give notice thereof to the parties and shall decide the same within
a reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent or
by attorney.

shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
   ADJACENT BLKLOT. A BLKLOT that physically adjoins another BLKLOT having a
common boundary line at any point in the parcel. A BLKLOT separated by roads,
railroads, or other public rights-of-way is not considered an ADJACENT BLKLOT.
   BLOCK/LOT (BLKLOT). Taxable parcel as defined in the Forsyth County tax
records.
   EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT (ERU). A measure of the amount of impervious
surface area contained on a typical single-family residence in Clemmons. This
has been determined to be 3,952 square feet of impervious surface area. An ERU
is also the basis for charging a stormwater fee.
   HABITABLE DWELLING UNIT (HDU). A permanent or semi-permanent (e.g., mobile
home) structure, that could provide shelter for one family unit, and has at
least one each of the following: sleeping area (bedroom), cooking area
(kitchen), and sanitary area (bathroom). A camper trailer would qualify if it
is a primary residence and meets the stated criteria.
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE AREA. A surface which, because of its composition or
compacted nature, impedes or prevents natural infiltration of water into the
soil, including but not limited to: roofs, solid decks, driveways, patios,
sidewalks, parking areas, tennis courts, streets, or compacted gravel surfaces.
(Note: slatted decks, swimming pools, ponds, and lakes are considered
pervious.)
   MANUFACTURED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. Any BLKLOT maintained, offered, or used
for parking two or more manufactured homes, regardless of whether or not a
charge is made for such accommodations.
   RESIDENTIAL BILLING CATEGORIES: 
   MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENCE (MFR). A BLKLOT or complex containing two or more
HDUs. Examples: townhouses, condominiums, apartment complexes, duplexes, and
mobile home parks.
      (1)   MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL - MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP (MFR-MO). A
collection of BLKLOTs that make up a defined development sharing common areas
and private streets where each HDU is owned separately and there is only one
HDU per BLKLOT. Examples include townhouses or condominium complexes.
      (2)   MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL - SINGLE OWNERSHIP (MFR-SO). A BLKLOT or
complex where a single entity owns the entire complex or major portions of the
complex. In this situation each BLKLOT will have multiple HDUs. Examples
include apartment complexes, mobile home parks, and duplexes.
   NON-RESIDENTIAL (NR). All property other than residential. Examples include
commercial, industrial, institutional, governmental, utilities, religious, tax-
exempt.
   NON-SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (NON-SFR). Any land use other than single-
family residential, except for undeveloped land.
   SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (SFR). A single BLKLOT having only one HDU and
having no apparent commercial activity or value. (The term includes
manufactured homes that are not located in manufactured housing developments
and MRF-MO. For billing purposes, a SFR BLKLOT being used for a commercial
purpose does not fit in this category, but will be billed according to the Non-
Single Family Residential standard as listed in §
51.07(A)(2). Examples include but are not limited to child day care or family
group homes.)
   SAME BLKLOT OWNERSHIP. The name listed in the Forsyth County tax records is
the same for two or more BLKLOTs.

   (C)   Stormwater management is a multi-faceted program extending beyond the
physical location and conditions of an individual property's stormwater
discharge or runoff. Additionally, stormwater runoff affects recharged
groundwater. Therefore, properties not draining into the village's drainage
system are not exempt, nor will receive credits, from the provisions of this
chapter simply due to the fact that they are not utilizing the village's
stormwater system.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 4-25-05)
§ 51.05 BILLING METHOD; RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.
   (A)   (1)   The billing and collections system for the Utility shall be
administered by the Forsyth County Tax Collector as set forth in the agreement
between the Village of Clemmons and Forsyth County. Stormwater billing fees
will be assigned to BLKLOTs based on property ownership data on file with
Forsyth County Tax Collector, and this fee will be included in the annual ad-
valorem property tax collection invoices administered annually by the Tax
Collector.
      (2)   The Village of Clemmons will maintain the billing data master
account file, and this file will indicate the number of ERUs attributable for
each BLKLOT as evidenced by the Tax Collector files as of January 1 of each
year prior to the subsequent budget year beginning the following July 1.
Stormwater charges will appear on the annual tax bill which will be mailed to
property owners consistent with the annual property tax billing schedule. The
property owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the annual stormwater
service fee for each BLKLOT and lot as listed on the tax invoice.
   (B)   Due date. Stormwater fees are due and payable according to the same
payment schedule applicable to property taxes as set forth in G.S. § 105-360.
Payments are due and payable on September 1 of the fiscal year for which the
fees are levied. Fees are payable at face value if paid before January 6
following the due date.
   (C)   Delinquent fees. Fees paid on or after January 6 following the due
date are delinquent and are subject to interest charges as set forth in G.S. §
105-360.
   (D)   Delinquent fees procedure. Delinquent fees may be collected in the
same manner as delinquent property taxes. Interest charges on delinquent fees
shall be collected in like manner. Accordingly, the Tax Collector shall proceed
to collect such fees and interest by use of any remedy allowed for under G.S.
Chapter 105, Article 26. Ths includes, but is not limited to, the North
Carolina State Debt Setoff program as set forth in G.S. Chapter 105A, Article
1, and procedures for attachment and garnishment as designated by G.S. §
105.368.
   (E)   The creation of tax liens as a remedy for delinquent stormwater fees
is hereby authorized as specified in G.S. § 160A-314(a1)(4). This authorization
includes all actions reasonably associated with the creation of tax liens,
including but not limited to, the advertisement of unpaid fees.
   (F)   The Village of Clemmons may, at its sole discretion, commence legal
actions allowed to collect unpaid debt or impose penalties on such unpaid debt
as allowed by law.
   (G)   Medium of payment. The method of fee payment shall be payable and
subject to the allowances and restrictions identified in G.S. § 105-357.
   (H)   Place for collection. Stormwater fees shall be payable at the office
of the Forsyth County Tax Collector and other places designated by the Tax
Collector for the payment of such fees. Stormwater fees shall not be collected
by the Village of Clemmons or its personnel.
   (I)   Immaterial irregularities. Immaterial irregularities, as listed in
G.S. § 105-94, will not invalidate the fee imposed upon BLKLOTs nor the ability
of the Forsyth County Tax Collector to otherwise enforce any other process
identified in this chapter.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 4-25-05; Am. Ord. 2005-12, passed 10-24-05)
§ 51.06 BACKBILLING.
   Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. The owner of
each parcel of developed land, unless excepted by this chapter, shall be
ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no
bill is sent for developed land, the village shall backbill for unpaid fees for
a period up to three years.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 4-25-05)
§ 51.07 BILLING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Each developed BLKLOT which has impervious surface equal to or greater
than 500 square feet shall be billed the appropriate stormwater fee.
      (1)   Single Family Residence (SFR) BLKLOTs. Each SFR BLKLOT will be
billed based on the amount of impervious area on their property as of January 1
of the subsequent billing year, as identified in § 51.03(D). Any BLKLOT
containing a single manufactured home will be considered as an SFR BLKLOT.
Exception: A BLKLOT that is adjacent to an SFR BLKLOT, and is under the same
ownership as the adjacent SFR BLKLOT, and does not have an HDU or commercial
value/activity, may not be billed. (Examples include adjacent BLKLOTs
containing only private driveways or sheds.)
      (2)   Non-Single Family Residential (Non-SFR) BLKLOTs. All Non-SFR
BLKLOTs shall be billed based on the amount of impervious area on the site as
of January 1 of the subsequent billing year. The actual impervious surface area
will be measured in square feet, and the number of ERUs calculated by dividing
the total square feet of impervious area by the ERU amount. The impervious area
present on each Non-SFR BLKLOT will be updated annually as needed using best
available information.
   (B)   Billing basis: SFR and Non-SFR. The basis for determining whether each
BLKLOT is billed SFR or Non-SFR will be the underlying zoning district and
associated land use as listed by the Forsyth County Planning Permits
Department. All BLKLOTs located in RS (Single Family) zoning districts as
designated by the Forsyth County zoning map shall be billed as SFR, unless the
land use of such SFR zoning districts clearly indicates a Non-SFR use. Examples
of such occurrences may include, but are not limited to, legally non-conforming
uses or potential zoning inaccuracies/violations. All other BLKLOTs will be
billed as Non-SFR BLKLOTs. Mobile homes located in mobile housing developments
will be handled in accordance with division (F) below.
   (C)   The minimum billable fee shall be based off of the minimum tier
(within the fee structure) as approved by Council for Single Family Residential
(SFR) BLKLOTs and one ERU for all Non-SFR BLKLOTs. Each fractional ERU for Non-
SFR BLKLOTs will be rounded up to the next full ERU when the fractional
impervious area is equal to or greater than 500 square feet.
   (D)   Optional billing method for Multi-Family Residential - Multiple
Ownership (MFR-MO). 
      (1)   If a homeowners’ association, or similar single entity representing
the MFR-MO presents a formal written request, the Village Council may amend the
billing method during the upcoming budget year. This option allow all of the
BLKLOTs represented by the homeowners’ association to include all common areas,
private streets, plus all dwelling units, to be included in one single
calculated impervious area. If approved, a single bill will be sent to the
association for payment of the calculated impervious area.
      (2)   This alternate billing method requires an agreement between, and
approved by, the Village of Clemmons and the homeowners’ association. It is the
sole discretion of the Village Council to approve this alternate billing
method, and will be based on a case-by-case determination of the homeowners’
association's legal authority to enter into such an agreement with the Village
of Clemmons.
   (E)   Manufactured housing developments (MHDs). This section applies to
zoning districts designated as Manufactured Housing Developments in the Forsyth
County unified development ordinance. Mobile home parks will be billed based on
the total impervious area in the MHD. This area will be updated annually by
summing the total of:
      (1)   All impervious surface area excluding mobile homes and pads; and
      (2)   The impervious area of all mobile homes and pads. This will be
updated annually by using a random sample (2% of mobile homes in the
development) to determine the average mobile home pad impervious surface area,
and then multiplying that average surface area times the number of mobile homes
or pads present as of January 1 each year preceding the subsequent budget year.
   (F)   Mixed-Use BLKLOT. BLKLOTs that include a mixture of residential and
commercial purposes will be billed as non-residential BLKLOTs. This use is
indicated either by the MU zoning district designated by the zoning maps or by
a determination by a Forsyth County Permits Inspector that such a combination
exists.
   (G)   The Village Manager has authority to interpret the billing procedures
and adjust related billing charges as needed to address circumstances which
apply principally to either misinterpretation of this chapter or to
miscalculation of billing charges.
   (H)   Privately owned streets. If the street is in an SFR area, impervious
area will not be measured or charged. If the street is in a non-residential
area with commercial uses, an MFR-SO, or a manufactured housing development,
then the impervious area of the street will be measured and included in the
total fee determination for the property. Additionally, MFR-MO BLKLOTs which
choose the optional billing method discussed above in division (D) will be
treated as Non-SFR and include private streets in the impervious area
calculation.
   (I)   Rules for sites under construction. Prior to public dedication and
acceptance by the Village of Clemmons’ governing body, SFR streets constructed
or graveled to an impervious condition will not be billed a stormwater fee
unless the subdivision experiences six months of construction inactivity as of
January l of each year. Construction activity may be indicated by, but not
limited to, any physical construction or permits issued for the site within the
last six months for construction purposes.

§ 51.08 APPEALS.
   Any customer who believes the provisions of this chapter have been applied
in error may appeal in the following manner:
   (A)   An appeal must be filed in writing with the Village Manager or his or
her designee stating the basis of the appeal. At the discretion of the Village
Manager, the appeal shall include information displaying the total property
area, the impervious surface area, and any information that is pertinent to the
appellant's case.
   (B)   A technical review shall be performed to determine the accuracy of the
information in the village's impervious surface master account file. The
Village Manager may adjust the fee or credit the account as long as the
adjustment is in conformance with the intent of this chapter. At the conclusion
of the review, the Village Manager shall issue a written determination stating
whether an adjustment to the stormwater billing is appropriate, and if so, the
amount of such adjustment. Decisions by the Village Manager should be concluded
within 60 days of receipt of appeal.
   (C)   Adjustments to fees already paid will be refunded through a check
which will be mailed to the offended party no later than 30 days following the
approved adjustment. Interest will not be paid by the village on refunds or
overpayments.
   (D)   No adjustments will be made for more than the two-year period
immediately preceding the date that the customer's appeal is received by the
Village Manager.
   (E)   All decisions of the Village Manager shall be served on the customer
personally or by registered or certified mail. Service shall be based upon the
billing address of the customer as listed in the Forsyth County tax records or
other verifiable document.
   (F)   Appeals will only be eligible when received by the village within two
calendar years of the applicable payment due date. Example: Fiscal year 2005-
2006 stormwater bills, mailed in September, are due and payable no later than
January 5, 2006. Appeals resulting from this bill must be received no later
than January 5, 2008.
   (G)   Results of appeal requests shall be reported to the elected Village
Council.
   (H)   Appeals of the Village Manager's decision shall be brought to the
elected Village Council by the aggrieved party by written request. The request
must be received by the Village of Clemmons within 60 days of receipt of notice
concerning the Village Manager's decision. A decision by the elected Village
Council shall be rendered within 60 days of receipt of the appeal, unless
delayed by conditions out of their control. All decisions of the Village
Council shall be final.
(Ord. 2005-04, passed 4-25-05)
§ 51.09 LIMITS OF RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   The village shall be responsible only for the portions of the drainage
system which are located in village-maintained street rights-of-way and
permanent storm drainage easements conveyed to and accepted by the elected
Village Council. Repairs and improvements to the drainage system shall be in
accordance with established standards, policies, and schedules.
   (B)   The village’s acquisition of storm drainage easements and/or the
construction or repair by the village of drainage facilities does not
constitute a warranty against stormwater hazards, including, but not limited
to, erosion, flooding, or standing water.

§ 51.11 ROADWAY DRAINAGE.
   (A)   Prohibited acts absent permit. Absent a permit issued by the Clemmons
Public Works Director or his or her designee:
      (1)   It shall be unlawful to block, fill, pipe, alter the grade of or
obstruct any drainage way, swale, ditch or drainage device located within the
public right-of-way in such manner as to impede or diminish the effectiveness
of its intended use.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful to pipe or fill any existing drainage ditch
along public ribbon-paved roadways, other than for permitted driveway access.
      (3)   It shall be unlawful for any person to connect a private drainage
structure to a public drainage structure in the public right-of-way.
   (B)   Permit. The Clemmons Public Works Director, or his or her designee, in
consultation with the Clemmons Stormwater Administrator, may authorize any of
the above prohibited acts to be done upon the public right-of-way when it is
made to appear that the action authorized, when taken, will not substantially
impair roadway drainage, will not impair the structural integrity of public
roads, and will not substantially diminish stormwater quality of quantity
controls.
   (C)   Violations; penalties. The following enforcement procedures may be
undertaken by the Stormwater Administrator, to enforce provisions of this
section.
      (1)   Criminal penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation violating any
provisions of this section shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. Upon
conviction thereof, such violator shall be subjected to a fine not to exceed
$500, except that no such violation shall be punishable until the expiration of
five days after notice shall have been issued by the Stormwater Administrator
and served upon such violator. Each and every day beyond the initial five-day
notice period during which such violation continues shall be deemed a separate
offense.
      (2)   Civil penalties.
         (a)   Assessment of civil penalties. In addition to criminal
penalties, any person, firm or corporation violating any provisions of this
section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $100 to be recovered by the
jurisdiction in a civil action in the nature of a debt. No civil penalty shall
be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified of
the violation by the Stormwater Administrator. Failure to correct the violation
within five days of the date of service of the notice, or the end of the period
of any extension, will result in the assessment of a civil penalty or other
enforcement action. For good cause determined by the Stormwater Administrator,
the correction period may be extended by him or her. Each day of continuing
violation shall constitute a separate violation.
         (b)   Referral to attorney. If payment is not received within 30 days
after written demand for payment is made, the Stormwater Administrator may
refer the matter to the jurisdiction’s attorney who is authorized to institute
a civil action in the name of the jurisdiction in the appropriate division of
the General Court of Justice for recovery of the penalty.
      (3)   Injunctive or other relief.
         (a)   Referral to attorney. In addition to other remedies provided by
law, whenever the Stormwater Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that
any person is violating or threatening to violate this section, the Stormwater
Administrator may refer the matter to the jurisdiction’s attorney.
         (b)   Other appropriate action. The jurisdiction’s attorney, on behalf
of the jurisdiction, may in addition to other remedies provided by law,
institute injunction, mandamus, abatement or any other appropriate action or
actions, proceeding or proceedings to prevent, enjoin, abate, or remove such
unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, maintenance, or
use.

§ 51.12 VILLAGE PARTICIPATION IN DRAINAGE PROJECTS ACROSS PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   The village may participate in the correction of private storm drainage
problems which occur on private property as follows:
   (A)   Single owner problems. Single owner private storm drainage problems
may be addressed when the following conditions are met:
      (1)   Public right-of-way runoff must be carried.
      (2)   The property involved in the project must be zoned residential and
must be improved with one single-family residential dwelling unit. Examples of
qualifying properties are single-family homes, and individual condominium units
or townhouses. Examples of non-qualifying properties are duplexes and apartment
buildings or complexes.
      (3)   The property owner must have been issued a Village of Clemmons
Stormwater Management Certificate of Occupancy for at least two years prior to
the request for assistance.
      (4)   The Village Manager, or their designee, in their sole discretion,
must determine that the drainage condition is an immediate threat to the
structural integrity of the dwelling, causing flooding of the dwelling, causing
severe erosion of the drainageway (factors considered may include size of
drainageway, linear footage of erosion, slope of drainageway, frequency of
erosion causing events and location of eroded area in relation to residences),
denying or threatening to deny access to property that would be accessible but
for the degradation of the drainageway, or impeding the flow of water due to
fallen brush and vegetative debris. Flooding of poorly placed structures in low
lying areas does not immediately qualify the applicant for this program.
      (5)   The action taken must significantly improve conditions described in
division (A)(4) of this section.
      (6)   Minimum size pipe shall be 15-inch and a village approved material.
      (7)   The total matched amount contributed by the village shall be 50% of
the total project cost, not to exceed $10,000 per property.
      (8)   The proposed project, in the opinion of the Village Manager, or
their designee, shall not be a threat to the downstream property.
      (9)   All storm drainage improvements constructed under this policy shall
be deemed to be the property and responsibility of the private property owner,
and such improvements shall not become part of the storm drainage system of the
village.
      (10)   After review and approval by the Stormwater Department, the
request must be approved by the Village Council.
      (11)   The property owner, upon the project being approved by the Village
Council, must pay to the village 50% of the estimated project cost, including
clearing and grubbing, purchasing and installation of pipe, and dirt to cover
the pipe, and enter into an agreement satisfactory to the Village Attorney for
the completion of the project, or, in lieu of such payment, must enter into an
agreement satisfactory to the Village Attorney, which shall be in the form of a
note and deed of trust with an interest rate as provided by law for
assessments, the payment schedule of which shall not exceed five years. Should
any project exceed the amount that the village will match, the property owner
will be solely responsible for those additional costs.
      (12)   No action or inaction of the village pursuant to this section
shall impose upon the village, its agents, officers, or employees, any
responsibility or liability of any kind, past or future, relating to any person
or property. The property owner shall agree to covenant to and hold the village
harmless from any death, personal injury, or property damage resulting from the
work.
      (13)   The property owner must sign a right of entry agreement form to
allow access to the work area and a hold harmless agreement. The village will
be held harmless for any damages to private property as long as reasonable care
is exercised.
   (B)   Multiple owner problems. Multiple owner problems may be addressed when
the following conditions are met:
      (1)   Public right-of-way runoff must be carried.
      (2)   The properties involved in the project must all be zoned
residential, at least 75% of the properties must be developed for residential
uses and each dwelling unit must be individually deeded to a person. Examples
of qualifying properties are single-family homes, condominium units, townhouses
and property used as a common area for multiple property owners, though owned
by a single entity, such as a home owner's association. Examples of non-
qualifying properties are duplexes and apartment buildings or complexes.
      (3)   Each property must have been issued a Village of Clemmons
Stormwater Management Certificate of Occupancy for at least two years prior to
the request for assistance.
      (4)   The drainage condition must be judged by the Village Manager, or
their designee, to involve flooding of a dwelling or dwellings, or must
represent an immediate threat to the structural integrity of a dwelling,
represent severe erosion of the drainageway (factors considered may include
size of drainageway, linear footage of erosion, slope of drainageway, frequency
of erosion causing events and location of eroded area in relation to
residences), or impede the flow of water due to fallen brush and vegetative
debris. Flooding of poorly placed structures in low lying areas does not
immediately qualify the applicant for this program.
      (5)   The action taken must significantly improve conditions described in
division (B)(4) of this section.
      (6)   Minimum size pipe shall be 15-inch and a village approved material.
      (7)   The total matched amount contributed by the village shall be 50% of
the total project cost, not to exceed $10,000 per property.
      (8)   The proposed project, in the opinion of the Village Manager, or
their designee, shall not be a threat to the downstream property.
      (9)   After review and approval by the Stormwater Department, the request
must be presented to the Village Council for its approval and determination
that funds are available.
      (10)   If all owners of the properties involved request the improvement,
payment of the owners' shares shall be made in the same manner as provided for
payment by single property owners in division (A) of this section. In that
event, all storm drainage improvements shall be deemed to be the property of
and the responsibility of the private property owners and shall not become a
part of the storm drainage system of the village.
      (11)   If fewer than all of the owners of all properties involved in the
project request the improvement, the Village Council may authorize the project
as a special assessment project pursuant to the provisions of G.S. Ch. 160A,
Article 10. In such circumstances, the requesting property owners shall provide
the village with both construction and/or permanent easements in amounts
sufficient for the project, in the opinion of the Village Manager, and the
costs of the project shall include the cost of acquisition or condemnation, if
necessary, of similar easements across the property of non-requesting property
owners. The cost of acquisition or condemnation shall be included in the
project costs for purposes of proration between the village and the property
owners. The assessments in such cases shall be for 50% of the estimated project
cost. Such assessment projects will only be undertaken where closed system
storm drainage improvements are undertaken. In such cases, the permanent
easement and all improvements included within the project shall be deemed to be
the property and responsibility of the village, such improvements shall become
a part of the storm drainage system of the village, and no private property
owner shall have any interest therein.

of vehicles, but not including grass or dirt.
   (B)   Exceptions.

in conjunction with special events including family or social gatherings,
provided such events do not occur more frequently than twice per calendar
month.
      (2)   Emergency or public vehicles. The prohibitions in this section
shall not apply to emergency and public service vehicles whose operators are
performing services for which they are responsible, nor do these prohibitions
apply to vehicles belonging to persons under contract with the village to
perform a public service. These exceptions, however, shall apply only when an
emergency situation requires that such vehicles park in the prohibited areas.
      (3)   Persons with special needs. The prohibitions in this section shall
not apply to a vehicle displaying a "handicap" sticker issued by the North
Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles when such vehicle is parked temporarily
(for less than one hour) to enable a person with special needs to access a

      (4)   Temporary maintenance of household. The prohibitions of this

      (5)   Permitted off-street parking. The prohibitions of this section
shall not apply to vehicles parked in compliance with §

§ 71.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   The civil penalty for violations of the section numbers listed below,
where a notice has been attached to a vehicle as provided in §
71.05, shall be as follows:
      (1)   Violation of §
71.02, too far from curb, $25;
      (2)   Violation of §
71.03, $100;
      (3)   Violation of §
71.07, parking on lawns of a residential dwelling unit, $50.
   (B)   (1)   When the owner of a vehicle, or his agent, makes proper payment
of a parking ticket within 45 days following the date of issuance of the
ticket, his obligation thereunto shall be discharged. If such charge has not
been paid within the 45-day period set out in §
71.05, the parking violation ticket shall be delinquent and subject to the
additional civil penalties below.
      (2)   The parking violation ticket shall have stated thereon that payment
is due within 45 days following the date of issuance to avoid an additional $50
civil penalty and court costs.
   (C)   The Village Clerk is authorized to accept payments in full and final
settlement of the claim or claims, or rights of action which the village may
have to enforce such civil penalties by civil action in the nature of debt.
Failure to pay the civil penalty shall subject the owner of the vehicle to a
civil action in the nature of debt for the penalties stated, plus an additional
civil penalty in the amount of $100. If, however, the owner makes payment after
the expiration of the 45-day period, but within 75 days following the date of
issuance of the ticket, a civil penalty of $25, in addition to the initial
civil penalty, shall apply in such cases. Acceptance of the additional civil
penalty and initial civil penalty shall be deemed a full and final release of
any and all claims or rights of action arising out of the contended violation.
   (D)   Violations of the provisions of this chapter for which a civil penalty
is listed in division (A) of this section shall not constitute a misdemeanor or
infraction punishable under G.S. § 160A-175. Any properly designated village
official is authorized to take legal action in the nature of a civil suit for
the collection of a debt when the civil penalty, including any additional civil
penalty due to delinquency, has not been paid.
   (E)   The civil penalties imposed herein and the proceeds therefrom, as
collected by payment, civil action, or otherwise, shall belong to the village
and shall be paid into the general fund of the village under such conditions,
if any, as prescribed in the village annual budget.
   (F)   Each hour a vehicle is parked in the same space following the issuance
of a parking ticket shall constitute a separate violation subject to the
issuance of a new parking ticket and additional civil penalties to be applied
to such vehicle.

SECURITY ALARMS
§ 93.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALARM. Any electronic or mechanical device which omits any signal, whether
electronic, audible, silent or recorded and which is designed, intended or used
for the detection of an unauthorized intrusion or an attempted intrusion into a
building, structure, or premises or to signal an actual or attempted robbery.
ALARM shall include any device which initiates a telephone call and delivers a
recorded message to any emergency telephone number assigned to the police
communications center, of the village; any procedure by which a third party
telephones any emergency telephone number and requests service on the basis of
having received an alarm signal from a subscriber of such person or an alarm
business represented by such person; or an audible signal or siren that when
sounded is detected by a third party that results in a police response.
   FALSE ALARM.  Includes negligently activated signals; signals which are the
result of faulty or malfunctioning equipment, except signals activated within
30 days after initial installation; improperly installed or maintained
equipment; signals activated to test the alarm system except test signals
activated after notification to the County Sheriff's Deputies and approval of
the test signals; and signals which are purposely activated to summon police
personnel in non-emergency situations.
   FALSE ALARMS. Any alarm signal communicated by any means that solicits
police response and to which:
      (1)   The responding officer finds no evidence of unauthorized intrusion,
attempted unauthorized intrusion, robbery, or attempted robbery; or
      (2)   Police response was canceled by the alarm subscriber or his agent.
   REPETITIVE FALSE ALARMS.  Due to malfunctioning equipment: The owner of
malfunctioning alarm equipment repaired within 24 hours (or first subsequent
workday) of occurrence by a bona-fide alarm vendor shall only be liable for the
first false alarm which occurred during the preceding 24 hour (or non-workday)
period. In this instance the owner or person responsible for maintaining the
alarm system shall provide proof to the village of the date and time of
response and of the repair action taken by maintenance personnel.
   SUBSCRIBER. Any person, firm, corporation or partnership owning or leasing
an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the
protection of such premises or property.
(Ord. 94-06, passed - - ; Am. Ord. 2002-06, passed 4-22-01)
§ 93.02 REGULATIONS.
   (A)   First through three false alarms. If, within any 12-consecutive-month
period, the County Sheriff's deputies respond to two false alarms at the same
premises or location, the Village Manager or his designee, shall send a letter
to the subscriber informing him of the false alarms and requesting that he
initiate action to stop further false alarms and informing him of the
consequences of continued false alarms, specifically the civil penalty fee.
There will be no fee assessed for the first three false alarms within a 12-
consecutive-month period.
   (B)   Ticket issued with fourth alarm. Beginning with the fourth false
alarm, a civil ticket shall be issued for each additional false alarm.
   (C)   Alarms tests. Alarms activated during alarm system testing procedures
shall not be considered false alarms if the subscriber first notifies and
receives permission from the village to test the system.
   (D)   Continuing audible alarms. All audible alarms shall be equipped with
an automatic reset device that will reset and cease to sound the alarm after 30
minutes of continuous activation. An alarm that sounds continuously for a
period of 30 minutes from the time officers arrived at the alarm location, due
to failure of the alarm to reset shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
The subscriber shall reimburse the village for each violation of a continuing
alarm activation at a rate of $50 per violation.

§ 94.40 NON-RESIDENTIAL DRIVEWAY DESIGN.
   All non-residential driveway permits shall meet the requirements of this
subchapter, §§ 94.40 et seq.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 2-27-12)
§ 94.41 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The safety and efficiency of public streets is dependent upon the
magnitude and type of interference encountered by vehicles moving along the
street. This interference may come from vehicles moving in the same direction
or from those approaching in an opposite direction, but most interference is
normally that of vehicles entering, leaving, or crossing the street.
   (B)   As traffic generators, commercial, industrial, institutional, and
multi-family developments can significantly affect the safety and efficiency of
roadways.
      (1)   In order to safeguard the traveling public and fully utilize the
potential capacity of existing and future streets, it is necessary to regulate
vehicle movements entering and leaving roadside development so as to reduce
interference with the traffic flow.
      (2)   At the same time, it is necessary to recognize the right of the
property owner or developer to have reasonable ingress and egress to their
property.
   (C)   Working in concert with NCDOT, the village has the responsibility to
make the movement of traffic safe and efficient, within reasonable and prudent
expectations. As part of that responsibility, balancing the conflicting rights
and interests of property owners and the needs of the traveling public for safe
and efficient roadways in the critical area of driveway location and operation
must be resolved. Therefore, the regulations in this subchapter have been
established to meet the following objectives:
      (1)   To enhance public safety and the functional efficiency of the
highway transportation network through the orderly control of traffic entering
and exiting public streets;
      (2)   To provide uniform criteria for the design and construction of new
driveways, and an administrative means for consistent application and
enforcement of the established regulations; and
      (3)   To provide regulations that address and satisfy, to the greatest
extent possible, the needs, rights and expectations of both property owners and
the traveling public.
   (D)   This subchapter is therefore applicable for all non-residential
driveways within the village, and should be applied to all access points to the
public street system (except for single-family residential driveways, which are
covered under §§ 94.14 et seq.).
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 2-27-12)
§ 94.42 PROCESS OF DRIVEWAY PLANNING AND APPROVAL.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Driveways and driveway entrances hereafter constructed in the
village and its jurisdictional boundaries on public street rights-of way shall
be designed, located and constructed in conformance with the regulations and
guidelines set forth in this subchapter.
      (2)   Any driveway constructed on a state-maintained roadway must also
conform to the requirements of the current Policy on Street and Driveway Access
to North Carolina Highways developed by the North Carolina Department of
Transportation. Where it is more restrictive, the NCDOT Driveway Manual will
take precedent on these state-maintained roadways.
      (3)   It shall be unlawful for any person to construct or alter a
driveway entrance into a public street or alley, or to cut, break out or remove
any curb along a street or alley, except as authorized by provisions of this
subchapter.
      (4)   All non-residential driveways constructed on village and NCDOT
street rights-of-way shall be reviewed and approved by the Clemmons Public
Works Director, or a designated representative, prior to the issuance of any
building permit for the erection, construction, remodeling or change in the use
of the building, structure or property. This provision shall apply to all
driveways generating in excess of 50 daily trips, but shall not apply to sites
for individual single-family detached residences and duplexes, or other
developments generating less than 50 daily trips * .
      (5)   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain
the driveway for as long as it is in operation.
      (6)   Persons seeking to construct a new driveway, modify an existing
driveway, or replace/maintain an existing driveway shall fully complete and
submit a driveway permit application to the village for review and approval.
Failure to secure a permit may result in closure of the driveway and/or removal
of the driveway at the expense of the property owner.
   (B)   Permits and fees. No person, firm, or corporation shall remove, alter
or construct any driveway, curb, gutter or pavement, or perform any other
improvement on, any public street or dedicated street right-of-way without
permits authorizing such improvements. A sample of the village's driveway
permit application is found in Appendix A to this chapter. The driveway permit
and attached plan shall be posted at the construction site. A driveway
application fee shall be provided in the budget schedule of fees.
   (C)   Submittal requirements.
      (1)   No driveway permit shall be issued until two copies of the approved
plans, showing the location and dimensions of all proposed improvements, are
filed with the village. Plans should identify the site by address, adjacent
properties, and the approximate distance to the nearest intersecting street.
See the driveway permit application in Appendix A for additional requirements.
      (2)   Applicants seeking permits for driveways located on state-
maintained roadways must first secure a NCDOT driveway permit prior to issuance
of a permit by the village. A copy of the NCDOT driveway permit must accompany
village driveway permit applications for driveways requested on state-
maintained roads.
      (3)   Six copies of the approved plans will be required for driveways on
the North Carolina Department of Transportation system streets. Information
required on the plans submitted shall include:
         (a)   A complete plan view of the site (drawn to engineering scale
between 1:20 and 1:50), showing existing and proposed buildings, with interior
parking layout and traffic circulation patterns;
         (b)   Existing and proposed driveway locations and dimensions,
including but not limited to:
            1.   Distance from other streets and driveways on both sides of the
roadway;
            2.   Width at the public right-of- way;
            3.   Curb radii;
            4.   Profile of estimated entrance and exit grades when grades

     *Trip generation estimates shall be based on values and methods as outlined in
* the current edition of the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of
  Transportation Engineers.
§ 94.43 ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS.
   (A)   The village recognizes that not all driveways will be able to conform
to every regulation set forth in this subchapter. Any driveways needing special
attention due to exceptional conditions will be handled on a case-by-case
basis. The village reserves the right to override the standards set forth in
this subchapter should the driveway necessitate such action.
      (1)   Conditions that may warrant exceptions to any of these standards
include unusual geometric conditions or areas where safety concerns exist.
      (2)   Any variance from the technical design specifications must be
approved by the Public Works Director.
   (B)   If there is a question as to whether or not a site will qualify for a
variance in any regulations documented in this subchapter, the village should
be contacted to discuss that potential variance.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 2-27-12)
§ 94.44 DRIVEWAY DESIGN; GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All driveways shall be constructed in conformance with the
construction plans and specifications approved by the village. When applicable,
driveways must conform to watershed regulations and any conditional uses or
zoning restrictions placed on the property during the zoning or subdivision
process.
   (B)   The choice of proper location for a driveway(s) must involve
consideration of vehicular and pedestrian conflicts that can be expected both
within the parking area and on the abutting street(s). The overriding principle
is one that seeks to reduce the number of driveways to a practical minimum,
thus providing fewer locations where conflicts may occur.
   (C)   Driveways shall cross the sidewalk at the sidewalk grade established
by the village.
      (1)   Driveways shall be constructed as nearly as possible on a right
angle to the street.
      (2)   A lesser angle should not typically vary more than 15° from the
right angle.
      (3)   Approval for a lesser angle can be granted by the Public Works
Director or a designated representative.
   (D)   The area to which the driveway provides access shall be of a size
sufficient to allow for the necessary loading, unloading, and parking maneuvers
to be accommodated on private property.
      (1)   All loading, unloading, and parking maneuvers shall be performed
completely outside of the public street right-of-way and on private property.
      (2)   Under no circumstances shall any new driveway be allowed which
requires motorists to back into or from a public street right-of-way.
   (E)   Driveways shall be constructed to conform to the existing paved street
grade; for unpaved streets, to a grade approved by the Public Works Director or
a designated representative.
   (F)   Where special pedestrian and vehicular hazards may be encountered,
driveways may be restricted to one-way operation.
      (1)   Proper signs and pavement markings shall be put in place and
maintained by the person or persons having control over such driveways,
instructing drivers about the direction of the driveways.
      (2)   All signs and pavement markings shall conform to the latest edition
of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).
      (3)   These signs shall be located in a manner that shall not obstruct
the visibility of motorists or pedestrian using the driveway (see Appendix B).
      (4)   Failure to install or maintain such signs and pavement markings or
failure to use such driveways in accordance with the proper signs and pavement
markings shall be considered a violation of this subchapter.
   (G)   All costs of any change proposed in any physical improvements
originally installed by the village, and all costs of the installation of any
driveway or necessary signing, shall be borne by the property owner or
developer.
   (H)   The minimum distance from the street right-of-way line at any ingress
or egress driveway to any interior circulation aisle, service drive, or parking
space with direct access to such driveway shall be 25 feet, or greater than the
expected peak hour queue at the location. If a traffic impact study has been
performed, the queue length will be determined by the results of the study,
rather than the formula listed below.
   (I)   The minimum length may be estimated by the following formula:
      L= (5/6)*x
      L = length required (rounded up or down to the nearest 25-foot increment)
      x = the number of vehicles entering a driveway in an hour
   (J)   In the absence of a traffic impact analysis, the minimum distance from
the street curb line on any major ingress or egress driveway to any interior
circulation aisle, service drive, or parking space having direct access to such
driveway shall be determined using the aforementioned queue length formula, but
shall not be less than 25 feet. The Policy on Street and Driveway Access to
North Carolina Highways, July 2003 (or latest edition), developed by the North
Carolina Department of Transportation, shall also be consulted on all driveways
intersecting a state facility.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 2-27-12)
§ 94.45 SIGHT DISTANCE.
   (A)   In addition to the placement standards set forth in Table 1 (see §
94.48(C)), driveways should be located in a manner that affords adequate
ingress and egress to the street as safely as possible. Adequate sight distance
is a key consideration in determining the appropriate locations of driveways.
      (1)   The sight distance triangle of 20 feet (representing one typical
vehicle) is defined as the lateral measurement along the centerline of the
proposed driveway from a projection of the curbline or edge of pavement of the
intersecting street; and the stopping sight distance recommended by American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) for the
design speed of the intersecting street; and measured along the curbline
intersecting the proposed driveway to a point adjacent to the center of the
nearest approach lane carrying through traffic in each direction, as shown in
Appendix B.
      (2)   An offset greater than 20 feet may be required when the placement
of pedestrian crosswalks results in an additional setback of the marked or
implied vehicle stopping point.
   (B)   AASHTO guidelines also apply to vertical stopping sight distances.
      (1)   When conditions merit, the owner may be required to submit roadway
and driveway profiles demonstrating that adequate vertical sight distance also
exists.
      (2)   In lieu of providing vertical sight distance profiles, a licensed
professional engineer may be may place a note on the plans, stating that the
proposed driveways have been designed and located to provide adequate
horizontal and vertical sight distance in accordance with AASHTO standards.
      (3)   A figure included in Appendix B depicts an example of the vertical
sight distance requirements.
   (C)   To provide and maintain an adequate “window of visibility” for the
motorist, no object, planting, structure, or sign shall be placed within this
triangle at a height between two and a half feet and ten feet above the
finished grade of the proposed driveway.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 2-27-12)
§ 94.46 JOINT DRIVEWAYS.
   Joint driveways are encouraged. They may also enable adjoining properties to
be developed more advantageously. Landowners of adjacent property may, by
written mutual agreement, construct a joint driveway to service both
properties, subject to the following:
   (A)   All requirements of this subchapter shall be met, with the exception
that the side clearance restriction shall not apply.
   (B)   In the event that the driveway does not conform to the requirements of
this subchapter, the driveway shall be corrected to conform to these
requirements by and at the expense of the landowners. Failure to do so may
result in the village doing such work and billing the landowners the cost of
such work.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 2-27-12)
§ 94.47 NUMBER AND LOCATION OF DRIVEWAYS.
   (A)   Three basic street classifications. The number and location of
driveways shall be regulated according to the size of the property being served
and the amount of public street frontage available to that property. The
approval of more than one driveway serving a single tract with frontage on a
public street shall be contingent upon a review of site plans for the proposed
development. For this purpose, the village has developed three basic street
classifications, consistent with those found in the Village Transportation
Plan:
      (1)   Class A - Thoroughfares.
         (a)   This class of streets includes all streets designated as major
or minor thoroughfares in the adopted Village Transportation Plan (see VTP
Figure 3.5).
         (b)   These are typically divided or undivided multi-lane facilities
serving a variety of land uses and carrying high traffic volumes. Such
facilities may be state-owned and often feature extensive traffic control
measures, including traffic signals and turn restrictions. The design/posted
speed limit for these routes may range from 40 to 60 miles per hour.
         (c)   The adopted Village Transportation Plan should be consulted to
determine the characteristics of streets in question. The designation of any
roadway not listed can be verified with the village.
      (2)   Class B - Collectors.
         (a)   Collector routes are defined by the village's Collector Street
Plan, and approved amendments.
         (b)   Although some collectors may be divided multi-lane facilities,
most are typically undivided three-lane or two-lane routes with provisions for
turn lanes at significant intersections. Like thoroughfares, they serve a
variety of land uses, but volumes are lower and they are generally designated
as village streets. Traffic control measures are generally less restrictive,
and the range of design/posted speed limits for these routes is lower, from 30
to 50 miles per hour.
         (c)   The designation of any roadway can be verified with the village.
      (3)   Class C - Locals.
         (a)   Although most local streets feature primarily single-family
residential development, some may provide access to a variety of other uses,
including multi-family and low-intensity commercial and business uses.
         (b)   Local streets may occasionally intersect directly with
thoroughfares, but more often transition to collector or thoroughfare
facilities. Design/posted speeds are 35 mph or less.
   (B)   Class D - Special Corridors.
      (1)   Requirements for driveways proposed within the defined limits of
any special corridors designated by this policy will vary as appropriate for
the streets to be accessed.
      (2)   Design guidelines will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the
village for these corridors. The village will maintain an inventory of any
special corridors and their corresponding standards in the appendix of this
chapter.
      (3)   Current corridors include: Lewisville-Clemmons Road (I-40 south to
U.S. Highway 158-Clemmons Road)
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 2-27-12)
§ 94.48 TURN LANES.
   (A)   Turn lanes will be required for ingress and egress into a proposed
site when the proposed turns and anticipated background adjacent street traffic
indicate their necessity. The North Carolina Department of Transportation
publishes a chart in the NCDOT Driveway Manual that recommends storage lengths
for left and right turn lanes, based on the number of turns versus the opposing
volume of traffic.
      (1)   This chart should be used as a basis for determining the storage
length required for turn lanes into a site. The chart (Figure 2) is included in
Appendix C.
      (2)   Figure 2 depicts the deceleration and storage lengths for right and
left turn lanes. Deceleration lengths are a function of design speed and
recommended deceleration lengths will be determined based on coordination
between NCDOT and the village.
   (B)   These guidelines shall be used to determine when a turn lane is
appropriate.
      (1)   The Figure 2 chart is intended for use with unsignalized, two-lane
roadways.
      (2)   For multi-lane roadways, the average through volume per lane should
be multiplied by 1.05 and used as the through volumes on the chart to determine
whether a turn lane is warranted at the location.
      (3)   Turn lane requirements for signalized locations shall be determined
by a traffic impact analysis or other engineering study with approval from the
village and NCDOT.
      (4)   In the event of a planned or ongoing roadway project in the
proximity of a development, the village may delay the required construction of
any auxiliary turn lane(s) a maximum of six months to assure design continuity
with the planned project, or accept a fee in lieu of construction to
incorporate the turn lane(s) into the road project.
   (C)   Applying these street classifications, the number and location of
permissible driveways shall be regulated as shown on Table 1:
Street classification Thoroughfare Collector Local
Street classification       Thoroughfare     Collector        Local
                                             Street-type

   (D)   Regardless of available frontage, the approval of multiple driveways
and driveway types is subject to site plan review by the village. One driveway
is typically permitted. Class D (Special Corridors) will be handled on a case-
by-case basis. Higher street classification governs for corner parcels.
      (1)   One driveway shall be permitted for ingress-and-egress purposes to
a single property or development, provided that the property has been created
as a separate tract in conformance with the Village Unified Development
Ordinances or was in existence prior to the adoption of this subchapter. Two
one-way driveways have the same consideration as one two-way driveway, provided
that site design and circulation clearly defines and promotes a one-way
pattern, and that appropriate signing and pavement markings are used to
reinforce the intended traffic pattern.
      (2)   The village shall offer more than one driveway as an incentive for
development that provides lot consolidation and/or the lot frontages shown
below in the incentive chart (Table 2). Additionally, the developer shall use
the following general considerations in developing a new non-residential site:
         (a)   Should be designed with future connections in mind;
         (b)   Stub to all adjoining commercially zoned parcels is encouraged;
         (c)   Parking and circulation should be configured to accommodate
adjacent connectivity;
         (d)   Adequate internal stacking should be required to avoid spillback
onto the public right-of-way.
      (3)   In such instances where the developer provides parcel consolidation
or frontages as noted in the incentive table, the Public Works Director shall
use the general consideration listed above when reviewing the site. The Public
Works Director and/or designee, in conjunction with NCDOT, shall review all
considerations for more than one driveway location. However, if a preexisting
safety condition is documented, then the incentive table will be used, at the
discretion of both the village and NCDOT, and additional driveways may not be
granted.
   (E)   When reviewing the site, both the village and NCDOT shall use the
following table to determine when additional driveway locations shall be
granted. Table 2 is intended for use when one or more existing lots are
combined.

vehicles that may have a loading dock.
   SIDE CLEARANCE. The distance, measured along the street right-of-way line,
from the property line to the near edge of the driveway.
   SIDE STREET. A street that is subordinate in the street hierarchy, often
used to describe the lesser order street where a property has frontage on two
streets.
   SIDEWALK. An area on public or private property where pedestrians walk or
stand, generally parallel to the street curbline or edge of pavement.
   STREET TYPE. A driveway constructed with radius returns; similar in
appearance to a street intersection.
   SWALE or FLUME. A low-lying or depressed area.
   WINDOW OF VISIBILITY. An area around the driveway between two and a half
feet and ten feet above the finish grade free of obstructions within the sight
triangle.
(Ord. 2012-02, passed 2-27-12)
§ 94.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person whose act, neglect, or omission, or who by permitting a
condition to continue, whether done or neglected directly or through an agent,
servant, or employee, causes additional expense to the village for necessary
special street, sidewalk, or storm drain cleaning or repair shall reimburse the
village for its expense upon receipt of an itemized statement of expenses
submitted by the village, and upon failure to reimburse the village shall incur
and be liable to the village for a civil penalty of $200.
   (B)   The Public Works Department shall send to any person responsible for
additional expense to the village an itemized statement of the expense incurred
and a request for reimbursement. The Village Attorney is authorized to bring
suit in the name of the village to recover any such unpaid penalties.
   (C)   Any person who violates §§
94.15 through
94.29 shall pay a civil penalty of $50 within ten days following the issuance
by the Village Public Works Director of a notice of such violation. Until such
penalty is paid, no occupancy permit or other permit shall be issued to such
person.

APPENDIX D: CLASS D - SPECIAL CORRIDORS: LEWISVILLE-CLEMMONS ROAD
   For the purposes of this chapter the section of Lewisville-Clemmons Road
between I-40 south to U.S. Highway 158-Clemmons Road shall have a separate set
of standards. These standards have been established in response to a documented
crash history and need to enhance safety, traffic operations, and mobility.
These conditions have been documented in the adopted Village Transportation
Plan and the Lewisville-Clemmons Road Connectivity Study. The resulting
standards are therefore intended to provide for the orderly development of
driveways in a manner consistent with the established vision for the corridor.
   General considerations:
   •   Should be designed with future connections in mind.
   •   Stub to all adjoining commercially zoned parcels is encouraged.
   •   Parking and circulation should be configured to accommodate adjacent
connectivity, creating an effective “backage” road where feasible.
   •   Adequate internal stacking should be required to avoid spillback onto
Lewisville-Clemmons Road.
   •   These sites should be limited to a single driveway unless they have 300+
linear feet of frontage on Lewisville-Clemmons Road.
      1. Parcels without Side-Street Access.
         (a)   A single full movement driveway shall be permitted or a single
right-in/right-out (RIRO) driveway per the following requirements:
   •   Full-movement driveway should maintain a driveway throat no less than
100 feet from the intersection with Lewisville-Clemmons Road. Full movement
access from the driveway throat shall be provided at a point located no less
than 200 feet from the intersection with Lewisville-Clemmons Road. An
additional RIRO access from the driveway throat will be permitted when located
between 100 feet and 200 feet from the intersection with Lewisville-Clemmons
Road.
            •   In lieu of a full movement driveway from Lewisville-Clemmons
Road, a RIRO driveway from Lewisville-Clemmons Road may be constructed
consistent with all other spacing and dimension requirements found within the
driveway policy.
         (b)   No deceleration lanes will be required by the village, except at
the street-type main entryways for multi-tenant developments, at the discretion
of NCDOT and village.
         (c)   Same number and spacing standards as those described on Table 1
(see § 94.48(C)).
      2.   Parcels with Side-Street Access:
         (a)   Full movement access to Lewisville-Clemmons Road is prohibited
except where the parcel has 200+ feet of linear frontage along Lewisville-
Clemmons Road.
         (b)   In cases where the parcel has less than 200 feet of frontage
along Lewisville-Clemmons Road, a full movement driveway shall be permitted
from the side street, to be located a minimum distance of 100 feet from the
Lewisville-Clemmons Road intersection or as far away as reasonably can be
achieved.
         (c)   Parcels with 200+ feet of frontage are entitled to one right-in/
right-out (RIRO) driveway on Lewisville-Clemmons Road. Parcels with greater
than 300 feet of frontage may be permitted an additional full-movement driveway
on Lewisville-Clemmons Road, with the expressed approval by NCDOT and village
(driveway must comply with all other setback and dimensional requirements).
         (d)   All sites should be designed with provisions for connections to
adjoining commercially zoned parcels, including circulation drive aisles. In no
case should offsite access be prohibited. Shared-use driveways are encouraged.
         (e)   Deceleration-acceleration lanes may be required per the
standards set forth in the driveway policy.
      3.   Additional Requirements:
All access and traffic signal locations should conform to the preferred access
strategy exhibit of the Lewisville-Clemmons Road Connectivity Study. Deviations
from the preferred access strategy will only be allowed with approvals from
NCDOT and the village.
NOTE: As with all other aspects of this policy, deviations to these standards
may be approved by the village upon written request by the property owner.
Approvals shall be granted only in cases where unusual geometric conditions or
safety concerns warrant deviations from the standards contained herein.
         Figure 3 on the following page communicates the standards described
herein.

a specific date no sooner than seven days after the notice is affixed or

vehicle which has been determined to be an abandoned vehicle on private
property, hazardous vehicle or junked motor vehicle who has received a notice
pursuant to division (A) that the vehicle will be removed may appeal the
determination. Any appeal shall be made within ten days upon receipt of the
notice for removal of the vehicle as provided in division (A). All appeals

highways and on private property, such vehicles may be removed without giving
prior notice in those circumstances where the authorizing official finds a
special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health,
safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation, such
circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to
businesses and residences; vehicles parked in such a location or manner as to
pose a traffic hazard, or vehicles causing damage to public or private
property.

findings shall, in all cases, be entered by the authorized official in the
appropriate written records.

unless the notice is waived in writing by the vehicle owner or his or her
agent.
   (C)   If the vehicle is registered in North Carolina, notice shall be given
within 24 hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the state, notice shall be
given to the registered owner within 72 hours of the removal of the vehicle.

and such vehicle has no valid registration or registration plates, the
authorizing village official shall make reasonable efforts, including checking
the vehicle identification number to determine the last known registered owner
of the vehicle and to notify him or her of the information set forth in
divisions (A)(1) through (A)(5) above.
(Ord. 2021-04, passed 3-8-21)

mail. When service is made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the
complaint or order will also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed
sufficient if the registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused, but the
regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten days after the
mailing. If regular mail is used, notice of the pending proceedings shall be
posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected.
   (B)   If the whereabouts of such persons are unknown and cannot be
ascertained by the inspector in the exercise of reasonable diligence, or, if
the owners are known but have refused to accept service by registered or
certified mail, and the inspector shall make an affidavit to that effect, and

by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the village at

the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of
providing affordable housing. The inspector or Village Clerk shall certify the
mailing of the notices, and the certification shall be conclusive in the
absence of fraud. Only an organization that has filed a written request for

remedy shall be an order requiring the inspector to wait 45 days before causing
removal or demolition.
(Ord. 2024-02, passed 3-11-24)
§ 150.23 DETERMINATION, ISSUANCE OF ORDER AFTER HEARING.
   (A)   Determination for dwellings. After such notice and hearing as provided
in §
150.21, if the inspector finds that the dwelling under consideration is unfit
for human habitation he or she shall state in writing his/her findings of fact
in support of that determination. The inspector shall issue and cause to be
served upon the owner thereof an order to repair, alter and improve such
structure or remove or demolish the same within a specified period of time not
to exceed 60 days.
   (B)   Determination for all other buildings and structures. If, after notice
and hearing, the inspector determines that the non-residential building or
structure has not been properly maintained so that the safety or health of its
occupants or members of the general public is jeopardized for failure of the
property to meet the minimum standards established by this chapter, the
inspector shall state in writing findings of fact in support of that
determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an
order.
   (C)   Limitations on orders.
      (1)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling or
abandoned structure can be made at a cost of no more than 50% of the value of
the dwelling or building as determined and published most recently by the
Forsyth County Tax Assessor, the order may require the owner, within the time
specified, to repair, alter or improve the building, structure or dwelling in
order to render it fit for human habitation or, in the case of non-residential
buildings to bring it into compliance with the standards of this chapter within
90 days. The order may require that the property be vacated and closed only if
continued occupancy during the time allowed for repair will present a
significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of the
necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current state of the
property; and any additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors
under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. The
order shall state that the failure to make timely repairs as directed in the
order shall make the dwelling subject to the issuance of an unfit order under §
150.25; or
      (2)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building
or structure cannot be made at a cost of less than 50% of the value of the
dwelling or building as determined and published most recently by the Forsyth
County Tax Assessor, the order may require the owner, within the time
specified, to remove or demolish the structure or dwelling in no more than 90
days.
         (a)   Historic exception. However, notwithstanding any other provision
of law and this chapter, if the building, structure or dwelling is a local
historic landmark or listed in the National Register of Historic Places or is
located in a historic district listed in the National Register of Historic
Places and the Village Council determines, after a public hearing as provided
by ordinance, that the dwelling is of particular significance or value toward
maintaining the character of the district, and the dwelling has not been
condemned as unsafe, the order may require that the dwelling be vacated and
closed consistent with G.S. 160D-940, et seq.
      (3)   General exception for vacant manufacturing or industrial
facilities. An order may not require repairs, alterations, or improvements to
be made to vacant manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial warehouse
facilities to preserve the original use. The order may require such building or
structure to be vacated and closed, but repairs may be required only when
necessary to maintain structural integrity or to abate a health or safety
hazard that cannot be remedied by ordering the building or structure closed for
any use.
(Ord. 2024-02, passed 3-11-24)
§ 150.24 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ORDER; COUNCIL MAY CONSIDER ORDINANCE ENFORCING
ORDER.
   (A)   Remedy. If the owner of any unsafe, unfit or abandoned dwelling,
building structure as defined in this chapter shall fail to comply with an
order of the inspector to repair, alter, or improve, vacate and close the same
within the time specified therein, the inspector may either request an
emergency meeting with the Village Council or place the matter on the agenda of
the next scheduled Council meeting. At the meeting, the Council may consider an
ordinance finding that failure to comply with the order jeopardized the public
health safety and welfare of the general public and/or the occupants of the
building structure or dwelling. If the Village Council finds that the public or
occupant's health and safety are jeopardized, the Council shall adopt an
ordinance:
      (1)   Describing the property;
      (2)   Listing the inspector's findings;
      (3)   Directing that the ordinance be recorded in the Forsyth County
Registry and indexed in the grantor index in the name of the property owner(s);
and
      (4)   Directing that the inspector cause the building or dwelling to be
repaired, altered and repaired or vacated and closed; or
      (5)   Directing that the inspector cause the building, structure or
dwelling be demolished and removed if the cost of repair, alteration or
improvement of the building, structure or dwelling would exceed 50% of its then
current value.
      (6)   If the building or dwelling is to be closed the ordinance will
direct the inspector to post the property with a placard reading:
         (a)   For non-residential buildings. "This building is unfit for any
use; the use or occupation of this building for any purpose is prohibited and
unlawful;" or
         (b)   For dwellings. "This building is unfit for human habitation; the
use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and
unlawful."
   (B)   Any person who occupies or knowingly allows the occupancy of a non-
residential building or structure so posted shall be guilty of a Class 3
misdemeanor. Any person who occupies or knowingly allows the occupancy of a
dwelling so posted shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (C)   Further optional in rem remedy - demolition. If the Village Council
has adopted an ordinance ordering a dwelling to be repaired, vacated or closed
under division (A), and if the owner fails to comply with that ordinance in
regard to a residence in one year or two years in the case of non-residential
buildings or structures, the Village Council may consider another ordinance if
the Council finds that: the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to
repair, alter or improve the building, structure or dwelling in order to render
it fit for human habitation or, for non-residential buildings, to have
abandoned the intention to repair and that the continuation of the dwelling in
its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety, morals
and welfare of the village in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate,
would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and
vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or
contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area, and
would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might otherwise have
been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable
housing in the village. Any ordinance enacted shall set forth the following:
      (1)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the building, structure or dwelling within
90 days; or
      (2)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost not exceeding 50% of the then
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the building, structure or dwelling within 90 days.
      (3)   Any ordinance so adopted shall be served on the owner of the
property and recorded in the Forsyth County Office of the Register of Deeds and
shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index.
      (4)   If the owner fails to comply with this chapter, the inspector shall
follow the requirements of the ordinance.

§ 150.25 REMEDIES; APPEAL BY OWNER TO SUPERIOR COURT.
   (A)   The Village Council shall also hear any appeals from any decision or
order of the inspector.
   (B)   An appeal from any decision or order of the inspector may be taken to
the Village Council by any person aggrieved thereby or by any officer,
Councilor or commission of the village. Any appeal from the inspector shall be
taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the
order by filing with the office of the inspector, a notice of appeal to the
Council which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon
the filing of any notice of appeal, the inspector shall forthwith transmit to
the Village Council all the papers constituting the record upon which the
decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the
inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his
decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is
from a decision of the inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act,
the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the
hearing by the Village Council, unless the inspector certifies to the Council,
after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that because of facts stated in
the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the person making the
appeal), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or
property. In that case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a
restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than
one day's written notice to the inspector by the Village Council , or by a
court of record upon petition made pursuant to division (F) of this section.
   (C)   The Village Council shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals,
shall give due notice to the parties, and shall render its decision within a
reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The
Council may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or
order appealed from, and may make any decision and order that in its opinion
ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of
the inspector. The Council shall have power also in passing upon appeals, when
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out
the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance
to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance
shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice
done.
   (D)   Every decision of the Village Council shall be subject to review by
proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the
decision of the Commissioner, but not otherwise.
   (E)   Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the inspector, or a
decision rendered by the Village Council may petition the superior court for an
injunction restraining the inspector and/or village from carrying out the order
or decision and the court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction
restraining the inspector pending a final disposition of the cause. The
petition shall be filed within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering
of the decision. The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall
enter such final order or decree as law and justice may require. It shall not
be necessary to file bond in any amount before obtaining a temporary injunction
under this section.
   (F)   If any building, structure or dwelling is erected, constructed,
altered, repaired, converted, maintained, or used in violation of this chapter
or any valid order or decision of the inspector or Village Council made
pursuant to any ordinance or code adopted under authority of this chapter or
the General Statutes, the inspector or Council may institute any appropriate
action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration or use, to restrain, correct or abate the violation,
to prevent the occupancy of the building, structure or dwelling, or to prevent
any illegal act, conduct or use in or about the premises.
(Ord. 2024-02, passed 3-11-24)
§ 150.26 SUMMARY EJECTMENT IF OCCUPANTS FAIL TO OBEY ORDER OR ORDINANCE TO
VACATE.
   (A)   Notice before ejectment from dwellings only. An action to remove an
occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of
a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this division unless such occupant
was served with notice at least 30 days before the filing of the summary
ejectment proceeding that the Village Council has ordered the inspector to
proceed to exercise his duties under §
150.24 to vacate and close or remove and demolish the dwelling.
   (B)   Ejectment procedure for residential and non-residential buildings and
structures. If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling,
the inspector may file a civil action in the name of the village to remove such
occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of summary
ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as parties-
defendant any person occupying such dwelling. The clerk of superior court shall
issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a magistrate at a
certain time, date and place not to exceed ten days from the issuance of the
summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as
provided in G.S. 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its tenor,
and if on its return it appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing
the inspector produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the
governing body pursuant to §
150.24 authorizing the officer to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the
magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated and that
all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated
shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary ejectment
entered under G.S. 42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the
magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. 7A-228, and the execution of such
judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. 7A-227.
(Ord. 2024-02, passed 3-11-24)
§ 150.27 EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT.
   The decision of the inspector pursuant to this chapter shall be final in
cases of emergency, which, in his opinion, involve imminent danger to human
life or health. The inspector shall promptly cause such building, structure or
portion thereof to be made safe or abated. For this purpose, the inspector may
at once enter such structure or land on which it stands, or abutting land or
structure, with such assistance and at such cost as he may deem necessary. The
inspector may vacate adjacent structures and protect the public by appropriate
fences or such other means as may be necessary, and for this purpose, may close
a public or private way.
(Ord. 2024-02, passed 3-11-24)
§ 150.28 PENALTIES AND FEES.
   (A)   Civil citations. If the violation continues after the deadline to
correct a violation established after the violation hearing by the order
requiring removal or correction of a violation, and no appeal has been filed
with the office of the inspector, then the inspector may issue a civil citation
with a fine in an initial amount of $500 against the violator. Thereafter, upon
issuing a second civil citation that each day the violation continues is an
additional separate and distinct offense and that additional citations with
additional fines of $500 shall apply each day the violation continues. Any
unpaid citations and delinquency charges shall be cumulative and shall be
recovered in a civil action in the nature of debt as well as any attorney fees
incurred by the village incident thereto.
   (B)   Multiple notices not required. A hearing is not required for issuance
of consequent civil citations with fines after the issuance of the first
citation. This chapter may be enforced by the simultaneous issuance of both
civil citation(s) and a criminal citation, in addition to any other remedies
provided in this chapter. See G.S. 160A-175, 160A-193.
(Ord. 2024-02, passed 3-11-24)
§ 150.29 COLLECTION OF COSTS.
   (A)   The expense of the action shall be paid by the person in default. If
the expense is not paid, it is a lien on the land or premises where the
nuisance occurred. A lien established pursuant to this section shall have the
same priority and be collected as unpaid ad valorem taxes.
   (B)   Liens on residential and non-residential buildings. The amount of the
cost of repairs, alterations or improvements, or vacating and closing, or
removal or demolition by the inspector shall be a lien against the real
property upon which the cost was incurred, which lien shall be filed, have the
same priority, and be collected as the lien for special assessment provided in
G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 10.
   (C)   Additional lien created in actions about residential buildings. Where
the original action was brought against a dwelling(s), the expense of the
action is also a lien on any other real property owned by the person in default
within the village limits, except for the person's primary residence. A lien
established pursuant to this section is inferior to all prior liens and shall
be collected as money judgment. This section shall not apply if the person in
default can show that the nuisance was created solely by the actions of
another. See G.S. §160A-193.
   (D)   The inspector will notify the Village Attorney to write a notice of
lien and cause it to be recorded in the county registry and/or judgments.
   (E)   Cost recovery in the case of actions against non-residential
buildings. If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the inspector, the
inspector shall sell the materials of the dwelling, and any personal property,
fixtures or appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall
credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition
and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the
inspector, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall be
disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final
order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
impair or limit in any way the power of the village to define and declare
nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or
otherwise.
