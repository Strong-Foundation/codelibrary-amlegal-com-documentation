existing or proposed structures; parking areas and other built-upon areas;
surface water drainage. The site plan shall be neatly drawn and indicate north
point, name and address of person who prepared the plan, date of original
drawing, and an accurate record of any later revisions;
         (b)   A complete and detailed description of the proposed variance,
together with any other pertinent information which the applicant feels would
be helpful to the Watershed Board of Adjustment in considering the application;
and
         (c)   The Administrator shall notify in writing each local government
having jurisdiction in the watershed. Notice shall include a description of the
variance being requested. Local governments receiving notice of the variance
may, within 30 days from the date notice is issued, submit comments to the
Administrator prior to a decision by the Watershed Board of Adjustment. The
comments shall become a part of the record of proceedings of the Watershed
Board of Adjustment.
      (3)   Before the Watershed Board of Adjustment may grant a variance it
shall make the following three findings, which shall be recorded in the
permanent record of the case, and shall include the factual reasons on which
they are based:
         (a)   There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the
way of carrying out the strict letter of the chapter. In order to determine
that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships the Watershed
Board of Adjustment must find and conclude that the five following conditions
exist:
            1.   If the applicant complies with the provisions of the chapter,
the applicant can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of,
his or her property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater
profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify
the granting of a variance. Moreover, the Watershed Board of Adjustment shall
consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms
of the chapter that will make possible the reasonable use of the applicant’s
property;
            2.   The hardship results from the application of the chapter to
the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other
hardship;
            3.   The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant’s
property, such as its size, shape or topography which is different from that of
neighboring property;
            4.   The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant
who knowingly or unknowingly violates the chapter, or who purchases the
property after the effective date of the chapter and then comes to the
Watershed Board of Adjustment for relief; and
            5.   The hardship is particular to the applicant’s property rather
than the result of conditions that are widespread. If other properties are
equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a
variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote
equal justice.
         (b)   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of the chapter and preserves its spirit.
         (c)   In the granting of the variance the public safety and welfare
have been assured and substantial justice has been done. The Board of
Adjustment shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any
respect impair the public health, safety or general welfare.
      (4)   In granting the variance, the Watershed Board of Adjustment may
attach conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the
proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of
the purpose of this chapter. If a variance for the construction, alteration or
use of property is granted, construction, alteration or use shall be in
accordance with the approved site plan.
      (5)   The Watershed Board of Adjustment shall refuse to hear an appeal or
an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have
been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the
appeal or application.
      (6)   A variance issued in accordance with this section shall be
considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit
or watershed occupancy permit for the use is not obtained by the applicant
within six months from the date of the decision.
      (7)   If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and
if the Watershed Board of Adjustment decides in favor of granting the variance,
the Watershed Board of Adjustment shall prepare a preliminary record of the
hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall
include:
         (a)   The variance application;
         (b)   The hearing notices;
         (c)   The evidence presented;
         (d)   Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence and rulings on
them;
         (e)   Proposed findings and exceptions; and
         (f)   The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be
added to the permit.
      (8)   The preliminary record shall be sent to the State Environmental
Management Commission for its review as follows:
         (a)   If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the
variance qualifies as a major variance and that:
            1.   The property owner can secure no reasonable return from nor
make any practical use of the property unless the proposed variance is granted;
and
            2.   The variance, if granted, will not result in a serious threat
to the water supply; then the Commission shall approve the variance as proposed
or approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations. The
Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it to the Watershed
Board of Adjustment. If the Commission approves the variance as proposed, the
Watershed Board of Adjustment shall prepare a final decision granting the
proposed variance. If the Commission approves the variance with conditions and
stipulations, the Board shall prepare a final decision, including such
conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance.
         (b)   If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the
variance qualifies as a major variance and that:
            1.   The property owner can secure a reasonable return from or make
a practical use of the property without a variance; or
            2.   The variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat to
the water supply; then the Commission shall deny approval of the variance as
proposed. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it to the
Watershed Board of Adjustment. The Board shall prepare a final decision denying
the variance as proposed.

   (B)   Whereas, the Pasquotank County Board of Commissioners deem it
necessary, for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, and morals or
general welfare of the county to enact such an ordinance; and whereas, the
Pasquotank County Planning Board has given reasonable consideration and
approval of the stormwater ordinance.
   (C)   Now, therefore, the Pasquotank County Board of Commissioners does
hereby ordain and enact into law throughout the unincorporated areas of
Pasquotank County the following articles and sections, this sixteenth day of
February, 2009.
(Ord. passed 2-16-2009)
§ 53.02 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be officially known as “The Pasquotank County Stormwater
Ordinance.” It is referred to herein as “this chapter.”
(Ord. passed 2-16-2009)
§ 53.03 AUTHORITY.
   The Pasquotank County Board of Commissioners is authorized to adopt this
chapter pursuant to North Carolina law, including, but not limited to Chapter
153A, Article 18 (Parts 1, 2 and 3) of the General Statutes of North Carolina.
(Ord. passed 2-16-2009)
§ 53.04 FINDINGS.
   It is hereby determined that:
   (A)   Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil
erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and
sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge.
   (B)   These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities
of water-borne pollutants and alterations: in hydrology that are harmful to
public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and these
effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned
controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites.
(Ord. passed 2-16-2009)
§ 53.05 PURPOSE.
   (A)   General. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and
enhance the public health, safety, environment and general establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-
development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution
associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that
proper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater
runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure;
safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and protect water and
aquatic resources.
   (B)   Specific. This chapter seeks to meet its general purpose through the
following specific objectives and means:
      (1)   Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect
the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
      (2)   Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as
practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, streambank
erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream
temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic
habitats;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the
minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices,
such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of
greenspace, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent
practicable;
      (6)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans.
(Ord. passed 2-16-2009)
§ 53.06 APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION.

§ 71.01 PURPOSE, INTENT AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Pursuant to G.S. § 153A-245, the county may by ordinance regulate the
operation of golf carts as defined in G.S. § 20-4.01 (12a) on any public
street, road or highway where the speed limit is 35 miles per hour or less
within the county that is located in any unincorporated areas of the county or
on any property owned or leased by the county.
   (B)   Further pursuant to G.S. § 153A-245, the county may by ordinance
require the registration of golf carts, charge a fee for the registration,
specify who is authorized to operate golf carts, and specify the required
equipment, load limits, and the hours and methods of operation of golf carts.
   (C)   The Board of Commissioners desires to allow the use of golf carts
within the county in accordance with state law and local law while at the same
time preserve and address the interest of public safety associated with such
use.
   (D)   The county finds that unregulated use of golf carts on public streets
and roads is detrimental to the safety of the citizens of the county. This
chapter is intended to apply only to Newbegun Land Subdivision. The chapter may
be expanded to other areas of the county at a later date or to the entire
county.
(Ord. passed 9-18-2017)
§ 71.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   GOLF CART. A vehicle designed and manufactured for operation on a golf
course for sporting or recreational purposes and that is not capable of
exceeding speeds of 20 miles per hour.
(Ord. passed 9-18-2017)
§ 71.03 POLICY STATEMENT AND LIABILITY DISCLAIMER.
   This chapter is adopted to address the interest of public safety under which
the provisions of G.S. § 153A-245 which provides counties with the authority to
regulate the use of golf carts that have not been outfitted and registered as
required by state law. Generally, golf carts (hereinafter “carts”) that have
not been outfitted and registered are not designated or manufactured to be used
anywhere other than golf courses, and the county in no way advocates or
endorses their operation elsewhere within the county. The county, by regulating
such operation, is merely trying to address obvious safety issues, and adoption
of this chapter is not to be relied upon as a determination that operation is
safe or advisable if done in accordance with this chapter. All persons who
operate or ride upon carts do so at their own risk and peril, and must be
observant of and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including
their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The county has
no liability under any theory of liability for permitting carts to operate in
the county. The owner and operator of the cart is responsible for any liability
involved in using the cart. The county does not encourage cart operation and
does not represent that the operation of carts under these rules will render
cart operation safe and without risk to the driver and passenger(s) of a cart.
(Ord. passed 9-18-2017)
§ 71.04 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Carts that are not equipped and registered as required by the State
Motor Vehicle Law may only operate on public streets and roads within the
county as set forth herein and in accordance with these rules and regulations.
Operation of carts in violation of these rules and regulations shall be subject
to the penalty provisions of §
71.99 or, in egregious cases, may constitute reckless driving as defined in the
North Carolina General Statutes.
   (B)   All carts operated on the streets must have a valid permit sticker
from the County Sheriff’s Office. A yearly fee as established by the County
Commissioners on a per cart basis will be charged by the County Sheriff’s
Office for a permit sticker (see Pasquotank Fee Schedule below). There will be
no prorated registrations nor will there be any refunds issued. A 31-day re-
registration period for all previously registered golf carts will be permitted
during the month of January each year for an annual registration charge per the
Pasquotank Fee Schedule. Owners re-registering after January 31 of each year
will be considered expired until re-registered and not permitted to use the
golf carts in the associated areas. Driving a golf cart without a current
registration will result in a fine as determined by the Pasquotank County Fee
Schedule. A list of all registrations will be maintained by the Pasquotank
County Sheriff's Office. The golf cart owner is responsible for maintaining
their registration, no notices will be mailed. If a golf cart is purchased
during the calendar year, the fee will not be prorated and would be the amount
established as per the Pasquotank County Fee Schedule.

This notice shall, if feasible, be given by telephone. Whether or not the owner
is reached by telephone, notice shall be mailed to the owner’s last-known
address unless the owner or the owner’s agent waives this notice in writing.
         (c)   Whenever a vehicle with neither a valid registration plate nor
registration is towed, the authorizing person shall make reasonable efforts,
including checking the vehicle identification number, to determine the last-
known registered owner of the vehicle and notify the owner as required herein.
Unless the owner has otherwise been given notice, it is presumed that the
authorizing person has not made reasonable efforts, as required under this
section, unless notice that the vehicle would be towed was posted on the
windshield or some other conspicuous place at least ten days before the towing
actually occurred; except, no pre-towing notice need be given if the vehicle
impeded the flow of traffic or otherwise jeopardized the public welfare so that
immediate towing was necessary.
         (d)   The owner or any other person entitled to claim possession of
the vehicle may regain possession of the motor vehicle by paying to the county
all reasonable costs incidental to the removal and storage.
         (e)   The owner or any person entitled to claim possession of the
vehicle may request in writing a hearing to determine if probable cause existed
for the towing. The request shall be filed with the magistrate’s office in the
county. The magistrate shall set the hearing within 72 hours of his or her
receiving the request. The owner, the person who requested the hearing if
someone other than the owner, the tower and the person who authorized the
towing shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing.
      (4)   After holding an abandoned motor vehicle for 30 days after the date
of removal, the county may sell or dispose of the vehicle as follows:
         (a)   If the vehicle appears to be worth less than $100, the county
may dispose of the vehicle as a junked motor vehicle as provided herein. With
the consent of the owner, the county may remove and dispose of a motor vehicle
as a junked motor vehicle without regard to the value, condition or age of the
vehicle and without holding it for any prescribed period of time.
         (b)   If the vehicle appears to be worth $100 or more, the vehicle
shall be sold at public auction. The county shall give 20 days’ written notice
of the sale to the registered owner at his or her last-known address, to each
holder of a lien of record against the vehicle and to the State Division of
Motor Vehicles. Any person having an interest in the vehicle may redeem it at
any time before the sale by paying all costs accrued to date. The proceeds of
the sale shall be paid to the finance officer of the county, who shall pay to
the appropriate officers or persons the cost of removal, storage,
investigation, sale and liens in that order. The remainder of the proceeds of
sale, if any, shall be paid over to the registered owner, or held by the county
for 60 days if the registered owner cannot be located with reasonable
diligence. If the owner does not claim the remainder of the proceeds within 60
days after the day of the sale, the funds shall be deposited in the county’s
General Fund and the owner’s rights in the vehicle are extinguished.
      (5)   This section does not apply to any vehicle in an enclosed building,
to any vehicle on the premises of a business enterprise being operated in a
lawful place and manner if the vehicle is necessary to the operation of the
enterprise, or to any vehicle in an appropriate storage place or depository
maintained in a lawful place and manner by the county.
   (B)   (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person to abandon a junked motor
vehicle on public grounds and on private property within the unincorporated
areas of the county and on county-owned property wherever located.
      (2)   Junked motor vehicles found to be in violation of this chapter may
be removed to a storage garage or area, but no the vehicle shall be removed
from private property without the written request of the owner, lessee or
occupant of the premises unless the Board of Commissioners or a duly authorized
county officer or employee finds in writing that the aesthetic benefits of
removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens imposed on the private property
owner. The finding shall be based on a balancing of the monetary loss of the
apparent owner against the corresponding gain to the public by promoting or
enhancing community, neighborhood or area appearance. The following among other
relevant factors, may be considered:
         (a)   Protection of property values;
         (b)   Promotion of tourism and other economic development
opportunities;
         (c)   Indirect protection of public health and safety;
         (d)   Preservation of the character and integrity of the community;
and
         (e)   Promotion of comfort, happiness and emotional stability of area
residents.
      (3)   The county may require any person requesting the removal of junked
motor vehicle from private property to indemnify the county against any loss,
expense or liability incurred because of the removal, storage or sale of the
junked motor vehicle.
      (4)   (a)   Whenever a vehicle with a valid registration plate or
registration is towed, the authorizing person shall immediately notify the
last-known registered owner of the vehicle of the following:
            1.   A description of the vehicle;
            2.   The place where the vehicle is stored;
            3.   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;
            4.   The possible sale or other disposition of the vehicle;
            5.   The procedure owner must follow to have the vehicle returned
to him or her; and
            6.   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable
cause hearing on the towing.
         (b)   If the vehicle has a state registration plate or registration,
notice shall be given to the owner within 24 hours; if the vehicle is not
registered in this state, notice shall be given to the owner within 72 hours.
This notice shall, if feasible, be given by telephone. Whether or not the owner
is reached by telephone, notice shall be mailed to his or her last-known
address unless he or she or his or her agent waives this notice in writing.
         (c)   Whenever a vehicle with neither a valid registration plate nor
registration is towed, the authorizing person shall make reasonable efforts,
including checking the vehicle identification number, to determine the last-
known registered owner of the vehicle and to notify him or her of the
information as required herein. Unless the owner has otherwise been given
notice, it is presumed that the authorizing person has not made reasonable
efforts, as required under this section, unless notice that the vehicle would
be towed was posted on the windshield or some other conspicuous place at least
ten days before the towing actually occurred; except, no pre-towing notice need
be given if the vehicle impeded the flow of traffic or otherwise jeopardized
the public welfare so that immediate towing was necessary.
         (d)   The owner or any other person entitled to claim possession of
the vehicle may regain possession of the motor vehicle by paying to the county
all reasonable costs incidental to the removal and storage.
         (e)   The owner or any person entitled to claim possession of the
vehicle may request in writing a hearing to determine if probable cause existed
for the towing. The request shall be filed with the magistrate’s office in the
county. The magistrate shall set the hearing within 72 hours of his or her
receiving the request. The owner, the person who requested the hearing if
someone other than the owner, the tower and the person who authorized the
towing shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing. Any decision by
the magistrate may be appealed by either party to district court.
      (5)   After holding a junked motor vehicle for 15 days, the county may
destroy it or sell it at private sale as junk. Within 15 days after the final
disposition of a junked motor vehicle, the county shall notify the state
division of motor vehicles that the vehicle has been determined to be a junked
motor vehicle and has been disposed of as such. The notice shall contain as
full and accurate a description of the vehicle as can be reasonably determined.
The full proceeds of the sale of the junked motor vehicle shall be paid to the
finance officer of the county, who shall pay to the appropriate officers or
persons the cost of removal, storage, investigation, sale and liens, in that
order. The remainder of the proceeds of sale, if any, shall be held by the
county for 30 days after the day the vehicle is disposed of. The funds shall be
deposited in the county’s General Fund, and the owner’s rights in the vehicle
are extinguished.
      (6)   If a junked motor vehicle does not display a current license plate
and the vehicle identification numbers have been removed or defaced so as to be
illegible, the county may dispose of a junked motor vehicle under this section
rather than § 90.08(D). The county may destroy the vehicle or sell it at
private sale, without regard to value, after having held the vehicle for 48
hours. The proceeds shall be placed in the county’s General Fund.
      (7)   This section does not apply to the following:
         (a)   Any motor vehicle in the process of repair or restoration on
property under the control of the owner of the vehicle or property under the
control of the person repairing or restoring the vehicle. Visible evidence of
repair or restoration shall be apparent on a monthly basis; and
         (b)   Any motor vehicle that is used on a regular basis for business
or personal use.

(Ord. passed 7-9-2018)
§ 91.03 RABIES VACCINATIONS; BITING ANIMALS.
   (A)   Every animal which has bitten anyone or which shows symptoms of rabies

Department shall make reasonable effort to notify the owner, and inform the
owner of the conditions whereby the animal may be redeemed.

is badly wounded, diseased or which is sick or diseased or poses a health
threat to other animals in the County Animal Shelter (not a rabies suspect) and
has no identification shall be euthanized immediately in a humane manner. If
the animal has identification, the staff of the County Animal Shelter shall
attempt to notify the owner before euthanizing the animal; but if the owner
cannot be reached readily, and the animal is suffering or poses a health threat
to other animals in the shelter, the staff of the County Animal Shelter may
euthanize the animal at its discretion in a humane manner.
   (E)   Public nuisance animals. The Sheriff's Department or the County Animal
Shelter staff may euthanize any public nuisance animal when it poses a threat
to the personal safety of any person.
   (F)   Redemption procedure for impounded animals. When any animal has been
impounded pursuant to this section at the County Animal Shelter, notice thereof
shall be given to the owner. The owner shall be entitled to resume possession
of his or her animal, except as already provided for certain animals, upon
compliance with the provisions of this section and the payment of shelter fees
incurred and proof of rabies vaccination. The redemption fees will be pre-set
and will be posted in the office of the County Animal Shelter. The fees will be
fixed by the Board of Commissioners.
   (G)   Personal safety of shelter workers. Any animal that is impounded and
endangers the personal safety of any shelter staff member may be euthanized at
any time. Examples of endangering the personal safety of the shelter staff
include, but are not limited to, scratching, biting and/or aggressively
attacking shelter staff.

CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
§ 91.45 UNLAWFUL ACTS.
   All animals shall be kept and treated under sanitary conditions and it shall

forth in §§ 91.46 through 91.50.
(Ord. passed 7-9-2018)

and “torment” shall be held to include every act, omission, or neglect whereby
unjustifiable physical pain, suffering, or death is caused or permitted: but
such terms shall not be construed to prohibit lawful shooting of birds, deer
and other game for human food: nor to prohibit an animal's owner, a
veterinarian, or Director of the Albemarle Regional Health Services, or
Sheriff’s Office agents from destroying dangerous, unwanted, or injured animals
in a humane manner. As used in this section, the term “animal” includes all
domesticated animals.
(Ord. passed 7-9-2018)
§ 91.47 FAILURE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FOOD, WATER, SHELTER AND VETERINARIAN CARE.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to provide an animal or animals
with proper shelter and protection from the weather, sufficient and wholesome
food and water to keep animal or animals in good health and comfort, the
opportunity for exercise, veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering and
humane care and treatment. Also, it shall be unlawful for any person to
maintain his or her animal or animals in their care or on their property in
unsanitary or inhumane conditions.
   (A)   By way of example, but not limitation, the following standards may be
deemed adequate upon the discretion of an animal control officer upon
investigation:
      (1)   “Adequate food” means the provision at suitable intervals, not to
exceed 24 hours, of quantity of wholesome foodstuff suitable for the species
and age, sufficient to maintain nutrition in each animal. Such foodstuff shall
be served in a receptacle, dish, or container.
      (2)   “Adequate water” means access to a supply of clean, fresh water
suitable for drinking and provided in a sanitary manner.
      (3)   Adequate shelter means that shelter or portion of an outside
enclosure which will keep a non-aquatic animal dry and out of the direct sun,
at a temperature level that is healthful for the animal. The structure should
have dry bedding such as hay or straw for warmth during cold temperatures. For
dogs, cats or other small animals the shelter shall be a wind and moisture
resistant structure of suitable size to accommodate the animal (the animal
should be able to stand up and turn around in the structure). The enclosure
shall be stable and include surrounding walls, a roof and a solid floor with an
opening entrance large enough to allow access to the animal. The animal must
have access to shaded areas other than the shelter during warm or hot days. If
there are dangerous temperatures all animals should be brought inside or
provided with adequate shelter.
   (B)   For all animals the containment area shall be free of accumulated
waste and debris so that the animal shall be free to walk or lie down without
coming into contact with any such waste or debris and drainage shall be
provided to eliminate excess water or moisture. Shelters that are not adequate
include, but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Underneath houses, outdoor steps, decks or stoops or underneath
motor vehicles;
      (2)   Inside metal barrels or cardboard boxes;
      (3)   Shelters that are prone to flood;
      (4)   Shelters surrounded by debris, obstructions or impediments that may
endanger the animal;
      (5)   Confinement of the animal in storage rooms, sheds or out buildings
without windows and proper ventilation if the Sheriff's Office determines the
shelter is inadequate.
   (C)   It is unlawful to keep an animal in unsanitary and/or inhumane
conditions which are detrimental to the animal’s health and general welfare,
which protects the county against the possibility of transmission of disease.

plan.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPROVAL AUTHORITY. The Board of County Commissioners, Board of Adjustment
or other board or official designated by ordinance or this chapter as being
authorized to grant the specific zoning or land use permit or approval that
constitutes a site specific development plan or a phased development plan.
   PHASED DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
      (1)   A plan which has been submitted to the county by a landowner for
phased development which shows the type and intensity of use for a specific
parcel or parcels with a lesser degree of certainty than the plan determined by
the county to be a site specific plan. The purpose of submitting the phased
development plan to the county is for purposes of obtaining one of the
following zoning or land use permits or approvals:
         (a)   Subdivision plan as regulated by §
155.061;
         (b)   Special use permit as regulated by §§
157.135 through
157.138;
         (c)   Multi-family dwellings as regulated by §
151.50; and
         (d)   Manufactured home rental community plan as regulated by §§
154.01 through
154.10.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither a variance, a sketch plan or
any other document that fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type
and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property shall
constitute a phased development plan.
   SITE SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
      (1)   A plan of land development submitted to the county for purposes of
obtaining one of the following zoning or land use permits or approvals:
         (a)   Subdivision plan as regulated by §

nor any other document that fails to describe with reasonable certainty the
type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property shall
constitute a site specific development plan.
   ZONING VESTED RIGHT. A right pursuant to G.S. § 153A-344.1 to undertake and
complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of
an approved site specific development plan or phased development plan.
(Ord. passed 11-4-1991)
§ 150.17 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING VESTED RIGHT.
   (A)   A zoning vested right shall be deemed established upon the valid
approval, or conditional approval, by the Board of County Commissioners or
Board of Adjustment, as applicable, of a site specific development plan or
phased development plan, following notice and public hearing.
   (B)   The approving authority may approve a site specific development plan
or phased development plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) above, approval of a site
specific development plan or phased development plan with the condition that a
variance be obtained shall not confer a zoning vested right unless and until
the necessary variance is obtained.
   (D)   A site specific development plan or phased development plan shall be
deemed approved upon the effective date of the approval authority’s action or
ordinance relating thereto.
   (E)   The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the
application of overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not
affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations
that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land-
use regulation by the county, including, but not limited to, building, fire,
plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes. Otherwise, applicable new or amended
regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject to
a site specific development plan or phased development plan upon the expiration
or termination of the vested right in accordance with this subchapter.
   (F)   A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and
run with the applicable property. After approval of a site specific development
plan or phased development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall
be entitled to exercise such right while applicable.
(Ord. passed 11-4-1991)
§ 150.18 APPROVAL PROCEDURES AND APPROVAL AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, an application for
site specific development plan or phased development plan approval shall be
processed in accordance with the procedures established by ordinance and shall

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 152.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has, in G.S. Ch. 143, Art.
21, Pt. 6; G.S. Ch. 153A Art. 18, Pts. 3 and 4; and G.S. Ch. 153A, Art. 6, Pt.
121, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners does ordain as follows:
(Ord. passed 3-25-2011)
§ 152.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the county are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood prone areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. passed 3-25-2011)
§ 152.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and all other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 3-25-2011)
§ 152.004 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets and bridges)
that are located in flood prone areas;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas; and
   (G)   To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in
a special flood hazard area.

any revision thereto adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S.
§ 143-143.15, or a certified engineered foundation. Additionally, when the
elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above
the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or
engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in
height, an engineering certification is required.
      (3)   All foundation enclosures or skirting shall be in accordance with
division (D) below.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with, and approved by, the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are below the
regulatory flood protection elevation shall not be designed to be used for
human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of
vehicles, building access or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in
connection with the premises; be constructed entirely of flood resistant
materials below the regulatory flood protection level in A and AE Zones and
meet the following design criteria:
      (1)   Measures for complying with this requirement shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood waters. To meet this requirement, the
foundation must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
meet the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings must be at least one square
inch for each square foot of each enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area must
have openings on exterior walls to allow flood waters to directly enter;
         (d)   The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one
foot above the adjacent grade; and
         (e)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other opening
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of flood waters
in both directions.
      (2)   Foundation enclosures:
         (a)   Vinyl or sheet metal skirting is not considered an enclosure for
regulatory and flood insurance rating purposes. Therefore such skirting does
not require hydrostatic openings as outlined above; and
         (b)   Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status,
is considered an enclosure and requires hydrostatic openings as outlined above
to comply with this chapter.
      (3)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such
enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except
to enclose storage areas.
   (E)   Additions/improvements.
      (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures whereas the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure:
         (a)   Are not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more nonconforming than the existing structure. (Conversion of a garage to
living space could not be below the floor level of the main structure and
mechanical units would have to be elevated to at least the floor level of the
structure.); and
         (b)   Are a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure shall require only the addition to comply with the standards
for new construction.
      (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures whereas the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure:
         (a)   Are not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; and
         (b)   Are a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      (4)   Where a fire wall or independent perimeter load-bearing wall is
provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall
be considered a separate building and only the addition must comply with the
standards for new construction.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreation vehicles placed on sites within a
special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and has no permanently attached additions); or
      (2)   Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring
and elevation requirements of §§
152.051,
152.065 and division (C) above.
   (G)   Temporary structures. Prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit for a temporary structure, the following requirements must

the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a hurricane or flash flood
warning notification. The plan must include the following information:
         (a)   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted;
         (b)   The name, address and phone number of the individual responsible
for the removal of the temporary structure;
         (c)   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or
immediately upon flood warning notification);
         (d)   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with a
trucking company to ensure the availability of removal equipment when needed;
and
         (e)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area to which the temporary structure will be moved.
      (2)   The above information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval.
   (H)   Accessory structures. 
      (1)   When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages and the like)
are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, the following criteria
shall be met:
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including work, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
         (b)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
         (c)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood
waters;
         (d)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
§
152.065(A);
         (e)   All service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment

division (D)(1) above.
      (2)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet
does not require an elevation or flood-proofing certificate. Elevation or
flood-proofing certifications are required for all other accessory structures
in accordance with §
152.051(C).
(Ord. passed 3-25-2011)
§ 152.067 SUBDIVISIONS, MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS.
   All subdivision, manufactured home park and major development proposals
located within special flood hazard areas shall:
   (A)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
   (B)   Have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical
and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
   (C)   Have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards;
and
   (D)   Provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is greater than
five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such base flood
elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference per §
152.031 to be utilized in implementing this chapter.
(Ord. passed 3-25-2011)
§ 152.068 STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS.
   Within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.031, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided, the
following provisions shall apply.
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development, shall be permitted within a distance of 20
feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream,
whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the

   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in §
152.031 are areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas. The
floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the
velocity of flood waters that have erosion potential and carry debris and
potential projectiles.
   (B)   The following provisions shall apply to all development within such
areas.
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit.
      (2)   If division (B)(1) above is satisfied, all development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. passed 6-20-1977)
§ 153.04 MINOR DEVELOPMENT PERMITS.
   (A)   Designation of AECs requiring minor permits. The following permit-
letting requirements and information in regard to AECs shall be available for
review and inspection in the Tax Supervisor’s office:
      (1)   Inscription of all AECs within the county jurisdiction that is
sufficiently clear to provide notice to all property owners within those AECs
that a permit must be secured before any development may proceed on the
property;
      (2)   A copy of the standards for development adopted by the Commission
for each type of AEC found in the jurisdiction and the statutory grounds on
which a permit application may be denied or conditional;
      (3)   The statutory definition of development, as provided in the CAMA,
the Coastal Area Management Act, being G.S. § 113A-103(5)(a) through (c);
      (4)   A copy of the approval permit application form for both major and
minor development in AECs;
      (5)   The name and office address of the permit officer; and
      (6)   A copy of this plan.
   (B)   Application. An application for a permit for minor development shall
consist of filing with the Secretary of DNER and the permit officer:
      (1)   A completed application using the applicable form adopted and
approved by the Commission; and
      (2)   A single check or money order payable to the county in the amount
of $10. Monies so collected may only be used in the administration of the
permit program, specifically including the cost of required public notices and
hearings.
   (C)   Disposition.
      (1)   The permit officer shall determine from the application what other
local permits are required for the development. He or she shall inform the
applicant of these other permit requirements and aid him or her in properly
applying for the permits.
      (2)   Permit applications shall be numbered serially using a six-digit
numbering system. The first two digits will indicate the year in which the
application is made, and the last four digits will run serially in the order in
which the applications are received. (For example, the first permit
applications were in 1978, and were numbered 78-0001, 78-0002, 78-0003 and the
like.)
      (3)   Disposition of the application shall take place within 30 days
unless the permit officer gives written notice by registered mail of one
additional 30-day extension as necessary for proper evaluation of the
application. The permit officer shall maintain a record of all evidence and all
matters relevant to each minor development permit application. The relevant
information shall include, but not be limited to, applications, correspondence,
public notices, responses to public notices and a copy of the final
disposition.
      (4)   Statutory grounds upon which the permit officer bases the denial,
conditioned grant or return of application shall be set out in writing. One
copy shall be maintained by the permit officer and one copy shall be given to
the applicant, either in person or by registered mail.
   (D)   Return of application.
      (1)   The permit officer shall return incomplete, insufficient or
unauthorized applications within a reasonable time. The 30-day period for
consideration of the application shall begin to run upon receipt. The time
period will continue to run in the case of an incomplete or insufficient
application until the permit officer returns it with reasons for the rejection
in writing to the applicant for correction of deficiencies. The time period
will begin to run again when a corrected application is returned to the permit
officer.
      (2)   Any application received requesting a permit for an activity which
constitutes major development shall be returned by the permit officer with
appropriate instructions for submitting the application to the Commission.
   (E)   Grant. A minor development permit shall be granted only if
consideration of the application results in none of the appropriate findings
listed in G.S. § 113A-120.
   (F)   Conditioned approval. The approval of a minor development permit may
be conditioned upon the acceptance by the applicant of certain reasonable
conditions as set out by the permit officer to protect the public interest with
respect to the appropriate findings listed in division (E) above. The applicant
must sign the conditioned grant of approval as an acceptance of the amendments
of the proposed project plans in a manner consistent with the conditions set
out by the permit officer before the permit shall become effective.
   (G)   Passive approval. Failure of the permit officer to approve or deny a
properly completed and filed application, or to give notice of an extension
beyond the initial 30-day disposition period shall result in a passive grant. A
passive approval shall have the full force and effect of an unconditioned
approval.
   (H)   Display of permit. The property owner shall cause the properly granted
minor development permit to be displayed in full view on the site of the
development. This requirement shall apply to every permit no matter how it is
granted. It is therefore necessary that the property owner acquire a permit
received by passive approval for purposes of posting on the site before
proceeding with the development.

enforcement plan, the permit officer and County Commissioners shall conduct an
investigation and prepare an appropriate response to the alleged deficiencies
set forth in the Commission’s notice.
   (B)   Notification to the Commission.
      (1)   If the Commission’s charges are found to be valid within 30 days of
notification by the Commission, the County Commissioners and permit officer
shall inform the Commission of the findings of the investigation, shall assert
the willingness and ability to modify the situation resulting in the violation
and shall state the means by which the permit officer and County Commissioners
intend to avoid similar violations in the future.
      (2)   If the County Commissioners and the permit officer find the
Commission’s charges to be without grounds, they shall so inform the
Commission. If the CRC disagrees with that finding, the County Commissioners
may, at that time, request a hearing before the Commission or take other
appropriate action within 90 days after receipt of the Commission’s
notification of the violation to come to some mutually acceptable solution with
the Commission.
      (3)   If no mutually acceptable solution has been achieved within the 90-

INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS
§ 155.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Subdivision Regulation
for Pasquotank County, North Carolina”, and may be referred to as the
“Subdivision Regulations”.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)
§ 155.002 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to support and guide the proper subdivision
of land within the jurisdiction of the county in order to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the county. The chapter
is designed to promote the orderly development of the county; for the
coordination of streets and highways within proposed subdivisions with existing
or planned streets and highways with other public facilities; for the
dedication or reservation of right-of-way or easements for street and utility
purposes; and for the distribution of population and traffic, which shall avoid
congestion and overcrowding and which will create conditions essential to
public health, safety and the general welfare. This chapter is designed to
further facilitate adequate provision for water, sewage, parks, schools and
playgrounds, and also to facilitate the further resubdivision of large tracts
into smaller parcels of land.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)
§ 155.003 AUTHORITY.
   The chapter is adopted under the authority of G.S. Ch. 153A, Art. 2.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)

   On and after April 17, 1989, these regulations shall govern each and every
subdivision of land within the county as provided in G.S. Ch. 153A, Art. 18,
except those lands lying within the subdivision regulation jurisdiction of any
municipality, unless such municipality shall have by resolution formally
requested the county to enforce these regulations within the city’s area of
jurisdiction.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)
§ 155.005 PREREQUISITE TO PLAT RECORDING.
   (A)   After April 17, 1989, the effective date of this chapter, each
individual subdivision plat of land within the county’s jurisdiction shall
receive preliminary approval by the County Planning Board and preliminary and
final approval by the County Board of Commissioners.
   (B)   In instances where the subdivision qualifies for the abbreviated
subdivision, the plat shall receive preliminary and final approval by the
County Subdivision Administrator.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989; Ord. 1, passed 12-16-1991; Ord. 2, passed 8-17-1992)
§ 155.006 ISSUANCE OF PERMITS.
   No street shall be recommended for acceptance for maintenance by the State
Board of Transportation nor shall any permit be issued by any administrative
agent of the county for the construction of any building or other improvement
requiring a permit, upon any land concerning which a plat is required to be
approved, unless and until the requirements set forth in this chapter have been
complied with and the same approved by the Planning Board and Board of County
Commissioners.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)
§ 155.007 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER OFFICIAL COUNTY PLANS.
   Proposed subdivisions must comply in all respects with the rules and
regulations of the appropriate water district providing the water service and
with all other officially adopted plans in effect in the area to be subdivided,
including the locally adopted Coastal Resources Commission ratified Land Use
Plan.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)
LEGAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.020 GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL.
   (A)   After the effective date of this chapter, no subdivision plat of land
within the subdivision jurisdiction of the county shall be filed or recorded
until it has been submitted to, and approved by, the County Board of
Commissioners or the County Subdivision Administrator, as set forth in §
155.005, and until this approval is entered in writing on the face of the plat
by the Chairperson of the Board of Commissioners or the Subdivision Review
Officer of the county.
   (B)   The Register of Deeds shall not file or record a plat of a subdivision
of land within the territorial jurisdiction of the county that has not been
approved in accordance with these provisions, nor shall the Clerk of Superior
Court order or direct the recording of a plat if the recording would be in
conflict with this section.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989; Ord. 2, passed 8-17-1992)
§ 155.021 DUTY OF SUBDIVIDER OR AUTHORIZED AGENT.
   A plat must be prepared, approved and recorded whenever the subdivision of
land takes place, as defined in this chapter. The owner of land shown on a
subdivision plat submitted for recording, or an authorized agent, shall sign a
statement on the plat stating whether any land shown thereon is within the
subdivision regulation jurisdiction of the county.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)
§ 155.022 EFFECT OF PLAT APPROVAL ON DEDICATIONS.
   Pursuant to G.S. § 153A-333, the approval of a plat does not constitute or
effect the acceptance by the county or the public of the dedication of any
street or other ground, public utility line or other public facility shown on
the plat and shall not be construed to do so.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989; Ord. 4, passed 6-21-1993)
§ 155.023 SEPARABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of this chapter be decided by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)
§ 155.024 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The County Board of Commissioners may, on recommendation from the
Planning Board, authorize a variance from these regulations when, in its
opinion, unnecessary hardship may result from strict compliance. In granting
any variance, the Board of Commissioners shall consider the nature of the
proposed subdivision, the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of
persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect
of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity.
Appropriate conditions may be imposed on a subdivision variance, provided that
the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. A concurring vote of
four-fifths of the Board shall be necessary to grant a variance.
   (B)   No variance shall be granted unless the County Board of Commissioners
finds:
      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989; Ord. 15-01, passed - - )
§ 155.025 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   The County Board of Commissioners may from time to time amend the
terms of this chapter, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall
have been proposed by, or shall have been submitted to, the Planning Board for
review and recommendation. The Planning Board shall have 30 days from the time
proposed amendment is submitted to it within which to submit its report. If the
Planning Board fails to submit a report within the specified time, it shall be
deemed to have recommended approval of the amendment.
   (B)   No amendment shall be adopted by the governing body until it has held
a public hearing on the amendment. Notice of the hearing shall be published in
a newspaper of general circulation in the county area at least once a week for
two successive calendar weeks prior to the hearing. The initial notice shall
appear not more than 25, nor less than ten, days prior to the hearing date. In
computing the ten and 25- day periods, the date of publication is not to be
counted, but the date of the hearing is.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)
§ 155.026 ABROGATION.
   It is not intended that this chapter repeal, abrogate, annul, impair or
interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions,
agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant
to law. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall govern.
(Ord. passed 4-17-1989)

   (A)   This chapter, in part, carries forward by re-enactment some of the
provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance of the county adopted on April 4, 1966,
and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue
enforcing such existing provisions so that all rights and liabilities that have
accrued thereunder are preserved and may be enforced.
   (B)   All provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance which are not re-enacted

   This chapter shall take effect and shall be in force on and after April 17,

§ 156.01 AUTHORITY; PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by G.S.
Ch. 63, Art. 4. It is hereby found that an obstruction has the potential for
endangering the lives and property of users of the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank
County Regional Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity;
that an obstruction may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums
of the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County Regional Airport and that an
obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for the landing, takeoff and
maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the
Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County Regional Airport and the public investment
therein.
   (B)   Accordingly, it is declared:
      (1)   The creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential
of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the Elizabeth
City-Pasquotank County Regional Airport;
      (2)   It is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety
and general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions that are
a hazard to air navigation be prevented; and
      (3)   The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the
extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power.
   (C)   It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or
establishment of hazards to air navigation, the elimination, removal,
alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation, or the marking and
lighting of obstructions are public purposes for which a political subdivision
may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.

the runway center line and the runway center line extended at a slope of seven
feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and
approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces.
TRANSITIONAL SURFACES for those portions of the precision approach surfaces,
which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a
distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach
surface and at 90-degree angles to the extended runway center line.
   TREE. Any object of natural growth.
(Ord. passed 2-15-1999)
§ 156.04 AIRPORT ZONES.
   (A)   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and
conical surfaces as they apply to Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County Regional
Airport. The zones are shown on the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County height
restriction zoning map dated February 15, 1999, which is attached to this
chapter and made a part hereof.
   (B)   An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered
to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various
zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
      (1)   Precision instrument runway approach zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet
wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at
a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center line
is the continuation of the center line of the runway.
      (2)   Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom
a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
      (3)   Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of
each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those
arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transition zones.
(Ord. passed 2-15-1999)
§ 156.05 HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be

zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height
limit herein established for the zone.
   (B)   The applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of
the zones in question as follows.
      (1)   Precision instrument runway approach zone. Slopes 50 feet outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway center line; thence slopes upward 40 feet horizontally for each
foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the
extended runway center line.
      (2)   Transitional zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing,
there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the
precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone,
there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-
degree angles to the extended runway center line.
      (3)   Horizontal zone. One hundred-fifty feet above the established
airport elevation.
      (4)   Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning
at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
      (5)   Excepted height limitation. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or
growth of any tree to a height up to 20 feet above the surface of the land.

   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change
or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of
the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance
of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this chapter, and
is diligently prosecuted.
   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to install, operate and maintain thereon the markers and lights as
shall be deemed necessary by the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County Airport
Authority to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of the airport obstruction. The markers and lights shall
be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the owner.
(Ord. passed 2-15-1999) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.08 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses. Except as specifically provided in divisions (A)(1)
through (A)(3) below, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit shall have been applied for
and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. All permit applications for obstructions in
either the conical or horizontal surface related to the Elizabeth City-
Pasquotank County Regional Airport shall be reviewed and evaluated by the
Federal Aviation Administration using FAA form 7460 (notice of construction).
The FAA report shall be a part of the application submittal to the Elizabeth
City-Pasquotank County Airport Authority for consideration for approval. If the
determination by the Authority is in the affirmative, the permit shall be
granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter
shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with
division (D) below.
      (1)   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone covered by this chapter, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except
when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, the tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for the zones.
      (2)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for the approach zones.
      (3)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when
the tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the transition
zones.
      (4)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter, except as set forth in §
156.05.
   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when
the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
a permit shall be granted.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the building
inspector determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned
or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall
be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from the height restriction zoning
regulations.
   (D)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance from the regulations. The application for a variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. The
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard
to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with
the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Board of Adjustment
unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Elizabeth City-
Pasquotank County Airport Authority for advice as to the aeronautical effects
of the variance. If the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County Airport Authority does
not respond to the application within 45 days after receipt, the Board of
Appeals may act on its own to grant or deny the application.
   (E)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if the action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and
be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner
of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the
owner’s expense, the markings and lights as may be necessary.

TITLE, ENACTMENT AND PURPOSE
§ 157.001 TITLE, ENACTMENT AND PREAMBLE.
    A chapter, in pursuance of the authority granted by G.S. Chapter 160D, for
the purposes of promoting the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare; to provide for the establishment of zoning districts within the
county, to regulate within those districts the location, height, number of
stories, and size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot that
may be occupied, the required open space, the density of population, and the
uses of land, buildings, and other structures; to provide methods of
administration of this chapter; to prescribe penalties for the violation
thereof; and to supersede any ordinances in conflict herewith.
   (A)   Whereas, the County Commissioners deem it necessary, for the purpose
of promoting the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the county to
enact such an ordinance; and
   (B)   Whereas, the County Commissioners have created a Planning Board to
prepare a proposed zoning ordinance, including both the full text of such
ordinance and zoning maps showing proposed district boundaries; and
   (C)   Whereas, the Planning Board has divided the county into districts and
has prepared regulations pertaining to such districts in accordance with a
comprehensive plan and appropriate land use studies, and designed to lessen
congestion, to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide
adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue
concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements;
and
   (D)   Whereas, the Planning Board has given reasonable consideration, among
other things, to the character of the districts and their peculiar suitability
for particular uses, with a view to conserving the value of buildings and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land through those areas of the county
under the jurisdiction of this chapter; and
   (E)   Whereas, the Planning Board has certified its proposed zoning
ordinance to the County Commissioners; and
   (F)   Whereas, the County Commissioners have given due public notice of
hearings relating to adopting the zoning ordinance in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and G.S. Ch. 160D, Art. 18, and have held such
public hearings; and
   (G)   Whereas, all requirements of the General Statutes of North Carolina,
with regard to the preparation of the proposed ordinance by the Planning Board
in accordance with a comprehensive plan, and subsequent action of the County
Commissioners have been met;
   (H)   Now therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the county, does hereby
ordain and enact into law throughout the areas designated on the official
zoning map(s) of the county except as otherwise provided in G.S. Chapter 160D
the following articles and sections, this the 21st day of June, 2021.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.002 SHORT TITLE.
    This chapter shall be known as the “Zoning Ordinance of Pasquotank County,

ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS AND PROVISION FOR ZONING MAP
§ 157.015 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (A)    For the purpose of this chapter, the county zoning jurisdiction is
hereby divided into zones or districts as shown on the “Official Zoning Map(s)
of Pasquotank County, North Carolina,” which, together with all explanatory
matter thereon is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
chapter.
   (B)   The Official Zoning Map(s) shall be identified by the signature of the
Chairman of the County Board of Commissioners and attested by the County Clerk
and bear the seal of the county under the following words:

Article 2 of the Zoning Ordinance of Pasquotank County, North Carolina together
with the date of adoption of this Ordinance."
   (C)   The Official Zoning Map(s), which shall be located in the Pasquotank
County Courthouse and recorded in the Pasquotank County Register of Deeds

the county.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.016 ZONING MAP CHANGES.
   (A)    If, in accordance with §§ 157.230 through 157.239 of this chapter,
changes are made in the zoning district boundaries or other matter shown on the
zoning map, such changes shall be made with an entry on the zoning map briefly
describing the change and the date of the change.

supersedes. The new zoning map shall bear the signatures of the Chairman of the
Board of Commissioners and the County Clerk and shall bear the seal of the
county under the following words:
   "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces
the Official Zoning Map adopted on (date of adoption of map replaced) -

§ 157.019 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
    Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
districts as shown on the “Official Zoning Map of Pasquotank County, North
Carolina,” the following rules shall apply:
   (A)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of
streets, highways, alleys, or railroads shall be construed to follow such
centerline.
   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
   (C)   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerline of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or
other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerline.
   (D)   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in divisions (A) through (C) above shall be so construed. Distances
not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by
the scale of the map.
   (E)   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in circumstances not
covered by division (A) through (D) above, the Board of Adjustment shall
interpret the district boundaries.
   (F)   Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single
ownership at the time of passage of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment may
permit, as conditional use, the extension of the regulations for either portion
of the lot, not to exceed 150 feet from the district boundary line. In
addition, the remaining parcel shall not be less than the minimum required for
the district in which it is located.
   (G)   If a parcel of land lies within the planning and development
regulation jurisdiction of both Pasquotank County and the City of Elizabeth
City, the local governments may, by mutual agreement and with the written
consent of the landowner, assign exclusive planning and development regulation
jurisdiction for the entire parcel to any one of those local governments. Such
a mutual agreement shall only be applicable to development regulations and
shall not affect taxation or other nonregulatory matters. The mutual agreement
shall be evidenced by a resolution formally adopted by each governing board and
recorded with the Pasquotank County Register of Deeds within 14 days of the
adoption of the last required resolution.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
EXEMPTIONS
§ 157.030 BONA FIDE FARM OPERATIONS EXEMPT.
   (A)   This chapter shall in no way regulate, restrict, or prohibit a bona
fide farm and its related uses, but any use of such property for non-farm
purposes shall be subject to such regulations.
   (B)   Bona fide farm purposes include the production and activities relating
or incidental to the production of crops, grains, fruits, vegetables,
ornamental and flowering plants, dairy, livestock, poultry, and all other forms
of agriculture, as defined in G.S. § 106-581.1. Activities incident to the farm
include existing or new residences constructed to the applicable residential
building code situated on the farm occupied by the owner, lessee, or operator
of the farm and other buildings or structures sheltering or supporting the farm
use and operation. For purposes of this section, "when performed on the farm"
in G.S. § 106-581.1(6) includes the farm within the jurisdiction of the county
and any other farm owned or leased to or from others by the bona fide farm
operator, no matter where located. For purposes of this section, the production
of a nonfarm product that the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
recognizes as a "Goodness Grows in North Carolina" product that is produced on
a farm subject to a conservation agreement under G.S. § 106-743.2 is a bona
fide farm purpose. For purposes of determining whether a property is being used
for bona fide farm purposes, any of the following is sufficient evidence that
the property is being used for bona fide farm purposes:
      (1)   A farm sales tax exemption certificate issued by the Department of
Revenue.
      (2)   A copy of the property tax listing showing that the property is
eligible for participation in the present-use value program pursuant to G.S. §
105-277.3.
      (3)   A copy of the farm owner's or operator's Schedule F from the
owner's or operator's most recent federal income tax return.
      (4)   A forest management plan.
   (C)   A building or structure that is used for agritourism is a bona fide
farm purpose if the building or structure is located on a property that (i) is
owned by a person who holds a qualifying farm sales tax exemption certificate
from the Department of Revenue pursuant to G.S. § 105-164.13E(a) or (ii) is
enrolled in the present-use value program pursuant to G.S. § 105-277.3. Failure
to maintain the requirements of this subsection for a period of three years
after the date the building or structure was originally classified as a bona
fide farm purpose pursuant to this subsection subjects the building or
structure to applicable zoning and development regulation ordinances adopted by
a county pursuant to G.S. § 160D-702 in effect on the date the property no
longer meets the requirements of this subsection. For purposes of this section,
"agritourism" means any activity carried out on a farm or ranch that allows
members of the general public, for recreational, entertainment, or educational
purposes, to view or enjoy rural activities, including farming, ranching,
historic, cultural, harvest-your-own activities, hunting, fishing, equestrian
activities, or natural activities and attractions. A building or structure used
for agritourism includes any building or structure used for public or private
events, including, but not limited to, weddings, receptions, meetings,
demonstrations of farm activities, meals, and other events that are taking
place on the farm because of its farm or rural setting.

similar to a use in the Permitted Use Table, then said use is prohibited.
   (C)   Rental and leasing of any commodity shall be permitted under the same
classification and in the same districts as are sales of that commodity, unless
rental or leasing of that commodity is listed separately in the Permitted Use
Table.
   (D)   If an industrial plant or facility involves two (or more)
manufacturing activities with different SIC Codes on the same zone lot, the
industrial plant shall be permitted only in those zoning districts where the
more restricted activity is permitted.

§ 157.121 NOTES TO THE TABLE OF AREA, YARD AND HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Note 1. Special use requirements take precedence. Area, yard and
height requirements as specified in the issuance of a special use permit shall
take precedence over area, yard and height requirements as set forth in the
Table of Area, Yard and Height Requirements.
   (B)   Note 2. Variance for prior lots of record. Notwithstanding the other
setback provisions of this chapter, a building or structure may be constructed
and occupied by one family on any lot recorded prior to adoption of this
chapter and meeting all of the requirements of the Pasquotank County Sanitarian
and maintaining minimum side yards of five feet, a front yard of 25 feet and a
rear yard of 20 feet.
   (C)   Note 3. 
      (1)    Corner lots. A minimum setback of 20 feet shall be maintained
between any principal building and the side street. This requirement shall not
be applied so as to reduce the building width of a residentially zoned corner
lot of record at the time of passage of this chapter to less than 40 feet, nor
to prohibit the erection of any accessory building where this requirement
cannot reasonably be complied with as determined by the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   Retaining walls. The setback and yard requirements of this chapter
shall not apply to a retaining wall not more than five feet high, as measured
from the lowest ground elevation to the top of the wall. The Board of
Adjustment may permit a retaining wall greater than five feet height where it
finds that due to the topography of the lot such a wall is necessary.
      (3)   Fences and walls and plantings. In residential zones, fences and
walls not over four feet high may project into or may enclose any front yard.
Side and rear yards may be enclosed by fences or walls up to six feet high. In
the Industrial and Commercial zones a solid or open fence or wall may be
erected to a maximum height of ten feet. However, no fence, wall, or plantings
may be established on or in a public street right-of-way or within deeded
drainage/utility easements as required by Albemarle Regional Health Services
and Pasquotank County.
      (4)   Open storage.  Any open storage not enclosed within the confines of
a building, such as boxes, crates, trash-piles, machinery and merchandise with
open display, that results from the commercial operation it is part of, shall
be enclosed or hidden from view along any property lines adjacent to or in a
residential zone by a wall, fence and/or screening. This provision shall apply
in any commercial or industrial use abutting or within a residential zone.
      (5)   Accessory structures.  Accessory structures (detached garages,
storage buildings, swimming pools, etc.) to residential uses may be constructed
provided:
         (a)   It shall not be located closer than ten feet to any adjoining
lot line;
         (b)   It shall not be located within a deeded drainage/utility
easement as required by Albemarle Regional Health Services or Pasquotank
County;
         (c)   On a corner lot it shall not be located closer to the street
side yard property line than one-half of the required front yard setback; and
         (d)   A minimum distance of ten feet shall be maintained between the
residential structure and the accessory building. Carports and swimming pools
are excluded from this requirement.
      (6)   Solar collectors. Roof-mounted or ground mounted solar collectors
are permitted as an accessory use in all zoning districts. In order to be
classified as an accessory use, the area of the system shall not exceed the
footprint of the principal structure and shall meet the following requirements:
         (a)   Solar collectors shall be configured to avoid glare and heat
transference to adjacent properties.
         (b)   The system shall not be located within ten feet of any side or
rear lot line.
         (c)   Solar collectors located within a front yard shall meet the
minimum setbacks required in §
157.120.
   (D)   Note 4. Structures excluded from height limitations. Chimneys, flag
poles, steeples, water towers, observation towers, electrical transmission
towers, communication towers, silos, and roof structures for housing stairways,
heating and air conditioning equipment, ventilating fans or similar equipment
may be erected without regard to the maximum height limitation. No structure
may be constructed above the height limit herein specified for purposes of
providing for human occupancy.
   (E)   Note 5. Exclusions from setback requirements.
      (1)    Signs.
      (2)   Utility lines and related appurtenances (water, sewer, electrical,
cable TV, etc).
      (3)   Underground drain tile systems and sewerage drainage systems
approved by Albemarle Regional Health Services.
   (F)   Note 6. Reduced lot width and front yard setback requirements.
      (1)   Lot width at front setback line. Subdivisions that have received
sketch plan approval by the Pasquotank County Planning Board prior to January
1, 2001 shall be required to maintain a minimum 100 feet width at the front set
back line.
      (2)   Front yard setback. Subdivisions that have received sketch plan
approval by the Pasquotank County Planning Board prior to January 1, 2001 shall
be required to maintain a minimum 30 feet horizontal distance from the street
right-of-way line.
   (G)   Note 7. Minimum lot size for parcels with individual septic systems.
      (1)   Minimum 43,000 square foot lots are not required when the following
criteria are met:
         (a)   Development site has been reviewed and approved for individual
septic systems by Albemarle Regional Health Services prior to July 19, 2004.
         (b)   Development site is located in a zoning classification that
permits development.

RMH-15, C-1 or O&I zoning classification lot sizes shall be a minimum 15,000
sq. ft.; in an A-1, R-25, R-25A, RMH-25, I-1, I-2, M-F or P-1 zoning
classification shall be a minimum 25,000 sq. ft.; in a R-35A or RMH-35 zoning
classification shall be a minimum 35,000 sq. ft.; and in an A-2 zoning
classification shall be a minimum 40,000 sq. ft. Minimum lot sizes may be
increased in each zoning classification based upon site evaluations by
Albemarle Regional Health Services.
   (H)   Note 8. The height of residential structures shall be measured as the
vertical distance from the lowest adjacent grade to the mid-point of the
highest roof height.

PROVISIONS FOR USES ALLOWED AS SPECIAL USES
§ 157.135 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSES OF SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   Special use permits add flexibility to the Zoning Ordinance. Subject to high
standards of planning and design, certain property uses may be allowed in the
several districts where these uses would not otherwise be acceptable. By means
of controls exercised through the special use permit procedures, property uses
which would otherwise be undesirable in certain districts can be developed to
minimize any negative effects they might have on surrounding properties.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.136 SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Special use permit uses are those uses that, by virtue of their more
limited size, impact, or relationship to the overall health, safety, and
general welfare of the community, will be reviewed and approved by the Planning
Board after a public hearing. These uses are identified as special uses in §§
157.105 through
157.107.
   (B)   Major special use permit uses are those uses that, by virtue of the
size, impact, or relationship to the overall health, safety, and general
welfare of the community, will be reviewed and approved by the Board of
Commissioners after a public hearing. These uses are identified as major
special uses in §§
157.105 through
157.107.
   (C)   The owner or owners, or their duly authorized agent, of the property
included in the petition for a special use permit or a major special use permit
shall submit an application to the Pasquotank County Planning Department at
least 30 days prior to the date of review by the approving Board. An
application fee established by the County Commissioners shall be paid to the
County of Pasquotank, to cover necessary administrative costs and advertising
expenses. Such application shall include all of the requirements pertaining to
it in this subchapter.
   (D)   (1)   Upon receiving the petition for a special use permit and holding
a quasi-judicial hearing, the Board may grant or deny the special use permit
requested in accordance with principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures
specified in the regulations. The special use permit, if granted shall include
such approved plans as may be required.
      (2)   In granting the special use permit the Board shall find:
         (a)   That the use will not materially endanger the public health or
safety if located where proposed and approved;
         (b)   That the use meets all required conditions and specifications;
         (c)   That the use will not substantially injure the value of
adjoining or abutting property, or that the use is a public necessity; and
         (d)   That the location and character of the use, if developed
according to the plan as submitted and approved, will be in harmony with the
area in which it is to be located and in general conformity with the plan of
development for the county.
    (E)   In granting the permit the approving Board may designate reasonable
and appropriate conditions and safeguards in addition and in connection
therewith, as will in its opinion, assure that the use in its proposed location
will be harmonious with the area in which it is proposed to be located and with
the spirit of this chapter. All such additional conditions shall be entered in
the minutes of the meeting at which the permit is granted and also on the
certificate of the special use permit or on the plans submitted therewith. All
specific conditions shall run with the land and shall be binding on the
original applicants for the special use permit, their heirs, successors and
assigns. A special use permit, issued by the Planning Board or Board of
Commissioners shall become null and void if construction or occupancy of the
proposed use as specified on the special use permit is not commenced within 12
months of the date of issuance. Time extensions for the special use permit may
be granted by the approving Board provided applications for extensions are
submitted in writing to the Planning Department prior to expiration. Although
the Board may grant more than one extension of a permit, no single extension
shall exceed a period of six months unless otherwise stated. A Board decision
on an extension may be appealed in conformity with the requirements of division
(G) below in this section.
   (F)   If the Board denies the permit, the Board shall enter the reasons for
its action in the minutes of the meeting at which the action is taken.
   (G)   Every decision by a Board issuing or denying a special use permit
shall be subject to review by the Superior Court by proceeding in the nature of
certiorari. Any petition for review by the Superior Court shall be filed with
the Clerk of Superior Court within 30 days after the decision of the Board is
filed in the Office of the Clerk to the Board of Commissioners or after a
written copy thereof is delivered to every aggrieved party who has filed a
written request for such copy with the Clerk or Chairman of the Board at the
time of the hearing of the case, whichever is later.
   (H)   In addition to the specific conditions imposed by the regulations of
this chapter and whatever additional conditions the Board deems reasonable and
appropriate, special uses shall comply with the height, yard, area, parking,
sign, and all other pertinent regulations for the use district in which they
are permitted unless otherwise specified.
   (I)   In the event of failure to comply with the plans approved by the
approving Board or with any other conditions imposed upon the special use
permit, the permit shall thereupon immediately become void and of no effect. No
building permits for further construction or certificates of occupancy under
this special use permit shall be issued, and all completed structures shall be
regarded as nonconforming uses subject to the provisions of §§
157.105 through
157.107 provided, however, that the county shall not be prevented from
thereafter rezoning said property for its most appropriate use.
   (J)   The original applicant(s), their successors or their assignee may make
minor changes in the location and/or size of the structure provided the
necessity for these changes is clearly demonstrated. Minor changes shall be
reviewed by the Planning and Building Inspection Departments. Upon approval of
the previously mentioned departments, the Zoning Administrator may approve the
requested minor changes. Such approval shall not be granted should the proposed
revisions cause or contribute to:
      (1)   A change in the character of the development,
      (2)   A change of design for, or an increase in the hazards to pedestrian
and vehicle traffic circulation, or
       (3)   A reduction in the originally approved setbacks from roads and/or
property lines.

negative impacts on adjoining properties and street right-of-ways. The use of
earth berms for visual screening shall be encouraged where appropriate;
      (7)   No activities associated with the mine or quarry, including but not
limited to excavation activities, vehicular access (except for driveways
providing access to the site) and detention ponds, shall be located within 100
feet of any property line and 300 feet of any residence, school, church,
hospital, commercial or industrial building, public road, or cemetery. Setbacks
will be reduced by 50% when there is a visual screen of at least six feet in
height between the mining or quarrying activity and the adjoining use. Further,
the Board of Adjustment may reduce non-modified setbacks by 50% when the mining
or quarrying activity adjoins a vacant parcel or farmland. Where mining or

earth berms is encouraged to reduce the impact of the mining or quarrying
operation on adjoining properties;
      (12)   No bulk waste, hazardous waste, commercial waste, garbage,
construction or demolition waste shall be placed on site;
      (13)   Discharging of water from the mine or quarry site shall be
permitted subject to obtaining a state permit. The county may take random
samples and have the results tested for settable solids, turbidity, and pH at
the operator's expense. Such testing shall not exceed six tests per year.
Discharging without proper state permits will result in initiating procedures

comparable to that which existed prior to the issuance of the use permit.
   (DD)   Wireless communication towers and facilities. Wireless communication
towers and facilities are allowed in accordance with Section 7.01. Table of
Permitted Uses and with the requirements listed below. The removal or
replacement of transmission equipment on an existing wireless communication
tower that does not result in a substantial modification of the wireless
facility and/or ordinary maintenance of existing wireless facilities shall be
permitted by right. These regulations shall not apply to noncommercial amateur/
ham radio towers.
      (1)   Towers and antennas shall be required to maintain a setback from
all property lines a distance equal to 50% of the height of the tower. Towers
shall be setback from existing structures and public rights-of-way a distance
equal to the height of the tower and antenna(s) plus 10%. Guy wires and utility
buildings shall conform to the principal structure setback provisions within §§
157.120 and 157.121, Table of Area, Yard and Height Requirements.
      (2)   Performance security. The applicant and the owner of record of any
proposed wireless telecommunications facilities property site shall, at its
cost and expense, be jointly required to execute and file with the county a
bond, or other form of security acceptable to the county as to type of security
and the form and manner of execution, in an amount set forth in the
commissioners fee schedule, and with such sureties as are deemed sufficient by
the county to assure the faithful performance of the terms and conditions of
this chapter. The full amount of the bond or security shall remain in full
force and effect until any necessary site restoration is completed to restore
the site to a condition comparable to that which existed prior to the issuance
of the original zoning permit.
      (3)   Abandoned or unused towers.
         (a)   Abandoned or unused towers and antennas located on land owned or
leased by the utility owner shall be removed by the utility owner within 365
days of cessation of operations;
         (b)   If the tower/antenna is not removed within the required 365 days
of cessation of operations, the county will attempt to contact the utility
owner and order the removal of the tower/antenna within 60 days of receipt of
the notice. If the county is not successful in contacting the utility owner,
the county will notify the landowner that the tower/antenna must be removed
within 60 days of receipt of the notice; and
         (c)    Upon successful notification to either the utility owner or the
landowner and failure to remove the tower/antenna as ordered, the county may
remove the tower/antenna and tax the costs of removal to the landowner or place
a lien upon the property for the costs of removal if such cost is above the
amount of the performance security.
      (4)   Towers and antennas proposed for local business internal
communication purposes only shall be exempt from the one mile search radius
required.
      (5)   Antennas placed on existing structures shall be considered
accessory uses that are permitted by right subject to a zoning permit provided
they are no higher than 20 feet above the structure to which they are attached
and a qualified and licensed engineer certifies the existing structure can
suitably accept the antenna. No additional setbacks shall be required for
antennas placed on existing structures, excluding existing towers. Antennas
that are placed on existing towers cannot be placed above that which exists
unless required setbacks can be met.
      (6)   No new or existing tower and antenna service shall interfere with
public safety telecommunications. Further, where it can be shown that
telecommunication service interferes with reception received by surrounding
properties, the permit holder shall be responsible for taking reasonable steps
to eliminate that interference in accordance with Federal Communications
Commission regulations.
      (7)   Prior to obtaining a building permit, the applicant shall submit
proof of compliance with Federal Aviation Administration and Federal
Communications Commission regulations and any other documentation to

eight feet in height, and in addition to, shall include a minimum of two
strands of barbed-wire and/or razor wire affixed to the top of the fence.
      (9)   The permit, when issued, shall include a condition that the
accumulative electromagnetic radiation levels maintain compliance with
requirements of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), regarding emission
of electromagnetic radiation. The tower or antenna owner shall provide
documentation of accumulative emission levels to FCC standards.
      (10)   When deemed appropriate to minimize the potential impact on
surrounding properties, landscaping may be required around the tower, antenna,
guy wires, and associated buildings. In addition, the following shall be
required:
         (a)   Existing mature tree growth and natural vegetation on the site
shall be preserved to the extent feasible; provided however, that vegetation
that causes interference with the antennas or inhibits access to the equipment
facility may be trimmed or removed;
         (b)   Grading for the new tower or antenna shall be minimized and
limited only to the area necessary for the new facility.
      (11)    All telecommunication facilities and accessory or associated
facilities shall maximize the use of building materials, colors and textures
designed to blend with the structure to which it may be affixed and /or to
harmonize with the natural surroundings, this shall include the utilization of
stealth technology.

      (15)     Shared facilities and collocation. 
         (a)   All new tower and antenna facilities (other than those proposed
for local business utilization) shall be engineered, designed and constructed
to be capable of sharing the facility with other applicants, to collocate with
other existing tower and antenna facilities and to accommodate the future
collocation of other tower and antenna facilities. A permit for a tower shall
not being issued until the applicant proposing a new tower and antenna facility
shall demonstrate that it has made a reasonable good faith attempt to locate
its antenna facility on an existing structure. Competitive conflict and
financial burden alone are not deemed to be adequate reasons against
collocation.
         (b)   All towers and antenna facilities (other than those proposed for
local business utilization) with a support structure up to a height of 150 feet
shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate at least three antenna
arrays. All towers and antenna facilities with support structures 150 feet or
greater in height shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate at least
four antenna arrays.
         (c)   Collocation agreements. All applicants for towers and antenna
facilities (other than those proposed for local business utilization) are
required to submit a statement with the application for a zoning permit
agreeing to allow and reasonably market collocation opportunities to other
tower and antenna facility users. The statement shall include the applicant's
policy regarding collocation of other providers and the methodology to be used
by the applicant in determining reasonable rates to be charged other providers.
      (16)    A proposal for a new wireless communication tower shall not be
approved unless the equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be
accommodated on existing or approved towers, buildings or alternative
structures within a one-mile search radius of the proposed wireless
communications facility due to one or more of the following reasons:
         (a)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing or approved tower, building or structures, as documented by a
qualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer, and the existing
or approved tower, building or structure cannot be reinforced, modified or
replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.
         (b)   The planned equipment would cause interference materially
impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower,
building or other structure as documented by a qualified and licensed North
Carolina professional engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost.
         (c)   Existing or approved towers, buildings or other structures
within the search radius, or combinations thereof, cannot accommodate the
planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by
a qualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer.
         (d)   Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the
planned telecommunication equipment upon an existing or approved tower,
building or other structure.
      (17)   All applications for wireless communications towers shall include
the following:
         (a)   The name, address, and telephone number of the owner and lessee

DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
§ 157.150 OFF-STREET PARKING AND OFF-STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Required number. Off-street parking space (either garage or properly
graded open space) shall be provided in accordance with §
157.151. In cases where different parking and/or loading requirements are
specified in §
157.135, Provisions for Special Uses, those ratios shall have precedence over
the parking requirements specified in this section.
   (B)   Parking, stacking and loading space required. If a change in use
causes an increase in the required number of off-street parking, stacking or
loading spaces, such additional spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter; except that if the change in use would require an
increase of less than 5% in the required number of parking spaces, no
additional off-street parking shall be required. If existing land uses are
converted to another type of land use or re-classified by this chapter, then
the off-street ratios as contained herein must be complied with.
   (C)   Parking compliance and certificate of occupancy. The certificate of
occupancy/compliance for the use of any building, structure or land where off-
street parking or loading space is required shall be withheld by the Pasquotank
County Building Inspector until provisions of this section are fully met. If at
any time such compliance ceases, any certificate of occupancy/ compliance which
shall have been issued for the use of the property shall immediately become
void and of no effect.
   (D)   Handicapped spaces. Spaces for the physically handicapped shall be
provided as required by the NC Building Code.
   (E)   Maintenance. All parking, stacking, and loading facilities shall be
permanently maintained by the owners or occupants as long as the use they serve
exists.
     (F)   Access. All parking, stacking and loading facilities shall have
vehicular access to a public street or approved private street. Where parking
or loading areas are provided adjacent to a public street, ingress or egress
thereto shall be made only through driveways or openings not exceeding 25 feet
in width at the curb line of said street, except where the Administrator or
Enforcement Officer finds that a greater width is necessary to accommodate the
vehicles customarily using the driveway. Upon the recommendation of the
Technical Review Committee, driveways shall not be closer than 100 feet to an
existing intersection.
   (G)   Number of parking spaces and stacking spaces required.
      (1)   The minimum number of required off-street parking and stacking
spaces is indicated in §
157.151.
      (2)   Whenever the number of parking spaces required by §
157.151 results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-
half or less may be disregarded while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be
counted as one parking space.
      (3)   For any use not specifically listed in §
157.151, the parking and stacking requirements shall be those of the most
similar listed use, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (4)   The parking spaces required by this chapter may not be used for any
purpose other than parking.
      (5)   Sales, storage, repair, dismantling and service of motor vehicles
shall not be permitted within required parking areas, including parking spaces
and drive aisles.
      (6)   Lots containing more than one use must provide parking and loading
areas in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.
   (H)   Design standards for parking, stacking and loading areas.

and access drives;   
         (c)   Maximize sight distances from parking lot exits and access
drives; and
         (d)   Allow off-street parking spaces in parking lots to have access
from parking lot driveways and not directly from streets. No parking, other
than those used for residential uses, shall be provided that would necessitate
an automobile backing onto any street right-of-way.   
         (e)   Minimize the impact on drainage facilities. No parking space or
loading area shall be located within a drainage easement. Driveways may be
located across drainage easements where needed to provide access to a right-of-
way.
      (2)   Dimensional requirements.
         (a)   Parking space dimensions shall be a minimum of ten feet by 20
feet.
         (b)   Drive aisles shall be a minimum of 12 feet for one-way traffic
and 24 feet for two-way traffic.
         (c) Stacking spaces shall be 12 feet by 20 feet.
      (3)   Improvements.
         (a)   Paving.
            1.   Required parking spaces, access drives, and loading areas
shall be graded, paved and maintained with concrete, asphalt, or similar
material of sufficient thickness and consistency to support anticipated traffic
volumes and weights. However, upon the approval of the TRC, access drives, and
loading areas may be surface with either a permeable (turf block) or semi-
permeable gravel, cobble stone or a semi-permeable tar/gravel mixture)
material. Such materials shall provide a durable and dustless surface, minimize
runoff, and dispose of accumulated water.
               a.   Where permeable or semi-permeable materials are used, a
retaining border, such as concrete curbing or other suitable material, shall be
provided around parking lot area edges to aid in stabilizing the surface
material.
               b.   Parking lots shall not drain onto adjacent property except
in approved stormwater retention facilities or drainage easements.
            2.   Paved aprons for access drives shall be installed and
maintained from the right-of-way to a point at least ten feet beyond the right-
of-way line for all parking and loading facilities, whether paved or unpaved.
            3.   Paving shall not be required for the following uses provided
they are constructed with a permeable (turf block) or semi-permeable(gravel,
cobble stone or a semi-permeable tar/gravel mixture) surface:
               a.   Parking facilities used on an irregular basis for churches,
private clubs or other similar nonprofit organizations.

lot, except where it is determined by the TRC that such system is not practical
for storm drainage purposes. Where gravel parking lots are permitted, cross
ties shall be provided around the perimeter of the parking lot.
            5.   All parking facilities shall be graded, properly drained,
stabilized, and maintained to minimize dust and erosion.
            6.   All parking spaces and stacking lanes shall be clearly
identified with paint lines, bumper guards, curbs, or similar treatment.
            7.   All parking spaces shall be provided with wheel guards or
curbs located so that no part of the parked vehicle will extend beyond the
property line or encroach more than two feet into a required planting area.
            8.   Concrete pads for stationary refuse containers shall be
provided beneath and in the approach to each container.
            9.   Parking lots shall be designed and constructed such that
walkways shall maintain a minimum unobstructed width of four feet (vehicle
encroachment is calculated as two feet beyond curb).
   (I)   Off-site parking. When required off-street parking is permitted to be
located off-site, it shall begin within 200 feet of the lot containing the
principal use.
   (J)   Combined parking. 
      (1)   Separate uses. The required parking for separate or mixed uses may
be combined in one facility.   
      (2)   Shared parking. A maximum of 50% of the parking spaces required for
a church, theatre, auditorium or assembly hall or other similar use may also
serve as required spaces for another use located on the same lot. Shared spaces
may also be located off-site as allowed in this section. In either case, the
Zoning Administrator must determine that the various activities will have peak
parking demand at different periods of the day or week. Otherwise, no off-
street parking required for one building or use shall be applied toward the
requirements of any other building or use.   
      (3)   Reassignment. Required off-street parking spaces shall not be
leased or otherwise assigned to another use except as provided in division (2)
above.
   (K)   Loading areas.
      (1)   Location. Off-street loading areas shall be located on lots with
the same zoning classification as the use they serve.

NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
§ 157.170 DEFINITIONS.
    Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the terms defined below are
used in this subchapter in the following manner:
   DIMENSIONAL NONCONFORMITY. A nonconforming situation that occurs when the
height, size, or minimum floor space of a structure or the relationship between
an existing building or buildings and other buildings or lot lines does not
conform to the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is
located.
   EXPENDITURE. A sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to
fulfill some obligation. Whenever the term is used hereafter, it also includes
binding, contractual commitments to make further expenditures, as well as any
other substantial changes in position.
   NONCONFORMING LOT. A lot existing at the effective date of this chapter or
any amendment to it (and not created for the purpose of evading the
restrictions of this chapter) that cannot meet the minimum area or lot-width
requirements of the district in which the lot is located.
   NONCONFORMING PROJECT. Any structure, development, or undertaking that is
incomplete at the effective date of this chapter and would be inconsistent with
any regulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed
as proposed or planned.
   NONCONFORMING SITUATION. A situation that occurs when, on the effective date
of this chapter or any amendment to it, an existing lot or structure or use of
an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the regulations
applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located. Among
other possibilities, a non-conforming situation may arise because a lot does
not meet minimum acreage requirements, because structures do not satisfy
maximum height or minimum floor-space limitations, because the relationship
between existing buildings and the land (in such matters as density and setback
requirements) is not in conformity with this chapter or because land or
buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by this chapter.
   NONCONFORMING USE. A nonconforming situation that occurs when property is
used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations
applicable to the district in which the property is located. (For example, a
commercial office building in a residential district may be a nonconforming
use.) The term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the
property. (For example, all the activity associated with running a bakery in a
residentially zoned area is a nonconforming use.)
   THIS CHAPTER. Includes any amendments. Whenever the effective date of this
chapter is referred to, the reference includes the effective date of any
amendment to it.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.171 CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS AND COMPLETION OF
NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.
   (A)    Nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective
date of this chapter may be continued, subject to the restrictions and
qualifications set forth in §§
157.172 through
157.177.
   (B)   Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the
provisions of §
157.177.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.172 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)    When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the
regulations (other than the area or width requirements) applicable to the
district in which the lot is located, such a use may be made as of right.
Otherwise, the nonconforming lot may be used only in accordance with a use
permit issued by the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall issue such a permit
if it finds that (i) the proposed use is one permitted by the regulations
applicable to the district in which the property is located, and (ii) the
property can be developed as proposed without any significant negative impact
on the surrounding property or the public health, safety, or welfare. In
issuing the permit authorized by this paragraph, the Board may allow deviations
from applicable dimensional requirements (such as setback lines and yard size
minimums) if it finds that no reasonable use of the property can be made
without such deviations.
   (B)   Whenever this chapter creates a nonconforming lot and the owner of the
nonconforming lot also owns land adjacent to it, and a portion of this other
land can be combined with the nonconforming lot to create a conforming lot
(without hereby creating other nonconformities), the owner of the nonconforming
lot, or his successor in interest, may not take advantage of the provisions of
division (A) of this section.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.173 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   (A)    Except as specifically provided in this section, it shall be unlawful
for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent
of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation.
   (B)   Subject to division (D) of this section, a nonconforming use may be
extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was
made nonconforming by this chapter, was manifestly designed or arranged to
accommodate such use. However, subject to §
157.177 of this subchapter (authorizing the completion on nonconforming
projects in certain circumstances), a nonconforming use may not be extended to
additional buildings or to land outside the original building.
   (C)   Subject to §
157.177 of this chapter (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects
in certain circumstances), a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended
to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming.
   (D)   The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a
nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes
used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if
these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity
rather than changes in kind of activity and no violations of other paragraphs
of this section occur.
   (E)   Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures
on open land are unlawful if they result in:
      (1)   An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming
use;
      (2)   Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such
as yard requirements, height limitations, or density requirements; or
      (3)   The enclosure of previously unenclosed area, even though those
areas were previously used in connection with the nonconforming activity. An
area is unenclosed unless at least 75% of the perimeter of the area is marked
by a permanently constructed wall or fence.
   (F)   Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where
nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major renovations
-- i.e., work estimated to cost more than 10% of the appraised value of the
structure to be renovated (and not required by the partial or total destruction
of a structure [see division (H) below of this section] -- may be done pursuant
to a special use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of
Adjustment shall issue such a permit if it finds that the work will not result
in a violation of any other divisions of this section (particularly division
(C)) or make the property more incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
   (G)   Notwithstanding division (E) above, any structure used for single-
family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be
replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the replacement
does not create new nonconformities with respect to yard size and setback
requirements. In particular, a manufactured/mobile home may be replaced with a
larger manufactured/mobile home, and a "single-wide" manufactured/mobile home
may be replaced with a "double-wide." This paragraph is subject to the
limitations stated in §
157.175 on abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations.
   (H)   A structure that is nonconforming in any respect or a structure that
is used in a nonconforming manner may be reconstructed or replaced if partially
or totally destroyed, subject to the following restrictions:
      (1)   The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use may not be
increased, except that a larger, single-family residential structure may be
constructed in place of a smaller one and a larger manufactured/mobile home
intended for residential use may replace a smaller one;
      (2)    The reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with
respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements, height
limitations, or density requirements, and such dimensional nonconformities must
be eliminated if they can reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening
the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming
use of such building;
      (3)   The reconstructed building may not enclose areas that were
previously unenclosed, even though those areas were used in connection with the
nonconforming activity. An area is unenclosed unless at least 75% or more of
the perimeter of the area is marked by a permanently constructed wall or fence.
      (4)   Except for single-family residential structures (including mobile
homes), if the estimated cost of the reconstruction work exceeds 10% of the
appraised value of the structure, the work may be done only after issuance of a
special use permit by the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall issue the permit
if it finds that the work will be done in accordance with this paragraph and
that the reconstructed building will not make the property more incompatible
with the surrounding property than it was before the destruction occurred.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.174 CHANGE IN KIND OF NONCONFORMING USE.
   (A)    A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use. Thereafter,
the property may not revert to a nonconforming use.
   (B)   A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use only
in accordance with a use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment. The Board
shall issue such a permit if it finds that the proposed use will be more
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the
time the application is made for the permit. If a nonconforming use is changed
to any use other than a conforming use without obtaining a special use permit
pursuant to this division (B) that change shall constitute a discontinuance of
the nonconforming use, with consequences as stated in §
157.175 of this subchapter.
   (C)   If a nonconforming use and a conforming use, or any combination of
conforming and nonconforming uses, or any combination of nonconforming uses
exist on one lot, the use made of the property may be changed substantially
(except to a conforming use), only in accordance with a use permit issued by
the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall issue such a permit if it finds that
the proposed use will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than
the use or combination of uses in operation at the time the permit is applied
for.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.175 ABANDONMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   (A)    When a nonconforming use is (i) discontinued for a consecutive period
of 180 days, or (ii) discontinued for any period of time without a present
intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may
thereafter be used only for conforming purposes, except as provided in division
(B) of this section. Present intention to reinstate the use shall not be
considered if the abandoned property lacks maintenance or continuity of public
services such as water, electricity, and trash removal.
   (B)   The Board of Adjustment may issue a special use permit to allow a
nonconforming use that has been discontinued for more than 180 consecutive days
to be reinstated if it finds that (i) the nonconforming use has been
discontinued for less than two years, and (ii) the discontinuance resulted from
factors that, for all practical purposes, were beyond the control of the person
maintaining the nonconforming use.
   (C)   If the principle activity on property where a nonconforming situation
other than a nonconforming use exists is (i) discontinued for a consecutive
period of 180 days, or (ii) discontinued for any period of time without a
present intention of resuming that activity, then that property may thereafter
be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the
district in which the property is located, unless the Board of Adjustment
issues a special use permit to allow the property to be used (for a
nonconforming purpose) without correcting the nonconforming situation. The
Board shall issue such a permit if it finds that the nonconforming situation
cannot be corrected without undue hardship or expense, and the nonconforming
situation is of a minor nature that does not adversely affect the surrounding
property or the general public to any significant extent.
   (D)   For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a
nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings,
activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally considered as a
whole. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a
conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period
shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter.
   (E)   When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is
vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this chapter, the 180-day
period for purposes of this section begins to run at the effective date of this
chapter.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.176 TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
    Subject to all other terms and conditions of §§
157.170 through
157.177 of this chapter, nonconforming situations shall not be subject to
specific time limitations for permanent discontinuation.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.177 COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.
   (A)    All work on any nonconforming project for which a permit has not been
issued shall cease on the effective date of this chapter. Thereafter, work on
nonconforming projects may begin, or may continue, only pursuant to a special
use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment (except as provided in division
(A)(2) of this section). The Board shall issue such a permit if it finds that
the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred
substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some
substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land-use law as it existed before
the effective date of this chapter and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced
if not allowed to complete his project as proposed. In considering whether
these findings may be made, the Board shall be guided by the following:
      (1)   To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable
effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those
expenditures. For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having
made expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property
obtained is just as valuable under the new classification as it was under the
old, for the expenditure can be recovered by resale of the property.
      (2)   An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant
both in dollar amount and in terms of the total estimated cost of the proposed
project, and the ordinary business practices of the developer.
      (3)   A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual
knowledge of a proposed adoption of land-use law affecting the proposed
development site could not be attributed to him.
      (4)   Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed adoption of
land-use law affecting a development site, the Board may still find that he
acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate
attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance. The Board may find
that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed
ordinance if it determines that:
         (a)   At the time the expenditures were made, either there was
considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed, or
it was not clear that the proposed Ordinance would prohibit the intended
development; and
         (b)   The developer had legitimate business reasons for making
expenditures.
   (B)   The requirements of division (A) of this section shall not apply to a
nonconforming project if the Zoning Enforcement Officer certifies that actual
construction of that project began at least 180 days before the effective date
of this chapter and that the work is at least 75% complete at the effective
date of this chapter.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment shall not consider any application for the
special use permit authorized by division (A)(1) of this section that is
submitted more than 90 days after the effective date of this chapter, unless it
waives this requirement for good cause shown.
   (D)   If the Board of Adjustment issues a special use permit pursuant to
division (A) of this section, it may attach such reasonable conditions to the
permit as it finds necessary to reduce the extent to which the nonconforming
project is incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood. In particular, the
Board may require that work on the nonconforming project be continuously
maintained, if possible, and that the project be completed as expeditiously as
possible.
   (E)   When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that the
nonconforming project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in
stages, segments, or other discrete units, the Board of Adjustment shall not
allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or completed in a fashion
that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to allow the developer to
recoup and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the expenditures he has made
in connection with that nonconforming project.

(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.192 SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (A)   No zoning certificate or building permit shall be issued until a site
plan has been approved for the development. A site plan shall not be required
if an adequate site plan is already on file, there is no change in the parking
requirements, or there is no increase in impervious surface area.
    (B)   Additions to existing buildings that exceed 10% of the gross floor
area of the building or require an additional five or more parking spaces shall

that he is unwilling to revise the site plan, it shall be deemed denied.
   (E)   Copies of all required state permits must be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator prior to the approval of a site plan.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.193 ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   (A)   No building or structure or any part thereof designed or intended to
be used for other than bona fide farm or agricultural purposes shall be erected
or repaired until a zoning certificate or certificate of occupancy therefore
has been issued by the Enforcement Officer.
   (B)   Each application for a zoning certificate or building permit shall be
accompanied by a plat, showing accurate dimensions of the lot to be built upon,
accurate dimension of the building to be erected, its location on the lot, and
such other information as may be necessary to provide for the enforcement of
this chapter such as evidence of the County Sanitarian's approval of the sewage
disposal system. A careful record of such applications and plats, together with
a record of the action taken thereon shall be kept in the Office of the
Pasquotank County Planning & Inspections. An application fee established by the
County Commissioners shall be paid to the county to cover necessary
administrative costs.
   (C)   No permit for excavation for or erection of any building or part of a
building, or for repairs to or alteration of a building, or the relocation of a

use has been determined to be in compliance with the provisions of this
chapter. A like certificate shall be issued for the purpose of changing any
existing use, as well as for maintaining, renewing, changing, or extending any
nonconforming use. A certificate of occupancy/compliance for the whole or part
of a building, shall be applied for prior to occupancy and shall be issued
within five days after the erection of alterations of such building or part
shall have been found in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and
other applicable codes and ordinances. A record of all such certificates shall
be kept on file in the Office of the Pasquotank County Planning & Inspections
and shall be furnished on request, to any person having a proprietary or
tenancy interest in the building or land.

§ 157.196 COMPLIANCE WITH STATE GUIDELINES FOR AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN.
    Prior to issuance of any initial zoning permit, zoning change permit, or
special use permit, the zoning enforcement officer and local AEC Permit Officer
in consultation with the State AEC Field Consultant, shall determine whether
the proposed use or structure is located within an area of environmental
concern. this determination shall result from an on-site investigation. if the
proposed use or structure is located in an area of environmental concern, the
Zoning Enforcement Officer and local AEC Permit Officer shall certify that the
proposed use or structure complies with development standards of the State
Guidelines for Areas of Environmental Concern prior to issuing any zoning
permit.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.197 VESTED RIGHTS.
   (A)   Site-specific vesting plan. A site-specific vesting plan consists of a
plan submitted in which the applicant requests vesting pursuant to this
section, describing with reasonable certainty on the plan the type and
intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The plan may be
in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or approvals:
a subdivision plat, a preliminary or general development plan, a special use
permit, or any other land-use approval designation as may be utilized by the
county. Unless otherwise expressly provided by the county, the plan shall
include the approximate boundaries of the site; significant topographical and
other natural features affecting development of the site; the approximate
location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and other
improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed
buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all existing
and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and
pedestrian walkways. What constitutes a site-specific vesting plan under this
section that would trigger a vested right shall be finally determined by the
county pursuant to a development regulation, and the document that triggers the
vesting shall be so identified at the time of its approval. A variance does not
constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and approval of a site-specific
vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained does not confer a
vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch
plan or other document fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and
intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may not
constitute a site-specific vesting plan.
   (B)   Establishment of vested right. A vested right is established with
respect to any property upon the valid approval, or conditional approval, of a
site-specific vesting plan as provided in this section. Such a vested right
confers upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development
and use of the property under the terms and conditions of the site-specific
vesting plan, including any amendments thereto.
   (C)   Approval and amendment of plans.  
      (1)   If a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by
this chapter, the county shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required
for that underlying approval. A duration of the underlying approval that is
less than two years does not affect the duration of the site-specific vesting
plan established under this section. If the site-specific vesting plan is not
based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice as required by
G.S. § 160D-602 shall be held.
      (2)   The county may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms
and conditions that may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare. Conditional approval results in a vested right, although
failure to abide by the terms and conditions of the approval will result in a
forfeiture of vested rights. A site-specific vesting plan is deemed approved
upon the effective date of the county's decision approving the plan or another
date determined by the Board of Commissioners upon approval. An approved site-
specific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the approval of
the owner and the county as follows: any substantial modification must be
reviewed and approved in the same manner as the original approval; minor
modifications may be approved by staff, if such are defined and authorized by
the zoning ordinance.
   (D)   Continuing review. Following approval or conditional approval of a
site-specific vesting plan, the county may make subsequent reviews and require
subsequent approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the
original approval, provided that these reviews and approvals are not
inconsistent with the original approval. The county may, pursuant to G.S. §
160D-403(f), revoke the original approval for failure to comply with applicable
terms and conditions of the original approval or the applicable chapter
regulations.
   (E)   Duration and termination of vested right.
      (1)   A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan remains vested for
a period of two years. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or
modifications to a site-specific vesting plan unless expressly provided by the
local government.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (E)(1) above, the county
may provide for rights to be vested for a period exceeding two years but not
exceeding five years where warranted in light of all relevant circumstances,
including, but not limited to, the size and phasing of development, the level
of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles, and market
conditions or other considerations. These determinations are in the sound
discretion of the county and shall be made following the process specified for
the particular form of a site-specific vesting plan involved in accordance with
division (A) of this section.
      (3)   Upon issuance of a building permit, the provisions of G.S. § 160D-
1111 and G.S. § 160D-1115 apply, except that a permit does not expire and shall
not be revoked because of the running of time while a vested right under this
section is outstanding.
      (4)   A right vested as provided in this section terminates at the end of
the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no
valid building permit applications have been filed.
   (F)   Subsequent changes prohibited; exceptions.
      (1)   A vested right, once established as provided for in this section,
precludes any zoning action by the county which would change, alter, impair,
prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as
set forth in an approved site-specific vesting plan, except under one or more
of the following conditions:
         (a)   With the written consent of the affected landowner.
         (b)   Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary
hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of
the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health,
safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site-
specific vesting plan.
         (c)   To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation
for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including,
but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all
architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consulting fees incurred
after approval by the county, together with interest as provided under G.S. §
160D-106. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the
property which is caused by the action.
         (d)   Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary
hearing, that the landowner or the landowner's representative intentionally
supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations that made a
difference in the approval by the county of the site-specific vesting plan or
the phased development plan.
         (e)   Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or
regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site-specific
vesting plan or the phased development plan, in which case the county may
modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or
federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and
an evidentiary hearing.
      (2)   The establishment of a vested right under this section does not
preclude the application of overlay zoning or other development regulations
which impose additional requirements but do not affect the allowable type or
intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and
are applicable to all property subject to development regulation by the county,
including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and
mechanical codes. Otherwise applicable new regulations become effective with
respect to property which is subject to a site-specific vesting plan upon the
expiration or termination of the vesting rights period provided for in this
section.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of
a vested right does not preclude, change, or impair the authority of the county
to adopt and enforce development regulations governing nonconforming situations
or uses.

provisions of this chapter originating from within the area encompassed by the
legal description of the jurisdiction of this chapter as described in §
157.015.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.212 RULES FOR PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
    The Board shall adopt rules governing its organization and for all
proceedings before it. Such rules shall provide and require the following in
addition to such other rules and regulations the Board shall adopt:
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment/Planning Board shall elect a Chairman and
Vice-Chairman on an annual basis.
   (B)   The County Planning Director or his designee shall serve as the
Secretary of the Board. The Secretary shall keep minutes of the proceedings.

abstention from voting and attendance.
   (C)   A member of the Board or any other body exercising the functions of a
Board of Adjustment shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial
matter in a manner that would violate affected persons' constitutional rights
to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible conflicts include, but are not
limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is
not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close
familial, business, or other associational relationship with an affected
person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection
is raised to a member's participation and that member does not recuse himself
or herself, the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
   (D)   Boards shall follow quasi-judicial procedures in determining appeals
of administrative decisions, special use permits, certificates of

all applications, reports, and written materials relevant to the matter being
considered. The administrative materials may be distributed to the members of
the Board prior to the hearing if at the same time they are distributed to the
Board a copy is also provided to the appellant or applicant and to the
landowner if that person is not the appellant or applicant. The administrative
materials shall become a part of the hearing record. The administrative
materials may be provided in written or electronic form. Objections to
inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials may be made before or during
the hearing. Rulings on unresolved objections shall be made by the Board at the
hearing.
   (H)   (1)   The applicant, the local government, and any person who would
have standing to appeal the decision under G.S. Chapter 160D shall have the
right to participate as a party at the evidentiary hearing. Other witnesses may
present competent, material, and substantial evidence that is not repetitive as
allowed by the Board.
      (2)   Objections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary issues,
including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal or the standing of a
party, may be made to the Board. The Board Chair shall rule on any objections,
and the Chair's rulings may be appealed to the full Board. These rulings are
also subject to judicial review pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D. Objections based
on jurisdictional issues may be raised for the first time on judicial review.
   (I)   The official who made the decision or the person currently occupying
that position, if the decision maker is no longer employed by the local
government, shall be present at the evidentiary hearing as a witness. The
appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in a notice of
appeal. If any party or the local government would be unduly prejudiced by the
presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board shall
continue the hearing.
   (J)   The Chair of the Board or any member acting as Chair and the Clerk to
the Board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter coming
before the Board. Any person who, while under oath during a proceeding before
the Board determining a quasi-judicial matter, willfully swears falsely is
guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
   (K)   Subpoenas. The Board making a quasi-judicial decision under this
chapter through the Chair or, in the Chair's absence, anyone acting as Chair
may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request
issuance of a subpoena, the applicant, the local government, and any person
with standing under G.S. Chapter 160D may make a written request to the Chair
explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be
compelled. The Chair shall issue requested subpoenas he or she determines to be
relevant, reasonable in nature and scope, and not oppressive. The Chair shall
rule on any motion to quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas
made by the Chair may be immediately appealed to the full Board. If a person
fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this division (K), the
Board or the party seeking the subpoena may apply to the General Court of
Justice for an order requiring that its subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall
have jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all proper parties.
   (L)   When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D or any other
appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record
below, and the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. Chapter 160D.
   (M)   The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board shall be necessary to
grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any
other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of
certiorari. For the purposes of this division (M), vacant positions on the
Board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter
under G.S. § 160D-109(d) shall not be considered members of the Board for
calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates
available to take the place of such members.
   (N)   The Board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within
a reasonable time. When hearing an appeal, the Board may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any
order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The Board
shall have all the powers of the official who made the decision. Every quasi-
judicial decision shall be based upon competent, material, and substantial
evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision shall be reduced to
writing, reflect the Board's determination of contested facts and their
application to the applicable standards, and be approved by the Board and
signed by the Chair or other duly authorized member of the Board. A quasi-
judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the clerk
to the Board or such other office or official as the development regulation
specifies. The decision of the Board shall be delivered within a reasonable
time by personal delivery, electronic mail, or first-class mail to the
applicant, landowner, and any person who has submitted a written request for a
copy prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person required to
provide notice shall certify to the local government that proper notice has
been made, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of
fraud.
   (O)   Judicial review. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to
review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari
pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D. Appeals shall be filed within the times
specified in G.S. Chapter 160D.
   (P)   Fees for filing appeals to the Board of Adjustment shall be
established by the Board of Commissioners, in order to cover necessary
administrative costs and advertising expense. Applications to the Board of
Adjustment may be withdrawn at any time. Application fees are nonrefundable.
   (Q)   Submittals for review by the Board of Adjustment shall be presented to
the appropriate county officials 30 days prior to the regularly scheduled Board
of Adjustment meeting.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.213 POWERS OF BOARD.
   (A)   Review of enforcement officers' decision. Where it is alleged that
there is any error in any order, decision, or requirements of the Enforcement
Officers appointed by the Board of Commissioners, the Board shall have the
power to hear and decide any appeal taken from the order, decision or
requirements, of the Enforcement Officer(s) and to grant a variance to the
appellant to rectify any error of the Enforcement Officer. A concurring vote of
four members of the Board shall be required to reverse any order, decision, or
determination of the Enforcement Officer or to decide in favor of the applicant
any matter which the Board is required to pass under the provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   Variance.
      (1)   A variance may be granted to authorize, upon appeal in specific
cases, such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to
the public interest where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that
the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. In
considering all proposed variances to this chapter, the Board shall, before
making any finding in a specified case, first determine that the proposed
variances will not constitute any change in the district boundaries shown on
the zoning map and will not impair any adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property, or adversely affect the use or physical attributes of
property within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided
that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.
      (3)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
      (4)   Before a variance is granted, the Board of Adjustment shall make
the following findings:
         (a)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of
the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of
the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
         (b)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
         (c)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant
or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
         (d)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose,
and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured and substantial
justice is achieved.
      (5)   The Board may grant a variance in the dimensional yard requirements
of this chapter only where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or
shape of a specific piece of property which was a lot of record as of the
effective date of this chapter, or where due to the topographical conditions of
a piece of property the strict application of the said dimensional requirements
of this chapter would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship
of such nature as described in the preceding paragraph.
      (6)   The fact that property may be utilized more profitably will not be
considered as a justification for granting a variance by the Board.
      (7)   The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board of Adjustment shall
be necessary to grant a variance. For the purposes of this division, vacant
positions on the Board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-
judicial matter under G.S. § 160D-109(d) shall not be considered members of the
Board for calculation of the requisite majority.
   (C)   Additional power. In addition to the general powers conferred upon the
Board in the foregoing, the Board shall have authority to make the following
exception to the general provisions of this chapter:
      Where a use district boundary line crosses a lot, the Board, after a
public hearing in which it has determined that the spirit and intent of this
chapter has been carried out, may permit a use of either classification on the
whole lot, but not to exceed a distance of 150 feet from the boundary line. In
addition, the remaining parcel shall not be less than the minimum required for
the district in which it is located.
   (D)   Recommendations to Planning Board and Board of Commissioners. The
Board shall make recommendations to the Board of Commissioners for any changes
in this chapter that are in the best interest of the county and the general
public.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.214 APPEAL TO THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   Appeals from the enforcement and interpretation of this chapter and
appeals for variances may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any person
aggrieved by a decision of any officer, department, board or bureau of the
county. Notice of an appeal to the Board of Adjustment shall be filed with the
Enforcement Officer within 30 from receipt of the written notice of the
interpretation and enforcement of this chapter by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer. Any other person with standing to appeal has 30 days from receipt from
any source of actual or constructive notice of the determination within which
to file an appeal. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given
pursuant to this section by first-class mail is deemed received on the third
business day following deposit of the notice for mailing with the United States
Postal Service.
   (B)   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of action appealed
from, unless the Enforcement Officer files a certificate stating that by
reasons of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion,
interfere with enforcement of this chapter because the violation is transitory
in nature, or would cause imminent peril to life and property. The Enforcement
Officer shall have one copy of said certificate delivered by registered mail or
by personal service to the appellant and to each member to the Board within ten
calendar days from the date the appeal is filed with the Enforcement Officer.
The certificate shall also be placed on file in the office of the Enforcement
Officer for public inspection and recorded in the minutes of the next meeting
of the Board. Where said certificate is filed by the Enforcement Officer,
proceedings in furtherance of the original order shall not be stayed otherwise
than a restraining order which may be granted by a court of record within the
county. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with
the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board
shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after the request is filed.
   (C)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, appeals of
decisions granting a development approval or otherwise affirming that a
proposed use of property is consistent with the development regulation does not
stay the further review of an application for development approvals to use the
property; in these situations, the appellant or local government may request
and the Board may grant a stay of a final decision of development approval
applications, including building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.215 APPEAL FROM DECISION OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
    Any person or persons aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Adjustment
may within 30 days or after a written copy thereof is given, but not
thereafter, present to the Superior Court of Pasquotank County a petition for a
writ of certiorari, duly verified, setting forth that such a decision is
illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of illegality, whereupon
such a decision of the Board shall be subject to review as provided by law.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
ADOPTION AND AMENDMENT PROCEDURE
§ 157.230 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The Board of Commissioners, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this subchapter, may adopt a zoning ordinance and zone property, and may amend
this chapter, which means amending the text of this chapter and rezoning
property (that is, amending the classifications of property appearing on the
official map of zoning districts). The Board shall adopt any amendments to
these development regulations by ordinance. Rezonings may require a
comprehensive plan amendment. The term AMENDMENT shall include amendments,
supplements, changes and modifications to, and repeals of, this chapter.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.231 PLANNING BOARD REVIEW.
   (A)   Before an amendment to this chapter may be adopted, it must be
presented or referred to the County Planning Board for the Planning Board's
recommendation. The Planning Board shall be given at least 30 days in which to
make a recommendation. Whenever territory is added to an existing designated
zoning area, it shall be treated as an amendment to this chapter for that area.
   (B)   When conducting a review of proposed zoning text or map amendments,
the Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed action is
consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other
officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning Board shall provide a
written recommendation to the governing board that addresses plan consistency
and other matters as deemed appropriate by the Planning Board, but a comment by
the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the
comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed
amendment by the Board of Commissioners. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as
a "large-scale rezoning" under G.S. Chapter 160D, the Planning Board statement
describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how
the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the
recommendation made.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.232 INITIATION OF AMENDMENTS.
    An amendment may be initiated by the Board of Commissioners, the Planning
Board, the Board of Adjustment, or by the petition of any owner of a legal or
equitable interest in land located in the county.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.233 AMENDMENT BY PETITION.
   (A)   A petition requesting an amendment shall be presented to the Planning
Board on a form prescribed by the Planning Board. The petition shall contain
such information, and shall be presented in such a manner as specified by the
Planning Board. The petition shall be submitted to the Pasquotank County
Planning Department 30 days prior to the regularly scheduled Planning Board
meeting. The Planning Board, after considering the petition, shall prepare a
recommendation to be considered by the Board of Commissioners. The
recommendation should contain all information considered by the Planning Board
in its deliberations and reasons for its recommendation. In cases of petitions
requesting rezoning of property or an amendment to the zoning ordinance text an
application fee established by the County Commissioners shall be paid by the
applicant to the County of Pasquotank to cover necessary administrative costs
prior to placement of the petition on any agenda of the Planning Board.
Petitions presented to the Planning Board may be withdrawn at any time.
Application fees are nonrefundable.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator shall cause a public notice to be published
identifying the nature of the petition and date, time, and place at which the
Planning Board will review the request. The notice shall be published in a
newspaper having general circulation in Pasquotank County at least ten days
prior to the scheduled Planning Board meeting. The notification may be in the
form of an item included on the Planning Board agenda.
   (C)   For zoning map amendments, the Zoning Administrator shall mail
individual notices, by first class mail, to the affected landowner, as shown on
the county tax listing, and to abutting property owners in all directions from
the affected parcel. Notices shall be deposited in the mail at least ten days
prior to the scheduled Planning Board meeting.
   (D)   If an amendment petition is denied by the Board of County
Commissioners, a rezoning petition similar to that denied for the same property
or a portion of the same property within one year of the Board's actions shall
not be accepted, except that:
      (1)   There has been a significant change in the zoning classification of
adjacent properties; or
      (2)   The Board of Commissioners has adopted a plan that changes public
policy regarding how the property affected by the amendment should be
developed; or
      (3)   Public facilities such as roads, water mains, sewer lines, or other
infrastructure are constructed or expanded to serve the property or to
accommodate the intensity of development allowed under the proposed
classification.
   Note: Change in ownership of the subject property does not qualify for an
exception to the one-year restriction.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.234 PUBLIC HEARING.
   (A)   Before amending this chapter, the Board of Commissioners shall hold a
public hearing on the amendment, at which parties interested in the proposed
amendment shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the hearing shall be
provided and the public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with this
subchapter. Upon receiving a recommendation from the Planning Board, the
Administrator shall coordinate with the County Manager's office the scheduling
of a public hearing and publication of a notice of the public hearing for any
amendment to this chapter.
   (B)   If any resident or property owner in the county submits a written
statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or repeal to a zoning
regulation, including a text or map amendment, to the Clerk to the Board at
least two business days prior to the proposed vote on such change, the Clerk to
the Board shall deliver such written statement to the Board of Commissioners.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.235 NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Mailed notice. For zoning map amendments, the owners of affected
parcels of land and the owners of all parcels of land abutting that parcel of
land shall be mailed a notice of the hearing on the proposed amendment by
first-class mail at the last addresses listed for such owners on the county tax
abstracts. For the purpose of this section, properties are "abutting" even if
separated by a street, railroad, or other transportation corridor. This notice
must be deposited in the mail at least ten but not more than 25 days prior to
the date of the hearing. The person or persons mailing such notices shall
certify the fact that the notices were duly mailed, and the date of mailing, to
the Board of Commissioners.
   (B)   Large-scale zoning map amendments. First-class mail notice shall not
be required if the zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning
designation of more than 50 properties, owned by at least 50 different property
owners, and if the county elects to use the expanded published notice provided
for in this division (B). In this instance, the county may elect to make the
mailed notice required of this section or, as an alternative, elect to publish
notice of the hearing as required by G.S. § 160D-601, provided that each
advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size. The
advertisement is effective only for property owners who reside in the area of
general circulation of the newspaper that publishes the notice. Property owners
who reside outside of the newspaper circulation area, according to the address
listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected property, shall
be notified by mailed notice.
   (C)   Posted notice. When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the local
government shall prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site proposed
for the amendment or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. The
notice shall be posted within the same time period specified for mailed notices
of the hearing. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning map
amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not required but the local
government shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to
interested persons.
   (D)   Published notice. For any public hearing, the County Zoning
Administrator shall cause a notice to be published in a newspaper having
general circulation in the county. The notice shall be published once a week
for two successive calendar weeks, and shall be published for the first time
not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the scheduled hearing date.
In computing such period, the day of publication shall not be counted, but the
day of the hearing shall be counted.
   (E)   Notice to military bases. If the adoption or modification would result
in changes to the zoning map or would change or affect the permitted uses of
land located five miles or less from the perimeter boundary of a military base,
the local government shall provide written notice of the proposed changes by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the commander of the military base
not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the
hearing. If the commander of the military base provides comments or analysis
regarding the compatibility of the proposed development regulation or amendment
with military operations at the base, the Board of Commissioners shall take the
comments and analysis into consideration before making a final determination on
the ordinance.
   (F)   Content of notices. All published and mailed notices for public
hearings shall identify the date, time, and place of the public hearing and the
nature and character of the proposed action.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.236 CONSISTENCY AND REASONABLENESS STATEMENTS.
   (A)   When adopting or rejecting a zoning text or map amendment, the Board
of Commissioners shall approve a brief statement describing whether its action
is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive plan. The
requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear
indication in the minutes of the Board that at the time of action on the
amendment the Board was aware of and considered the Planning Board's
recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive plan. If
a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with
the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending
any future land-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or
application for a plan amendment shall be required. A plan amendment and a
zoning amendment may be considered concurrently.
   (B)   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under
G.S. § 160D-602(b), the governing board statement describing plan consistency
may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in
the relevant adopted plans were considered in the action taken.
    (C)   Additional reasonableness statement for rezonings.  
      (1)   When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment,
a statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be
approved by the Board of Commissioners. This statement of reasonableness may
consider, among other factors:
         (a)   The size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the area
proposed to be rezoned;
         (b)   The benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors,
and the surrounding community;
         (c)   The relationship between the current actual and permissible
development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be
permissible under the proposed amendment;
         (d)   Why the action taken is in the public interest; and
         (e)   Any changed conditions warranting the amendment.
      (2)   If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning"
under G.S. Chapter 160D, the Board statement on reasonableness may address the
overall rezoning.
   (D)   Single statement permissible. The statement of reasonableness and the
plan consistency statement required by this section may be approved as a single
statement.
   (E)   Should a zoning map amendment be approved that is not consistent with
the Future Land Use Map, the Future Land Use Map shall be deemed amended. The
Zoning Administrator shall note the approved amendment on the Future Land Use
Map. If the Future Land Use Map was adopted as a CAMA plan, then the amendment
will not be deemed effective until the change is approved through the CAMA
plan-amendment process.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.237 PENDING APPLICATIONS.
   If an amendment is adopted while an application for development or zoning
approval is pending, the applicant may choose to comply with the original or
new version of the ordinance, pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.238 DOWN-ZONING.
   No amendment to the zoning ordinance or the official zoning map that down-
zones property shall be permitted without the written consent of all property
owners whose property is the subject of the down-zoning amendment, unless the
down-zoning amendment is initiated by the county. For purposes of this section,
DOWN-ZONING means a zoning ordinance that affects an area of land in one of the
following ways:
   (A)   By decreasing the development density of the land to be less dense
than was allowed under its previous usage.
   (B)   By reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in a
zoning ordinance or land development regulation to fewer uses than were allowed
under its previous usage.
(Ord. passed 6-21-2021)
§ 157.239 MORATORIA.
   (A)   Authority.  The Board of Commissioners may adopt temporary moratoria
on any development approval required by law, except for the purpose of
developing and adopting new or amended plans or development regulations
governing residential uses. The duration of any moratorium shall be reasonable
in light of the specific conditions that warrant imposition of the moratorium
and may not exceed the period of time necessary to correct, modify, or resolve
such conditions.
   (B)   Hearing required. Except in cases of imminent and substantial threat
to public health or safety, before adopting a development regulation imposing a
development moratorium with a duration of 60 days or any shorter period, the
Board of Commissioners shall hold a legislative hearing and shall publish a
notice of the hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the area not
less than seven days before the date set for the hearing. A development
moratorium with a duration of 61 days or longer, and any extension of a
moratorium so that the total duration is 61 days or longer, and any extension
of a moratorium so that the total duration is 61 days or longer, is subject to
the notice and hearing requirements of §
157.235.
   (C)   Exempt projects. Absent an imminent threat to public health or safety,
a development moratorium adopted pursuant to this section does not apply to any
project for which a valid building permit issued pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D
is outstanding, to any project for which a special use permit application has
been accepted as complete, to development set forth in a site-specific vesting
plan approved pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D, to development for which
substantial expenditures have already been made in good-faith reliance on a
prior valid development approval, or to preliminary or final subdivision plats
that have been accepted for review by the county prior to the call for a
hearing to adopt the moratorium. Any preliminary subdivision plat accepted for
review by the county prior to the call for a hearing, if subsequently approved,
shall be allowed to proceed with final plat approval without being subject to
the moratorium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a complete application for a
development approval has been submitted prior to the effective date of a
moratorium, G.S. § 160D-108(b) applies when permitting processing resumes.
   (D)   Required statements. Any development regulation establishing a
development moratorium must include, at the time of adoption, each of the
following:
      (1)   A statement of the problems or conditions necessitating the
moratorium and what courses of action, alternative to a moratorium, were
considered by the county and why those alternative courses of action were not
deemed adequate.
      (2)   A statement of the development approvals subject to the moratorium
and how a moratorium on those approvals will address the problems or conditions
leading to imposition of the moratorium.
      (3)   A date for termination of the moratorium and a statement setting
forth why that duration is reasonably necessary to address the problems or
conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
      (4)   A statement of the actions, and the schedule for those actions,
proposed to be taken by the local government during the duration of the
moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the
moratorium.
   (E)   Limit on renewal or extension. No moratorium may be subsequently
renewed or extended for any additional period unless the county has taken all
reasonable and feasible steps proposed to be taken in its ordinance
establishing the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to
imposition of the moratorium and unless new facts and conditions warrant an
extension. Any ordinance renewing or extending a development moratorium must
include, at the time of adoption, the findings set forth in divisions (D)(1)
through (D)(4) of this section, including what new facts or conditions warrant
the extension.
   (F)   Expedited judicial review. Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a
moratorium on development approvals required by law may apply to the General
Court of Justice for an order enjoining the enforcement of the moratorium.
Actions brought pursuant to this section shall be scheduled for expedited
hearing, and subsequent proceedings in those actions shall be accorded priority
by the trial and appellate courts. In such actions, the county has the burden
of showing compliance with the procedural requirements of this division (F).

$75 or a maximum 30 days imprisonment as provided by G.S. § 14-4.
   (B)   Any act constituting a violation of this chapter or a failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violations of any conditions and
safeguards established in connection with the grants of variances or special
use permits, shall subject the offender to a civil penalty of $50 for each day
the violation continues. If the offender fails to pay this penalty within 15
days after being cited for a violation, the penalty may be recovered by the
county in a civil action in the nature of debt. A civil penalty may not be
appealed to the Board of Adjustment if the offender was sent a final notice of
violation in accordance with §
157.190 and did not take an appeal to the Board of Adjustment within the
prescribed time stated in §
157.214.
   (C)   This chapter may also be enforced by any appropriate equitable action.
   (D)   Each day that any violation continues after notification by the
Enforcement Officer that such violation exists shall be considered a separate
offense for purposes of the penalties and remedies specified in this section.
   (E)   Any one, all, or any combination of the foregoing penalties and
remedies may be used to enforce this chapter.
