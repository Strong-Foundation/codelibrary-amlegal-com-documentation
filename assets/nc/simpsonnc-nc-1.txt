GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 33.01 WHEN DEEMED TO EXIST.
   A state of emergency shall be deemed to exist whenever, during times of
great public crisis, disaster, rioting, catastrophe or similar public
emergency, for any reason, the village public safety authorities are unable to
maintain public order or afford adequate protection for lives, safety or
property within the village.
(Prior Code, § 2-19)
§ 33.02 PROCLAMATION BY MAYOR; IMPOSITION OF CURFEW.
   In the event of an existing or threatened state of emergency endangering the
lives, safety, health or welfare of the people within the village or
threatening damage to or destruction of property, the Mayor is hereby
authorized and empowered to issue a public proclamation declaring to all
persons the existence of such state of emergency and, in order more effectively
to protect the lives, safety and property of people within the village, to
define and impose a curfew applicable to all persons within the jurisdiction of
the village.
(Prior Code, § 2-20)
§ 33.03 CURFEW; WHERE AND TO WHOM TO BE MADE APPLICABLE.
   The Mayor is hereby authorized and empowered to limit the application of
such a curfew to any specific area designated and described with the village
and to specific hours of day or night; and to exempt from the curfew police
officers, firefighters, doctors, nurses and such other classes of persons as
may be essential to the preservation of public order and immediately necessary
to serve the safety, health and welfare needs of the people with the village.
(Prior Code, § 2-21)
§ 33.04 CURFEW VIOLATION PROHIBITED.
   During the existence of a proclaimed state of emergency when a curfew has
been imposed, it shall be unlawful for anyone subject to such curfew:
   (A)   To be or travel upon any public street or upon public property, unless
in search of medical assistance, food or other commodity or service necessary
to sustain the well-being of himself or herself or his or her family or some
member thereof;
   (B)   To possess, off one’s own premises, buy, sell, give away or otherwise
transfer or dispose of any explosive, firearm, ammunition or dangerous weapon
of any kind;
   (C)   To sell beer, wine or intoxicating beverages of any kind, or to
possess or consume the same off one’s own premises;
   (D)   To sell gasoline or any other similar petroleum product, or any other
inflammable substance, except as expressly authorized by the provisions of the
curfew imposed; and
   (E)   To violate any other provision of such proclaimed curfew.
(Prior Code, § 2-22) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 33.05 TERMINATION OF EMERGENCY AND CURFEW.
   The Mayor shall proclaim the end of such state of emergency and the curfew
as soon as circumstances warrant or when directed to do so by the Village
Council.
(Prior Code, § 2-23)
CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT
§ 33.20 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   Because of existing possibility of an attack upon the United States of
unprecedented size and destructiveness, including the inevitable hazards of
radioactive contamination, and in order, in the event of such an attack, to
assure the continuation of effective, legally constituted leadership, authority
and responsibility in the offices of the government of the village, it is found
and declared by the Village Council to be necessary to provide for emergency
interim officers who can exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the
key executive, administrative, legislative and judicial offices of the village
in the event that the incumbents thereof are unable to perform the duties and
functions of their offices; and this subchapter is, therefore, enacted pursuant
to the authority conferred by G.S. Ch. 162B.
(Prior Code, § 2-24)
§ 33.21 SHORT TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Continuity of
Government Ordinance of the Village of Simpson”.
(Prior Code, § 2-25)
§ 33.22 DESIGNATION OF EMERGENCY INTERIM SUCCESSORS TO OFFICERS.
   Within 30 days following each general village election and after first
entering upon the duties of office, the Village Council shall, in addition to
any duly authorized deputy, designate such number of emergency interim
successors to village officers and specify their rank in order of succession
after any duly authorized deputy so that there will be not less than three duly
authorized deputies or emergency interim successors of combination thereof for
each duly elective and appointive office in the village government.

successor unless he or she may, under the Constitution and statutes of the
state, the Village Charter and this code, hold the office of the person to
whose powers and duties he or she is designated to succeed; but no provision of
this code or other ordinance prohibiting an officer or employee of the village
from holding another office shall be applicable to an emergency interim
successor.
(Prior Code, § 2-28)
   (B)   A person designated as an emergency interim successor holds that
designation at the pleasure of the designator; provided that, the person must
be replaced if removed. The person retains this designation as emergency
interim successor until replaced by another appointed by the authorized
designator.
(Prior Code, § 2-29)
§ 33.25 FILING AND PUBLICATION.
   The name and address in order of succession of each duly authorized deputy
and emergency interim successor shall be filed with the Village Clerk. The
Village Clerk shall keep on file all such data regarding duly authorized
deputies and emergency interim successors and it shall be open to public
inspection.
(Prior Code, § 2-30)
§ 33.26 NOTIFICATION OF OTHER PUBLIC AUTHORITIES.

the Secretary of State of this state, the Clerk of Superior Court of the county
and such other federal, state or municipal officers as may at any time be
designated by the Village Council, the Mayor, the Village Attorney or the
Village Clerk, on the basis of a possible need to know.
(Prior Code, § 2-31)
§ 33.27 INFORMATION FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS.
   The Village Clerk, within the capabilities and limitations of the office,
shall endeavor to collect and file information as to deputies and emergency
interim successors of the county and state government, and such federal
agencies, if any, with which the village transacts business.
(Prior Code, § 2-32)
§ 33.28 ASSUMPTION OF POWERS AND DUTIES OF PRINCIPAL BY EMERGENCY INTERIM
SUCCESSORS.
   If, in the event of an attack any officer named in §
33.23 of this chapter is unavailable, the senior available emergency interim
successor shall exercise the powers and discharge the duties or such officer.
An emergency interim successor shall exercise these powers and discharge these
duties only until such time as the lawful incumbent officer becomes available
or a successor is appointed to fill such vacancy or is elected and qualified as
provided by law.
(Prior Code, § 2-33)

GOLF CARTS
§ 71.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter shall be to establish a golf cart
ordinance within the village to promote the health, safety and welfare of
persons operating golf carts or carts within the village. Golf carts,
hereinafter sometimes referred to as “carts”, are not designed or manufactured
to be used on public streets and roads, and the village in no way advocates or
endorses their operation on streets and roads.
   (B)   The village, by regulating such operation, is merely trying to address
obvious safety issues, and adoption of this subchapter is not to be relied upon
as a determination that operation on streets or roads is safe or advisable if
done in accordance with this subchapter.
   (C)   All persons must be observant of, and attentive to, the safety of
themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists
and pedestrians.
   (D)   (1)   Any person who owns, operates or rides upon a golf cart on a
public street, road or highway within the village does so at his or her own
risk and peril and assumes all liability resulting from the operation of the
golf cart.
      (2)   The village has no liability under any theory of liability for
permitting carts to be operated on roads under special legislation granted by
the state legislature.
      (3)   Any person who operates a cart is responsible for procuring
liability insurance sufficient to cover the risk involved in using a cart on
the streets and roads of the village.
(Ord. 19-O-05, passed 10-21-2019)
§ 71.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. For
purposes of this subchapter, those definitions set out in G.S. § 20-4.01 shall
also apply throughout.
   DRIVER’S LICENSE. A valid license issued to operate a motor vehicle issued
by North Carolina or any other state.
   GOLF CART. Sometimes referred to as a CART, a vehicle designed and
manufactured for operation on a golf course for sporting or recreational
purposes and that is not capable of exceeding speeds of 20 mph. The definition
is republished here for convenience only and the definition set out in G.S. §
20-4.01(12b), as amended from time to time, is controlling for all purposes.
   OPERATOR. Only persons over 16 years of age and holding a valid driver’s
license may operate a golf cart.
(Ord. 19-O-05, passed 10-21-2019)
§ 71.03 RULES AND REGULATIONS; SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Carts may be driven on roads only from official sunrise to official

lights (one on each side of the rear of the golf cart) which are visible from a
distance of at least 500 feet.
   (B)   Carts must be equipped with:
      (1)   A rear vision mirror;
      (2)   A rear triangle reflector of the same type required by state law,
or a reflective “slow moving sign” or “flag” on the rear of the cart;
      (3)   The brakes provided by the manufacturer of the golf cart that are
in proper working order; and
      (4)   The golf cart must have all of the standard safety features
provided by the manufacturer and must not have been modified to exceed a speed
of 20 mph, nor otherwise modified in any way that creates a hazard regarding
the speed of the cart.
   (C)   No golf cart may be operated at a speed greater than reasonable and
prudent for the existing conditions, and in any instance at a speed greater
than 20 mph.
   (D)   Children must be properly seated while the golf cart is in motion and
may be not transported in a negligent manner.
   (E)   Cart drivers must have a valid driver’s license issued in their names

   (F)   Cart drivers shall stay to the far right of the traveled portion of
the road and yield the right-of-way to overtaking vehicles.
   (G)   The number of occupants in a golf cart shall be limited to the number

prohibited.
   (N)   Golf carts may not be used for the purpose of towing another cart,
trailer or vehicle of any kind including a person on roller skates, skateboard
or bicycle.
   (O)   ATVs, four-wheel utility vehicles and other similar utility vehicles
which are not manufactured for operation on a golf course and golf carts which
have been modified so that they no longer meet the definition of a golf cart
may not be registered as a golf cart, nor shall such vehicles be operated on
the public roads, streets and highways within the village, unless such vehicles
are otherwise registered with and allowed under the motor vehicle laws of the
state.
(Ord. 19-O-05, passed 10-21-2019) Penalty, see §
71.99
§ 71.04 REGISTRATION, INSPECTION AND FEES.
   (A)   No golf cart may be operated on any public street, road or highway
within the village or on property owned or leased by the village unless the
golf cart has first been registered with the village, as required herein.
   (B)   To evidence the registration, the owner shall be issued a permit which
shall be displayed in a prominent, visible place on the front windshield or
rear fender of the golf cart or at such other place as may be approved by the
Village Clerk (“permit”). The permit may contain a registration number assigned
for the particular golf cart. Permits will be issued annually and are valid
from January 1 to December 31 of each year.
   (C)   Permits issued to operators/owners of golf carts are done so by the
Village Clerk. A registration fee in the amount of $10, or such other amount as
may be established and published in the Schedule of Fees and Charges adopted by
the Village Council from time to time, as amended, shall be paid to the village
at the time the application for registration is filed with the Village Clerk.
The golf cart owner must complete the registration application which will be
maintained by the village. Should a golf cart previously receiving registration
approval from the village change ownership, the new owner of said cart shall
apply for registration in his or her name and pay the associated registration
fee stated herein above.
   (D)   To obtain approval of an application for registration, each owner must
have proof of ownership, proof of liability insurance for the cart and its
operators and a completed disclaimer of liability releasing the village, its
employees and affiliates from all liability that may arise as a result of
operating a cart in the village. The disclaimer of liability must be renewed
annually.
   (E)   Lost or stolen permits are the responsibility of the owner. A written
report detailing the occurrence must be filed with the Village Clerk in the
event of a lost or stolen permit. The Village Clerk will have the discretion in
determining whether a permit may be reissued in this instance. If no record can
be found of a previous application or the receipt of a permit, the Village
Clerk may direct the applicant to reapply and also resubmit any and all fees
necessary before a permit is issued.
   (F)   The Village Clerk, or his or her designee, shall inspect the golf cart
presented for registration to ensure that the safety requirements set forth in
§
71.03 of this chapter are met, and every golf cart operating on village streets
or roads must have the safety equipment and minimum standards stated in the
same. Any cart presented for registration that does not meet said requirements
shall not be approved for operation upon the streets, roads and highways of the
village. The Village Clerk retains the right to refuse to issue and to revoke
any permit issued for any golf cart at any time and for any reason that he or
she feels is appropriate to ensure the safety and well-being of the citizens of
the village.

as shall be set forth in the Schedule of Fees and Charges adopted by the
village from time to time, as amended. Each day that any of the provisions of
§§
71.01 through

and easements, within the village, the following procedures shall be followed:
   (A)   The Mayor, or his or her designee, shall notify the owner of the
premises where the nuisance is located that conditions exist which constitute a
public nuisance, and unless the condition is abated within ten days from the
mailing of the notice, which shall be sent by registered or certified mail, the
conditions constituting a nuisance will be abated, and the cost of abatement,
including an administrative fee, shall constitute a lien against the premises.
   (B)   The Mayor, or his or her designee, is hereby given full power and
authority to enter upon the premises involved, for the purpose of abating the
nuisance found to exist as herein set out. If any property owner served with
notice shall fail or refuse to correct or eliminate the condition causing the
nuisance within ten days after the notice has been given, the Mayor, or his or
her designee, may proceed to abate the nuisance by utilization of town forces
or an outside contractor. The Mayor may allow the owner additional time to
correct or eliminate the condition causing the nuisance, if he or she

designee, shall make a written report of the actual cost incurred by the
village, and shall deliver the report to the Finance Officer. The owner of the

town in the nuisance abatement, including an administrative fee. The cost shall
be charged against the property owner, and shall be collected in the same
manner and at the same time as the ad valorem taxes of the owner are collected.
The cost shall be a lien on the real property, subject only to the lien of the
town and county ad valorem taxes thereon.

   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the registered owner or person entitled to
possession of a vehicle to cause or allow such vehicle to be abandoned as the
term is defined in this chapter. Upon investigation, the Mayor or his or her
designee may determine that a vehicle is an abandoned vehicle and order the

   (B)   (1)   It shall be unlawful for the registered owner or person entitled
to possession of a motor vehicle, or for the owner, lessee or occupant of the
real property upon which the vehicle is located to leave or allow the vehicle
to remain on the property after it has been declared a nuisance vehicle.

or declare that a vehicle is a health or safety hazard and a nuisance vehicle,
as define above, and order the vehicle removed.

section.
      (4)   The Mayor or his or her designee, upon investigation, may order the
removal of a junked motor vehicle, as defined herein, after finding, in
writing, that the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the
burdens imposed on the private property owner. Such findings shall be based on

         (b)   Promotion of tourism and other economic development

obtained in this chapter; and
         (c)   More than one junked motor vehicle. Any other junked vehicle(s)
must be kept in a garage or building structure that provides a complete
enclosure so that the junked motor vehicles(s) cannot be seen from a public
street or abutting property. A garage or building structure means either a
lawful, nonconforming use or a garage or building structure erected pursuant to
the lawful issuance of a building permit and which has been constructed in
accordance with all zoning and building code regulation.

junked motor vehicle, if the names and mailing addresses of the registered
owner or person entitled to the possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee
or occupant of the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be
ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given
first by certified mail. The person who mails the notice(s) shall retain a

mailed. If such names and addresses cannot be ascertained or the vehicle to be
removed is an abandoned vehicle, notice shall be given by affixing on the

that the vehicle will be removed by the village on a specified date (no sooner
than seven days after the notice is affixed). The notice shall state that the

days after the notice is affixed or mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by the
owner or legal possessor to that time.
   (B)   With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property, nuisance
vehicles and junked motor vehicles to which notice required to be given, if the
registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the vehicle,
but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is abandoned, a
nuisance vehicle or, in the case of a junked motor vehicle, that the aesthetic
benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, such appeal shall be
made to the Mayor or his or her designee in writing, and further proceedings to
remove the vehicle shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and decided.
(Ord. passed 6-20-1994)
§ 92.05 EXCEPTIONS TO PRIOR NOTICE REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   The requirement that notice be given to the removal of an abandoned,

entered by the authorizing official in the appropriate daily records.

      (2)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles. With respect to abandoned or
nuisance vehicles left on village-owned property other than streets and
highways and on private property, such vehicles may be removed without giving
prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing official finds a
special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health,
safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of limitation such
circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to
businesses and residences, vehicles parked in such a location or manner as to
pose a traffic hazard and vehicles causing damage to public or private
property.

and such vehicle has no valid registration or registration plates, the
authorizing village official shall make reasonable efforts, including checking
the vehicle identification number, to determine the last known registered owner
of the vehicle and to notify him or her of the information set forth in
divisions (A)(1) through (A)(5) above.
