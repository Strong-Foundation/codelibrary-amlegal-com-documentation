Council deals with a particular substantive issue or substantive motion that is

time. It requires a two-thirds vote for adoption. A matter concerning which

does not bind a new Council.

accordance with the current fee schedule. Under no circumstances may garbage be
left by the roadside for town garbage pickup without approved receptacles and
bins as described in division (C).
      (2)   Property owners wishing to exempt their property from the
requirements of §
50.11(B) may do so by registering their request with the Town Manager for

resistant to rust, corrosion or rapid deterioration. Each receptacle shall be
watertight. Each receptacle shall have two handles and shall be covered with a
tight-fitting cover at all times. All receptacles shall be located in an
enclosure that meets or exceeds the minimum specifications in §
50.12 and incorporated herein by reference. The purpose of the enclosure is to

owner may appeal the decision of the Public Works Director to the Town Manager
within ten days of receipt of notice. If the owner fails to appeal the order of
the Public Works Director, an adequate dumpster shall be obtained and provided
within 60 days of receipt of the original notice. In the event of an
unsuccessful appeal, the required dumpster shall be provided within 60 days of
disposition of the appeal by the Town Manager.
   (G)   In requiring dumpsters for commercial establishments, the town shall
take into consideration the nature of the waste being generated and the
likelihood of spoilage or otherwise unsanitary conditions.
   (H)   All customers using dumpster containers must provide a suitable
location for the dumpster(s) that provides access to the collection vehicle. In
addition, the site provided must be such that the elevation of the dumpster
meets the specifications required for convenient attachment with the equipment
of the town, considering the weight of the dumpster, and settlement of the land
over time. Continuing settlement may require a hard surface pad. All customers
using dumpster containers must screen their dumpsters from view and keep them
in good repair and appearance. Temporary dumpsters at construction sites are
exempt from screening requirements.
   (I)   No person may damage, displace or otherwise interfere with solid waste

fundamental alteration of the municipality's solid waste collection provisions;
and
         (b)   NECESSARY. An accommodation will be determined to be necessary

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 WATER AND SEWER CONNECTIONS REQUIRED.
   (A)   All owners of real estate for which a Certificate of Occupancy has
been issued, that is located within 200 feet of any town water and/or sewer
line, shall connect with such water and/or sewer line, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   DELETED
   (C)   In all cases where water and sewer lines are within 200 feet of the
property line, the owner of the property shall connect to both the water and
sewer lines of the town. Where either water or sewer is not available, a
private well or septic tank built by the owner shall be maintained by the
property owner until such time as a water line or sewer line shall be extended
to serve the property.
   (D)   At such time as a town sewer line becomes available to a parcel of
property being served by either a private septic system or a private wastewater
disposal system, the property owner must make application and connect the
structure to the town sewer line within 60 days after receipt of notice from
the town. The property owner must pay the sewer system development fee then in
effect when application for connection is made. However, in light of the fact
that the property owner has previously invested in a private sewage system, the
owner shall not be required to pay the sewer tap fee.
   (E)   At such time as a town water line becomes available to a parcel of
property being served by a private well, the property owner must connect the
structure to the town water line within 60 days after receipt of notice from
the town. The property owner must pay the water system development fee then in
effect when application for connection is made. However, in light of the fact
that the property owner has previously invested in a private water supply, the
owner shall not be required to pay the water tap fee.
   (F)   All property owners who constructed a private septic system during the
moratorium on new connections to the town’s sewer system mandated by the State
of North Carolina shall make application for and connect to the town’s sewer
system no later than five years after the date the state moratorium was lifted.
The property owner must pay the sewer system development fee then in effect
when application for connection is made. However, in light of the fact that the
property owner has previously invested in a private sewage system, the owner
shall not be required to pay the sewer tap fee. 1
   (G)   All property owners who are using a private septic system and who have
been granted a waiver prior to November 30, 2000 from connecting to the town’s
sewer system, shall make application for and connect to the town’s sewer system

   (A)   No water or sewer connections shall be made until such time that
application has been made and all connection fees and availability fees paid.
In projects requiring other permits, no connections shall be made until such
time that all required building, zoning, driveway and other permits required by
the Town of Beech Mountain, county, state or federal agencies have been
obtained.
   (B)   The Town of Beech Mountain may reject any application for service not
available under a standard rate, or which includes excessive service costs, or
which may affect the supply of service to other customers or may be detrimental
to the waste treatment process due to the volume, character or content of the
discharge.
   (C)   The Town of Beech Mountain shall reject any applications for
connection or applications for service when the applicant is delinquent in
payment of bills incurred for service supplied at any location.
   (D)   Customers requesting the water and sewer services or transfer of these
services shall pay, at the town office, utility service deposits in the amount
required by ordinance at that time. Upon discontinuance of the water and sewer
services, and after the customer has paid his or her final bill for those
services, the deposit will be returned to the depositor upon request. No
interest will be paid on water and sewer deposits. Security deposit charges are
set by the Town Council. The master schedule of fees is maintained in the
Clerk’s office.
   (E)   All service accounts shall be billed at least a minimum monthly charge
as specified in the rate schedule adopted by the Town Council regardless of the
account status, consumption, or occupancy of the structure. Charges shall
commence effective with the installation of the meter.
   (F)   Accounts for sprinkler systems only shall not be billed a minimum
charge nor shall water utilized in the extinguishment of fire be billed to the
customer if said sprinkler system is separated from all other plumbing fixtures
and appurtenances and is metered separately from all other consumption or
usage. Any water passing through sprinkler systems due to negligence,
carelessness, frozen pipes or improper maintenance shall be billed in
accordance with the rate schedule in effect at the time.
   (G)   Bills are past due and delinquent the twentieth of each month. If the
twentieth of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, the day of delinquency
will move to the end of the next business day. Delinquent accounts will be
charged a monthly administrative fee computed on the date of delinquency at a
rate of 15% on the full balance of the account. Service may be discontinued by
the town pursuant to §§
51.130 et seq. herein.
   (H)   Disconnection of water service may take place on or after the date of
the third billing cycle on all accounts that are two months in arrears, or upon
shorter notice to the account holder if deemed appropriate by the Town Manager.

twice the basic deposit, delinquency fees, reconnection fees, and the balance
due on the account. The master schedule of fees is established by Town Council
and maintained in the Clerk's Office.
   (I)   In cases where the customer provides conclusive proof that a leak has
occurred in his or her plumbing system that has caused demand to increase and
has been fixed, the utility bill for the period of time when the leak occurred
may be adjusted by reducing the sewer portion of the bill to reflect average
sewage charges for the account, or the minimum sewage charge, whichever is
greatest. In no such circumstances shall the sewage portion of the bill be
reduced below the minimum monthly charge for the period.
   (J)   (1)   Any water account which is charged a large amount in any one
billing period due to a leak is eligible for a 15% reduction in water charges,

the leak, if the customer has been approved to pay the charges over a period of
months. Interest charges will begin to accrue on the entire balance past due if
the customer is late in making payment on the approved schedule. This provision
applies only to large balances resulting from private plumbing leaks in a
single billing period, and does not apply to subsequent charges for water
service after the leak has been repaired. Situations requiring that special
arrangements be made for the payment of past due accounts may only be approved
by the Town Manager. The Town Manager, or designee, is authorized to make
further reductions in situations where the property owner has an “
   (K)   Not less than three-days’ notice must be given in person or in writing

RESPONSIBILITIES; LIABILITIES
§ 51.045 SERVICES; CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Where service is available, and upon receipt of all necessary
connection and availability fees, the town may extend service lines to serve
properties as follows:
      (1)   In cases where the distribution or collection lines run in a
roadway immediately adjacent to the property to be served, the town shall run a
service line from its water and/or sewer main to the property line.
      (2)   In cases where the distribution or collection lines from which
service is to be obtained is located in a street separated from the property to
be served by the property of another, the town shall run the service line from
its distribution or collection line to the property line of the lot located
adjacent to the road in which the main distribution or collection line is
located.
   (B)   Generally, service lines, meters, etc., installed by the town to serve
properties will be located at a point along the property line mutually agreed
upon by the Town and property owner, However, in such cases where mutual
agreement cannot be reached as to the most suitable location, the decision will
rest with the Public Works Director.
   (C)   The property owners shall be responsible for connecting all plumbing
fixtures, piping and appurtenances on the property with the service lines
installed by the town. Once installed, the property owner shall be responsible
for maintaining his or her water service line from the property or structure
being served to the meter. Similarly, the property owner is responsible for the
maintenance of the sewer service line from the property or structure being
served to the sewer service line extended by the town. The location of all
sewer lines must be approved by the Public Works Director. All sewer lines must
be buried unless the Public Works Director determines it is not feasible to do
so. If any lines are not buried, they must be camouflaged from view. 1
   (D)   The property owner shall furnish and maintain a private cutoff valve
on the customer’s side of the water meter. The cutoff valve shall be of curb-
stop quality, shall be located immediately on the customer’s side of the water
meter, shall be kept in good working order, and shall be protected from the
elements in a suitable manner. State Building Code prohibits underground
installation of combination stop-and-waste valves and cocks.
   (E)   Furthermore, a pressure reduction valve, preferably with a pressure
gauge, shall be installed on the customer's side of the water meter in all
existing and new construction.
   (F)   In order to protect the water supply of the Town of Beech Mountain and
thereby insure the availability of water for human needs, it is crucial that
customers utilize their private cutoff valve year round during periods when a
house, unit or business will be unoccupied. All utility customers are required
to turn water service off using their own private cutoff valve when the
structure will be unoccupied for more than three days. Failure to do so may
result in the town’s cutting off service and billing the customer for the
cutoff fee. 2
   (G)   The town neither guarantees customers uninterrupted service, nor does
it assume any liability for damage to private property due to interruptions in
service. All utility customers are urged to ensure that their plumbing systems
and appurtenances are adequately equipped with back-flow prevention devices or
vacuum relief valves as necessary.

160A-218 and under the authority granted to the town by G.S. § 160A-216.
      (3)   A property owner shall have the opportunity to pay the assessment
after the assessment roll is confirmed rather than paying his or her share in
equal annual installments with interest as required by the statute.
      (4)   When the town determines that it is advisable to install larger
size lines or facilities than are necessary to serve the benefited property,
the difference in the cost of the larger size facilities over the cost of the
facilities required to serve the benefited property the extensions may be paid
by the town and excluded from the total cost to be shared by the property owner
(s) and the town as provided herein.
   (B)   Extension by the Council's initiative. Nothing in this chapter shall
prevent the Council from extending water or sanitary sewer mains or both within
the corporate limits on their own initiative without receipt of an application
from property owners and to assess the cost of such extensions in accordance
with state statutes when, in the opinion of the Council, the general public
interest requires such extensions of service.

telephone through use of reverse 911.
(Ord. passed 4-13-2010; Ord. passed 6-14-2011)
§ 51.078 LEVELS OF RESPONSE.
   (A)   Five levels of water shortage response are outlined in the table
below. The five levels of water shortage response are: voluntary reductions,
mandatory reductions I and II, emergency reductions and water rationing. A
detailed description of each response level and corresponding water reduction
measures follow below.
 
Stage Response                Description
                              Water users are encouraged to reduce their water
1     Voluntary Reductions    use and improve water use efficiency; however, no
                              penalties apply for noncompliance. Water supply
                              conditions indicate a potential for shortage.
                              Water users must abide required water use
                              reduction and efficiency measures; penalties
2     Mandatory Reductions I  apply for noncompliance. Water supply conditions
                              are significantly lower than the seasonal norm
                              and water shortage conditions are expected to
                              persist.
3     Mandatory Reductions II Same as in Stage 2
                              Water supply conditions are substantially
4     Emergency Reductions    diminished and pose an imminent threat to human
                              health or environmental integrity.
                              Water supply conditions are substantially
5     Water Rationing         diminished and remaining supplies must be
                              allocated to preserve human health and
                              environmental integrity.
 
   (B)   In Stage 1, Voluntary Reductions, all water users will be asked to
reduce their normal water use by 5%. Customer education and outreach programs
will encourage water conservation and efficiency measures including: irrigating
landscapes a maximum of one inch per week; preventing water waste, runoff and
watering impervious surfaces; watering plants deeply to encourage root growth;
washing only full loads in clothes and dishwashers; using spring-loaded nozzles
on garden hoses; and identifying and repairing all water leaks.
   (C)   In Stage 2, Mandatory Reductions I, all customers are expected to
reduce their water use by 10% in comparison to their previous month’s water
bill. In addition to continuing to encourage all voluntary reduction actions,
the following restrictions apply: irrigation is limited to a half inch per week
between 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.; outdoor use of drinking water for washing
impervious surfaces is prohibited; and all testing and training purposes
requiring drinking water (e.g. fire protection) will be limited.
   (D)   In Stage 3, Mandatory Reductions II, customers must continue actions
from all previous stages and further reduce water use by 20% compared to their
previous month’s water bill. All non-essential uses of drinking water are
banned and garden and landscape irrigation must be reduced to the minimum
amount necessary for survival. Additionally, in Stage 3, a drought surcharge of
1.5 times the normal water rate applies.
   (E)   In Stage 4, Emergency Reductions, customers must continue all actions
from previous stages and further reduce their water use by 25% compared to
their previous month’s water bill. A ban on all use of drinking water except to
protect public health and safety is implemented and drought surcharges increase
to two times the normal water rate.
   (F)   The goal of Stage 5, Water Rationing, is to provide drinking water to
protect public health (e.g. residences, residential health care facilities and
correctional facilities). In Stage 5, all customers are only permitted to use
water at the minimum required for public health protection. Firefighting is the
only allowable outdoor water use and pickup locations for distributing potable
water will be announced according to Beech Mountain’s Emergency Response Plan.
Drought surcharges increase to five times the normal water rate.
(Ord. passed 4-13-2010)
§ 51.079 TRIGGERS.
   (A)   The Town of Beech Mountain’s water source is a reservoir, Buckeye
Lake. The following measurements of intake levels trigger entry into
corresponding water restriction stages.
      (1)   Stage 1 - zero feet (no longer flowing over spillway) elevation
3428 feet.
      (2)   Stage 2 - four feet below spillway.
      (3)   Stage 3 - six and one half feet below spillway (top intake).
      (4)   Stage 4 - 13.5 feet below spillway (middle intake).
      (5)   Stage 5 - 23.5 feet below spillway (bottom intake).
   (B)   Return to normal. When water shortage conditions have abated and the
situation is returning to normal, water conservation measures employed during
each phase should be decreased in reverse order of implementation. Permanent
measures directed toward long-term monitoring and conservation should be
implemented or continued so that the community will be in a better position to
prevent shortages and respond to recurring water shortage conditions.
(Ord. passed 4-13-2010)
§ 51.080 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The provisions of the water shortage response plan will be enforced by
Town of Beech Mountain utility department and police personnel. Violators may
be reported to the town’s dedicated water conservation hotline. Citations are
assessed according to the following schedule depending on the number of prior
violations and current level of water shortage.
 
Water Shortage Level First Violation Second Violation   Third Violation
Voluntary reductions N/A             N/A                N/A
Mandatory reductions Warning         $250               Discontinuation of

   (B)   Drought surcharge rates are effective in Stages 3, 4 and 5.
(Ord. passed 4-13-2010)
§ 51.081 PUBLIC COMMENT.
   Customers will have multiple opportunities to comment on the provisions of
the water shortage response plan. First, a draft plan will be will be available
at Town Hall for customers to view. A notice will be included in customer water
bill notifying them of such. Also a draft plan will be published in the
Mountain Times. All subsequent revisions to the draft plan will be published at
least 30 days prior to an adoption vote by Beech Mountain’s Town Council.
(Ord. passed 4-13-2010)
§ 51.082 VARIANCE PROTOCOLS.
   Applications for water use variance requests are available from the Town
Utility Office. All applications must be submitted to the Utility Office for
review by the Utility Director or his or her designee. A decision to approve or
deny individual variance requests will be determined within two weeks of
submittal after careful consideration of the following criteria: impact on
water demand, expected duration, alternative source options, social and
economic importance, purpose (i.e. necessary use of drinking water) and the
prevention of structural damage.
(Ord. passed 4-13-2010)
§ 51.083 EFFECTIVENESS.
   The effectiveness of the Beech Mountain water shortage response plan will be
determined by comparing the stated water conservation goals with observed water
use reduction data. Other factors to be considered include frequency of plan
activation, any problem periods without activation, total number of violation
citations, desired reductions attained and evaluation of demand reductions
compared to the previous year’s seasonal data.
(Ord. passed 4-13-2010)
§ 51.084 REVISION.
   The water shortage response plan will be reviewed and revised as needed to
adapt to new circumstances affecting water supply and demand, following
implementation of emergency restrictions, and at a minimum of every five years
in conjunction with the updating of our Local Water Supply Plan. Further, a
water shortage response planning work group will review procedures following
each emergency or rationing stage to recommend any necessary improvements to
the plan to Beech Mountain’s Town Council. The Town of Beech Mountain Utility
Director is responsible for initiating all subsequent revisions.

§ 72.01 POLICY STATEMENT.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted to promote the health, safety and welfare of
the public.
   (B)   (1)   Golf carts and utility vehicles are not designed or manufactured
to be used on the public streets, and the town in no way advocates or endorses
their operation on public roads.
      (2)   The town, by regulating the operation, is merely trying to address
obvious safety issues, and the adoption of this chapter is not to be relied
upon as a determination that operation on public streets is safe or advisable
if done in accordance with this chapter.
   (C)   All persons who operate or ride upon golf carts or utility vehicles on
public streets or roads do so at their own risk and peril, and must be
observant of, and attentive to, the safety of themselves and others, including
their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians.
   (D)   The town has no liability under any theory of liability, for
permitting golf carts or utility vehicles to be operated on the public streets
and roads under the special legislation granted by the state’s legislature.
   (E)   Any person who operates a golf cart or utility vehicle is responsible
for procuring liability insurance sufficient to cover the risk involved in
using a golf cart or utility vehicle on the public streets and roads.
   (F)   The Town Council must exercise its judgment concerning what roads to
allow golf carts or utility vehicles to be driven upon. In exercising its
judgment, the Town Council has considered the following factors:
      (1)   The town is a resort community, and the Beech Mountain Golf Course
is an important recreational facility in the community;
      (2)   Golf carts and utility vehicles being driven upon roads that are
main traffic arteries create a greater public safety concern;
      (3)   The greater the distance a golf cart or utility vehicle must be
driven to reach the golf course, the greater the public safety concern; and
      (4)   Adopting rules and regulations concerning the operation of golf
carts or utility vehicles upon public roads within the town promotes public
safety.

   Vehicles creating a hazard, see §
71.02
§ 96.01 STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   Abandoned and junked motor vehicles constitute a hazard to the health and
welfare of the people of the town in that those vehicles can harbor noxious
diseases, furnish shelter and breeding places for vermin, and present physical
dangers to the safety and well-being of children and other citizens. In many
circumstances, abandoned and junked motor vehicles also detract from community,
neighborhood, or area appearance and may negatively impact tourism and economic
development, property values, and the character of the town. The town is a
mountain community whose character and economy is based, in part, upon the
natural beauty of the area and its unique aesthetic appearance. It is,
therefore, in the public interest that the present accumulation of abandoned
and junked motor vehicles be eliminated and that future abandonment of vehicles
be prevented.
(1989 Code, Title IV, Ch. 43, § 4-1) (Ord. 2013-07, passed 5-14-2013)
§ 96.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLE. A vehicle that:
      (1)   Is left on public grounds or town owned property in violation of a
law or ordinance prohibiting parking;
      (2)   Is left for longer than 24 hours on property owned or operated by
the town;
      (3)   Is left for longer than two hours on private property without the
consent of the owner, occupant or lessee of the property; or
      (4)   Is left for longer than seven days on public grounds.
   JUNKED MOTOR VEHICLE. A vehicle that does not display a current license
plate and that:
      (1)   Is partially dismantled or wrecked;
      (2)   Cannot be self-propelled or moved in the manner in which it was
originally intended to move; or
      (3)   Is more than five years old and appears to be worth less than $500.
(1989 Code, Title IV, Ch. 43, § 4-2) (Ord. 2013-07, passed 5-14-2013)
§ 96.03 REMOVAL OF ABANDONED AND JUNKED VEHICLES AUTHORIZED.
   (A)   Subject to division (B) below, whenever it is made to appear to
appropriate town officials that abandoned or junked motor vehicles exist within
town limits, the town may have the vehicles removed by a private towing
operator to a storage yard or area and thereafter may dispose of them in
accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. The private towing operator
shall be selected using a rotation method of local or regional towing companies
who are licensed, insured, and have advised the town they are interested in
participating in such a rotation.
   (B)   (1)   No motor vehicle may be removed from private property without
the written request of the owner, lessee or occupant of the premises unless the
Council or a duly authorized city official or employee find in writing that the
aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens imposed on the
private property owner. This finding shall be based on a balancing of the
monetary loss of the apparent owner against the corresponding gain to the
public by promoting or enhancing community, neighborhood or area appearance.
The following, among other relevant factors, may be considered:
         (a)   Protection of property values;
         (b)   Promotion of tourism and other economic development
opportunities;
         (c)   Indirect protection of public health and safety;
         (d)   Preservation of the character and integrity of the community;
and
         (e)   Promotion of the comfort, happiness, and emotional stability of
area residents.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the above, no motor vehicle located on private
property shall be removed or disposed of pursuant to this section without the
written request of the owner, lessee or occupant of the premises if the vehicle
is used on a regular basis for business or personal use.
   (C)   The town may require any person requesting the removal of a junked or
abandoned motor vehicle from private property to indemnify the town against any
loss, expense or liability incurred because of the removal, storage or sale
thereof.
   (D)   No agent or employee of the town, no person or occupant of the
premises from which any derelict or abandoned vehicle shall be removed, nor any
person or firm contracting for the removal of or disposition of any such
vehicle shall be held criminally or civilly liable in any way arising out of or
caused by carrying out or enforcing any provision of this subchapter.
(1989 Code, Title IV, Ch. 43, § 4-3) (Ord. 2013-07, passed 5-14-2013)
§ 96.04 NOTICE REQUIRED WHEN VEHICLE REMOVED.
   (A)   (1)   Whenever a vehicle with a valid registration plate or
registration is towed as provided in G.S. § 20-219.10, the authorizing person
shall immediately notify the last known registered owner of the vehicle of the
following:
         (a)   A description of the vehicle;
         (b)   The place where the vehicle is stored;
         (c)   The violation with which the owner is charged, if any;
         (d)   The procedure the owner must follow to have the vehicle returned
to him or her; and
         (e)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable cause
hearing on the towing.
      (2)   If the vehicle has a North Carolina registration plate or
registration, notice shall be given to the owner within 24 hours; if the
vehicle is not registered in this state, notice shall be given to the owner
within 72 hours. This notice shall, if feasible, be given by telephone. Whether
or not the owner is reached by telephone, notice shall be mailed to his or her
last known address unless his or her agent waives this notice in writing.
   (B)   Whenever a vehicle with neither a valid registration plate nor
registration is towed as provided in G.S. § 20-219.10, the authorizing person
shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the vehicle identification
number, to determine the last known registered owner of the vehicle and to
notify him or her of the information listed in division (A). Unless the owner
has otherwise been given notice, it is presumed that the authorizing person has
not make reasonable efforts, as required under this division, unless notice
that the vehicle would be towed was posted on the windshield or some other
conspicuous place at least seven days before the towing actually occurred;
however, no pretowing notice need be given if the vehicle impeded the flow of
traffic or otherwise jeopardized the public welfare so that immediate towing
was necessary.
   (C)   The owner or any other person entitled to claim possession of the
vehicle may request in writing a hearing to determine if probable cause existed
for the towing. The request shall be filed with the magistrate in the county
where the vehicle was towed. The owner, the person who requested the hearing if
someone other than the owner, the tower, and the person who authorized the
towing shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing.
   (D)   The owner, the tower, the person who authorized the towing, and any
other interested parties may present evidence at the hearing. The person
authorizing the towing and the tower may submit an affidavit in lieu of
appearing personally, but the affidavit does not preclude that person from also
testifying.
   (E)   The only issue at this hearing is whether or not probable cause
existed for the towing. If the magistrate funds that probable cause did exist,
the tower’s lien continues. If the magistrate finds that probable cause did not
exist, the tower’s lien is extinguished, and the town shall provide
compensation to the tower.
   (F)   Any aggrieved party may appeal the magistrate’s decision to district
court.
   (G)   At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause
hearing, the owner may obtain possession of his or her vehicle by:
      (1)   Paying the towing fee; or
      (2)   Posting a bond for double the amount of the towing fee.

illegible, the provisions of §§
96.04 and

authority of the town to effect the removal or abatement of any abandoned or
junked motor vehicle, regardless of whether the motor vehicle is located on

(1989 Code, Title VI, Ch. 80, § 8) (Ord. passed 6-10-2003; Ord. 2019-08, passed
8-13-2019; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)
§ 153.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Issuance of complaint.
      (1)   Whenever the town receives a complaint, or whenever it appears to
the code enforcement officer (on his or her own motion) that a dwelling is
unfit for human habitation, the code enforcement officer shall, if his or her
preliminary investigation discloses a basis for the charges, issue and cause to
be served upon the owner of the dwelling a complaint stating the charges of
violations of this code, listing code deficiencies, and containing a notice
that a hearing will be held before the Town Manager at a place, date and time
specified. The notice shall also notify the owner(s) that they have the right
to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and
give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; and that the rules
of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in
hearings before the Town Manager.
      (2)   Provided, however, the code enforcement officer may, prior to the
issuance of a complaint, serve upon the property owner or property owner's
agent with a violation notice giving the property owner up to 90 days to
correct violations.
   (B)   Findings of fact and order. If, after the notice and hearing, the Town
Manager determines that the dwelling under consideration is unsafe or unfit for
human habitation, according to the standards of this code, he or she shall
state in writing his or her findings of fact in support of that determination
and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order.
      (1)   If the dwelling is found to be deteriorated as defined in this
code, the Town Manager shall require the owner to repair, alter or improve the
dwelling so as to bring it into compliance with this code within a period not
to exceed 120 days of the service of the order upon the owner. The order may
also require the owner to vacate and close the dwelling as a human habitation.
Where the Town Manager finds that there is imminent danger to life or other
property, he or she may order that corrective action be taken in the lesser
time period as may be necessary.
      (2)   If the dwelling is found to be dilapidated as defined in this code,
the Town Manager may require the owner to demolish and remove the dwelling
within a period not to exceed 90 days of the service of the order. Where the
Town Manager finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he
or she may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser time period as
may be necessary. The order will not bar the owner from making repairs as are
necessary to bring the dwelling into compliance with this code within the
corrective action period imposed by the order.
   (C)   Action upon failure to comply with order.
      (1)   If the owner of a dwelling fails to comply with an order to repair
or to vacate and close the dwelling, the Town Manager may cause the dwelling to
be repaired or to be vacated and closed.
         (a)   The Town Manager may cause to be posted on the main entrance of
any dwelling so closed a placard with the following words:
      "This dwelling is unfit for human habitation. The use or occupation of
this dwelling for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful."
         (b)   Occupation of a dwelling so posted shall constitute a
misdemeanor.
      (2)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to demolish and remove
the dwelling, the Town Manager may cause the dwelling to be demolished and
removed.
      (3)   The order of the Town Manager to repair, vacate and close or
demolish and remove shall not be exercised until the Town Council shall have by
ordinance ordered the Town Manager to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this
code with respect to the particular property.
         (a)   No such ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a
dwelling until the owner has first been given reasonable opportunity to bring
it into conformity with this code.
         (b)   The ordinance shall be recorded in the Office of the Register of
Deeds for the appropriate county and shall be indexed in the name of the
property owner in the grantor index.
      (4)   The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or vacating and
closing, or demolition and removal caused by the Town Manager shall be a lien
against the real property upon which the cost was incurred. This lien shall be
filed, have the same priority, and be collected as the lien for special
assessment provided in G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 10. If the dwelling is caused to be
demolished and removed by the Town Manager, he or she shall, where feasible,
sell the materials of the dwelling, and any personal property, fixtures or
appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall credit the
proceeds of the sale against the cost of the demolition and removal. Any
balance remaining shall be deposited in the appropriate County Superior Court
by the Town Manager, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and
shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by
final order or decree of the court.
      (5)   If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling,
the town may file a civil action to remove the occupant. The action to vacate
the dwelling shall be in the nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced
by filing a complaint naming as parties-defendant any person occupying the
dwelling. The Clerk of the appropriate County Superior Court shall issue a
summons requiring the defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain
time, date and place not to exceed ten days from the issuance of the summons to
answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in
G.S. § 42-29.
         (a)   The summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on
its return it appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the Town
Manager produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the town pursuant
to division (C)(3) above authorizing to proceed to vacate the occupied
dwelling, the magistrate shall enter a judgement ordering that the premises be
vacated and that all persons be removed.
         (b)   The judgement ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be
enforced in the same manner as the judgement for summary ejectment entered
under G.S. § 42-30. An appeal from any judgement entered hereunder by the
magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. § 7A-228, and the execution of the
judgement may be stayed as provided in G.S. § 7A-227.
         (c)   An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of
the owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant
to this section unless the occupant has been served with notice at least 30
days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the town has
ordered the Town Manager to proceed to exercise his or her duties under this
section to vacate and close or demolish and remove the dwelling.
   (D)   Displacement. In enforcing the provisions of this code, the Town
Manager shall make every effort to prevent unnecessary displacement of
occupants, including assisting in locating alternate housing.
   (E)   Determination of value. The code enforcement officer is hereby
authorized to fix the reasonable value of any dwelling or abandoned dwelling
for the purpose of this code at the amount set forth in the appropriate
county's property tax listing (as adjusted by the County Assessor, or pursuant
to the Assessor's instruction), not including land value. The value shall be
binding unless the owner provides for delivery of a written appraisal as to the
reasonable value of the dwelling prepared by a state-certified residential
appraiser within 15 days after receipt of an order from the Town Manager. The
written appraisal shall be binding and conclusive for the purposes of this
code.
   (F)   Service of complaints and orders.
      (1)   Complaints and orders issued pursuant to this code shall be served
upon persons either personally or by certified mail; but if the identities of
any owners or the whereabouts of the persons are unknown and the same cannot be
ascertained by the Code Enforcement Officer, in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, and the Code Enforcement Officer makes an affidavit to that effect,
then the serving of the complaint or order upon the unknown owners may be made
by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the town at least
once no later than the time at which personal service would be required under
this code.
      (2)   Where service is made by publication, a notice of the pending
proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises thereby
effected. Failure on the part of any owner or party in interest to receive or
have served upon him or her any complaint, notice or order herein provided for
shall not affect or invalidate the proceedings with respect to any other owner
or party in interest or any other person, firm or corporation.
   (G)   Civil penalties. An owner who fails to comply with an order to repair
or to improve, vacate, close or demolish and remove any dwelling determined
unfit for human habitation pursuant to the provisions contained in this code,
or who permits the occupancy or re-occupancy of an unsafe or unfit dwelling in
violation of this code shall be subject to a civil penalty of $100 for the
first day following the expiration of an order to repair or improve, vacate or
close any occupied dwelling or following a determination that an unfit dwelling
has been re-occupied in violation of this code. In each instance, a penalty of
$20 per day shall be imposed for each subsequent day that the failure to comply
continues. If a person fails to pay the civil penalty within ten days after
being notified of the amount due, the town may recover the penalty together
with all costs by filing a civil action in the General Court of Justice in the
nature of a suit to collect a debt.
   (H)   Violator responsible for costs. In the event it is necessary for the
town to file a civil action to enforce any provision of this chapter, the
violator shall be liable for and may pay to the town all costs and attorney
fees incurred by the town.
(1989 Code, Title VI, Ch. 80, § 9) (Ord. passed 6-10-2003; Ord. 2021-03, passed
6-8-2021)
§ 153.10 APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   (A)   To Town Manager. Any owner may file a written appeal within ten days
after issuance of the code enforcement officer's report to the owner, with the
Town Manager. The Town Manager is hereby given authority to rule on any dispute
arising out of the interpretation of this code by the code enforcement officer.
The Town Manager will affirm, reverse or modify the ruling of the code
enforcement officer.
   (B)   To Board of Adjustment. A housing appeals board is hereby created to
which appeals on the record may be taken by an owner or other party in interest
from any decision or order of the Town Manager. The Board of Adjustment for the
town shall serve as the Housing Appeals Board and will hear and determine the
appeals on the record.
      (1)   An appeal from any decision or order of the Town Manager may be
taken by any person aggrieved thereby. The appeal shall be taken within ten
days from the service of the order and shall be taken by filing with the Town
Manager and with the Board a notice of appeal, which shall specify the grounds
upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the
Town Manager shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the
record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from
the decision of the Town Manager refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby
to do any act, his or her decision shall remain in force until modified or
reversed.
         (a)   When any appeal is from a decision of the Town Manager requiring
the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of
suspending the requirement until the hearing of the Board, unless the Town
Manager certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him or
her, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which
shall be furnished to the petitioner) a suspension of his or her requirement
would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property or that
because the violation charged is transitory in nature a stay would seriously
interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case proceedings shall not
be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board if
Adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
         (b)   To this end, the Board shall have all the powers of the officer
from whom the appeal is taken.
      (2)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of appeals,
shall give due notice to all the parties and shall render its decision within a
reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. The
Board may reverse, affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the decision or
order appealed. The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Town Manager. The
Board shall have the power also in passing upon appeals in any case where there
are practical difficulties or undue hardships in the way of carrying out the
strict letter of this code, to adapt the application of the code to the
necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the code shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
      (3)   Every decision of the Board shall be subject to review by
proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted in the appropriate County
Superior Court within 30 days after the written decision of the Board is filed
or after a copy thereof is delivered to the appealing party, whichever is
later. The decision of the Board may be delivered to the aggrieved party either
by hand delivery or by any method authorized by the State Rules of Civil
Procedure.
   (C)   Injunction. Any person aggrieved by a decision rendered by the Board
may petition the Superior Court for an injunction restraining the town from
carrying out the order or decision and the court upon the petition, issue a
temporary injunction restraining the town pending a final disposition of the
cause; provided, however, that the petition shall be filed within 30 days after
issuance of the order or rendering of the decision.
(1989 Code, Title VI, Ch. 80, § 10) (Ord. passed 6-10-2003; Ord. 2021-03,
passed 6-8-2021)
§ 153.11 OTHER UNLAWFUL ACTS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to remove
(or permit the removal of), damage or deface any complaint, notice order or
certificate posted in accordance with the provisions of this code, unless the
code enforcement officer consents in writing to the action.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for the owner or owner's agent(s) of any dwelling
subject to the provisions of this code to fail to furnish to the buyer(s) a
copy of the inspection findings or report prior to closing or other property
transfer of the dwelling.

town should continue to grow, emphasizing its natural surroundings of forest
land, wildlife, and natural streams. The Zoning Ordinance should seek to ensure
the serenity of a natural environment and restrict to a minimum any artificial
growth which would destroy that which nature has provided.

Zoning Ordinance, as well as future planning elements, and for the fulfillment
of the projected needs of the community.

Mountain enhancing and accentuating the existing favorable qualities of the
Town and diminish those features that detract from the most beneficial
development of the Town.
      (2)   To promote the coordinated growth and development of the Town of
Beech Mountain.
      (3)   To provide for orderly residential growth.
      (4)   To protect the environment and ecology of the area.

insure the growth of the Town of Beech Mountain, the natural beauty must be
preserved.

the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property; and
      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate
to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a
person with a disability; and
      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or
the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship; and
      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial
justice is achieved.
   (C)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
   (D)   Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that
the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.

§ 154.048 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIANCES WITHIN WATER SUPPLY WATERSHEDS.
   (A)   The Administrator shall notify in writing each local government having
jurisdiction in the watershed district as well as any entity using the
watershed for water consumption. Such notice shall include a description of the
variance being requested. Local governments receiving notice of the variance
request may submit comments to the Administrator prior to a decision by the
Board of Adjustment. Such comments shall become a part of the record of
proceedings of the Board of Adjustment.
   (B)   If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if
the Board of Adjustment decides in favor of granting the variance, the Board
shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed.
The preliminary record of the hearing shall include:
      (1)   The variance application;
      (2)   The hearing notices;
      (3)   The evidence presented;
      (4)   Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on
them;
      (5)   Proposed findings and exceptions; and
      (6)   The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be
added to the permit.
   (C)   The preliminary record shall be sent to the NC Environmental
Management Commission for its review as follows:
      (1)   If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the
variance qualifies as a major variance and that [i] the property owner can
secure no reasonable return from, nor make any practical use of the property
unless the proposed variance is granted, and [ii] the variance, if granted,
will not result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the Commission
shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with
conditions and stipulations. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision
and send it to the Board of Adjustment. If the Commission approves the variance
as proposed, the Board shall prepare a final decision granting the proposed
variance. If the Commission approves the variance with conditions and
stipulations, the Board shall prepare a final decision, including such
conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance.
      (2)   If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the
variance qualifies as a major variance and that [i] the property owner can
secure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property without
the variance or [ii] the variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat
to the water supply, then the Commission shall deny approval of the variance as
proposed. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it to the
Board of Adjustment. The Board shall prepare a final decision denying the
variance as proposed.
   (D)   A record of all variances granted within water supply watersheds by
the town shall be submitted the NC Environmental Management Commission on or
before January first of the year following the granting of the variance.

corporate limits, or extraterritorial boundary lines, shall be construed as
following such lines, limits or boundaries;
      (3)   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines or the centerlines of
streams, rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow
such shorelines or centerlines, and in the event of change in the shoreline or
centerline, the boundary shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline
or centerline;
      (4)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following designated limits
of areas of special flood hazard shall be construed as following such limits;
      (5)   Where a district boundary divides a lot or where distances are not
specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map, the boundary shall be
determined by measurement, using the scale of the Official Zoning Map;
      (6)   Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or
abandoned, the regulations applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall
apply to that portion of such street or alley added thereto by virtue of such
vacation or abandonment.

(Ord. passed 10-14-2008; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)
§ 154.051 BOARD ACTION.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall decide any appeal before it in
compliance with the procedures set out in its duly adopted Rules of Procedure.
   (B)   A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one or
more of the four criteria set forth in §
154.047(B) are not satisfied or that the application is incomplete. Insofar as
practicable, such a motion shall include a statement of the specific reasons or
findings of fact that support it. This motion is adopted as the Board’s
decision if supported by more than one-fifth of the Board’s membership (i.e.
two or more Board members).
   (C)   Before granting a variance, the Board must take a separate vote and
vote affirmatively by a four-fifths majority on each of the four required
findings set forth in §
154.047(B). Insofar as practicable, a motion to make an affirmative finding on

ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP
§ 154.070 GENERAL USE DISTRICTS.
   Each district described below constitutes a General Use Zoning District.
Each General Use District category serves a different purpose and imposes its
own set of requirements and restrictions on the use of land in addition to the
general requirements and restrictions imposed on all land or uses within the
planning jurisdiction. A General Use District may be layered with an Overlay
District.
   (A)   Each district described below constitutes a General Use District.
      (1)   Low Density Single-Family Residential District (R-1). The Low
Density Single-Family Residential District is primarily intended to provide
locations for low density residential and related type development in areas
where more intense development is not practical. These areas are not likely to
have public water and sewer services available and are located away from the
main developed area of Beech Mountain. The minimum required lot area will be
40,000 square feet unless additional land is required for adequate sewage
disposal.
      (2)   Single-Family Residential District (R-2, R-2A).1 The Single-Family
Residential District is primarily intended to provide locations for single-
family residential and supporting uses in areas where public water and sewer
services are available or will likely be provided in the future. This district
is further intended to protect existing single-family subdivisions from
encroachment of incompatible land uses and thus does not allow mobile homes or
mobile home parks. This district will be applied within those areas designated
on the Land Use Plan as Single-Family Residential and platted as single-family
residential subdivisions.
      (3)   Multi-Family High Density Residential District (R-3A and R-3B).
These districts are intended for a variety of residential uses, including
single-family houses, duplexes and multi-family buildings and developments,
depending upon the availability of public water and sewer services. Some areas
within these districts may not have adequate water and sewer services available
for the higher densities and will thus be suitable for single-family
residential units. Other areas within these districts will have adequate public
water and sewer service available and will thus be suitable for higher density
uses such as multi-family residential units and Planned Unit Developments.
These districts also provide for various recreational and community service
uses that will complement the residential development. These districts will be
applied within those areas designated on the Land Use Plan as Multi-Family
Residential, R-3A and R-3B.2, 3
      (4)   Commercial Service Districts (CS-1 and CS-2). The Commercial
Service Districts (CS-1) (CS-2) are primarily intended to provide suitable
locations for clustered commercial development, to encourage the concentration
of commercial activity in those specified areas with access to major traffic
arteries, and to discourage strip commercial development. These districts will
usually be applied to existing commercial developments on sites within areas
designated on the Land Use Plan as Commercial Service Centers. These districts
may also be applied to suitable areas adjacent to existing commercial
concentrations to allow for their expansion. CS-2 shall be contiguous to other
commercial zones.
      (5)   Private-Public Service District (PS and PS-C). The Private-Public
Service District (PS) is primarily intended to be an area containing a
concentration of private and public service activities such as schools,
recreation parks and emergency services, amidst population centers. This
district will apply to those areas designated on the Land Use Plan as Private-
Public Service Centers.
      (6)   Beech Mountain Resort District (BMR). The Beech Mountain Resort
District (BMR) is primarily intended to be an area used as a ski resort, theme
park or similar recreational area. This district is further intended for
activities related to such use.4
      (7)   MH Mobile Homes;5
      (8)   MP Memorial Park.

§ 154.071 OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Overlay Districts will impose additional restrictions on top of the
existing requirements of the underlying General Use District.
   (B)   Each district described below constitutes an Overlay District.
      (1)   Buckeye Creek Water Supply Watershed WS II. WS II is an overlay
district as shown on the official Zoning Map primarily intended to maintain a
predominantly undeveloped land use intensity pattern. Single-family uses, where
permitted, shall be allowed at a maximum of one dwelling unit per acre on a
project by project basis. All other residential and non-residential development
shall be allowed a maximum of 12% built-upon area, where permitted. In
addition, commercial uses may occupy 5% of the balance of the watershed with a
70% built-upon area when approved as a special, non-residential intensity
allocation (SNIA). The Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve SNIA’s
consistent with the provisions of this chapter. Projects must minimize built-
upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface waters and incorporate
Best Management Practices to minimize water quality impacts. 1 Landfills and
sites for the land application of residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils are
prohibited in the district. No activity, situation, structure or land use shall
be allowed within the WS-II and WS-II-C water supply watersheds which poses a
threat to water quality or the public health, safety and welfare. Such
conditions may arise from (for example) inadequate on-site sewage systems,
inadequate sedimentation and erosion control measures, the improper storage or
disposal of junk, trash or other refuse within a buffer area, the improper
management of storm water runoff or any other situation found to pose a threat
to water quality. 2
      (2)   Buckeye Creek Water Supply Watershed Critical Area WS II C. WS II C
is an overlay district as shown on the official Zoning Map intended to maintain
a predominantly undeveloped land use pattern. Because of the district’s
proximity to a water supply intake, single-family uses, where permitted, shall
be allowed at a maximum of one dwelling unit per two acres on a project by
project basis. All other residential and non-residential development shall be
allowed a maximum of 6% built-upon area where permitted. 3 Landfills and sites
for the land application of residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils are
prohibited in the district. No activity, situation, structure or land use shall
be allowed within the WS-II and WS-II-C water supply watersheds which poses a
threat to water quality or the public health, safety and welfare. Such
conditions may arise from (for example) inadequate on-site sewage systems,
inadequate sedimentation and erosion control measures, the improper storage or
disposal of junk, trash or other refuse within a buffer area, the improper
management of storm water runoff or any other situation found to pose a threat
to water quality. 4
      (3)   Pond Creek Water Supply Watershed Critical Area WS-II-C. WS-II-C-is
an overlay district as shown on the official Zoning Map primarily intended to
maintain a predominantly undeveloped land use intensity pattern. Because of the
district's proximity to a water supply intake, single-family uses, where
permitted, shall be allowed at a maximum of one dwelling unit per two acres on
a project by project basis. All other residential and non-residential
development shall be allowed a maximum of 6% built-upon area where permitted.
Landfills and sites for the land application of residuals or petroleum
contaminated soils are prohibited in the district. No activity, situation,
structure or land use shall be allowed within the WS-II and WS-II-C water
supply watersheds which pose a threat to water quality or the public health,
safety, or welfare. Such conditions may arise from (for example) inadequate on-
site sewage systems, inadequate sedimentation and erosion control measures, the
improper management of stormwater runoff or any other situation found to pose a
threat to water quality.
      (4)   Pond Creek WS-II. WS-II is an overlay district as shown on the
official Zoning Map primarily intended to maintain a predominantly undeveloped
land use intensity pattern. Single-family uses, where permitted, shall be
allowed at a maximum of one dwelling unit per acre on a project by project
basis. All other residential and non-residential development shall be allowed a
maximum of 12% built-upon area, where permitted. In addition, commercial uses
may occupy 5% of the balance of the watershed with a 70% built-upon area when
approved as a special, non-residential intensity allocation (SNIA). The Zoning
Administrator is authorized to approve SNIA's consistent with the provisions of
this chapter. Projects must minimize built-upon surface area, direct storm
water away from surface waters and incorporate best management practices to
minimize water quality impacts. Landfills and sites for the land application of
residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils are prohibited in the district. No
activity, situation, structure or land use shall be allowed within the WS-II
and WS-II-C water supply watersheds which pose a threat to water quality or the
public health, safety and welfare. Such conditions may arise from (for example)
inadequate on-site sewage systems, inadequate sedimentation and erosion control
measures, the improper storage or disposal of junk, trash or other refuse
within a buffer area, the improper management of storm water runoff or any
other situation found to pose a threat to water quality.
      (5)   Pond Creek WS-III. In order to maintain a low to moderate land use
intensity, single family detached uses shall develop at a maximum of two
dwelling units per acre (2 du/ac). All other residential and non-residential
development shall be allowed at a maximum of 24% built-upon area. In addition,
new development and expansions to existing development may occupy 10% of the
balance of the watershed area with up to 70% built-upon area when approved as a
special intensity allocation (SIA). The Zoning Administrator is authorized to
approve SIAs consistent with the provisions of this division (B)(5). Projects
must, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize built-upon surface area,
direct storm water away from surface waters and incorporate best management
practices to minimize water quality impacts.
      (6)   Commercial Thoroughfare Overlay District. The commercial corridor
for the town is an area predominantly used for retail, restaurants, inns and
other commercial establishments in which the public is typically invited and
welcomed to use and enjoy the space. This area is also the face the town puts
on to the public, being the area that visitors and guests are exposed to first,
and the area from which their impressions about the town are generated. Good
design in this area will increase the value of the town’s properties as a
whole, and promote the town’s goal as a resort destination. Therefore, this
area has a need to ensure design characteristics that are harmonious with the
town’s vision for the community and that enhance the quaint, mountain-town
character. Accordingly, an overlay district has been established in which
design regulations are applicable in addition to regulations of the underlying
base district. Where provisions of this Overlay District are found to be in
conflict with the underlying base zoning district, the more stringent
regulations shall apply. Architectural standards for development in the
Commercial Thoroughfare Overlay District are found in §§ 154.120 et seq.
   (C)   Other. Landfills and sites for the land application of residuals or
petroleum-contaminated soils are prohibited in all the watershed districts.
   (D)   Conditions that pose a threat to waterways. No activity, situation,
structure or land use shall be allowed within the WS-II and WS-II-C water
supply watersheds which poses a threat to water quality or the public health,
safety and welfare. Such conditions may arise from (for example) inadequate on-
site sewage systems, inadequate sedimentation and erosion control measures, the
improper storage or disposal of junk, trash or other refuse within a buffer
area, the improper management of storm water runoff or any other situation
found to pose a threat to water quality.

1  Due to the scenic beauty of Beech Mountain, its reputation as a peaceful
retirement and resort area community, its emphasis on tourism, the elevation of
the town and its views, the Council finds that heavy manufacturing and
processing would be incompatible with the community of the Town of Beech
Mountain and would injure the nature of the community and its focus on tourism,
nature, and recreation.
   A Special Use Permit shall not be required for a satellite dish that is (a)
no greater than 24 inches in diameter, (b) attached to the building structure,
and (c) placed no higher than the highest point of the structure.

the hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in Beech Mountain
published at least five days prior to the date of the hearing. The Board shall
mail notices of the hearing to the affected parties, to members of the Planning
Board, and to such other persons as the Zoning Administrator shall direct at
least seven days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall state the location of
the building or lot, the general nature of the applicant’s request, and the
time and place of the hearing. 2
   (D)   Copies of final development plan to be submitted. At least ten days
prior to the date set for the hearing, the applicant shall submit three copies
of the final development plan to the Zoning Administrator. The development plan
shall contain a map or maps drawn to scale, with the date of preparation, and
shall contain, where applicable, the following information:
      (1)   Existing site conditions, including contours, water courses,
identified flood hazard areas, any unique natural or man made features.
      (2)   Boundary lines of the proposed development, proposed lot lines and
plot designs.
      (3)   Proposed location and use of all existing and proposed structures.

before the Board shall be placed under oath and the opposing party may cross-
examine them.
      (2)   Rehearings. An application for a rehearing may be made in the same
manner as provided for an original hearing. Evidence in support of the
application shall initially be limited to that which is necessary to enable the
Board to determine whether there has been a substantial change in the facts,
evidence, or conditions in the case. The application for rehearing shall be
denied by the Board if from the record it finds that there has been no
substantial change in facts, evidence or conditions. If the Board finds that
there has been a change, it shall thereupon treat the request in the same
manner as any other application.
   (F)   Conditions for granting approval.
      (1)   If the Board of Adjustment finds that, in the particular case in
question, the use for which the Special Use Permit is sought will not adversely
affect the health or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood
of the proposed use, and will not be detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to property or public improvements in the neighborhood, a permit may
be granted. In granting such a permit, the Board of Adjustment may designate
such conditions in connection therewith as will, in its opinion, assure that
the proposed use will conform to the requirements and spirit of this chapter.
      (2)   If at any time after a Special Use Permit has been issued the Board
of Adjustment finds that the conditions imposed and agreements made have not
been or are not being fulfilled by the holder of a Special Use Permit, the

   (I)   Planned Unit Developments.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to encourage and provide
for flexibility and innovation in the design and location of structures and
land development, to provide for mixtures of housing types and land use, to
provide for the most efficient use of land resources, and to provide an
opportunity to develop land areas in a manner different from the standard
arrangement of one principal building on one lot. Residential densities are
calculated on a project basis, thus allowing the clustering of buildings in
order to create useful open spaces and preserve natural site features. It is
further intended that a Planned Unit Development will be in harmony with the
character of the district in which it is located.
      (2)   Planned Unit Development defined. Any development where more than
one principal building or use is proposed to be constructed on a single lot, or
any building with a gross floor area of 25,000 square feet or more, shall be
deemed a Planned Unit Development (PUD). Residential units within a PUD may
include single-family detached or attached units, townhouse developments,
garden apartments, patio homes, condominiums, and other type residential units
excluding mobile homes and mobile home parks.
      (3)   Land development standards. The following land development
standards shall apply for all Planned Unit Developments. PUDs may be located in
the R-3 districts as conditional uses, subject to a finding by the Board of
Adjustment that certain conditions be met:
         (a)    Ownership control. The land in a PUD shall be under single
ownership or management by the applicant before final approval and/or
construction, or proper assurances (legal title or execution of a binding sales
agreement) shall be provided that the development can be successfully completed
by the applicant.
         (b)   Density requirements. There are no density requirements for non-
residential uses as long as the proposed project does not violate the intent of
the district in which it is located. The proposed residential density of the
PUD (dwelling units per acre as shown in §
154.105) shall conform to that permitted in the district in which the
development is located. If the PUD lies in more than one district, the number
of allowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each portion of
the PUD that is in a separate district, and must then be combined to determine
the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire Planned Unit Development.
         (c)   Frontage requirements. PUDs shall have access to a highway or
road suitable for the scale and density of development being proposed.
         (d)   Land uses. A mixture of land uses shall be allowed in any PUD.
However, within residential districts, non-residential uses shall not
constitute the primary use in the PUD, and non-residential uses shall be
carefully designed to complement the residential uses within the PUD. All PUDs
must be compatible with and not violate the intent of the zoning district.
         (e)   Minimum requirements.
            1.   Waived. The normal minimum lot size, setbacks and frontage
requirements are hereby waived for the PUD, provided that the spirit and intent
of this section is complied with in the total development plan, as determined
by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall exercise ultimate
discretion as to whether the total development plan does comply with the spirit
and intent of this section.
            2.   Height limitations. No building or structure shall exceed the
height limitations of the district in which it is located.
            3.   Required distance between buildings. The minimum distance
between buildings shall be 20 feet or as otherwise specified by the Board of
Adjustment to ensure adequate air, light, privacy, and space for emergency
vehicles.
            4.   Access to common use areas; streets, walkways, etc. Every
dwelling unit shall have access to a public or private street, walkway or other
area dedicated to common use, and there shall be provision for adequate
vehicular circulation to all development properties in order to ensure
acceptable levels of access for emergency vehicles. All roads within a Planned
Unit Development shall meet the minimum construction standards for subdivision
roads of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, Division of Highways'
Subdivision Roads Minimum Construction Standards dated April, 1983 (as amended)
with only the following exception: A reduced right-of-way of 40 feet will be
permitted if a reduced width is essentially unavoidable due to topographic
reasons and is approved by the Town Manager and/or Director of Public Works.6
            5.   Access to public road. All Planned Unit Developments must have
access to a public road that meets the minimum construction standards for
subdivision roads of the Division of Highways of the North Carolina Department
of Transportation with the exception that in lieu of paving, the developer may
use a minimum of eight inches of state approved Aggregate Base Course (ABC). In
addition, all such access roads to Planned Unit Developments must be approved
by the Director of Public Works for the Town of Beech Mountain and the Fire
Chief of the Beech Mountain Volunteer Fire Department to insure the
accessibility by emergency or municipal vehicles over such access roads to the
Planned Unit Development.7
         (f)   Privacy. Each development shall provide reasonable visual and
acoustical privacy for all dwelling units. Fences, insulation, walks, barriers,
and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, for the protection and aesthetic
enhancement of property and the privacy of its occupants, screening of
objectionable views or uses, and reduction of noise. Multilevel buildings shall
be located within a PUD in such a way as to dissipate any adverse impact on
adjoining low-rise buildings and shall not invade the privacy of the occupants
of such low-rise buildings.
         (g)   Perimeter requirements.
            1.   Structures located on the perimeter of the development must be
set back from property lines and rights-of-way of abutting streets in

   (Q)   Wind energy system-commercial.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the wind power
turbines and other wind energy systems in order to preserve the character of
the mountain and to protect its citizens from potential nuisances caused by
these systems, while also allowing for the clean and renewable energy provided
by these systems should they meet certain criteria.
      (2)   Definition. For the purpose of this division, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         WIND ENERGY SYSTEM HEIGHT. The height above the original natural grade
of the land on which the system sits (at its highest point directly beneath the
footprint of the system) to the tip of the turbine blade when it reaches its
highest elevation.
      (3)   Standards for wind energy systems. The Board of Adjustments shall
deny any application for a special use permit for a wind energy system that it
determines will be out of harmony with the character of the community and its
land use plan for the area in which the turbine is proposed, that it determines
would be unsafe or presents a potential safety hazard, or that it determines
will be a nuisance due to its appearance, size, noise generated, and the like.
In making such a determination, the Board shall consider the following
standards.
         (a)   Wind energy system height. Height shall be limited to 100 feet.
         (b)   Site location and setback. No part of a wind energy system
(including overhanging blades or appurtenances) shall be closer to surrounding
property lines than the height of the wind energy system unless a North
Carolina registered professional engineer certifies the fall zone of the wind
energy system and appurtenances will be within the setback area proposed. In
addition, no wind energy system shall be located closer to an inhabited
structure on adjacent property than three times the height of the wind energy
system. Furthermore, a wind energy system may not be located closer to another
wind energy system than five times the height of the wind energy system. No
wind energy system may be located on a tract of land less than five acres in
area. No part of a wind energy system (including overhanging blades or
appurtenances) may be located within the required building setbacks on a lot or
tract.
         (c)    Building permit requirements. A building permit shall be
required. Building permit applications for wind energy systems shall be
accompanied by standard drawings of the wind energy system structure, including
the tower, base, and footings. An engineering analysis of the tower certified
by a licensed professional engineer which includes standards for ice/wind
loading shall also be submitted. This analysis may be supplied by the
manufacturer.
         (d)   Compliance with other applicable laws. Wind energy systems must
comply with applicable FAA regulations, including any necessary approvals for
installations close to airports. Evidence of compliance or non-applicability
shall be submitted with the application. Wind energy systems must also comply
with any other applicable state or local laws, including the “Ridge Line Law”
(G.S. §§ 113A-205 et seq.).
         (e)   Utility notification. No wind energy system shall be installed
until evidence has been given that the utility company has been informed of the
customer’s intent to install an interconnected customer-owned generator. Off-
grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement.
         (f)   Appearance. Wind energy systems shall maintain a galvanized
finish or be painted to conform to the surrounding environment to reduce visual
obtrusiveness. No wind energy system should have any signage, or writing or
pictures that may be construed as advertising placed on it at any time. In
addition no flags, streamers or decorative items may be attached to the wind
energy system.
         (g)   Removal of defective or abandoned wind energy systems. Any wind
energy system that is not functional shall be repaired by the owner or removed.
In the event that the town becomes aware of any wind energy system that is not
operated for a continuous period of six months, the town will notify the
landowner by registered mail and provide 45 days for a written response. In
such a response, the landowner shall set forth reasons for the operational
difficulty and provide a reasonable timetable for corrective action. If the
town deems the timetable for corrective action as unreasonable, the town shall
notify the landowner and such landowner shall remove the energy system with 120
days of receipt of the notice.

Adjustments shall deny any application for a special use permit for a wind
energy system that it determines will be out of harmony with the character of
the community and its land use plan for the area in which the turbine is
proposed, that it determines would be unsafe or presents a potential safety
hazard, or that it determines will be a nuisance due to its appearance, size,
noise generated, and the like. In making such a determination, the Board shall
consider the following standards.
         (a)   Use. Accessory systems are to be located on the same tract of
land as a permitted residential dwelling or commercial building, and are to be
designed such that their primary function is to produce energy for consumption
by the residential dwelling or commercial building with which they share the
lot or tract of land.
         (b)   Frequency. A maximum of one wind energy system-accessory unit is
permitted per lot.
         (c)   Site location and setback. Accessory units are not permitted in
street yards (the portion of the yard that abuts a street or road and is nearer
to the street or road than the primary structure on the lot). Wind energy
systems may not be located in or overhang above the required building setbacks
for a lot or tract.
         (d)   Height. Accessory units may not extend to a height of greater
than 15 feet above the highest point of the structure to which they are
accessory or 50 feet in total height, whichever is lesser. Total height shall
be measured vertically from the highest point of the wind energy system to the
ground. Mounding of dirt or rocks to achieve an artificially high ground level
shall not be considered in this calculation.
         (e)   Noise. Units cannot produce more than 40 decibels when in
operation, measured at the lot line.
         (f)   Operation. Units are required to have a cut-in speed of at least
seven miles per hour. “Cut-in speed” is the wind velocity at which a wind
energy system begins operation.
         (g)   Compliance with other applicable laws. Wind energy systems must
comply with applicable FAA regulations, including any necessary approvals for
installations close to airports. Evidence of compliance or non-applicability
shall be submitted with the application. Wind energy systems must also comply
with any other applicable state or local laws, including the “Ridge Line Law”
(G.S. §§ 113A-205 et seq.).
         (h)   Appearance. Wind energy systems shall maintain a galvanized
finish or be painted to conform to the surrounding environment to reduce visual
obtrusiveness. No wind energy system should have any signage, or writing or
pictures that may be construed as advertising placed on it at any time. In
addition no flags, streamers or decorative items may be attached to the wind
energy system.
         (i)   Building permit requirements. A building permit shall be
required. Building permit applications for wind energy systems shall be
accompanied by standard drawings of the wind energy system structure, including
the tower, base, and footings. An engineering analysis of the tower certified
by a licensed professional engineer which includes standards for ice/wind

that the fall zone of the wind energy system and appurtenances will be within
the boundaries of the property on which it is located.
         (j)   Utility notification. No wind energy system shall be installed
until evidence has been given that the utility company has been informed of the

energy system that is not functional shall be repaired by the owner or removed.
In the event that the town becomes aware of any wind energy system that is not
operated for a continuous period of six months, the town will notify the
landowner by registered mail and provide 45 days for a written response. In
such a response, the landowner shall set forth reasons for the operational
difficulty and provide a reasonable timetable for corrective action. If the
town deems the timetable for corrective action as unreasonable, the town shall
notify the landowner and such landowner shall remove the energy system with 120
days of receipt of the notice.
   (S)   Manufacturing/processing, light.
      (1)   Purpose. The Council finds that the residential/resort character of
the area within Beech Mountain’s planning jurisdiction is incompatible with the
development of such area for manufacturing/processing uses except to the extent
that such uses create none of the negative impacts often associated with such
manufacturing/processing uses. Therefore, no manufacturing/processing use
within any zoning district may:
         (a)   Emit from a vent, stock, chimney, or combustion process any
smoke that is visible to the naked eye that is a result of the process of
manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing, renovating, painting, cleaning,
or assembling of goods, merchandise, or equipment.
         (b)   Generate noise in the course of manufacturing of greater than 40
decibels as measured at the lot line between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Between the hours of 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. the Town of Beech Mountain’s general
noise regulations as coded in § 94.25 of the Beech Mountain Code of Ordinances
shall apply.
         (c)   Generate any ground transmitted vibration that is perceptible to
the human sense of touch measured at the lot line.
         (d)   Generate any odor that reaches the “odor threshold” measured at
the lot line. For purposes of this subdivision, the ODOR THRESHOLD is defined
as the minimum concentration in air of a agas, vapor, or particulate matter
that can be detected by the olfactory systems of a panel of healthy observers.
         (e)   Require for its operations a daily average of more than 200
gallons of water per employee.
         (f)   Create any electrical disturbance that adversely affects any
operations or equipment other than those of the creator of such disturbance, or
otherwise causes, creates, or contributes to the interference with electronic
signals (including television and radio broadcasting transmissions) to the
extent that the operation of any equipment not owned by the creator of such
disturbance is adversely affected.
         (g)   Store materials necessary for the manufacturing or processing
activity in a location where such materials are visible from beyond the
boundaries of the property on which the manufacturing/processing facility is
located.
         (h)   Semi-trucks or tractor trailers may be used to deliver or pick
up materials but may not remain on the premises continuously for more than 48
hours. Such trucks or trailers may not be used as a means to store materials
necessary for the manufacturing or processing activity or finished products of
the manufacturing activity.
         (i)   Manufacturing/processing, light facilities already in existence
at the time of the adoption of this subsection shall be required to apply for
special use permits and comply with the requirements herein.
   (T)   Alternative building methods in the Commercial Thoroughfare Overlay
District.
      (1)   Roof designs, building materials, building sizes (scale), color
schemes, window types and numbers, and landscaping arrangements, other than
those specifically listed as allowed in §
154.122, may be allowed if the totality of the design indicates harmony and
compatibility with the Commercial Thoroughfare Overlay District, and its
purpose of fostering a functional, visually appealing and vibrant commercial
district in Beech Mountain.
      (2)   The Board may impose additional conditions necessary to ensure the
proposed use will be compliant with the spirit and intent of the Commercial
Thoroughfare Overlay District.
   (U)   Sexually oriented businesses.
      (1)   (a)   The purpose of the following special use standards shall be
to set forth the regulatory and requirements for adult establishments located
within the town. Adult establishments, because of their very nature are
recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics. Studies
and experiences that are relevant to North Carolina have shown that lower
property values and increased crime rates tend to accompany and are brought
about by adult establishments. The Town Council finds that regulation of these
uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse secondary effects do not
contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and to regulate acts,
omissions or conditions detrimental to the health, safety or welfare and the
peace and dignity of the town. Regulations to achieve these purposes can be
accomplished by the procedures set forth hereinafter.
         (b)   The provisions of the following standards have neither the
purpose nor effect for imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of
any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly,
it is not the intent nor effect of these standards to restrict or deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. These standards represent a balancing of the legitimate ends
of the community by imposing an incidental, content neutral place, time and
manner regulation of sexually oriented businesses, without limiting alternative
avenues of communication and at the same time, requiring the business to carry
its share of financing administrative and enforcement activities.

characteristics of the site. In hilly terrain, clustering of buildings is
encouraged as a strategy to avoid destroying sensitive natural areas.
         (f)   Buildings shall be designed to harmonize with the existing
topography, thereby minimizing land disruption.
         (g)   Grading shall be held to a minimum and should complement natural
land forms (such as smooth gradations or terracing).
      (2)   Relationships of the project to adjoining area.

instead shall reflect the context of the adjoining properties.
         (b)   Grading shall blend gently with contours of adjacent properties.
         (c)   Buildings at the ends of streets, or at street corners, shall
serve as visual “terminals,” serving to both unify and conclude the
architectural statement made on the street.
         (d)   Proposed recreation areas or uses shall complement nearby
existing uses. The extension of existing parks or recreation areas into a
proposed development is a highly desirable design feature.
         (e)   Buildings or projects located near or adjacent to a greenway
shall provide safe and efficient pedestrian connection to that greenway, and
also to adjacent properties that might include pedestrian systems in the
future.
         (f)   Buffer zones shall separate and protect the greenway, while at
the same time connect it to the building site.
         (g)   Natural drainage patterns shall be preserved where possible.
Changing the natural drainage areas will affect the drainage onto adjoining
areas. New offsite drainage created by the development shall be prevented or
adequately controlled with stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs).
         (h)   Innovative building and site design can capitalize on natural
drainage ways and transform steep slopes into major site amenities.
         (i)   Design shall insure that drainage occurs only in areas designed
to serve a drainage function. Stormwater should not flow over sidewalks, paths
or streets.
      (3)   Streetscape.
         (a)   Along and adjacent to the street frontage property line, there
shall be enough room to accommodate the planting of trees and shrubs (minimum
of a five-foot-wide planting strip). The street will be enclosed, pedestrians
will be separated from the cars (where applicable) and the view will be framed.
Where a town-maintained public walkway/sidewalk is located on the applicant’s
property in the five feet immediately adjacent to the property line, the five-
foot planting strip shall be measured from the edge of the walkway/sidewalk.
See division (H) below for planting requirements in this area.
         (b)   Street furniture should complement the overall site and
landscape design. It shall reflect the natural mountain character of Beech
Mountain, such as the use of wood and stone for benches, trash receptacles, and
the like.
         (c)   Where a pedestrian plan officially adopted by the town depicts
sidewalks/walkways within the applicant’s property, the applicant shall
dedicate to the town an easement for the construction, maintenance and
beautification of sidewalks/walkways and associated landscaping elements. The
easement shall extend to any portion of the applicant’s property that lies
within seven and a half feet on either side of the location of centerline of
the walkway as depicted on the plan. This area may count towards the required
minimum setback and the five-foot planting strip as required above.
   (B)   Building scale. Scale and proportion should reflect local traditions
of mountain buildings. They should be oriented to the characteristic, simple
residential buildings of Beech Mountain. Texture of roof and wall finishes
shall provide a scale or reference point for the pedestrian in proximity to the
structure.

natural materials, are prohibited.
   (H)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Street trees. The planting strip required by §
154.122(A)(3)(e) shall be planted with street trees as follows:
         a.   One large shade tree (expected height of 35 feet or more at
maturity) is required for every 50 feet of linear street frontage of the lot,
minus the width of driveways and access points. Trees do not need to be spaced
evenly. They may be clustered with a minimum spacing of 15 feet and a maximum
spacing of 75 feet. Ornamental trees (expected height of 25 feet upon maturity)
may be used in place of shade trees at the rate of one for every 30 feet. Due
to above-ground utilities, the town may require the use of ornamental trees in
place of large shade trees.
         b.   Inclusion of existing trees in the landscape design is
encouraged. Shrubbery, ground cover, and other planting materials shall be used
to compliment the tree planting. No area of the street yard may be exposed
soil, but instead shall be covered with vegetation, whether grass or shrubbery.
The only area that shall remain uncovered is the six-foot radius surrounding
the trunk of any tree; however, this area shall be mulched.
      (2)   Existing vegetation. Existing trees and vegetation, other than
exotic, non-native species, may count toward meeting the requirements of this
section, when such vegetation is in good condition, is properly protected
during development, and helps to further the purpose of the district. Existing
vegetation that is used to meet the standards of this section shall be
maintained or replaced if it dies during the first year after the completion of
the development.
      (3)   New plant material. Regionally grown and native species of plants
are preferred. Any plant listed with the Agricultural Extension Office as a
native plant shall be considered to be a native plant for these purposes. New
plant material shall complement existing site vegetation, should be mixed with
it and should be integrated with all other natural site features.
   (I)   Parking lots; parking lot yards. The purpose of this section is to
ensure that the Commercial Thoroughfare Overlay District of Beech Mountain is
an attractive and appealing place for residents and visitors. This often means
that a higher priority must be placed upon being an attractive and functional
place for people than being convenient for automobiles.
      (1)   Parking location. Parking is encouraged to be located to the rear
or sides of buildings, with the building fronting on the public way. However,
nothing in this section is to prevent the establishment of parking in front of
a building so long as the project adheres to all other relevant regulations.
When parking is to be established in front of buildings, it is recommended that
the applicant create and utilize on-street parking if such is approved by the
NCDOT and/or the town. (For the purposes of this section, ON-STREET PARKING is
defined as a parking area without a divider between the street and the parking
area, in which automobiles directly access the parking spaces from the road.
On-street parking may be parallel, angled or straight in, as approved by the
NCDOT and the town.)
   (J)   Buffer yards. The purpose of the buffer yard is to provide a
transitional area between uses that may differ in development intensity and
density. A BUFFER YARD is defined as a planting yard that serves as a visual
separation between uses and should be densely planted. No buildings, parking
areas or other development may encroach within the buffer yard, with the
exception of town-approved public walkways or sidewalks. Refer to §
154.165 for the standards for buffer yards.

purpose. The provisions and requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) regarding parking requirements shall be satisfied.
   (C)   Location on other property. 4 If the required vehicle parking spaces
cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot on which the principal use is
conducted, such spaces may be provided on other off-street property, provided
(a) such property lies adjacent to the property of the principal use, and (b)
the owner of the principal use lot has an irrevocable exclusive parking
easement recorded at the Public Registry allowing said owner to use the
adjacent lot for parking that benefits the principal use lot. The parking

LIGHTING
§ 154.151 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide regulations that preserve and
enhance the view of the dark sky; promote health, safety, security, and
productivity; and help protect natural resources by promoting energy
efficiency. The provisions of this subchapter are intended to control glare,
light trespass, and the obtrusive aspects of excessive and/or careless outdoor
light usage. It is the intent of this subchapter to provide standards for
appropriate lighting practices and systems that will enable people to see
essential detail in order that they may undertake their activities at night,
facilitate safety and security of persons and property, and curtail the
degradation of the nighttime visual environment.
(Ord. 2016-09, passed 8-9-2016 ; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)
§ 154.152 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCENT LIGHTING. Any luminaire that emphasizes a particular object or draws
attention to a particular area for aesthetic purposes.
   CUT-OFF ANGLE (of a luminaire). The angle, measured from the lowest point

the first line of sight at which the bare source is not visible.
   FIXTURE (also called a LUMINAIRE). A complete lighting unit including the
lamps, together with the parts required to distribute the light, to position
and protect the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply.
   FOOT-CANDLE. A measure of illuminance or a measure of how bright a light
appears to the eye. One foot-candle is equal to one Lumen/ft2. As an example, a
typical 60-watt incandescent lamp (840 lumens) produces an illuminance of 0.1
foot-candles at a distance of about 25 feet.
   FOSSIL FUEL LIGHT. Any outdoor lighting fixture producing light directly by
the combustion of natural gas or other fossil fuel.
   LAMP. The light-producing source installed in the socket portion of a
luminaire.
   LIGHT POLLUTION. General sky glow caused by the scattering of artificial
light in the atmosphere and resulting in decreased ability to see the natural
night sky.
   LIGHT TRESPASS. Any light emitted by an outdoor luminaire that shines
directly beyond the property on which the luminaire is installed, or indirectly
shines beyond the property on which the luminaire is installed at a brightness
(illuminance) that exceeds 0.1 foot-candles at the property line.
   LUMINAIRE. See definition for FIXTURE.
   OUTDOOR LIGHTING FIXTURE. A luminaire outside of an enclosed building or
structure or any luminaire directed such that it primarily illuminates outdoor
areas.
   PUBLIC STREETLIGHT. A light that is erected and owned by the electric
utility company, is located within the right of way of a public street or on
other property owned or maintained by the town, and for which the cost of
operation is borne by the town.
   SHIELDING. That no light rays are emitted by a fixture above the horizontal
plane running through the lowest point of the fixture.
   SPOTLIGHT. Any lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to
concentrate the light output into a directed beam in a particular direction.
   STROBE LIGHT. A lamp that produces very short, intense flashes of light.
   USE, ABANDONMENT OF. The relinquishment of a property, or the cessation of a
use or activity for a continuous period of 12 months, excluding temporary or
short term interruptions for the purpose of remodeling, maintaining or
rearranging a facility. A use shall be deemed abandoned when such use is
suspended as evidenced by the cessation of activities or conditions that
constitute the principal use of the property.
(Ord. 2016-09, passed 8-9-2016 ; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)
§ 154.153 APPLICABILITY.
   All outdoor lighting fixtures installed on private and public property shall
comply with this subchapter. This subchapter does not apply to interior
lighting; provided, that if it is determined by the town that any interior

commercial or public may not install lighting fixtures that create a light
trespass upon a residentially zoned property.
   (L)   Public streetlights that emit less than 3,000 kelvin and are of the
100 Watt High Pressure Sodium or LED lighting type shall be exempt from the
restrictions on light trespass in this subchapter, provided that the Town of
Beech Mountain, as financier of such lighting may request that Mountain
Electric modify or remove such lighting at its discretion.

lighting fixtures and accent lighting:
   (A)   Light trespass is prohibited.
   (B)   Outdoor lighting fixtures and accent lighting must be shielded and
aimed downward or toward the object which they illuminate, without encroaching
beyond such object. The shield must mask the direct horizontal surface of the
light source or direct light at a specific illuminated object. The light must
be aimed to insure that the illumination is only pointing downward onto the
ground surface or at the specific object, with no escaping direct light
permitted to contribute to light pollution by shining upward into the sky.
   (C)   All outdoor lighting fixtures and accent lighting shall be designed,
installed, located and maintained such that there is no light trespass.

related land-disturbing activity on the tract; and
   (C)   Activities for which a permit is required under the Mining Act of
1971, G.S. Ch. 74, Art. 7.
   (D)   Land-disturbing activity over which the state has exclusive regulatory
jurisdiction as provided in G.S. § 113A-56(a).
   (E)   For the duration of an emergency, activities essential to protect
human life.
(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art. XVII, § 1702) (Ord. passed 11-14-1995; Ord.
2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)
§ 154.213 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Plan required. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity
which uncovers more than one-half acre without having an erosion control plan
approved by the Town of Beech Mountain.
   (B)   Protection of property. Persons conducting land-disturbing activity
shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property
from damage caused by such activity.
   (C)   More restrictive rules shall apply. Whenever conflicts exist between
federal, state or local laws, ordinance or rules, the more restrictive
provision shall apply.
(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art. XVII, § 1703) (Ord. passed 11-14-1995; Ord.

§ 154.214 BASIC CONTROL OBJECTIVES.
   An erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved pursuant to §
154.225 of this subchapter if the plan fails to address the following control
objectives.
   (A)   Identify critical areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe
erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from
erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special
attention.
   (B)   Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned
and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time.
   (C)   Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and
conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time.
   (D)   Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of
exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during
the period of exposure.
   (E)   Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned
and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage.
   (F)   Manage storm water runoff. When the increase in the velocity of storm
water runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause
accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures
to control the velocity to the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated
erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream.

   No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this subchapter shall
be undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards.
   (A)   Buffer zone.
      (1)   No land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or
improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural
watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the
watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25% of
the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity. This subdivision shall
not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of
facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse. 1
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided, the width of a buffer zone is measured
from the edge of the water to the nearest edge of the disturbed area, with the
25% of the strip nearer the land-disturbing activity containing natural or
artificial means of confining visible siltation.
      (3)   The 25-foot minimum width for an undisturbed buffer zone adjacent
to designated trout waters shall be measured horizontally from the top of the
bank.
      (4)   Where a temporary and minimal disturbance has been permitted as an
exception by §
154.224(A)(1) of this chapter, land-disturbing activities in the buffer zone
adjacent to designated trout waters shall be limited to a maximum of 10% of the
total length of the buffer zone within the tract to be distributed such that
there is not more than 100 linear feet of disturbance in each 1,000 linear feet
of buffer zone. Larger areas may be disturbed with the written approval of the
Director. 2
      (5)   No land-disturbing activity shall be undertaken within a buffer
zone adjacent to designated trout waters that will cause adverse temperature
fluctuations, as set forth in 15A NCAC 02B .0211 (Fresh Surface Water Quality
Standards for Class C Waters), in these waters.
   (B)   Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall
be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other
adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left
exposed will, within 21 calendar of completion of any phase of grading,
whichever is shorter, be planted or otherwise provided with ground cover,
devices or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. 3
   (C)   Fill material.  Materials being used as fill shall be consistent with
those described in 15A NCAC 13B.0562 unless the site is permitted by the
Department’s Division of Waste Management to operate as a landfill. Not all
materials described in Section .0562 may be suitable to meet geotechnical
considerations of the fill activity and should be evaluated accordingly.  4
   (D)   Ground cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a
tract comprising more than one-half acre, if more than one-half acre is
uncovered, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install
such sedimentation and erosion control devices and practices as are sufficient
to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the
boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said tract,
and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to
restrain erosion after completion of construction or development. Except as
provided in §
154.216(B)(5) below, provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain
erosion must be accomplished within 90 calendar days following completion of
construction or development. 5
   (E)   Prior plan approval. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing
activity on a tract if more than one-half acre is to be uncovered unless, 30 or
more days prior to initiating the activity, an erosion and sedimentation
control plan for such activity is filed with and approved by the Town of Beech
Mountain.

§ 154.216 DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) below, erosion and sedimentation
control measures, structures and devices shall be so planned, designed and
constructed as to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of
runoff from the ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the
procedures in the latest edition of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation
Service’s National Engineering Field Handbook, or other acceptable calculation
procedures.
   (B)   In High Quality Water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall
apply:
      (1)   Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a
maximum total area within the boundaries of the tract of 20 acres. Only the
portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW zone shall be governed by
this section. Larger areas may be uncovered within the boundaries of the tract
with the written approval of the Director upon providing engineering
justification with a construction sequence that considers phasing, limiting
exposure, weekly submitted self-inspection reports, and a more conservative
design than the 25-year storm.
      (2)   Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and devices
within HQW zones shall be so planned, designed and constructed to provide
protection from the run off of the 25-year storm which produces the maximum
peak rate of run off as calculated according to procedures in the latest
edition of the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources
Conservation Service’s National Engineering Field Handbook or according to
procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or
any generally recognized organization or association.
      (3)   (a)   Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and
constructed according to the following criteria:
            1.   Use a surface withdrawal mechanism, except when the basin
drainage area is less than 1.0 acre;
            2.   Have a minimum of 1,800 cubic feet of storage area per acre of
disturbed area;
            3.   Have a minimum surface area of 325 square feet per cfs of the
25-year storm (Q25) peak flow;
            4.   Have a minimum dewatering time of 48 hours;
            5.   Incorporate three baffles, unless the basin is less than 20
feet in length, in which case two baffles shall be sufficient.
         (b)   Upon a written request of the applicant, the Director may allow
alternative design and control measures in lieu of meeting the conditions
required in divisions (3)(a)2. through (3)(a)5. of this division (B) if the
applicant demonstrates that meeting all of those conditions will result in
design or operational hardships and that the alternative measures will provide
an equal or more effective level of erosion and sediment control on the site.
Alternative measures may include quicker application of ground cover, use of
sediment flocculants, and use of enhanced ground cover practices.
      (4)   Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and
constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical if
a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions permit a
steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices,
structural devices or other forms of ditch liners proven as being effective in
restraining accelerated erosion. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall
be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion.

§ 154.217 STORM WATER OUTLET PROTECTION.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post
construction velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse
to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:
         (a)   The velocity established by the table in division (D) below of
this section; or
         (b)   The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving
watercourse prior to development.
      (2)   If divisions (A)(1) or (2) above cannot be met, then the receiving
watercourse to and including the discharge point shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds
the "prior to development" velocity by 10%.
   (B)   Acceptable management measures.
      (1)   Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of
this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary
consequences. The Commission recognizes that the management of storm-water
runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a
developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and
may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results
      (2)   Some alternatives are to:
         (a)   Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by
including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff
from areas rendered impervious;
         (b)   Avoid increases in storm-water discharge velocities by using
vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high
velocity paved sections;
         (c)   Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage
facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge. These may range
from simple rip-rapped sections to complex structures; and
         (d)   Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving
cross sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining.
   (C)   Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated
that storm-water discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the
receiving watercourse.

§ 154.220 OPERATIONS IN LAKES OR NATURAL WATERCOURSES.
   Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over or
under a lake or natural watercourse shall be planned and conducted in such a
manner as to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream
channel. The relocation of a stream, where relocation is an essential part of
the proposed activity, shall be planned and executed so as to minimize changes
in the stream flow characteristics, except when justification for significant
alteration to flow characteristic is provided.

§ 154.223 EXISTING UNCOVERED AREAS.
   (A)   All uncovered areas existing on the effective date of this subchapter
which resulted from land-disturbing activity, exceed one-half acre, are subject
to continued accelerated erosion, and are causing off-site damage from
sedimentation, shall be provided with a ground cover or other protective
measures, structures or devices sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion and
control off-site sedimentation.
   (B)   The Town of Beech Mountain will serve upon the landowner or other
person in possession or control of the land a written notice of violation by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means
reasonably calculated to give actual notice. The notice will set forth the
measures needed to comply and will state the time within which such measures
must be completed. In determining the measures required and the time allowed
for compliance, the authority serving notice shall take into consideration the
economic feasibility, technology, and quantity of work required, and shall set
reasonable and attainable time limits of compliance.
   (C)   The Town of Beech Mountain reserves the right to require preparation
and approval of an erosion control plan in any instance where extensive control
measures are required.
   (D)   This rule shall not require ground cover on cleared land forming the
future basin of a planned reservoir.

§ 154.225 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PLANS.
   (A)   (1)   An erosion control plan shall be prepared for all land-
disturbing activities subject to this subchapter whenever the proposed activity
is to be undertaken on a tract comprising more than one-half acre, if more than
one-half acre is to be uncovered.
      (2)   The plan shall be filed with the Town of Beech Mountain, and a copy
shall be simultaneously submitted to the Watauga Soil and Water Conservation
District, at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the proposed activity.
A copy of the Erosion Control Plan for any land-disturbing activity that
involve the utilization of ditches for the purpose of de-watering or lowering
the water table must be forwarded to the Director of the Division of Water
Quality.
      (3)   The approval of an Erosion Control Plan is conditioned on the
applicant's compliance with Federal and State water quality laws, regulations
and rules. 1
   (B)   Persons conducting land-disturbing activity on a tract which covers
one-half or more acres shall file two copies of the erosion control plan with
the town at least 30 days prior to beginning such activity and shall keep
another copy of the plan on file at the job site. After approving the plan, if
the town, either upon review of such plan or on inspection of the job site,
determines that a significant risk of accelerated erosion or off-site
sedimentation exists, the town will require a revised plan. Pending the
preparation of the revised plan, work shall cease or shall continue under
conditions outlined by the appropriate authority.
   (C)   Erosion control plans may be disapproved unless accompanied by an
authorized statement of financial responsibility and ownership. This statement
shall be signed by the person financially responsible for the land-disturbing
activity or his or her attorney in fact. The statement shall include the
mailing and street addresses of the principal place of business of the person
financially responsible and of the owner of the land or their registered
agents. If the person financially responsible is not a resident of North
Carolina, a North Carolina agent must be designated in the statement for the
purpose of receiving notice of compliance or non-compliance with the plan, the
Act, this subchapter or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this
subchapter.
   (D)   The Watauga Soil and Water Conservation District shall review the plan
and submit any comments and recommendations to the Town of Beech Mountain
within 20 days after the Soil and Water Conservation District received the
erosion control plan, or within any shorter period of time as may be agreed
upon by the Soil and Water Conservation District and the town. Failure of the
Soil and Water Conservation District to submit its comments and recommendations
within 20 days or within any agreed-upon shorter period of time shall not delay
final action on the plan.
   (E)   The Town of Beech Mountain will review each complete plan submitted to
them and within 30 days of receipt thereof will notify the person submitting
the plan that it has been approved, approved with modifications, or
disapproved. Failure to approve, approve with modifications or disapprove a
complete erosion and sedimentation control plan within 30 days of receipt shall
be deemed approval. Disapproval of a plan must specifically state in writing
the reasons for disapproval. The town must approve, approve with modifications,
or disapprove a revised plan within 15 days of receipt, or it is deemed to be
approved. If, following commencement of a land-disturbing activity pursuant to
an approved plan, the Town determines that the plan is inadequate to meet the
requirements of this subchapter, the town may require any revision of the plan
that is necessary to comply with this subchapter. Failure to approve, approve
with modifications or disapprove a revised erosion control plan within 15 days
of receipt shall be deemed approval of the plan. The town may establish an
expiration date for erosion control plans approved under this subchapter.
   (F)   Any plan submitted for a land-disturbing activity for which an
environmental document is required by the North Carolina Environmental Policy
Act (G.S. § 113A-1 et seq.) shall be deemed incomplete until a complete
environmental document is available for review. The Town of Beech Mountain
shall promptly notify the person submitting the plan that the 30-day time limit
for review of the plan pursuant to division (E) above shall not begin until a
complete environmental document is available for review.
   (G)   The plan required by this section shall contain architectural and
engineering drawings, maps, assumptions, calculations, and narrative statements
as needed to adequately describe the proposed development of the tract and the
measures planned to comply with the requirements of this subchapter. Plan
content may vary to meet the needs of specific site requirements. Detailed
guidelines for plan preparation may be obtained from the Town of Beech Mountain
on request.
   (H)   A local government may disapprove an erosion control plan upon a
finding that an applicant, or a parent, subsidiary or other affiliate of the
applicant:
      (1)   Is conducting or has conducted land-disturbing activity without an
approved plan, or has received notice of violation of a plan previously
approved by the Commission or a local government pursuant to the Act and has
not complied with the notice within the time specified in the notice;
      (2)   Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to the Act or a
local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act by the time the payment is due.
      (3)   Has been convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. § 113A-64(b)
or any criminal provision of a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act, or
      (4)   Has failed to substantially comply with state rules or local
ordinances and regulations adopted pursuant to the Act. For purposes of this
division (H) an applicant's record may be considered for only the two years
prior to the application date.
   (I)   Applications for amendment of an erosion control plan in written and/
or graphic form may be made at any time under the same conditions as the
original application. Until such time as said amendment is approved by the
town, the land-disturbing activity shall not proceed except in accordance with
the erosion control plan as originally approved.
   (J)   Any person engaged in land-disturbing activity who fails to file a
plan in accordance with this subchapter or who conducts a land-disturbing
activity except in accordance with provisions of an approved plan shall be
deemed in violation of this subchapter.
   (K)   No person may initiate a land-disturbing activity before notifying the
agency that issued the plan approval of the date that land-disturbing activity
will begin. 2
   (L)   A plan approval issued under this subchapter shall be prominently
displayed until all construction is complete, all permanent sedimentation and
erosion control measures are installed and the site has been stabilized. A copy
of the approved plan shall be kept on file at the site. 3

is $5,000. No penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in
violation has been notified of the violation as provided in §
154.227(C) of this subchapter. If, after the allotted time period has expired,
the violator has not completed corrective action, a civil penalty may be
assessed from the date the violation is detected. However, no time period for
compliance need be given for failure to submit an erosion control plan for
approval or for obstructing, hampering or interfering with an authorized
representative while in the process of carrying out his or her official duties.
Each day of continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. A
person may be assessed a one-time civil penalty in the amount of $5,000 for the
day the violation is first detected. 2
      (2)   If payment is not received within 30 days after demand for payment
is made, the town may institute a civil action to recover the amount of the
penalty. The civil action may be brought in the Superior Court of the county
where the violation occurred, or the violator's residence or principal place of
business is located. Such civil actions must be filed within three years of the
date the penalty was due. A penalty that is not contested is due when the
violator is served with a notice of penalty. A penalty that is contested is due
at the conclusion of the administrative and judicial review of the penalty. In
the event it is necessary for the town to file a civil action to collect the
penalty, the violator shall pay the town for all court costs and attorney fees
it incurs.
      (3)   Civil penalties collected pursuant to this subchapter shall be
credited to the general fund of the local government as non-tax revenue.
   (B)   Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any
provision of this subchapter, or rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to
this subchapter, or who knowingly or willfully initiates or continues a land-
disturbing activity for which an erosion control plan is required except in
accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan,
shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor which may include a fine not to exceed
$5,000.

Editor's note:
   1 Definition added by amendment June 4, 1985.
§ 154.249 PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION PLATS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   No final plat of a subdivision within the Town of Beech Mountain
shall be recorded by the Register of Deeds of Watauga or Avery County until it
has been approved as provided herein. To secure such approval of a final plat,
the subdivider shall follow the procedure established in this subchapter.
      (2)   All proposed subdivisions shall be reviewed prior to recording with
the Register of Deeds by submitting a vicinity map to the Zoning Administrator
to determine if the property is located in a Public Water Supply Watershed. 1
      (3)   Furthermore, no street shall be maintained by the town nor street
dedication accepted for ownership and maintenance, nor shall water, sewer or
other public facilities or services be extended to or connected with any
subdivision for which a final plat is required to be approved unless and until
such final plat has been approved.
   (B)   Minor subdivision review process. 2
      (1)   Purpose. The minor subdivision review procedure affords a
simplified process for the review and approval of qualifying a subdivision.
Such subdivisions should have only limited impact on community facilities and
services. If for any reason the Zoning Administrator should determine that a
subdivision which meets the basic criteria for the minor subdivision review
process has features that could potentially represent the need for a more
thorough review, he or she shall state in writing the reasons for his or her
determination. Approval shall be denied under the minor subdivision review
process, and the subdivider referred to the major subdivision review process.
      (2)   Definition.
         (a)   Any number of lots on an existing, approved street provided the
following conditions are met:
            1.   Involves no street right-of-way dedication or street
construction of any kind; and
            2.   Not requiring extension of public water and/or sewage lines;
and
            3.   Not requiring creation of new drainage easements through
property to serve property in the rear; and
            4.   Does not create any new or residual lots that do not conform
to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, these Subdivision Regulations or
any other land use controls, regulations or ordinances of the town; or
         (b)   Involves no more than four lots (expressed, planned or implied).
      (3)   Submissions to Zoning Administrator.
         (a)   The subdivider shall submit to the Zoning Administrator three
copies of the final plat, accompanied by a filing fee established by the Town
Council. The master schedule of fees is maintained in the Clerk’s office.
         (b)   The final plat shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator and
other members of the town staff for compliance with this subchapter and other
town policies. The town's consulting engineer shall also review the plat when
deemed necessary by the Administrator.
         (c)   Within 30 days of the first consideration of the final plat, the
Zoning Administrator shall approve or disapprove the final plat. If the final
plat is in compliance with the subchapter, the Zoning Administrator shall
approve the final plat.
         (d)   If the Zoning Administrator disapproves the final plat, he or
she shall state in writing his or her reasons for such action, specifying the
provisions of this subchapter with which the plat does not comply. One copy of
this statement shall be transmitted to the subdivider within five days of
disapproval, and one copy shall be retained by the Zoning Administrator as part
of his or her proceedings.
         (e)   Appeal from the Zoning Administrator shall be by petition to the
Planning Board to be heard at their next regularly scheduled meeting following
the Zoning Administrator's ruling.
         (f)   The original tracing and one paper print of the final plat shall
be retained in the Zoning Administrator's office.
         (g)   The approval of a final plat shall not be deemed to constitute
or affect the acceptance by the town of any dedication shown on the plat.
However, the Town Council, by resolution, may accept any dedication made to the
public of lands or facilities located within its subdivision regulation
jurisdiction. Acceptance of dedication of lands or facilities located within
the subdivision regulation jurisdiction shall not place on the town any duty to
open, operate, repair or maintain any land or facility.
   (C)   Sketch Plan. 3 Prior to preliminary plat application, the subdivider
shall submit a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision to the Zoning
Administrator. The purpose of submitting the sketch plan is to afford the
subdivider an opportunity to obtain the advice and assistance of the town staff
to facilitate the subsequent preparation and approval of the preliminary plat.
This procedure does not require formal application or fee.
      (1)   Contents required. A simple sketch plan shall be drawn at a scale
of no less than 200 feet to one inch and shall show the proposed street layout

in agreement that the proposal is in compliance, the Zoning Administrator shall
notify the applicant, in writing, that the preliminary plat may be prepared.

dedication of all improvements prior to final plat approval, the Town of Beech
Mountain may enter into an agreement with the subdivider whereby the subdivider
shall agree to complete all required improvements within a reasonable time, to
be determined in said agreement. Once said agreement is signed by both parties
and the security required herein is provided, the final plat may be approved by
the Planning Board provided it meets with the requirements of division (F)
below.
            2.   To secure this agreement, the subdivider shall provide,
subject to the approval of the Planning Board, either one or a combination of
the following guarantees not exceeding 1.25 times the entire cost as provided
herein:
               a.   Surety performance bond(s). The subdivider shall obtain
performance bond(s) from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in
North Carolina. The bond(s) shall be payable to the Town of Beech Mountain and

notification by the Town Council, immediately either pay to the town all funds
in said account, or deliver to the town any other instruments fully endorsed or

subdivider to complete the required improvements, the Town Council may require
the subdivider, the surety, or the financial institution holding the escrow
account to pay all or any portion of the bond or escrow account fund to the
Town of Beech Mountain. Upon payment, the Town Council shall expend such
portion of said funds as it deems necessary to complete all or any portion of
the required improvements.
         (c)   Release of guarantee security. The Town Council may release a
portion of any security posted as the improvements are completed and
recommended for approval by the Town Manager. Within 32 days after receiving
the Town Manager's recommendation, the Town Council shall approve or not
approve said improvements. If the Town Council approves said improvements, then
it shall release any security posted at the time the subdivider posts the
necessary maintenance guarantees.
      (2)   Improvement guarantees for subdivisions having more than ten lots.
Prior to the beginning of construction of any improvements, the subdivider
shall guarantee the completion of all such improvements within a reasonable
period of time as provided below.

To secure such guarantee, the subdivider shall provide the Town of Beech
Mountain with a Surety Performance Bond or an equivalent security as the same

such bond or cash deposit shall be equal to 0.25 times the entire cost of
installing all required improvements, as estimated by the subdivider and
approved by the Town Manager.
         (b)   Payment of bond or escrow accounts. Upon default, meaning
failure on the part of the subdivider to make any necessary repairs within a
reasonable period of time to be determined by the town after such repairs
become necessary, the Town Council may require the subdivider, the surety or

of the bond or escrow account funds to the Town of Beech Mountain. Upon
payment, the Town Council shall expend such portion of said funds as it deems
necessary to complete all or any portion of the required repairs.

and the receipt of the Town's written acknowledgment that said improvements

condition.
   (F)   Final plat. 7
      (1)   General. The final plat shall constitute only that portion of the

municipality or appropriate utility company for both underground and overhead
utility installation where needed. Easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet
wide, or as required by utility companies, and normally centered along rear or
side lot lines. Wider easements may be required if the topography along the
proposed right-of-way is such that maintenance equipment cannot reasonably
operate within the minimum 20 feet wide easement. Where easements are required
along the outside perimeter of a subdivision, ten feet will be required.
      (2)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a water
course, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of
such water course and such further width or construction, or both, as will be
adequate for the purpose of managing storm water runoff in a manner that will
safeguard the health and property of the citizens of Beech Mountain and the
surrounding area.

attain a stable road bed, the developer shall add the required amount of stone
before attaining approval of the final plat. If the developer elects to pave
roads, he or she shall meet requirements of the State Division of Highways
pertaining to stone base and top surface, or as required by the Beech Mountain
Planning Board, whichever is the most stringent.
      (2)   A private driveway shall provide direct access to a public street.

intersections and at curves which the town deems sharp enough to warrant
additional illumination.
   (N)   Utilities. 14 The developer shall be required to provide each lot in a
subdivision direct access to electric distribution lines, telephone lines and
cablevision lines. The installation of these utilities shall be underground in
accordance with the installation requirements of the town and the utility
company standards. These utilities shall be installed in accordance with the
approved preliminary plat and the requirements of this subchapter, prior to
approval of the final plat. Said extensions shall be accomplished with the
knowledge of the utility companies and in accordance with their specifications
so that, once constructed, the utility company shall assume title and control
of the system.
   (O)   Note. If an existing CATV system is within reasonable proximity to the
proposed development as determined by the Planning Board, then the developer
shall be required, at his or her expense, to extend CATV service to the
development and to all parcels within the development. The Planning Board may
by resolution waive the requirement that the developer extend CATV service to
the subdivision if the developer provides documentation that demonstrates that
it is not financially feasible to extend the CATV service to the subdivision.
   (P)   Open space or fees in lieu. Every applicant who proposes a subdivision
of land, other than a minor subdivision as defined in §
154.249(B)(2), shall designate a portion of land or pay a fee in lieu thereof,
in accordance with this section, for public park, greenway or trail,
recreation, and open space sites to serve the recreational needs of the
residents of the subdivision or development. Dedicated open space shall either
be separately deeded to the town, deeded to a non-profit land trust or
conservancy for ownership and maintenance and assurance of public access, or
may be held in private ownership with a recorded easement assuring public
access to these facilities in perpetuity. The town may, at its discretion,
decline to accept such a dedication, in which case the open space shall be
dedicated to a non-profit land trust or conservancy for ownership and
maintenance and assurance of access, or may be held in private ownership with a
recorded easement assuring public access to these facilities in perpetuity.
      (1)   Purpose. The open space requirements contained herein are intended
to set design standards for new subdivisions within the town that preserve
adequate open space in order to meet the recreational needs of residents,
improve the aesthetic character of the community, reduce stormwater runoff,
enhance air quality, and establish cohesion between new and existing park and
trail systems throughout the town.
      (2)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division, the following terms
have been defined.
         ACTIVE RECREATION. Outdoor recreational activities, such as organized
sports, playground activities, hiking, biking, and canoeing or kayaking, that
require supportive infrastructure.
         OPEN SPACE. All public or common areas not covered by building or
parking lots, stormwater management basins/ponds or detention structures, non-
recreational ponds and lakes, wetlands, or streets, that have been improved for
active or passive recreational purposes or set aside as natural areas.
         PASSIVE RECREATION. Outdoor recreational activities, such as nature
observation, that require minimal supportive infrastructure.
      (3)   Open space requirement. The amount of open space required for
dedication by each new subdivision, excluding minor subdivisions, shall be
equal to or greater than 0.022 acres (958 square feet) per dwelling unit,
planned or proposed.
      (4)    Responsibility for improvements. The construction of improvements
shall be the responsibility of the developer, unless said developer provides a
fee in lieu thereof in accordance with this section.
      (5)   Open space standards. Except as otherwise required by the Planning
Board at the time of preliminary plat approval all dedications of land shall
meet the following criteria:
         (a)   Character of land designated. A minimum of 75% of the land area
required for dedication shall be designated for active recreation purposes;
         (b)   Usability. The land dedicated to fulfill the requirements of
this section shall not have characteristics (such as slope, drainage, etc.)
that make the proposed use of the land unfeasible. Land dedicated as a greenway
or trail shall be a minimum of ten feet wide;
         (c)   Connectivity. In meeting the requirements established by this
section, priority shall be given to achieving connectivity with existing or
planned trails and park systems through the dedication of land for trails or
greenways;
         (d)   Access. Land dedicated for recreational use shall be sited such
that it can be safely and easily reached by its anticipated users. Public
access to the dedicated land will be provided either by adjoining public street
frontage or by a dedicated public easement, at least ten feet wide, which
connects the dedicated land to a public street or right-of-way;
         (e)   Landscaping. Dedicated open space areas will have a sufficient
natural or manmade buffer or screen to minimize any negative impacts on
adjacent residents; and
         (f)   Maintenance. If the open space required herein is dedicated to
the town and the town elects to accept such dedication, the town may, at its
discretion, choose to maintain said open space. If the open space is retained
in private ownership or assigned to a non-profit, the responsibility for
maintenance shall reside with that entity. If open space retained in private
ownership or assigned to a non-profit is not being adequately maintained such
that the recreational area is functional and serving its purpose, the town may
elect, at its discretion, to maintain the area.
      (6)   Procedures for open space dedication.
         (a)   At the time of filing a preliminary plat, the applicant shall
designate thereon the area or areas to be dedicated pursuant to §
154.251(O)(3). If the applicant desires to make a payment in lieu of the
dedication of land, a letter to that effect shall be submitted with the
preliminary plat.
         (b)   The open space required for dedication shall be shown on the
final plat when submitted. If the improvements for which the open space is
dedicated have not been constructed, the final plat may be approved if such
improvements are guaranteed in accordance with §
154.249(E).
         (c)   If the open space is being dedicated to the town, and the town
has elected to accept such dedication, the final plat shall be accompanied by
an executed general warranty deed conveying the dedicated land to the town. If
the open space is being retained in private ownership or assigned to a
nonprofit, documentation (i.e. covenants and restrictions) shall be provided
that indicates how the area will be maintained and how such maintenance will be
financed. Where a payment in lieu of dedication is approved by the town, such
payment will be made before the final plat is signed and recorded.
      (7)   Payment of fees in lieu of land dedication.
         (a)   Preference will be given to projects that provide open space on-
site in the form of a land dedication. Nevertheless, the payment of fees in
lieu of the dedication of land under §
154.251(O)(3) above may be approved by the Planning Board upon a finding that:
            1.   The dedication of open space is infeasible or impractical
given the unique nature of the particular property; or
            2.   Due to the unique characteristics of the property involved or
of the property's location with respect to other services or amenities, the
dedication of the open space required by this section will not accomplish the
goals of this section.
         (b)   Procedures for payment of fees in lieu of land dedication.
            1.   The amount of the payment shall be the product of:
               a.   The number of acres to be dedicated, as required by §
154.251(O)(3) above;
               b.   The value per acre of the property being developed, as
determined by a recent appraisal of the land performed by a professional land
appraiser. The appraisal shall reflect the value of the property in its
developed state. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the developer; and
               c.   In addition to the value derived above, a 10% premium shall
be added to compensate for the cost of constructing improvements

duration of display for a category, it must comply with all requirements and
obtain a permit for the appropriate category of duration.
      (1)   Permanent signs. Signs which are intended to be displayed
continuously for a period of greater than one year. Signs (such as real estate
signs) which are erected prospectively with the goal of being removed in less
than one year do not constitute permanent signs.
      (2)   Accessory signs. Signs intended for the recurring, periodic display
of information. These signs are typically modified regularly, but are not

are not limited to, signs erected to advertise the sale of real estate and
signs erected during a construction project. Semi-temporary signs may by
erected for periods of greater than one year, provided that required permits
are obtained. Signs intended to be erected permanently do not qualify for this
category.
      (4)   Temporary signs. Signs or advertising display intended to be
displayed for a short period of time (not greater than 14 days), often to
inform the public of an unusual or special event. These signs are often in the
form of "Banners.” Signs erected for longer than 14 days do not qualify for
this category.
      (5)   Short term signs. Signs erected for less than 48 hours.
      (6)   Transitional signs.  Signs erected for a maximum of six months
while a permanent sign is being created.
   (E)   Area of sign defined.
      (1)   The area of a sign excluding wall or window signs shall be
considered to include all lettering, wording, and accompanying design and
symbols, together with the background on which they are displayed, any frame
around the sign, and any cutouts or extensions, but shall not include any
supporting or bracing. In the case of a multi-faced sign, the area of the sign
shall be considered to include all faces visible in any one direction.
      (2)   The area of a wall or window sign consisting of individual letters
or symbols attached to or painted on a surface, building, wall, or window,
shall be considered to be that of the smallest rectangle or triangle which
encompasses all of the letters or symbols.
      (3)   (a)   Signs that are contiguous (touching) or are separated by a
divider, frame, or portion of the sign support structure less than six inches
wide shall be considered one sign for the purposes of this subchapter.
         (b)   Exception.  Signs of different types as defined by their
duration of display as set forth above shall be considered separate signs, even
if they are contiguous.

§ 154.272 EXEMPTIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Exempt signs. The following signs and/or displays shall be exempt from
the regulations of this subchapter:
      (1)   Signs not visible beyond the boundaries of the property on which
they are located;
      (2)   Signs erected by a duly-constituted governmental body;
      (3)   Signs erected within a residential home; and
      (4)   Historic signs as defined in this subchapter, provided that the
message, background, colors, dimensions, orientation, location and design of
the support structure of such signs shall not be altered in any way. Normal
maintenance, however, is permitted.
   (B)   Exceptions. Particular features or concerns regarding the following
types of signs provide compelling reasons for their regulation in a different
manner from other signs of similar duration of display or located within a
common zoning district.
       (1)   Private traffic directional signs located on private property not
to exceed three square feet.  The town finds there is a compelling need for
private property owners to be able to control aspects of traffic on private
property in order to avoid damage to property and inconveniences and potential
dangers caused by the restriction of ingress and egress to a property by
methods such as designating parking spaces and restricting "no parking" areas,
identifying "one-way" driveways and the like with the standard, commercially
available signage commonly associated with these purposes. Therefore, these
signs need not comply with material and style requirements, limitations on
number, and other requirements and are exempt from this section.
      (2)   Signs erected to prohibit trespassing displayed in accordance with
North Carolina State law. The town finds that there is a compelling need for
private property owners to be able to avail themselves of the protection from
liability offered by NC state law in the manner prescribed in such laws or
statutes. Therefore, these signs need not comply with material and style
requirements, limitations on number, and other requirements and are exempt from
this section, provided that the number, size, or other features of such signs
is not in excess of that prescribed by state law.
      (3)   Non-illuminated trade names and graphics which are customarily
painted on newspaper and soft drink dispensers and similar outdoor amenities.
The town finds there is a compelling interest in exempting these signs from
regulation due to their ubiquitous nature and the impracticality or inability
to obtain soft drink dispensers and the like without such trade names or
graphics. Therefore, these signs are exempt from the requirements of this
section.
         (a)   Parties affected. All structures, residential, multi-family, and
commercial are required to display the assigned street number in the manner
described in this section.
         (b)   Visibility. Street numbers shall be displayed so as to be
conspicuously visible and legible from the street from both directions. Numbers
must maintain contrast to the background and be reflective.
         (c)   Number type. All numbers shall be displayed in Arabic form (0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
         (d)   Number location. 
            1.   Structures visible from the street. Where the structure is
visible from the road and at such a distance that numbers are legible from the
road, numbers shall be affixed to the structure. Numbers shall be reflective
and a minimum of three inches high and may be mounted either horizontally or
vertically.
            2.   Structures not visible from the street. Where a structure is
not visible from the street or is otherwise situated to make number display on
the building ineffective, the number shall be displayed at the access entrance.
Numbers may be combined with property or business identification signs. Where
signs are perpendicular to the street, numbers shall be displayed on both sides
of the sign. Numbers shall be a minimum of three inches high, reflective, and
may be mounted wither horizontally or vertically.
            3.   Mailboxes. Numbers of a minimum of three inches in height,
reflective, and shall be affixed to both sides of the mailbox serving the
primary structure. When the mailbox is clustered with other mailboxes or is
across the street from the primary structure, the numbers will be placed on the
front of the mailbox. There could be confusion as to the primary structure
access by using numbers on the mailbox than prudence would dictate placing the
numbers on a post at the primary structure access point on the street.
Mailboxes across the street or otherwise located across the street are not
adequate for the purposes of this section.
            4.   Trash bins. Numbers of a minimum of three inches in height,
reflective, and shall be affixed to both sides of the trash bins serving the
primary structure.
         (e)    Unauthorized building numbers prohibited. No person shall affix
or allow to remain upon any building in the Town of Beech Mountain any
different number from the one designated by this section, with the exception of
dates affixed for historical purpose.

§ 154.304 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT/EXPIRATION.
   (A)   A Special Use Permit for a telecommunication tower shall expire five
years after the effective date of the permit approval by the Board of
Adjustment. A permittee wishing to continue the use of a specific tower must
apply for a renewal of the Special Use Permit at least six months prior to the
expiration of the permit. In considering the request for the renewal of the
Special Use Permit, the Board of Adjustment shall apply all regulations then in
effect and shall consider the impact that any changes in technology since the
approval of the original permit may have had on the need for the tower or the
tower’s design.
   (B)   Following the Board of Adjustment’s approval of a Special Use Permit
for a proposed tower, and the permit owner’s acknowledgment, acceptance, and
execution of the Special Use Permit, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a
tower permit. If a building permit is not obtained for the construction of the
tower within 12 months after the approval of the Special Use Permit, or if the
Special Use Permit expires in accordance with the provisions of §
154.116(G)(3) of this chapter, then the tower permit shall be void.
(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art. XX, § 2005) (Ord. passed 4-14-1998; Ord.
2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)
§ 154.305 TOWER APPROVAL STANDARDS.
   In addition to the other criteria set forth in the Zoning Ordinance for the
approval and issuance of Special Use Permits by the Board of Adjustment, the
Board shall apply the following standards in considering the approval of a
tower application.
   (A)   Any proposed tower shall provide a needed service or benefit to the
residents of Beech Mountain, Avery County or Watauga County that cannot
otherwise be met.
   (B)   The tower must be designed to meet the ANSI/ELA/TIA-222-E standards of
minimum 100-year return wind speed and a minimum one-half inch of solid radical
ice.
   (C)   Towers shall be sited on a property so that all ice-fall or other
debris from a potential tower failure can be contained in the property. The
minimum distance from the tower’s base to the property line, or to any public
road or public utility (such as power lines or phone lines other than those
solely related to the telecommunication tower itself) shall be equal to the
tower’s height. Guy wires and other support devices shall be no closer than 20
feet from any lot line.
   (D)   A tower shall be set back from other on-site and off-site towers and
supporting structures such that the failure or collapse of one tower will not
strike another tower or its support structure.
   (E)   The tower shall be designed and placed on the site in a manner that
takes maximum advantage of existing trees, mature vegetation, and structures so
as to:
      (1)   Use the existing site features to screen the tower from prevalent
views; or
      (2)   Use existing site features as a background so that the tower blends
into the background with increased site distances.
   (F)   No artificial lighting shall be permitted on towers except as required
to meet the minimum standards of the Federal Aviation Administration. If
lighting is required, the Zoning Administrator shall review the available
lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least
disturbance to surrounding properties and views. Security lighting at the base
of a tower may be provided if the lighting is shielded so that no light is
directed toward adjacent properties or rights-of-way.
   (G)   The base of the tower shall be surrounded by a fence or wall at least
eight feet in height unless the tower is constructed entirely on a building
over eight feet in height.
   (H)   Only monopole towers or alternative tower structures shall be
permitted. No tower or alternative tower structure located on any Major
Mountain ridge shall have its highest point at an elevation greater than 30
feet higher than the vegetative canopy immediately surrounding the base of the
tower. No tower at a location other than a Major Mountain Ridge shall have its
highest point at an elevation greater than 100 feet from the ground.
   (I)   (1)   The proposed tower shall be engineered and constructed to
accommodate one additional antenna that is at least as large as the largest
proposed antenna identified in §
154.303(D)(5)(d). Tower permit approval is conditioned upon the tower owner
agreeing to allow the future collocation of other antennas upon the tower
structure. This provision shall not apply to monopole towers or alternative
tower structures located on a major mountain ridge where the height restriction
placed on the tower or alternative tower structure makes it infeasible or
impractical to place more than one antenna on the tower structure.
      (2)   In the event that a dispute arises as to whether a permittee has
exercised good faith in accommodating other users, the town may require a third
party technical study (at the expense of the permittee or the proposed user, or
both) to determine whether the tower could accommodate the proposed use.
      (3)   Failure to comply with the co-location requirements of this
division may result in the denial of a permit request or the revocation of an
existing permit.
   (J)   Towers shall be light gray or other blending color as approved by the
town, except when some other color may be required by applicable federal or
state regulations.
   (K)   Property located within the tower's fall area shall not be subdivided
so long as the tower is standing.
   (L)   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the tower site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. The tower and support
structures shall be designed and placed on the site in a manner that will take
maximum advantage of existing trees and mature vegetation so that the existing
features will be used to screen the tower and support structures from prevalent
views.
   (M)   Where a tower is proposed adjacent to a residential area, the setback
space is to be used as a buffer zone. The buffer shall consist of a semi-opaque
planting/landscaping screen as described in §
154.165(A) of the Zoning Ordinance. Trees shall be at least six to seven feet
tall for evergreens and six to eight feet tall with a one and one-half-inch
caliper for deciduous trees at the time of planting and shall reach a height of
no less than 20 feet at maturity.
   (N)   The applicant must be willing to allow the Town of Beech Mountain, the
Beech Mountain Fire Department, or other public entities use of the tower under
reasonable terms and conditions if a request is made for such use within 30
days of the filing of the permit application, provided that tower load and
frequency compatibility issues are satisfied.
   (O)   (1)   Proposed towers shall not be permitted within residential areas
as defined in §
154.302. Within the other acceptable areas, the Board of Adjustment shall give
preference to proposed tower sites that are not located on a major mountain
ridge.
      (2)   Alternative tower structures shall be given preference over
monopole towers.
   (P)   The tower owner must provide the Zoning Administrator with proof of
general liability insurance in the minimum amount of $1,000,000.
   (Q)   (1)   If the tower, or the equipment on the site, is of a type that
will emit a continuous or frequent noise, the applicant must prove that
sufficient action will be taken to prevent such noise from being audible to
surrounding residents and businesses. Tower facilities and equipment must be
operated so that noise levels are less than 45dB as measured from the property
line nearest to the tower facilities.
      (2)   The applicant shall comply with federal standards for radio
frequency emissions. The applicant shall ensure that the tower/antennas will
not cause localized interference with the reception of area television or radio
broadcasts. If, on review, the town finds that the tower’s antenna interferes
with such reception, and if the interference is not corrected within 60 days,
the town may revoke or modify the Special Use Permit.
   (R)   A sign identifying the owner(s) and operator(s) of the tower and an
emergency telephone number shall be placed in a clearly visible location on the
premises on the tower.
   (S)   The tower must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the
Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and any
other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers
and antennas.
   (T)   Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower
facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of a telecommunication
tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made.

§ 154.307 CONTINUED COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (A)   All permits for the erection of a tower are issued in reliance upon a
presumption that the tower will in fact conform to the plans that are submitted
as the basis for the permit. Once erected, the tower must at all times be
maintained in compliance with the provisions of the Special Use Permit.
   (B)   To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower
shall ensure that it is constructed and maintained in compliance with standards
contained in the applicable State building codes and the applicable standards
for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) as
amended from time to time.
   (C)   At least every 12 months, the tower shall be inspected at the owner's
expense by an expert who is regularly involved in the maintenance, inspection,
and/or erection of telecommunication towers. At a minimum, this inspection
shall be conducted in accordance with the tower inspection check list provided
in the EIA Standard 222 Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and
Antenna Support Structures. A copy of such inspection record shall be forwarded
to the Zoning Administrator.
   (D)   If the Zoning Administrator concludes that a tower fails to comply
with the state building codes and/or the EIA standards and constitutes a danger
to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the
tower, the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower
into compliance with such codes with standards. If the owner fails to bring
such tower into compliance within the 30 days, the Board of Adjustment may
order the removal of the tower at the owner's expense.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
Editor's note:
   Non-coastal regular phase
§ 154.325 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization, municipal. 
      (1)   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. Ch. 143,
Art. 21, Part 6; G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 19, Parts 3, 5, and 8; and G.S.§ 160D-923,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry.
      (2)   Therefore, the Town Council of The Town of Beech Mountain, North
Carolina, does ordain as follows.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Beech
Mountain are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood prone areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development which
may increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this subchapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a Special Flood Hazard Area.

Special Flood Hazard Areas within the jurisdiction, including Extra-Territorial
Jurisdictions (ETJ) if applicable, of the Town of Beech Mountain and within the
jurisdiction of any other community whose governing body agrees, by resolution,
to such applicability.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas.
      (1)   FEMA. The Special Flood Hazard Areas are those identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or produced under the Cooperating
Technical State (CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in
its Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and its
accompanying flood maps such as the Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) (FIRM) and/or
the Flood Boundary Floodway Map(s) (FBFM), for Watauga County, panel #'s 150e,
151e and 153e dated September 21, 1998, which with accompanying supporting
data, and any revision thereto, including Letters of Map Amendment or Revision,
are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this subchapter. The
Special Flood Hazard Areas also include those defined through standard
engineering analysis for private developments or by governmental agencies, but
which have not yet been incorporated in the FIRM. This includes, but is not
limited to, detailed flood data:
         (a)   Generated as a requirement of §
154.328(C)(11) and (12) of this subchapter;
         (b)   Preliminary FIRMs where more stringent than the effective FIRM;
or
         (c)   Post-disaster Flood Recovery Maps.
      (2)   Municipal. In addition, upon annexation to the Town of Beech
Mountain or inclusion in the Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ), the Special
Flood Hazard Areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
and/or produced under the Cooperating Technical State agreement between the
State of North Carolina and FEMA as stated above for the Unincorporated Areas
of Avery and Watauga Counties, with accompanying maps and other supporting
data, and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this subchapter.
   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A Floodplain
Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
subchapter prior to the commencement of any development activities within
Special Flood Hazard Areas as determined in §
154.327(B) above.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance with the
terms of this suchapter and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This suchapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this subchapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (G)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this subchapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Actual flood heights may be increased by man-made
or natural causes. This subchapter does not imply that land outside the Special
Flood Hazard Areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This subchapter shall not create liability on the
part of the Town of Beech Mountain or by any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this subchapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (H)   Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this
subchapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including
violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of
variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who
violates this subchapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $50 or imprisoned for not more
than 30 days, or both. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Town of Beech
Mountain from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.

requests for variances from the requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal
such decision to the Court, as provided in G.S. Ch. 7A.
      (3)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   In passing upon variances, the appeal board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this subchapter, and:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (f)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be
submitted with the application for a variance.
      (6)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this subchapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this subchapter.
      (7)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or
non-encroachment area if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
      (8)   Conditions for variances:
         (a)   Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
         (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         (d)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the Base Flood Elevation (BFE)
and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced reference level elevation. Such notification shall
be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
         (e)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the State of North Carolina upon request.
(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art. XXI, § 2104) (Ord. passed 11-11-2003; Ord.
2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)
§ 154.329 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (A)   General standards. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas the following
provisions are required:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      (3)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
      (4)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding. These include but are not limited to HVAC equipment,

      (5)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
      (6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (7)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (8)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure which is in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this subchapter.
      (9)   Non-conforming structures or other development may not be enlarged,
replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished
in conformance with the provisions of this subchapter. Provided, however,
nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this
subchapter and located totally or partially within the floodway, non-
encroachment area, or stream setback, provided that the bulk of the building or
structure below the regulatory flood protection elevation in the floodway, non-
encroachment area, or stream setback is not increased and provided that such
repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of
this subchapter.
      (10)   New solid waste disposal facilities, hazardous waste management
facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not be
permitted in Special Flood Hazard Areas. A structure or tank for chemical or
fuel storage incidental to an allowed use or to the operation of a water
treatment plant or wastewater treatment facility may be located in a Special
Flood Hazard Area only if the structure or tank is either elevated or
floodproofed to at least the regulatory flood protection elevation and
certified according to §
154.328(B)(3) of this subchapter.
   (B)   Specific standards. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where Base Flood
Elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in §
154.327(B), or §
154.328(C)(11) and (12), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall
have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (2)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation. Structures located in A, AO, AE and A1-
30 Zones may be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in
lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required
flood protection elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards
of this division are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the
official as set forth in §
154.328(B)(3).
      (3)   Manufactured homes.
         (a)   New or replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
         (b)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement in
accordance with the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured/Mobile
Homes, 1995 Edition, and any revision thereto adopted by the Commissioner of
Insurance pursuant to G.S. § 143-143.15 or a certified engineered foundation.
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36
inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength.
When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering
certification is required.
         (c)   All foundation enclosures or skirting shall be in accordance
with §
154.329(B)(4).
         (d)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management coordinator.
      (4)   Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of
elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are below the
regulatory flood protection elevation shall not be designed to be used for
human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of
vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in
connection with the premises, be constructed entirely of flood resistant
materials below the regulatory flood protection level in A, AO, AE, and A1-30
zones and meet the following design criteria:
         (a)   Measures for complying with this requirement shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the
foundation must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
meet the following minimum design criteria:
            1.   Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
            2.   The total net area of all openings must be at least one square
inch for each square foot of each enclosed area subject to flooding;
            3.   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area must
have openings on exterior walls to allow floodwater to directly enter;
            4.   The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than
one foot above the adjacent grade; and
            5.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
opening coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
            6.    Foundation enclosures:
               a.   Vinyl or sheet metal skirting is not considered an
enclosure for regulatory and flood insurance rating purposes. Therefore such
skirting does not require hydrostatic openings as outlined above.
               b.   Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural
status, is considered an enclosure and requires hydrostatic openings as
outlined above to comply with this subchapter.
         (b)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such
enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except
to enclose storage areas.
      (5)   Additions/improvements.
         (a)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures whereas the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure.
            1.   Are not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more non-conforming than the existing structure.
            2.   Are a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         (b)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the
existing structure shall require only the addition to comply with the standards
for new construction.
         (c)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures whereas
the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications
to the existing structure:
            1.   Are not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction.
            2.   Are a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         (d)   Where a fire wall or independent perimeter load-bearing wall is
provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall
be considered a separate building and only the addition must comply with the
standards for new construction.
      (6)   Recreational vehicles. Recreation vehicles placed on sites within a
Special Flood Hazard Area shall either:
         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and has no permanently attached additions); or
         (b)   Meet all the requirements for new construction, including
anchoring and elevation requirements of §
154.328(B) and §
154.329(A) and (B)(3).
      (7)   Temporary structures. Prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit for a temporary structure, the following requirements must
be met:
         (a)   Applicants must submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan
for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a hurricane or flash flood
warning notification. The plan must include the following information:
            1.   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted;
            2.   The name, address, and phone number of the individual
responsible for the removal of the temporary structure;
            3.   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e. minimum of 72 hours before landfall of a hurricane or immediately
upon flood warning notification);
            4.   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with a
trucking company to insure the availability of removal equipment when needed;
and
            5.   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location
outside the Special Flood Hazard Area to which the temporary structure will be
moved.
         (b)   The above information shall be submitted in writing to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval.
      (8)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, etc.) are to be placed within a Special Flood Hazard Area, the
following criteria shall be met:
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including work, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
         (b)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
         (c)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;

         (f)   Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be
provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in conformance with §
154.329(B)(4)(a).
         (g)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square
feet does not require an elevation or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or
floodproofing certifications are required for all other accessory structures in
accordance with §
154.328(B)(3).
   (C)   Subdivisions, manufactured home parks and major developments. All
subdivision, manufactured home park and major development proposals located
within Special Flood Hazard Areas shall:
      (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
      (2)   Have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
      (3)   Have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards; and
      (4)   Have Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data provided if development is
greater than the lesser of five acres or 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference per §
154.328(B) to be utilized in implementing this code.
   (D)   Standards for floodplains without established Base Flood Elevations.
Within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in §
154.328(B), where no Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided, the
following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet
each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream whichever is
greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
      (2)   If §
154.329(C)(1) is satisfied and Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available
from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within
such areas shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this subchapter
and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established
in accordance with §
154.328(C)(11) and (12). When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is not available
from a federal, state, or other source, the reference level, including
basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (E)   Standards for floodplains with BFE but without established floodways
or non-encroachment areas. Along rivers and streams where Base Flood Elevation
(BFE) data is provided but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are
identified for a Special Flood Hazard Area on the FIRM or in the FIS, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.
   (F)   Floodways and non-encroachment areas. Located within the Special Flood
Hazard Areas established in §
154.327(B) are areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas. The
floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the
velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and
potential projectiles. The following provisions shall apply to all development
within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit.
      (2)   If §
154.329(F)(1) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of this subchapter.
      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement
manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
provided the following provisions are met:
         (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
154.329(B)(3); and
         (b)   The no encroachment standards of §
154.329(F)(1) are met.
   (G)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones). Located within the
Special Flood Hazard Areas established in §
154.327(B), are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following provisions shall apply within
such areas:
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of all structures
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above the highest
adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated at least to the regulatory flood protection
elevation as defined for the Special Flood Hazard Areas where no BFE has been
established.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall have the option to, in lieu of elevation, be
completely floodproofed together with attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities to or above that level so that any space below that level is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as per §
154.328(B)(3) and §
154.329(B)(2).

      (1)   Public property trees. In determining whether a permit should be
issued for the cutting of trees on public property, the Town Manager or his or

         (b)   The necessity to remove trees in order to construct proposed
improvements to allow economic development of property adjacent to public

erosion, soil retention and the diversion or increased flow of surface waters,
and coordination with the town’s drainage patterns; and

property. The Town Manager or his or her designee shall be guided by the
standards established in the neighborhood and the effect of tree removal upon
property values in the area.
         (e)   The town may require the relocation or replacement of trees as a
condition of issuing the permit, on a one for one basis, with replacement trees
having a caliper of one and one-half inch diameter at breast height (that is,
four feet above the ground at its highest point).
      (2)   Private property trees. The Town Manager or his designee may issue
a permit for the cutting of live trees or portions of live trees (i.e. limbs or
branches) on private property when such trees are in excess of six inches in

growth and development of other trees on the lot;
         (f)   The trees or portions of trees are diseased or damaged;
         (g)   The trees or portions of trees are within a temporary service
route as defined in this subchapter. Approval under this criteria shall require
the replacement of trees on a one-for-one basis in accordance with §
154.364 of this subchapter; or
         (h)   The removal of trees or portions of trees not meeting the
criteria set forth in division s (a) through (g) above may be permitted
pursuant to a landscaping plan that improves the property and is acceptable to
the town. Such a plan shall be designed to minimize the injury, disturbance, or
removal of trees not necessary to achieve the specific objectives of the plan.
         (i)   With regard to divisions (a), (b) and (c) above, for new
construction no trees or portions of trees shall be cut pursuant to these
criteria until the owner is ready to begin construction as evidenced by the
issuance of a building permit.
         (j)   Permits may be granted for trees to be pruned or limbed for view
enhancement. To attempt to minimize the detriment to the tree of these
practices, the standards provided in American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) A300 (Trees, Shrubs, and Other Woody Plant Management, Part 1 - Pruning)
shall be followed.
   (D)   Flag and photo required.  All trees to be cut or trimmed must be
