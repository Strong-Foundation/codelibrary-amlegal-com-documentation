160A-11) (Ord. 10, passed 1-17-1980; Ord. 20, passed 1-1-1985)
      (2)   A statutory cite set forth as a “statutory reference” following the

   (C)   If a section of this code is derived from the prior code of ordinances
of the city, the prior code section number shall be indicated in the history by

references scattered throughout the code are not part of the code, but are
merely for the benefit for the user of the code.
§ 10.19 FILING ORDINANCES.
   Every ordinance passed by the governing body shall be immediately filed in a
book provided for this purpose by the governing body which shall be known as
the “Ordinance Book”.
(Prior Code, § 1-13)
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, violation of any provision of
this code or any other ordinance shall be a misdemeanor or an infraction as the
case may be, as provided by G.S. § 14-4, and punishable as provided therein.
   (B)   Violation of any provision of this code or any other ordinance shall
subject the offender to a civil penalty to be recovered by the city in a civil
action in the nature of debt if the offender does not pay the penalty within a
reasonable period of time prescribed by an administrative officer of the city
after the offender has been cited for the violation.
   (C)   Any provision of this code or any other ordinance may be enforced by
an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction.
In that case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue
orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application
of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law.
   (D)   Any provision of this code or any other ordinance that makes unlawful
a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by
injunction and order of abatement and the general court of justice shall have
jurisdiction to issue the orders. When a violation of a provision occurs, the
city may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of justice for
a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement commanding the
defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of
the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and
rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in
general and Rule 65 in particular. In addition to an injunction, the court may
enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of
abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be
closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable
property be removed from buildings on the property; that grass and weeds be
cut; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken
that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this code or the
ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or
with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, the defendant
may be cited for contempt and the city may execute the order of abatement. The
city shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of
abatement in the nature of a mechanic’s and materialman’s lien. The defendant
may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the
proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be
given with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount
approved by the Judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned
on the defendant’s full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement
within a time fixed by the Judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall
not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith.
   (E)   The provisions of this code and any other ordinance may be enforced by
any one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this
section.
   (F)   Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day’s continuing
violation of any provision of this code or any other ordinance shall be a
separate and distinct offense.

§ 31.01 MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL; TERMS AND ELECTION.
   (A)   The Mayor shall be elected by all the qualified voters of the city for
a term of four years.
   (B)   The City Council shall consist of seven members, who shall all serve
terms of four years. The city shall be divided into five single-member
electoral districts (wards), the wards to be delineated and numbered on an
official map, and adopted by the governing body pursuant to G.S. §§ 160A-22 and
160A-23. Five Council members shall be apportioned to the districts (wards) so
that each member represents the same number of persons as nearly as possible.
The qualified voters of each district (ward) shall elect from candidates who
reside in the district (ward) for the seat apportioned to that district (ward).
The other two Council member(s) shall be apportioned to the city at large and
all the qualified voters of the city shall elect candidates apportioned to the
city at large.
   (C)   The terms of office for the Mayor and Council members shall be
staggered, such that some members of the governing body shall run for election
in each biennial municipal election. In the 1991 municipal election, and in
elections every four years subsequent to the election, Council members from
districts (wards) 1 and 2; and one at-large Council seat; and the Mayor shall
be elected for those offices. Because the Council size is increasing from six
to seven members, the second at-large seat will need to be filled for a two-
year term in the 1991 election. Therefore, in the 1991 municipal election, all
qualified voters shall vote for two at-large Council seats, using the methods
prescribed in G.S. § 163-293, so that the successful at-large candidate with
the largest number of votes shall serve a four-year term and the successful at-
large candidate with the next largest number of votes shall serve a four-year
term. In the 1993 municipal election, and in elections every four years
subsequent to the election, candidates for Council member from districts
(wards) 3, 4 and 5; and one at-large Council seat shall be elected for those
offices.
   (D)   The nonpartisan election and runoff election method shall be used, as
authorized by G.S. § 160A-101(7)(c). The elections shall be conducted in
accordance with G.S. Ch. 163, Art. 23 and Art. 24. The determination of
election results shall be made using the methods prescribed in G.S. § 163-293.
   (E)   The Mayor and City Council members shall possess the qualifications
set out in Article VI of the Constitution of the state. In addition, Council
members who were elected to district (ward) seats on the governing body shall
reside in the district (ward) they represent. When the Mayor or any Council
member ceases to meet all of the qualifications for holding office pursuant to
the Constitution, or when a Council member ceases to reside in an electoral
district (ward) that he or she was elected to represent, the office is ipso
facto vacant.
   (F)   Vacancies in either the Office of Mayor, or the Office of any Council
member, shall be filled as prescribed by G.S. § 160A-63.
   (G)   The governing body shall fix the date and time for its organizational
meeting in accordance with G.S. § 160A-68. At the organizational meeting, all
successful candidates for Mayor or Council member shall qualify by taking the
oath of office prescribed in Art VI, § 7, of the Constitution of the state.

(Prior Code, § 11-6) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.07 AGREEMENT.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   Utility services owned or operated by the city will be supplied
under:
         (a)   The city’s standard form of application (service agreement) or
contract;
         (b)   The applicable rate schedules; and
         (c)   These service regulations.
      (2)   The city shall not be required to supply service unless and until
the agreement is executed by the customer and the city, it being understood and
agreed that no promise, statement or representation by an agent, employee or
other person shall be binding upon the city unless same be in writing and
attached to and made a part of the agreement; notwithstanding the foregoing,
when the requested supply of utility product or service is for residential use,
the customer’s application and the city’s acceptance thereof may be verbal and,
in that event, the city’s applicable rate schedules and these service
regulations shall be effective in the same manner as if the city’s standard
form of application for service had been signed by the customer and accepted by
the city. A verbal service agreement shall be conclusively presumed, when there
is no written application by a customer accepted in writing by the city, if the
utility product or service supplied by the city is used by the customer or on
the customer’s premises.
(Prior Code, § 11-7)
   (B)   Agreement personal. The rights which accrue to the customer under the
agreement are personal and shall not be transferred or assigned by the customer
without the written consent of the city.
(Prior Code, § 11-8)
§ 50.08 NOTICE OF VACATING PREMISES; PAYMENT OF AMOUNTS DUE.
   (A)   The customer shall notify the city before vacating the premises served
under the agreement as herein provided and shall pay, upon presentation, all
bills due under all agreements or contracts.
   (B)   If any deposits are being held by the city for the account being
vacated, the deposits shall be refunded by check or deducted from the final
billing statement. However, no refund shall be made by check unless the final
billing has been paid in full.
(Prior Code, § 11-9) (Ord. passed 4-29-1991)
§ 50.09 DEPOSITS.
   (A)   Since an accumulation of unpaid bills would tend toward higher utility
rates for all customers, the city shall, before commencement of service,
require a deposit for each type of utility service desired. The amount of the
deposits shall be established by resolution by the City Council. The city shall
refund the deposits of any customer whose account has not been delinquent for a
period of 12 consecutive months. The deposit refund will be credited to the
account. However, any customer whose deposit has been refunded, who shall
subsequently have a delinquent account, may be required by the Billing Director
to post deposits before utility services are reconnected or continued. The
deposits shall be refunded if the customer’s account subsequently has not been
delinquent for the required 12 consecutive months.
   (B)   In lieu of full deposits for each type of utility service, the city
may accept written letters from other utility companies or municipalities which
indicate that the customer was a good customer of the utility company or
municipality for at least one year.
   (C)   The city shall require the maximum deposit before commencement of
service for any request of service that does not meet all of the requirements
for the application of service. The city shall refund the deposit if the
account has not been delinquent for a period of 24 consecutive months or when
all service application requirements have been met and account history is good.
The deposit refund will be credited to the account.
(Prior Code, § 11-10) (Ord. passed 4-29-1991; Ord. 17-03, passed 1-31-2017)
§ 50.10 ACCESS TO CUSTOMER’S PREMISES.
   The city shall, at all reasonable times, have the right of ingress to and
egress from the premises of the customer, for all purposes connected with the
delivery of service, or the exercise of any rights under the agreement.
(Prior Code, § 11-11)
§ 50.11 ATTACHMENT TO STRUCTURES.
   No equipment or facilities owned by the customer or others may be attached
to poles or other structures owned by the city, except where the attachments
are part of another utility system and are subject to the terms of a joint-use
agreement or except where the attachment has been otherwise approved by the
respective Director or the City Manager.
(Prior Code, § 11-12) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.12 METERS.
   (A)   To be furnished by city; rights of city. The city will furnish all
necessary meters. When a meter is moved from one location to another, all
expense in connection with the removal shall be borne by the city, except where
the removal is at the request of the customer, in which case, the expense will
be borne by the customer. The city shall have the right, at its option, to
place demand meters, volt meters or other instruments on the premises of the
customer for the purpose of making tests with respect to the customer’s
service.
(Prior Code, § 11-13)
   (B)   Location.
      (1)   Meters for all residential utility service, and for all other
service to the extent practicable, shall be located out-of-doors on the
customer’s structure at a place or point which is mutually acceptable to the
customer and the city, and which meets all the city’s requirements for reading,
testing, servicing accessibility and safety.
      (2)   Where it is not practicable, in the city’s opinion, to locate the
meter and its associated apparatus, if any, out-of-doors, the customers shall
provide a suitable indoor location which meets all of the city’s requirements
for reading, testing, servicing accessibility and safety.
(Prior Code, § 11-14)
   (C)   Inaccuracy. In case of the inaccuracy of a meter, the customer’s bill
for the period of such inaccuracy, not to exceed 60 days prior to the last
meter reading by the city, the meter readings, shall be adjusted up or down as
required to compensate for any meter inaccuracy exceeding acceptable
performance per each utility. Electric standard is as follows: (ANSI
STANDARDS). The performance of a watt-hour meter is considered to be acceptable
when the meter disk does not creep, and when the percentage registration is not
more than 102% or less than 98%, calculated in accordance with one of the
methods described in 6.1.8. Tested with standards whose accuracy is directly
traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (N.I.S.T.)
formerly by the National Bureau of Standards.
(Prior Code, § 11-15)
§ 50.13 PAYMENT OF UTILITY BILLS AND THEFT OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Utility bills are usually dated and mailed the fifth business day of
the month. All utility payments are due and payable not later than the
twentieth day of the same month. Failure to receive a bill which has been
properly mailed or hand-delivered will not entitle the customer to any delay in
paying the amount due beyond the date when the bill is due and payable. The
Billing Director shall have delinquent notices mailed to all delinquent
accounts by the twenty-first day of the month. If payment is not received by
the twentieth day of the month, the account is delinquent and a late payment
fee will be added to the bill on the twentieth day of the month. The late
payment fee shall be $10 for all bill amounts up to $1,000, plus 1% of any
amount over the first $1,000. If the bill is not paid in full, including any
late payment fees, by 5:00 p.m. on the last business day of the month, utility
service will be disconnected, subject to the provisions of division (F) of this
section. All accounts not paid in full on the last business day of the month
also will be charged a $50 processing fee. All delinquent service charges, late
payment fees and processing fees must be paid in full before utility service
can be restored or continued. Any unpaid bills will be collected using all
collection methods available. Utility billing, delinquent, and disconnection
for non-payment dates are subject to change upon the City Manager’s approval.
   (B)   (1)   The Billing Director is authorized to make one agreement within
a 12-month period with any customer to extend the time for payment; providing,
the following conditions are met:
         (a)   No agreement can exceed two months in length;
         (b)   Any agreement must be in writing, signed by the customer and the
Billing Director; and
         (c)   The customer must show unusual circumstances that impact his or
her ability to pay; and the circumstances must be of a temporary nature so that
the city is reasonably assured that future bills will be paid in a timely
manner.
      (2)   In highly unusual circumstances, the City Manager may authorize
either a further extension of time, or more than one agreement in a 12-month
period. Any agreement must be in writing, and signed by the customer, the
Billing Director and the City Manager.
      (3)   Failure of the customer to abide by any of the terms of the written
agreement for extension of payments shall result in immediate disconnection of
utility services. No utility services can be reconnected or continued without
full payment of all delinquent service charges, late payment fees and
processing fees.
   (C)   (1)   Payment by a check returned for non-sufficient funds shall
constitute non-payment of the bill. Any customer that writes a check which is
returned by any financial institution for non-sufficient funds in the
customer’s account, must pay all bills in cash or by cashier’s check for a
period of one year in which no reoccurrence takes place. In addition, all
checks returned for non-sufficient funds (bad checks) shall be charged a $25
fee, as authorized by G.S. § 25-3-506, as amended.
      (2)   If the customer presents written evidence that the returned check
was the result of an error by the financial institution upon which it was
drawn, the Billing Director shall waive the requirements of this section, but
not the $25 fee.
   (D)   Where a meter for any reason is not read at the regular reading time,
the city may calculate the amount of service used with reference to the
customer’s normal consumption, and make any adjustment which may be necessary
in the bill rendered when the meter is next read; or the city may, in that
event, render the customer a bill for the minimum charge, the charge to be
credited to the customer when the meter is read and bills computed for the
normal billing cycle. The minimum charge for residential water and sewer
consumption when the meter is broken or does not exist, shall be based upon
3,000 gallons per month for each person residing in the dwelling. The minimum
charge for commercial or industrial water and sewer consumption shall be based
on average prior consumption for three months if metered; and shall be
negotiated by the City Manager based upon estimated usage where no meter will
exist (i.e., sewer service only).
   (E)   No claim or demand which the customer may have against the city shall
be set off or counterclaimed against the payment of any sum of money due the
city by the customer for services rendered, and all sums shall be paid in
accordance with the utility service agreement regardless of the claim or
demand.
   (F)   Disconnection for late payment.
      (1)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city’s form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address,
room number and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill;
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second
bill will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid
within ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be discontinued
for nonpayment; and
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.
      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.
      (3)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge.

Ord. 14-16, passed 9-30-2014) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Use of water, sewer, electric or natural gas service after
disconnection by the city, whether reconnected by the customer or anyone other
than an authorized employee of the city, shall constitute theft of the utility
service by the customer. The usage shall be a violation of the municipal code
of the city and punishable by any means delineated in §
10.99. The civil penalty for the violation, as authorized by §
10.99(B), shall be $300 for each and every offense. Every day that the
violation continues shall be a separate and distinct offense (see tampering
policy).
   (B)   The civil penalties shall be recovered by the city in a civil action
in the nature of debt if the offender does not pay the civil penalty within
seven days of written notification of the penalty by the Billing Director,
either delivered by a police officer or by registered or certified mail to the
customer’s billing address. The seven days shall begin either upon actual
delivery by the police officer or upon the date upon which the registered or
certified letter was mailed.

§ 51.01 DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE FACILITIES; INSTALLATION; MAKING CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   The city’s distribution and service facilities will be installed above
ground on poles, towers or other fixtures; however, underground facilities may
be provided when requested by the customer, in accordance with the city’s
underground installation policy.
   (B)   The city may require the customer to perform any excavation conduits
and backfill necessary for the installation of underground electric service and
may require the customer to provide concrete foundation pads for transformers
or other pad-mounted equipment associated with underground service. All work
shall be in accordance with the city’s specifications.
   (C)   Service connections will be made as follows.
      (1)   Where both the city’s lines and the customer’s entrance conductors
are above ground, and where the service agreement between the city and the
customer is not to be made on one of the city’s electric service agreements.
The city will extend its service conductors to the customer’s building,
terminating them on the outside of the building at an attachment point provided
by the customer at a location and route provided by the customer and
satisfactory to the city for this purpose. As to electricity, the attachment
point must be of sufficient height to satisfy the requirements of the National
Electrical Safety Code and of applicable local and state codes, and the
strength of the structure at the point of connections must be satisfactory to
the city. The customer will provide and own all meter sockets or enclosures per
city specifications, with the exception of 13 terminal meter bases. The
customer will install all meter bases and enclosures. The city will make the
necessary connections from its service conductors to the customer’s entrance
conductors.
      (2)   Where both the city’s lines and the customer’s entrance conductors
are below ground, or when one is above ground and the other is below ground, or
where the size of the customer’s demand or any unusual character of the
customer’s location requires the service agreement between the city and the
customer to be made on one of the city’s electric service agreement, the city
will make the necessary connections from its service conductors to the
customer’s entrance conductors as in division (D)(1) above, if applicable, or
as in division (D)(3) below, if applicable. If neither divisions (D)(1) above
nor (D)(3) below is applicable, the connection shall be at a point to be agreed
upon by the city and the customer.
      (3)   (a)   When, in the city’s opinion, an individual transformer
installation is necessary to serve the customer’s demand and the demand exceeds
the capacity of a pole-type transformer installation, the city will require the
customer to provide suitable outdoor space on the customer’s premises to
accommodate a ground-type transformer installation, or substation.
         (b)   When the incoming service is overhead and the customer provides
space for a ground-type transformer installation, or substation, the city will
erect a structure outside of and immediately adjacent to the fence surrounding
the installation, and will connect to the customer’s entrance conductors at
that point. The city may require the customer to provide main disconnecting
switches at the point of connection, which switches shall control all of the
customer’s load other than the fire pump circuit, if any. In the event the
space agreed upon for the installation is adjacent to one or more of the
customer’s building walls, the city will connect to the customer’s entrance
conductors on the outside of one of the walls.
      (4)   With respect to any service, after a service connection has been
made it may be changed by the city upon request of the customer, but the
customer must bear the expense of the change and the change will not be made
where it will interfere with or jeopardize the city’s service either to the
customer desiring the change or to any other customer or customers.
(Prior Code, § 11-20)
§ 51.02 RIGHT-OF-WAY FOR ELECTRIC LINES.
   (A)   The customer shall, at all times, furnish the city a satisfactory and
lawful right-of-way over the customer’s premises for the city’s electric lines
and apparatus necessary or incidental to the furnishing of electric service and
shall also provide satisfactory outdoor locations for metering equipment.
   (B)   The city may change the location of the right-of-way upon request of
the customer and may require the customer to bear the expense of the change;
the change will not be made where it will interfere with or jeopardize the
city’s service, either to the customer requesting the change, or to any other
customer. All privileges of the city incident to the original location shall
apply to the new location.
   (C)   The obligation of the city to supply service is dependent upon the
city securing and retaining all necessary rights-of-way, privileges, franchises
or permits, for the delivery of the service, and the city shall not be liable
to the customer for any failure to deliver service because of the city’s
inability to secure or retain the rights-of-way, privileges, franchises or
permits.
(Prior Code, § 11-21)
§ 51.03 CUSTOMER’S WIRING AND EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Notice to city required; installation and maintenance.
      (1)   Equipment which will operate in one locality may be useless in
another due to difference in voltage, phase or frequency of electric service;
therefore, before wiring a premises or purchasing equipment, the customer shall
give the city notice and shall ascertain the character of service available at
the premises. The city may specify the voltage and type of electric service to
be furnished, also the location of the meter and the point where the service
connection shall be made.
      (2)   All the customer’s wiring and equipment must be installed and
maintained in accordance with the requirements of the city; otherwise, the city
may refuse to connect service to the customer or may discontinue service to
same. The customer shall keep in repair all wiring and equipment to the point
of connection with the facilities of the city.
(Prior Code, § 11-22)
   (B)   Changes.
      (1)   The customer shall not employ or utilize, without the written
consent of the city, any equipment, appliance or device, or permit the
continuation of any condition, which tends to create any hazard or otherwise to
affect adversely the city’s service to the customer or to others. When
polyphase electric service is used by any customer, the customer shall control
the use of service so that the load will be maintained in reasonable electrical
balance between the phases at the point of delivery.
      (2)   The customer shall give the city reasonable notice in writing of
any anticipated increase in demand exceeding 20 kilowatts or 10% of former
demand, whichever is greater, and stating the approximate excess and date
required. If, in the opinion of the city, the unexpired term of the agreement
is sufficient to justify the additional investment required, the city will
endeavor to provide additional capacity for any increase so requested by the
customer within reasonable notice.
      (3)   The city will extend its facilities and change the point of
delivery only when the investment required is warranted by the anticipated
revenue and when the extension is permissible and feasible.
(Prior Code, § 11-23)
§ 51.04 OWNERSHIP OF EQUIPMENT.
   All electric conductors and conduits, inside work and equipment, switches,
fuses and circuit breakers, from the point of connection with the city’s
service shall be installed and maintained by and at the expense of the
customer. All equipment furnished by the city shall be and remain the property
of the city.
(Prior Code, § 11-24)
§ 51.05 OVERCHARGE OR UNDERCHARGE.
   If the city has inadvertently overcharged or undercharged a customer as a
result of a misapplied schedule, an error in meter reading, a skipped meter
reading or other human or machine error, except meter inaccuracy, or if the
customer has bypassed or otherwise tampered with the meter, has otherwise acted
in a fraudulent or willfully misleading manner, or has knowledge of being
undercharged without notifying the city, the city shall adjust its charges to

   (D)   Wavier of requirements; approval; certificate; review; revocation. In
the event that any new sewer user is unable to comply with any provision
contained in this subchapter, whether because of the physical location of his
or her premises, the nature of his or her operations, conditions beyond his or
her control, or circumstances which would render compliance unreasonable, or
impractical, or would result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of
property, or in the closing and elimination of any lawful business occupation
or activity, he or she may apply to the Director for a certificate of waiver,
specifying the requirement sought to be waived and the reason underlying the
request. Upon receipt of the request, the Director shall examine the premises
and operations in question to determine whether adequate justification exists.
If good cause is shown, the Director may thereafter issue a certificate of
waiver which sets forth the findings of fact as determined by the Director with
respect to the request, the grounds upon which the certificate is based, and
the specific conditions and restrictions to which the continued validity of the
certificate are subject, including without limitations, the payment by the
requesting party of the additional charges as are necessary, in the
determination of the Director, to compensate for the excess burden on the sewer
system occasioned by the waiver. The certificate of waiver may be conditioned
upon periodic review of the grounds upon which it is based, and any certificate
shall be revocable by the Director for good cause at any time upon 90 days
notice to the party who has been granted the waiver. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to modify or affect the application hereof as to the
requesting party. The Director shall maintain publicly at his or her office a
file containing copies of all current certificates of waiver issued.

reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case
shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in non-compliance
with any state or federal regulation or guideline;
         (i)   Any wastewater which imparts color which causes the treatment
plant effluent to violate the NPDES permit limit for color, if applicable;
         (j)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes,
except as specifically approved by the POTW Director in compliance with
applicable state or federal regulations;
         (k)   Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by a

         (l)   Recognizable portions of human or animal anatomy.
      (3)   When the Director determines that a user(s) is contributing to the
POTW, any of the above enumerated substances in amounts as may cause or
contribute to interference of POTW operation, pass through or cause violation
of agreement with other governmental units, the Director shall:
         (a)   Advise the user(s) of the potential impact of the contribution
on the POTW in accordance herewith; and
         (b)   Take appropriate actions in accordance with §

53.131, that may cause potential problems for the POTW Director, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. This notification
shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   (1)   Within five days following the discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the POTW Director, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences.
      (2)   The notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
the notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability
which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
   (D)   All SIUs are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at
its facility affecting the potential for spills and other accidental discharge,
discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge,
or a slug load as defined in §
53.131.

(Ord. 01-19, passed 3-27-2001; Ord. 13-20, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 53.151 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user
indicates a violation, the user must notify the POTW Director within 24 hours
of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the POTW Director
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. If allowed by the POTW
Director, the user is not required to resample:
      (1)   If the POTW Director monitors at the user’s facility at least once
a month; or
      (2)   If the POTW Director samples between the users initial sampling and
when the user receives the results of this sampling.
   (B)   If the POTW Director has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu
of the industrial user and the POTW sampling of the user indicates a violation,
the POTW Director shall repeat the sampling and obtain the results of the
repeat analysis within 30 days after becoming aware of the violations, unless
sone of the following occurs:
      (1)   The POTW Director monitors at the user’s facility at least once a
month;
      (2)   The POTW Director samples the user between their initial sampling
and when the POTW receives the results of this initial sampling; or
      (3)   The POTW Director requires the user to perform sampling and submit
the results to the POTW Director within the 30 day deadline of the POTW
becoming aware of the violation.
   (C)   Notification of the intent to discharge hazardous waste. The city
prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification to and
approval by the POTW Director.
      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. part 261. The notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of the waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent the
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of the constituents in the waste stream discharge during any
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of constituents
in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
All notifications must take place no later than 180 days before the discharge
commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written
approval from the city. Any notification under this division need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
53.148. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
53.144,
53.146 and
53.147.
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (1) above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulation under § 3001 of RCRA, being 42
U.S.C. 6921, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or
listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of
the effective date of the regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 53.152 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be
submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall
be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part
136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be
performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. Analyses must be
performed by a state certified lab for each parameter analyzed, if such
certification exists for that parameter.
   (B)   Grab and composite sample collection.
      (1)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (2)   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as
required by 40 C.F.R. 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs
necessary to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 C.F.R. 403.12(g)
(5) for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90-day
compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW Director may allow collection of
multiple grabs during a 24 hour period which are composited prior to analysis
as allowed under 40 C.F.R. 136.
      (3)   Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be
collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there
is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow
proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Director. When
authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be
representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented.
   (C)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
   (D)   Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this subchapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant
to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of the
requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of the analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the POTW Director.
   (E)   Electronic reporting. The POTW Director may develop procedures for
receipt of electronic reports for any reporting requirements of this chapter.
Such procedures shall comply with 40 C.F.R. part 3. These procedures shall be
enforceable under§
53.165 through
53.168 of this chapter.
   (F)   Special reporting requirements for Ius in satellite POTW. In the case
of industrial user located in a satellite POTW organization’s jurisdiction, all
information required to be reported to the industrial user’s pretreatment
program Control Authority by this chapter shall also be reported to the POTW
treatment plant organization.

§ 53.153 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Monitoring facilities.
      (1)   The city may require the user to provide and operate at the user’s
own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
city may, when a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
      (2)   There shall be ample room in or near the sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
      (3)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the city.
   (B)   Inspection of facilities. The city will inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city, approval authority
and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The city,
approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user’s
property the devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements
with his or her security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities. Denial of the city’s, approval authority’s or EPA’s
access to the user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access.
   (C)   Search warrants. If the city, approval authority or EPA has been
refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and
is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation
of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify
compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued thereunder, or to
protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then
the city, approval authority or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from
the court having jurisdiction within the city.

§ 53.154 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   Information and data provided by an industrial user to the POTW
Director pursuant to this chapter identifying the nature and frequency of a
discharge, shall be available to the public without restriction. All other
information which may be so submitted by an industrial user to the POTW
Director in connection with any required reports shall also be available to the
public unless the industrial user or other interested person specifically
identifies the information as confidential upon submission and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW Director that the disclosure of
such information or a particular part thereof to the general public would
divulge methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets.
   (B)   Information provided by an industrial user to the POTW Director that
is determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be made available
upon written request to the Division of Water Resources or any state agency for
uses related to the Pretreatment Program, the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, collection system permit, stormwater permit,
and/or non-discharge permit, and for uses related to judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
   (C)   Information and data received by the Division or other state agency
under division (B) above shall be subject to the processes set forth in G.S. §
143-215.3C.

pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may serve upon a person a written
notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the date of
this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. Submission of
this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the non-compliance.
The orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to
correct the non-compliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order
issued pursuant to division (D) below.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.
      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this chapter or is in
non-compliance with a wastewater discharge permit, to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW Director
determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for the action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be
made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the
hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to
the assessment of a civil penalty under §
53.166, nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director under this
section subject to an administrative appeal under §
53.170.
   (D)   Administrative orders. When the POTW Director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter, permits or orders
issued thereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may
issue an order to cease and desist all violations and direct those persons in
non-compliance to do any of the following:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in
the order;
      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a
continuing or threatened violation; and
      (4)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
   (E)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/
or wastewater permit when suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes
with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or non-
discharge permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension
to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user’s waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the shall take steps as deemed necessary including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW
system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW Director shall reinstate
the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the
elimination of the non-compliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a
detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution
and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW Director
prior to the date of the above-described hearing.
   (F)   Termination of permit or permission to discharge.
      (1)   The POTW Director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or
permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the
following reasons:

   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Director
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset and if this submittal was done
orally, has followed with a written submission within five days.
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-
compliance;
         (b)   The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.
   (C)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (D)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for non-compliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (F)   Prohibited discharge standards defense. A user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for non-
compliance with the general prohibitions in §
53.132(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
53.132(B)(2), (3), (5)-(7) and (9)-(23), if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interfere and that
either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with a limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (G)   Bypass. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of divisions (B) and (C) above.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW Director at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW Director may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
      (3)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (B) above.
      (4)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Director determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C) above.

§ 53.187 LEVELS OF RESPONSE.
   Five levels of water shortage response are outlined in the table below. The
five levels of water shortage response are: voluntary reductions, mandatory
reductions I and II, emergency reductions and water rationing. A detailed
description of each response level and corresponding water reduction measures
follow below.
 
Stage Response                Description
                              Water users are encouraged to reduce their water
1     Voluntary reductions    use and improve water use efficiency; however, no
                              penalties apply for noncompliance. Water supply
                              conditions indicate a potential for shortage.
                              Water users must abide required water use
                              reduction and efficiency measures; penalties
2     Mandatory reductions I  apply for noncompliance. Water supply conditions
                              are significantly lower than the seasonal norm
                              and water shortage conditions are expected to
                              persist.
3     Mandatory reductions II Same as in Stage 2.
                              Water supply conditions are substantially
4     Emergency reductions    diminished and pose an imminent threat to human
                              health or environmental integrity.
                              Water supply conditions are substantially
5     Water rationing         diminished and remaining supplies must be
                              allocated to preserve human health and
                              environmental integrity.
 
   (A)   Stage 1, voluntary reductions. All water users will be asked to reduce
their normal water use by 5%. Customer education and outreach programs will
encourage water conservation and efficiency measures including: irrigating
landscapes a maximum of one inch per week; preventing water waste, runoff and
watering impervious surfaces; watering plants deeply to encourage root growth;
washing only full loads in clothes and dishwashers; using spring-loaded nozzles
on garden hoses; and identifying and repairing all water leaks.
   (B)   Stage 2, mandatory reductions I. All customers are expected to reduce
their water use by 10% in comparison to their previous month’s water bill. In
addition to continuing to encourage all voluntary reduction actions, the
following restrictions apply: irrigation is limited to a one-half inch per week
between 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.; outdoor use of drinking water for washing
impervious surfaces is prohibited; and all testing and training purposes
requiring drinking water (e.g., fire protection) will be limited.
   (C)   Stage 3, mandatory reductions II. Customers must continue actions from
all previous stages and further reduce water use by 20% compared to their
previous month’s water bill. All non-essential uses of drinking water are
banned and garden and landscape irrigation must be reduced to the minimum
amount necessary for survival. Additionally, in Stage 3, a drought surcharge of
1.5 times the normal water rate applies.
   (D)   Stage 4, emergency reductions. Customers must continue all actions
from previous stages and further reduce their water use by 25% compared to
their previous month’s water bill. A ban on all use of drinking water except to
protect public health and safety is implemented and drought surcharges increase
to two times the normal water rate.
   (E)   Stage 5, water rationing. Is to provide drinking water to protect
public health (e.g., residences, residential health care facilities and
correctional facilities). In Stage 5, all customers are only permitted to use
water at the minimum required for public health protection. Firefighting is the
only allowable outdoor water use and pickup locations for distributing potable
water will be announced according to the city’s emergency response plan.
Drought surcharges increase to five times the normal water rate.

§ 53.188 TRIGGERS.
 
Stage Usable Storage Water Level
1     <75%           5 feet below full
2     <65%           8 feet below full
3     <50%           11 feet below full
4     <30%           15 feet below full
5     <10%           Water below top of lower intake
 
   Return to normal. When water shortage conditions have abated and the
situation is returning to normal, water conservation measures employed during
each phase should be decreased in reverse order of implementation. Permanent
measures directed toward long-term monitoring and conservation should be
implemented or continued so that the community will be in a better position to
prevent shortages and respond to recurring water shortage conditions.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 54.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be officially known as "The Phase II Stormwater
Ordinance." It is referred to herein as "this chapter."
(Ord. 15-01, passed 1-15-2015)
§ 54.002 AUTHORITY.
   The City Council is authorized to adopt this chapter to create a stormwater
utility and establish a schedule of stormwater fees for property in the
corporate limits, pursuant to North Carolina law, including but not limited to
Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; G.S. 143-214.7 and
rules promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder;
Session Law 2004-163; Chapter 160A 174, 185.4.
(Ord. 15-01, passed 1-15-2015)
§ 54.003 STORMWATER UTILITY.
   A stormwater utility is hereby established to provide stormwater management
services, as authorized by state law. Stormwater service charges will be
determined and modified from time to time so that the total revenues generated
by said charges will be used to pay the principal of and interest on the debt
incurred for stormwater purposes and such expenses as are reasonably necessary
or convenient in the planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of the
stormwater system. (Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North
Carolina; G.S. § 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the Environmental
Management Commission thereunder; Session Law 2004-163; Chapter 160A §§ 174,
185.)
(Ord. 15-01, passed 1-15-2015)
§ 54.004 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Whereas, development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response
of local watersheds and increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, soil erosion stream channel erosion, non-point and point source
pollution, sediment transport and deposition, and reduce groundwater recharge;
   (B)   Whereas, these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are
harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment These
effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned
controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites;
   (C)   Whereas, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (Clean Water
Act) and Federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as
rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in
response to Federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas,
including the city, to adopt stormwater controls as included in this chapter;
and
   (D)   Whereas, the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit became effective December 1, 2011, and requires the city to
adopt a local ordinance implementing stormwater controls on sites during and
after construction activity.
   (E)   Therefore, the City Council hereby establishes this set of regulations
to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of
stormwater runoff and discharge.
(Ord. 15-01, passed 1-15-2015)
§ 54.005 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (A)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect,
maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare
by establishing requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of
increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source
pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit
discharges into municipal stormwater systems. Proper management of
construction-related and post development stormwater runoff will minimize
damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public
health, safety, and general welfare, and protect water and aquatic resources.
   (B)   The chapter seeks to meet the requirements of the city's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit and its general purposes
through;
      (1)   Establishing decision-making process for development that protects
the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;
      (2)   Requiring new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as
practicable to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint and point source
pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of
stream channels and aquatic habitats;
      (3)   Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater
runoff quantity and quality;
      (4)   Establishing design and review criteria for the construction,
function, and use of structural stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) to
meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
      (5)   Encouraging the use of better management and set design practices,
such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of
green space, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum
extent practicable;
      (6)   Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they
continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no
threat to public safety; and
      (7)   Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of
approved projects, and to assure appropriate long term maintenance.
(Ord. 15-01, passed 1-15-2015)
§ 54.006 SERVICE CHARGES, RATES AND FEE SCHEDULE.
   (A)   Stormwater service charges shall accrue beginning on February 1, 2014.
Stormwater service charges shall apply to all property within the city limits
that is serviced by the city's stormwater system without regard to ownership.
Such charges shall be based on the amount of impervious surface on each parcel
as determined by the equivalent residential unit standard. For purposes of this
chapter, and equivalent residential unit (ERU) is 2000 square feet of
impervious surface.
   (B)   The City Council shall set a base rate for single-family residential
uses and charges for non-single-family residential uses shall be calculated
utilizing the equivalent residential unit. For purposes of this chapter, a
"non-single-family residential use" shall be any land use other than single-
family residential, except for undeveloped land.
(Ord. 15-01, passed 1-15-2015)
§ 54.007 EXEMPTIONS AND CREDITS.
   Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be
exempt from stormwater service charges or receive a credit against such
charges.
   (A)   Only undeveloped land shall be exempt from stormwater service fees.
   (B)   Properties subject to stormwater service fees may be granted credits
against the fees in accordance with a credit policy manual developed by the
City Manager and referenced in the city fee schedule. Any non-single-family
residential use that provides measures to mitigate the impacts of runoff on the
stormwater system shall be eligible for a maximum credit of 40% of the service
fee. The amount of the credit shall be proportional to the extent the measures
address the impacts on peak discharge, total runoff volume and water quality as
compared to the applicable city, state, and federal standards. Water quantity
and water quality measures shall each be eligible for a 20% maximum credit. Any
credit allowance shall be conditional on continuing compliance with applicable
standards, including requirements for operation and maintenance. Subject to
approval in accordance with the credit policy, any credits shall be effective
on the date of application therefore.
   (C)   The city shall be responsible only for the portions of the drainage
system which are in the city-maintained street rights-of-way and permanent
storm drainage easements conveyed to and accepted by the city. Repairs and
improvements to the drainage system shall be in accordance with established
standards.
   (D)   The city's acquisition of storm drainage easements and/or the
construction or repair by the city of drainage facilities does not constitute a
warranty against stormwater hazards, including, but not limited to, flooding,
erosion, or standing water.
(Ord. 15-01, passed 1-15-2015)

plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not
limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan
application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design)
or physical demarcation (including but not limited to boundary signs, lot
stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur
on a specific plot.
   LOW-DENSITY PROJECT.
      (1)   For a project that is not located within one-half mile of and
draining to Shellfish Resource Waters: the project is a low-density project if
it has no more than two dwelling units per acre or 24% built-upon area (BUA)
for all residential and non-residential development.
      (2)   For a project that is located within one-half mile of and draining
to Shellfish Resource Waters: the project is a low-density project only if it
contains no more than 12% built-upon area (BUA).
      (3)   A project with an overall density at or below the relevant low-
density threshold, but containing areas with a density greater than the overall
project density, may be considered low- density as long as the project meets or
exceeds the post construction model practices for low-density projects and
locates the higher density in upland areas and away from surface waters and
drainage ways to the maximum extent practicable.
   ONE-YEAR, TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR STORM (1-YEAR, 24-HOUR STORM). The surface runoff
resulting from a 24-hour rainfall of intensity expected to be equaled or
exceeded, on average, once in 12 months and with duration of 24 hours.
   OWNER. The legal or beneficial owner of land, including but not limited to a
mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, or long-term or
commercial lessee, or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights in
the property or having legal power of management and control of the property.
OWNER shall include long-term commercial tenants, management entities, such as
those charged with or engaged in the management of properties for profit, and
every person or entity having joint ownership of the property. A secured lender
not in possession of the property does not constitute an owner, unless the
secured lender is included within the meaning of OWNER under another
description in this definition, such as a management entity.
   REDEVELOPMENT. Any development on previously-developed land, other than a
rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and
provides equal or greater stormwater control than the previous development.
   STRUCTURAL BMP. A physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter
pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff
velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-
development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of
these goals. Structural BMP includes physical practices such as constructed
wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other
methods installed or created on real property. STRUCTURAL BMP is synonymous
with "structural practice," "stormwater control facility," "stormwater control
practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater management practice,"
"stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater treatment systems," and
similar terms used in this chapter.
   SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS. For the purposes of determining whether sufficient
progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following
construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan
shall occur: obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a
continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; installation and
approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the
construction and approval of a building foundation. SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS for
purposes of determining whether an approved plan is null and void is not
necessarily the same as SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES used for determining vested
rights pursuant to applicable law.

on a concept plan for the post-construction stormwater management system to be
utilized in the proposed development project. This consultation meeting should
take place at the time of the preliminary plan of subdivision or other early
step in the development process. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the
post-construction stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed
project, as well as to discuss and assess constraints, opportunities and
potential approaches to stormwater management designs before formal site design
engineering is commenced. Local watershed plans, and other relevant resource
protection plans should be consulted in the discussion of the concept plan.
      (2)   To accomplish this goal, the following information should be
included in the concept plan, which should be submitted in advance of the
meeting:
         (a)   Existing conditions/proposed site plans. Existing conditions and
proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a minimum: existing and
proposed topography; perennial and intermittent streams; mapping of predominant
soils from soil surveys (if available); boundaries of existing predominant
vegetation; proposed limits of clearing and grading; and location of existing
and proposed roads, buildings, parking areas and other impervious surfaces.
         (b)   Natural resources inventory. A written or graphic inventory of
natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the
commencement of the project. This description should include a discussion of
soil conditions, forest cover, geologic features, topography, wetlands, and
native vegetative areas on the site, as well as the location and boundaries of
other natural feature protection and conservation areas such as lakes, ponds,
floodplains, stream buffers and other setbacks (e.g., drinking water well
setbacks, septic setbacks, and the like). Particular attention should be paid
to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or
constraints for development and stormwater management.
         (c)   Stormwater management system concept plan. A written or graphic
concept plan of the proposed post-development stormwater management system
including: preliminary selection and location of proposed structural stormwater
controls; low-impact design elements; location of existing and proposed
conveyance systems such as grass channels, swales, and storm drains; flow
paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits; relationship of site to upstream
and downstream properties and drainages; and preliminary location of any
proposed stream channel modifications, such as bridge or culvert crossings.
   (B)   Stormwater management permit application.
      (1)   The stormwater management permit application shall detail how post-
development. stormwater runoff will be controlled and managed and how the
proposed project will meet the requirements of this chapter. All such plans for
any non-single-family residence shall be prepared by a qualified registered

      (1)   Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy
shall be granted, the applicant shall certify that the completed project is in
accordance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs, and shall
submit actual "as-built" plans for all stormwater management facilities or
practices after final construction is completed.
      (2)   The plans shall show the final design specifications for all
stormwater management facilities and practices and the field location, size,
depth, and planted vegetation of all measures, controls, and devices, as
installed. The designer of the stormwater management measures and plans shall
certify, under seal, that the as-built stormwater measures, controls, and
devices are in compliance with the approved stormwater management plans and
designs and with the requirements of this chapter. A final inspection and
approval by the Stormwater Administrator shall occur before the release of any
performance securities.
   (D)   Other permits. No certificate of compliance or occupancy shall be
issued by the Building Inspector without final as-built plans and a final
inspection and approval by the Stormwater Administrator, except where multiple
units are served by the stormwater practice or facilities, in which case the
Building Inspector may elect to withhold a percentage of permits or
certificates of occupancy until as-built plans are submitted and final
inspection and approval has occurred.
(Ord. 15-01, passed 1-15-2015)
§ 54.033 APPROVALS.
   (A)   Effect of approval. Approval authorizes the applicant to go forward
with only the specific plans and activities authorized in the permit. The
approval shall not be construed to exempt the applicant from obtaining other
applicable approvals from local, state, and federal authorities.
   (B)   Time limit/expiration.
      (1)   An approved plan shall become null and void if the applicant fails
to make substantial progress on the site within one year after the date of
approval. The Stormwater Administrator may grant a single, one-year extension
of this time limit, for good cause shown, upon receiving a written request from
the applicant before the expiration of the approved plan.
      (2)   In granting an extension, the Stormwater Administrator may require
compliance with standards adopted since the original application was submitted
unless there has been substantial reliance on the original permit and the
change in standards would infringe the applicant's vested rights.

§ 54.071 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.
   (A)   In general.
      (1)   Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to
be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this chapter, and prior to issuance
of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP
pursuant to this chapter, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an
operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent
owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the
structural BMP, until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served
by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary
responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement.
      (2)   The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or
owners to maintain, repair and if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP,
and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the
structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the city a right of entry in the
event that the Stormwater Administrator has reason to believe it has become
necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair or reconstruct the structural
BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an
obligation on the city to assume responsibility for the structural BMP.
      (3)   The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the
Stormwater Administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on
the final plat and shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds upon
final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be
given to the Stormwater Administrator within 14 days following its recordation.
   (B)   Special requirement for homeowners' and other associations. For all
structural BMPs required pursuant to this chapter and that are to be or are
owned and maintained by a homeowners' association, property owners'
association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance
agreement shall include all the following provisions:
      (1)   Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and
maintain the stormwater control and management facilities.
      (2)   Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for
sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major
repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not
performing adequately or as intended or are not properly maintained, the city,
in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such instances the
city shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be
spent by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or
vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural
BMPs, provided that the city shall first consent to the expenditure.
      (3)   Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the
escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits,
whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an
amount equal to 15% of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs.
Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into
the escrow account within the first five years and the full amount shall be
deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural
BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of
the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the
escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced
in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking
fund budget.
      (4)   The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund
the escrow account may be varied by the city depending on the design and
materials of the stormwater control and management facility.
      (5)   Granting to the city a right of entry to inspect, monitor,

§ 54.073 PERFORMANCE SECURITY FOR INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   May be required. The city may, at its discretion, require the
submittal of a performance security or bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of
credit or other acceptable legal arrangement prior to issuance of a permit in
order to ensure that the structural BMPs are:
      (1)   Installed by the permit holder as required by the approved
stormwater management plan; and/or
      (2)   Maintained by the owner as required by the operation and
maintenance agreement.
   (B)   Amount.
      (1)   Installation. The amount of an installation performance security
shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs approved under the
permit, plus 25%.
      (2)   Maintenance. The amount of a maintenance performance security shall
be the present value of an annuity of perpetual duration based on a reasonable
estimate of the annual cost of inspection, operation and maintenance of the
BMPs approved under the permit, at a discount rate that reflects the
jurisdiction's cost of borrowing minus a reasonable estimate of long-term
inflation.
   (C)   Uses of performance security.
      (1)   Forfeiture provisions. The performance security shall contain
forfeiture provisions for failure, after proper notice, to complete work within
the time specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions which may be
required of the applicant or owner in accordance with this chapter, approvals
issued pursuant to this chapter, or an operation and maintenance agreement
established pursuant to this chapter.
      (2)   Default. Upon default of the owner to construct maintain, repair
and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the
applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement, the Stormwater
Administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of the security to make
the necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure
of funds shall only be
made after requesting the owner to comply with the permit or maintenance
agreement. In the event of default triggering the use of installation
performance security, the city shall not return any of the unused deposited
cash funds or other security, which shall be retained for maintenance.
      (3)   Costs in excess of performance security. If the city takes action
upon such failure by the applicant or owner, the city may collect from the
applicant or owner the difference between the amount of the reasonable cost of
such action and the amount of the security held, in addition to any other
penalties or damages due.
      (4)   Refund. Within sixty days of the final approval, the installation
performance security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, except
any amount attributable to the cost (plus 25%) of landscaping installation and
ongoing maintenance associated with the BMPs covered by the security. Any such
landscaping shall be inspected one year after installation with replacement for
compliance with the approved plans and specifications and, if in compliance,
the portion of the financial security attributable to landscaping shall be
released.

and maintenance agreement, conservation easement, or dedication and acceptance
into public maintenance (whichever is applicable) pertaining to every
structural BMP shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with
the county Register of Deeds upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat
is recorded for the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement,
conservation easement, or dedication and acceptance into public maintenance,
whichever is applicable shall be recorded with the county Register of Deeds so
as to appear in the chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under generally
accepted searching principles.
   (B)   Signage. Where appropriate in the determination of the Stormwater
Administrator to assure compliance with this chapter, structural BMPs shall be
posted with a conspicuous sign stating who is responsible for required

74.99
§ 74.03 REGULATION, PERMITS AND FEES.
   Golf carts being operated on the permitted streets within the city must be
in compliance with the following.
   (A)   There may be two applications for golf cart permits per household made
each year. For any number greater than two, they must be approved by the City
Manager. All applicants for golf cart permits must be residents within the city
limits.
   (B)   The application must be on a form approved by the city for this
purpose.
   (C)   The applicant must be the owner of the golf cart and provide with the
application, proof of liability insurance in at least the minimum coverages for
liability insurance, as is required for the operation of other motor vehicles
for operation on the streets and highways of the state. The required liability
insurance coverage must be maintained in effect during all times when a permit
issued is in a valid status and/or as long as the golf cart is being operated
on the streets of the city.
   (D)   Permits/stickers will be issued to an owner of only electric or gas
golf carts.
   (E)   All golf carts must be meet minimum requirements and standards for
safety equipment. A photograph of the golf cart for which a permit may be

However, one may operate a golf cart if one has been issued a limited learners
permit under those restrictions and requirements as are set out in G.S. § 20-11
and its subparagraphs. A driver or operator 18 years of age and older, with a
medical or physical condition that prevents that individual from being able to
obtain a valid state driver’s license, may be able to operate a golf cart. The
medical condition must be evidenced with professional, certified medical proof
that indicates that the condition prevents the driver or operator from taking a
driver licensing exam. The medical professional must document that the operator
does not possess a medical condition that would prevent the safe operation of a
motor vehicle and this documentation must be updated annually. Any driver or
operator that is exempt from the requirement of a valid state driver’s license
must still present and have on record and in their possession while operating a
golf cart, a valid state identification card.
   (G)   The permit and/or sticker which will be issued by the city, indicating
that the golf cart has been authorized to be operated on the streets of the
city, shall have that permit and/or sticker affixed to the golf cart during its
operation in a prominent area on the golf cart for display.
   (H)   Golf carts by design are equipped to seat a certain number of
passengers. Each golf cart differs in that it may accommodate two to six
passengers generally. This section is designed to regulate overcrowding or
reckless operation of a golf cart. Therefore, no passengers are permitted to
stand on a golf cart while it is in operation.
   (I)   Permits/stickers will be issued annually, and shall be valid from July
1 of a year through June 30 of the following year. The fee to be paid upon the
issuance of permit/sticker shall be in the sum of $20 annually, and as may be
amended, and such is not an amount which may be prorated. Lost or stolen
permits/stickers are the responsibility of the owner. The city shall
immediately be notified in the event of a lost or stolen permit/sticker. The
city may require a new application to be filed for the issuance of a permit/
sticker for that golf cart from which a permit/sticker has been lost or stolen.
This re-application may require the resubmission of any and all fees necessary
before a replacement permit/sticker is issued.

74.99
§ 74.05 LIABILITY DISCLAIMER.
   This chapter is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Golf carts
are not designed or manufactured to be used on public streets and the city in
no way advocates or endorses their operation on public streets or roads. The
city, by regulating the operation, is merely trying to address obvious safety
issues, and adoption of this chapter is not to be relied upon as a
determination that operation on a public street or public vehicular area is
safe or advisable if done in accordance with this chapter. All persons who
operate or ride upon golf carts on public streets or public vehicular areas do
so at their own risk and peril, and must be observant of and attentive to the
safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists,
bicyclist and pedestrians. The city has no liability under any theory of
liability and the city assumes no liability for permitting golf carts to be
operated on the public streets and public vehicular areas, under special
legislation granted by the state’s legislature. Any person who operates a golf
cart is responsible for procuring liability insurance sufficient to cover the
risk involved in using a golf cart on public streets and public vehicular areas
of the city.
(Ord. 08-24, passed 7-29-2008)

other penalty is provided, shall be, upon conviction, guilty of a misdemeanor
and subject to a fine not to exceed $50. Each date that any of the provisions
of this chapter are violated shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   Any owner of a permitted golf cart and/or an operator of the permitted
owner’s golf cart, who shall have been found to have violated this chapter on
at least two occasions, may be subject to a revocation of the permit issued for
the golf cart and may not be allowed to re-apply for at least two years from
the date of the second violation for a permit/sticker.

(Prior Code, § 14-73) (Ord. passed 11-26-1991)
§ 92.40 PERMIT TO CONSTRUCT.
   (A)   All structures, including stationary and floating docks, launching
ramps and mooring facilities, which are proposed for construction either on or
in the waters of Moss Lake, or upon or over the city’s control strip of land
adjacent to the lake (generally between the 736.0-foot and 744.0-foot above
mean sea level elevations), must be approved and inspected by the city’s
Building Inspector. Permit approval is required before construction can begin
on structures or dredging. Application for the permits may be obtained either
from the Park Ranger’s office or the Building Inspector’s office.
   (B)   Structure permits shall be submitted with a complete set of plans,
signed and sealed by a registered engineer, architect or landscape architect,
showing the proposed stationary pier, floating structure, launching ramp,
cluster mooring facility or seawall. The plans shall show the relationship of
the structure to the property lines, the projection of the property corners and
the materials of construction. The permit fee for structures shall be
recommended by the Moss Lake Commission and approved by resolution of the City
Council.
   (C)   Dredging permits shall be submitted with a complete set of plans
showing all elevation changes and required erosion protection (i.e., rip-rap,
seawall or similar measures). Documentation must be submitted for any required
permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the State Department of
Environment, Health and Natural Resources, Division of Land Resources, Land
Quality Section. The permit fee for dredging shall be recommended by the Moss
Lake Commission and approved by resolution of the City Council. A deposit shall
be collected prior to issuance of a dredging permit, as required by §
92.41(A).
   (D)   Final approval of the construction of any structure (stationary or
floating) shall require an as-built survey and certification of the registered
engineer, architect or landscape architect that the structure was built
substantially in accordance with the approved plans. All approved structures,
upon final inspection, shall have a permanent permit attached to the structure
to indicate it is an approved structure. All existing structures deemed in
compliance with the regulations contained in this chapter, also shall have the
permanent permit attached following an inspection by the Building Inspector or
the Park Ranger. Thereafter, any structure not having a permanent permit
attached shall be considered in violation of this chapter.
   (E)   The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall have the
authority to condemn piers, docks and any other structures built on the lake or
within the city’s control strip. However, the City Manager or the City
Manager’s designee must afford the property owner a hearing before the City
Manager or the City Manager’s designee, and determine from the evidence
presented whether repair or condemnation is required, giving the owner a
reasonable time period to comply with the City Manager or the City Manager’s
designee’s determination. All structures must be maintained properly by the
owner(s). A property whose structure is in disrepair, and following
notification to repair by the Building Inspector shall fail to do so within the
prescribed time, may have his or her lease agreement revoked by the City
Manager or the City Manager’s designee. The city may remove, or have removed,
any such structure in disrepair which the owner refuses to repair or remove
within the required time, and bill the property owner for the cost of said
removal. All structures and improvements shall be subject to periodic
inspections for the purpose of determining conformance with the chapter and
with this section. To that end the lease shall allow access into a structure
and make all engineering and architectural drawings available to the lessor.
      (1)   Other structures. In accordance with this section, no other
structures may be installed on the control strip. It is the spirit and intent
of this chapter to provide and preserve for safety, protection of the
watershed, protection of the reservoir, and enjoyment of a lake setting. For
example, no gazebos, picnic shelters and pergolas are allowed. Structures for
storage purposes such as “yard barns” and garages are not allowed. Other
structures that are not transitory in nature such as swimming pools, hot tubs,
house additions, and saunas are not allowed.
      (2)   Limits of projection.
         (a)   Stationary and floating pier structures may project into the
lake to a depth of ten feet below the normal water level. The maximum
projection of any structure into the lake shall be 60 feet from the 736 contour
line (normal pool). All projections shall normally be perpendicular to the
shoreline and shall be within the confines of the lake front lot being served.
         (b)   A projection may be established at each of the two property
corners located at the control strip. Each projection should be perpendicular
to a line connecting two points on the 744.0 contour line (control strip) where
a ten-foot radius from that property corner intersects that contour line, as
shown on Figure 1 attached to Ord. passed 3-31-1992, which is hereby adopted by
reference as part of this section.
         (c)   In cove areas, no structure shall project beyond the one-third
point of the width of the cove, as measured from the shoreline at the point of
proposed construction to the closest point on the opposite shore. The Moss Lake
Commission may grant variances to a property owner for unusual horizontal or
vertical configurations of the shoreline in coves or peninsulas which may
prevent a property owner fair access and use of the lake. In such cases, the
Moss Lake Commission will make a recommendation to the City Council for the
entire area affected. At least one-third of the waterway must be left
unobstructed.
         (d)   Where, due to existing non-conforming piers on nearby property
or to unusual property configuration, a pier cannot be constructed as described
above, the Moss Lake Commission may grant a variance from this requirement. The
Moss Lake Commission shall ensure that the proposed pier construction has no
effect on existing facilities.
      (3)   Material of construction.
         (a)   Materials of construction for pilings shall include reinforced
concrete, hot dipped galvanized steel, aluminum or pressure treated wood.
Materials of construction for decking shall include reinforced concrete, hot
dipped galvanized steel, aluminum fiberglass and treated wood. Floating
structures shall be constructed of hot dipped galvanized steel and polystyrene
floatation. Steel drums are prohibited. Anchorage for the floating structure
shall be of galvanized steel cables secured to reinforced concrete anchorage or
steel anchor piles in firm ground beyond the shoreline or approved pilings with
appropriate connections. The Building Inspector shall approve materials of
construction during permit review. The City Engineer may approve materials of
construction not listed above, if he or she determines that they will not
negatively impact water quality.
         (b)   All piers and docks shall have white reflectors located at least
six inches above full pool elevation, on the furthermost corners of the
extension of the pier into the water, which reflects light parallel to the
shoreline in each direction and directly across the lake. White reflectors
shall be placed on each side of the pier at intervals of 15 feet or less,
beginning at its outermost extensions into the water and extending to the 736
contour of the shoreline.
      (4)   Stationary piers. Stationary piers shall conform to divisions (E)
(1) and (2) above. Stationary structures may be covered, but no siding or wall
surfaces are permitted.
      (5)   Floating structures. Floating structures including ramps or bridge
sections used for access to the floating structure shall conform to divisions
(E)(1) and (2) above. The ramp or bridge shall be designed to accommodate any
rise or fall in water level.
      (6)   Boathouses.
         (a)   Boathouses may be constructed on private property, outside the
control strip, for use by lake front property owners in accordance with the
Cleveland County Zoning Ordinance of the Buffalo Creek Reservoir area. The Lake
Moss Commission exercises no jurisdiction or control over the materials or
design of boathouses, but recommends that materials for construction and the
design be compatible with the residence.
         (b)   A permit shall be obtained for the launching ramp or tram rails
which will facilitate the launching or withdrawing of the boat. The boat dolly
or other launching mechanism shall be withdrawn from the water, after the boat
is launched. The rail shall be galvanized steel pipe or rolled rail steel and
shall be securely anchored in concrete piers.
      (7)   Launching ramps. Launching ramps shall be constructed of 3,000 psi
minimum concrete with a minimum slab thickness of four inches. The ramp shall
not be less than 12 feet wide with a six- inch by six-inch curb. The concrete
ramp should begin approximately six feet from the shoreline and be sloped
approximately one inch per foot to drain toward the lake. The ramp shall then
be sloped along the lake floor approximately one and one-half inches to one and
three-fourths inches per foot until a water depth of two feet is reached or
approximately 14 feet. The ramp shall then slope approximately two inches per
foot to a water depth of four feet or approximately 12 feet. Where more than
one launching ramp is required at one site, they should be spaced approximately
six feet apart and separated by a four-foot wide stationary pier.
      (8)   Cluster mooring facilities (private). Cluster facilities shall be
installed where permitted by the Moss Lake Commission, for use by and for the
convenience of owners and residents of interior lots contained in residential
subdivisions of land bordering on the Moss Lake Reservoir area. Cluster
facilities shall conform to the requirements contained herein for stationary
and floating structures. These facilities may extend beyond the ten-foot depth
and beyond the 60-foot projection from the existing 736.0 contour line which is
specifically applicable to facilities constructed for use by the individual
owner of a lake front lot; provided that, a minimum distance of 300 feet
between the proposed projection and the opposite shore exists. The width of the
cluster facility shall be kept within the confines of the lake frontage of the
lot of land as described in division (E)(1) above.
      (9)   Cluster mooring facilities (public). A public mooring facility is
to be a full-service marina designed to serve the needs of the boater who is
permitted the use of the lake. It shall be designed in conjunction with other
lakeside recreational facilities to be located on property owned by the city.
Materials of construction shall conform to division (E)(2) above. Restrictions
to positioning, projection limits and water depth are not applicable to this
facility, but shall be determined by the City Council, following receipt of a
recommendation from the Moss Lake Commission.
(Prior Code, § 14-74) (Ord. passed 3-31-1992; Ord. 14-01, passed 2-25-2014)
§ 92.41 SHORELINE IMPROVEMENT.
   Property owners are prohibited from increasing or decreasing the existing
shoreline of the lake. Owners of property contiguous to the lake may make, at
their own cost, shoreline improvements if approved by the Moss Lake Commission.
Plans for the improvements must be submitted to the Building Inspector, and
shall include the following: existing site plan; new and proposed contours with
profile showing existing and proposed improvements; and location and details of
rip-rap and seawall. The plans shall be reviewed by the Building Inspector for
compliance with the chapter, and forwarded to the Moss Lake Commission. In
determining whether the improvements should be allowed, the Moss Lake
Commission shall weigh the applicant’s need for shoreline improvement against
the aesthetic appeal of an unhardened (natural) shoreline. It is the policy of
the city to give preference to maintaining the natural shoreline whenever
possible, while preserving the property of the contiguous property owner.
   (A)   Dredging.
      (1)   Boating access may be improved by removal of earth from the lake
bottom below elevation 736.0 feet MSL. The Moss Lake Commission may require
this new slope be rip-rapped from elevation 733.0 to elevation 739.0 to prevent
erosion. No excavation is permitted to alter the existing 736.0 contour. The
shoreline may be graded back from the 736.0 contour to the 744.0 elevation at a
slope not steeper than two to one unless a retaining wall is allowed and
constructed.
      (2)   Earth removed from the lake bottom shall be disposed of in an
approved manner. Disposed material shall be stabilized, seeded, fertilized and
mulched in a manner which will prevent erosion and silting of the lake or
adjacent streams. No dredged material may be disposed of within the city’s
control strip.
      (3)   Before excavating, the property owner must notify the State
Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources, Division of Land
Resources, Land Quality Section, Post Office Box 950, Mooresville, North
Carolina 28115, phone (704) 663-1699 and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Regulatory Field Office, Room 75, Grove Arcade Building, 37 Battery Park
Avenue, Asheville, North Carolina 28801, phone (704) 259-0857, in order to
determine if any wetlands will be affected or permits required. Correspondence
from the state and corps must be submitted to the Moss Lake Commission with the
appropriate plans and lake dredging application.
      (4)   A deposit or performance bond equal to 100% of the contract price
to perform the dredging will be required prior to the property owner initiating
work. The deposit will be returned upon completion of the excavation, if work
is in accordance with the permit and approved plans. If the property owner
fails to complete the work proposed to the satisfaction of the Moss Lake
Commission or other approving agency, the Moss Lake Commission shall seize the
deposit or performance bond, and the City Engineer is authorized to hire a
contractor to complete the job according to the approved plans and all
applicable permits.
   (B)   Rip-rap. Stone for rip-rap shall conform to NCDOT Class 1 or Class B
for erosion control. The depth of any allowed rip-rap shall not be less than
one foot and shall extend from elevation 733.0 to 739.0.
   (C)   Concrete. Any allowed concrete lining for shoreline protection shall
consist of 3,000 psi minimum concrete not less than four inches in thickness,
and shall extend from elevation 733.0 to 739.0. The bottom edge shall attach to
a toe-footing extending not less than one foot, vertically into the lake bottom
and having a thickness of not less than six inches.
   (D)   Seawall.
      (1)   A seawall, or retainer wall for erosion control, if permitted, must
be constructed on the existing 736.0 contour. Earth fills below the 736.0
contour are prohibited.
      (2)   A gravity type seawall shall be constructed of stone or mass
concrete (3,000 psi minimum). Mortar used in seawall construction shall consist
of one part portland cement, one-fourth part hydrated lime, three and three-
quarters parts sand (maximum) with no more water than necessary to make a
workable mixture. The use of concrete building blocks is not permitted.
      (3)   Properly designed steel or aluminum sheet piling systems are
acceptable alternative construction materials.

§ 92.42 WASTE WATER TREATMENT AND FUEL STORAGE TANKS.
   (A)   All wastewater treatment facilities shall meet all requirements of the
State Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources Division of
Environmental Management. Plans of any wastewater treatment facility shall be
submitted to the Building Inspector for review and submitted to and approved by
the appropriate state and county agencies.
   (B)   Septic tanks and drainage fields shall be located a minimum of 100
feet from the existing 736.0 contour line of the lake. Under no circumstances
shall any treatment facility, or any part of a treatment facility be located in
the city control strip.
   (C)   In order to insure the integrity of the water quality in the John H.
Moss Reservoir, all property owners with existing fuel tanks are prohibited
from dispensing gasoline or oil across the city control strip, via hose, pipe
or other devises, because of the potential for a major accidental spill.
Gasoline or oil must be carried across the control strip in approved containers
of six gallons or less.
   (D)   Any tank larger than 1,100 gallons must meet the requirements of NCAC
15A-02N. Fuel storage tanks, under or above ground, are not allowed on the
city’s control strip, or on any structure built over the lake.
   (E)   The Moss Lake Commission shall inventory all existing tanks and advise
owners of their responsibility to protect the water quality of the lake.
(Prior Code, § 14-76) (Ord. passed 3-31-1992)
§ 92.43 ADOPTED WATERSHED PROTECTION CLASSIFICATIONS AND MANAGEMENT CRITERIA.
   (A)   (1)   The State Environmental Management Commission (EMC) has adopted
watershed protection classifications and management criteria for the entire
state. John H. Moss Lake has received a classification of WS III. Since
Cleveland County has jurisdiction in the lake watershed, the county is required
to adopt and enforce ordinances that will meet or exceed the requirements of
this act.
      (2)   The ordinance will limit density of development, control storm
water runoff, establish a buffer around the water supply reservoirs and
maintain an inventory of hazardous materials in the watershed.
      (3)   The EMC has established water quality standards to protect WS III
classified waters. To meet these standards, no trees, stumps, brush or other
vegetative matter shall be allowed in the lake.
      (4)   If concentrations in the lake exceed these limits, the city shall
immediately investigate and eliminate its sources.
   (B)   Any lakefront property owner may apply for permission-to withdraw
water from the lake for irrigation of lakefront property only. The permit
expires annually on April 30. The Moss Lake Commission reserves the right to
cancel the property owners permit at any time. There shall be no extension of
the irrigation line beyond the property of the permittee and there shall be no
resale of any lake water by the permittee. The installation and maintenance of
the pump and suction line is the responsibility of the property owner. Neither
the City Council nor the Moss Lake Commission will be responsible for the lake
level dropping below the pump suction and causing damage to the property
owner’s equipment. All irrigation pumps shall have a backflow preventer or of a
double check valve assembly and shall be inspected for such by the city prior
to the initial permit and each subsequent annual renewal.
   (C)   No livestock or other animals raised commercially may be allowed
access to the city’s control strip or the lake.
   (D)   All markers, location and installation shall be reviewed and approved
by the Park Ranger. The federal-uniform marking system adopted by national
boating organizations for use in both ocean and inland waters shall be
followed. Markers shall be mounted on polystyrene floatation and anchored with
a galvanized steel cable attached to concrete weight. Stationary markers shall
be mounted on galvanized steel posts driven firmly into the lake bottom.
   (E)   The regulations set out in this chapter are supplemental to, and do
not in any way negate or void, any other applicable statute, ordinance, rule or
regulation of the federal, state or county governments or any agencies thereof.
(Prior Code, § 14-77) (Ord. passed 3-31-1992)
USAGE OF RAW WATER
§ 92.55 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Any person who shall engage in the taking or usage of raw water impounded

101.07, an abandoned, nuisance or junked vehicle which is to be removed shall
be towed only after notice to the registered owner or person entitled to
possession of the vehicle. In the case of a nuisance vehicle or a junked
vehicle, if the names and mailing addresses of the registered owner or person
entitled to the possession of the vehicle, or the owner, lessee or occupant of
the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be ascertained in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given by first class mail
or personal delivery. The person who mails the notice(s) shall retain a written
record to show the name(s) and addresses(es) to which mailed, and the date
mailed. The notice shall state that the vehicle will be removed by the city on
a specified date, no sooner than seven days after the notice is mailed or
personally delivered, unless the vehicle is moved by the owner or legal
possessor prior to that time. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the first-
class mail is not returned by the post office within ten calendar days after
the mailing.
      (2)   If the names and addresses cannot be ascertained or if the vehicle
to be removed is an abandoned vehicle, notice shall be given by affixing on the
windshield or some other conspicuous place on the vehicle. The notice shall
state that the vehicle will be removed by the city on a specified date, no
sooner than seven days after the notice is affixed, unless the vehicle is moved
by the owner or legal possessor prior to that time.
   (B)   With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property, nuisance
vehicles and junked vehicles to which notice is required to be given, if the
registered owner or person entitled to possession does not remove the vehicle,
but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle is abandoned, a
nuisance vehicle or in the case of a junked vehicle that the aesthetic benefits
of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, he or she may submit a written
request of appeal to the Director of the Inspections and Codes Department
before the seven day period has expired. The appeal shall be heard by the City
Manager within 30 days of the appeal and further proceedings to remove the
vehicle shall be stayed until the appeal is heard and decided.

   (A)   The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an
abandoned, nuisance or junked vehicle may, as determined by the authorizing
official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a special need for
prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to otherwise maintain and
protect the public safety and welfare. The findings shall, in all cases, be
entered by the authorizing official in the appropriate daily records.
   (B)   Circumstances justifying the removal of vehicles without prior notice
includes:
      (1)   Vehicles abandoned on streets. For vehicles left on the public
streets and highways, the City Council hereby determines the immediate removal

under code sections.
      (2)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles. With respect to abandoned or
nuisance vehicles left on city owned property other than the streets and
highways, and on private property, the vehicles may be removed without giving
prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing official finds a
special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the public health,
safety and welfare. By way of illustration and of limitation, the circumstances
include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to businesses and
residences, vehicles parked in a location or manner as to pose a traffic hazard
and vehicles causing damage to public or private property.

      (5)   The procedure the owner must follow to request a probable cause
hearing on the removal.
   (B)   The city shall attempt to give notice to the vehicle owner by
telephone; however, whether or not the owner is reached by telephone, written
notice, including the information set forth in divisions (A)(l) through (A)(5)
above, shall also be mailed to the register owner's last known address, unless
this notice is waived in writing by the vehicle owner or his or her agent.
   (C)   If the vehicle is registered in the state, notice shall be given
within 24 hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the state, notice shall be
given to the registered owner within 72 hours from the removal of the vehicle.
   (D)   Whenever an abandoned, nuisance or junked vehicle is removed, and the
vehicle has not valid registration or registration plates, the authorizing
official shall make reasonable efforts, including checking the vehicle
identification number, to determine the last known registered owner of the
vehicle and to notify him or her of the information set forth in divisions (A)

102.06   Liability
§ 102.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to define the process in which correct
structure addressing is determined, assigned and communicated within the city
in an effort to expedite the provision of emergency services of EMS, fire,
police, and other public services.
(Ord. 10-22, passed 9-28-2010; Ord. 23-33, passed 10-12-2023)
§ 102.02 APPLICATION.
   Any person or business owning property within the city limits on which an
“addressable structure” has been constructed and/or otherwise created should
adopt, properly display and maintain legible premises numbers on the structure
as designated or assigned by Development Services. Premises numbers shall be of
adequate size to be legible by the motoring public when viewed from the far
lane of the roadway.
(Ord. 10-22, passed 9-28-2010; Ord. 23-33, passed 10-12-2023)
§ 102.03 ASSIGNMENT.
   (A)   Internal.
      (1)   Addresses within the city shall be assigned by Development
Services. This assignment is made as part of the building permit process. After
the address has been made, notification of the new address will be forwarded to
appropriate agencies as listed on the address notification list.
      (2)   When assigning an address to a new structure, Development Services
will refer to a variety of information sources to assist in the correct address
assignment. These sources may include plats on file, the GIS address data base
and/or performing a field inspection in order to obtain the appropriate address
assignment.
      (3)   Methodology. The methodology used to determine the assignment of an
address to a location shall be as follows:
         (a)   The city shall be divided by a north-south and east-west plane.
Both the north-south and east-west plane shall originate at the intersection of
King Street and Piedmont Avenue, extending outward to the current and future
land boundaries of the city. The term AXIS found later in this chapter refers
to the intersecting of the two planes at King and Piedmont.
         (b)   The assignment of an address shall be at the federally
recommended standard of 5.82 feet or 25 feet; the decision of which will be
made by the assigned Development Services personnel after taking into account
surrounding parcels and expected future development.
         (c)   The range of addresses shall begin with the lowest number in
that range that is closest to the road of origin; this number shall increase in
value as distance from the road of origin also increases. Each block
constitutes a new series (i.e., 101, 201, 301 and so on).
         (d)   If the road that is being addressed does not have a discernable
point of origin but connects two roads (such as a local road between two
connector roads) the road closest to the central axis shall be considered the
road of origin.
         (e)   For all new roads, addresses shall be assigned with odd numbers
on the left and even on the right. In utilizing the terms “left” and “right”
when referring to the “road of origin,” directionality will be determined as
one travels away from the aforementioned central axis.
         (f)   For a new subdivision, address assignments will begin with
either an even or odd number but not both. If a right turn must be taken to
enter the subdivision from the road of origin, all address ranges will begin
with an even number. Just as well, if a left turn must be taken to enter the
subdivision, address ranges will begin with an odd number. Division (A)(3)(c)
applies to address assignments within subdivisions.
         (g)   In cul-de-sacs, the street numbers shall continue to increase
accordingly to the left and right of the street centerline while approaching
the back of the cul-de-sac. The building being the most perpendicular to the
centerline of the street at the back of the cul-de-sac shall have the highest
numerical number, whether it be an even or an odd number.
         (h)   Numbers shall run in an ascending order from east to west on
streets that are west of the north-south plane. Just as well, numbers shall run
in an ascending order from west to east on streets east of the north-south
plane. For roads that are north of the east-west plane, addresses shall be
assigned in ascending order from south to north. Roads that are south of the
east-west plane shall be addressed in ascending order from north to south.
         (i)   Roads which connect to both planes shall begin their numbering
on the end that originates from/closest to the north-south plane.
         (j)   All roads with a dead-end shall begin with numbers at the open
end, regardless of the direction they follow. Just as well, roads which do not
run north-south or east-west shall begin numbering at the end closest to the
center axis.
         (k)   Roads that have both ends opening from the same direction shall
begin numbering on the end closest to the axis.
      (4)   In the assignment of an address, there are certain situations where
an address may have to be modified, in some form, to facilitate multiple
businesses or residences located within one structure/location. Just as well,
certain special situations may allow the above described methodology to be
deviated from.
         (a)   For a multi-structure commercial development, such as a business
park, a singular address will be assigned to that particular parcel in
accordance with the standard methodology. However, the buildings associated
with that development will be provided building numbers. For example, parcel
number 12345 would be 100 Nowhere Ave. but buildings located at the address
will Building 1, Building 2, and so on.
         (b)   In instances where multiple addressable structures are placed on
one lot and this lot has street frontage and no interior named street exists,
an address will be assigned to the parcel in accordance with the above
described methodology. Structures within will be assigned a hyphenated number
behind the parcel address, this will go in ascending order starting with the
building closest to the road of origin (i.e., 100-1, 100-2, and the like).
         (c)   In instances where separate commercial and/or residential
establishments are located adjacent to each other in one continuous structure,
a new address may be assigned in accordance with division (A)(3)(b) in the
above described methodology if there is direct street access.
         (d)   In instances where separate commercial and/or residential
establishments are located within one structure that does not have direct
street contact, such as structures with a central atrium or apartment building,
each unit within shall receive a separate unit number assigned by the owner of
the establishment.
         (e)   In instances where a cell tower or a utility box requires an
address assignment, due to a telephone service on site that requires E-911
recognition, an address shall be assigned utilizing the above described
methodology. However, a hyphenated alphabetical value will be assigned after
the main address to denote its particular use. In instances where the cell
tower or utility box is placed on a lot that has an existing address, the
appropriate suffix shall be added to the existing site address. Cellular towers
shall have a “C” and utility boxes shall have an “U” after their assigned
address numbers.
         (f)   Any special circumstance not listed in the above section may be
presented to Development Services for further review. If a discrepancy is
discovered or a situation warrants clarification; a proposal for modification
of the addressing policy may be submitted.
   (B)   External.
      (1)   When an address is assigned during the permit process, it shall be
the responsibility of the
person applying for the permit to relay the assigned address information to the
owner or occupant after the permit has been approved and picked up. The
assigned street number shall be properly posted before occupancy.
      (2)   In instances where a new subdivision or new street is created, the
Post Office and the E-911 office shall be notified and provided with a site map
showing the new subdivision or new street. In order for the E-911 office to
effectively maintain their MSAG (Master Street Address Guide) address ranges,
they shall be provided with a list of the potential street number assignments.
The numbers provided during this process are unofficial until they have
undergone the permitting process.
      (3)   For new subdivisions, commercial developments, and other private
development projects that will include public right-of-ways to service
addresses within/around the development, a list of four potential street names
must be submitted to Development Services for review. Street names provided
must not be similar, in both pronunciation and spelling, to any other street
name in Kings Mountain or any street originating outside of city limits that
passes through. If no suitable street name is available from what is provided
by a developer or citizen, a list of potential street names shall be provided
by Development Services until an agreed upon street designation is reached.
(Ord. 10-22, passed 9-28-2010; Ord. 23-33, passed 10-12-2023)
§ 102.04 PLACEMENT AND DISPLAY.
   (A)   In instances of new construction, the owner, occupant or agent of each
house, building or other structure who was assigned a street number through the
permitting process shall place the assigned street number on the structure
prior to occupancy.
   (B)   Costs and installation of the street number is not the responsibility
of the city but rather the property owner. Residential district street numbers
must not be less than six inches in height. Commercial business district street
numbers must not be less than eight inches in height. Numbers on both
residential and commercial structures must have at least a minimum stroke width
of one inch (25.5 mm) and shall not be spelled out. All numbers must be made of
a durable, clearly visible material and must contrast with the color of the
surface on which they are mounted.
   (C)   Street numbers must be conspicuously placed immediately above, on or
to the side of the appropriate door so that the number is clearly visible from
the street. In cases where the structure is situated more than 50 feet from the
street, the assigned street number must also be placed near the walk, drive, or
common entrance to the structure location in a way that it is clearly visible
from the road. The numbers may also be placed upon a mailbox, gatepost, fence,
or other appropriate place so as to be clearly visible from the street of the
assigned address. U.S. Postal Regulations for Mail Receptacles, D041-2.3,
requires the assigned street number to be posted on any road-side mailbox.
   (D)   In instances where an address is assigned to one lot, using the
guidelines set forth in §

§ 102.05 CHANGE OF ADDRESSES.
   (A)   To facilitate the emergency services and help ensure that public
services are accurately and safely provided, it sometimes becomes necessary to
change a previously assigned address which includes structure number and street
name. When the city must necessitate a change of an assigned address or
currently used street name, the property owners and/or lessees affected by the
change shall be notified, via certified mail, of the proposed change. They
shall then be given not less than 30 days to respond, in writing, to the
proposed change. All written responses challenging the proposed change shall be
weighed on their individual merit. Development Services may solicit the
expertise of the E-911 coordinator, Post Office Address Management, Police
Department, Fire Department, and/or Codes Department as needed, in order to
arrive at an educated decision. Development Services shall give written
notification of its final decision within 30 days of the initial response from
the property owner and/or lessee and this decision shall be final. If a
response, in writing, is not received from the property owner and/or lessees
within the 30-day time period challenging the proposed change, the property
owner and/or lessees shall be notified, via certified mail, that the change of
address is henceforth in effect and then 21 days from the date of receiving
this letter to post the correct street number.
   (B)   This policy change is, at times, in direct conflict with the
previously established method of addressing within the city. As such, changes
to existing addresses shall be made at times when the burden of change is
lessened for the property owner. An example of this may be when a change of
ownership occurs or a property with an addressable structure becomes available
for sale. It is during this time period that Development Services shall consult
multiple resources to determine if an address reassignment will be needed. If
so, the provisions set forth in §
102.05(A) shall apply.
   (C)   If a property owner(s) desires a road name changed, a petition must be
submitted to Development Services explaining the need for the change. The
petition must include three potentially non-duplicate and non-confusing names
and the signatures of all of the property owners accessible from the road. All
affected property owners must be in favor of the change and indicate so on the
petition. Name does not include the descriptor of the type of street (road,
street, lane, court, drive, trail, avenue, way, boulevard and the like). If the
road is included within a homeowner association neighborhood, the petition must
be signed by the president, as well as every member within the association.
      (1)   Changes initiated by a petition (property owner/owners) are
responsible for the cost of all new signs associated with the change.
      (2)   No renaming of roads will be considered that is a duplicate, or a
road that is deceptively or phonetically similar to any existing road
(regardless of type) in both Cleveland and Gaston Counties.
   (D)   The Codes, Customer Service, Utilities, Public Works, Fire, and Police
Departments shall be notified of any address change that is implemented as
indicated in the address notification list.
      (1)   The property owner and/or lessee shall make the appropriate changes
of address within 21 days after receiving final written notice from Development
Services.
      (2)   Other entities, relying on address data, shall be notified of any
address change as indicated in the address notification list.
(Ord. 10-22, passed 9-28-2010; Ord. 23-33, passed 10-12-2023)
§ 102.06 LIABILITY.
   The city, its officers, agents or employees, together with any person
following its instructions in rendering address assignment services, are not
liable for civil damages as a result of an act, omission or interpolation of
the sections as set forth under the street addressing policy for the city.

subchapter has been violated, or the purpose of the solicitation has been
misrepresented, the City Manager shall, within two days after the hearing file
in the official’s office for public inspection and send to the permit holder by

limit by policy the total number of taxicab operating permits to be granted.
The City Council or designee will review on an annual basis the limit on the
total number of operating permits available and make changes, if any. An
operating permit, whether or not limited in number, shows that by its issuance
the convenience and necessity of the public requires the operation of the

   (B)   The City Council authorizes the City Manager or his or her designee to
issue operating permits to any applicant or applicants subject to conditions as
the City Council may deem advisable or necessary in the public interest and
upon payment of a regulatory fee provided by §

meets the requirements of this chapter, the City Manager or his or her designee
will issue for each taxicab vehicle a numbered medallion to be affixed to the
outside left rear portion of the taxicab vehicle for which the operating permit
is issued, in plain view from the rear of the taxicab vehicle. Loss or
destruction or defacing of the medallion shall be reported to the City Manager
or his or her designee. No vehicle shall be operated while there is affixed
thereto a medallion issued pursuant to this division (D) unless, pursuant to
this chapter, the vehicle’s use as a taxicab has been authorized and the driver
of the vehicle has been authorized to drive a taxicab for the operating permit
holder to whom the medallion was issued.
   (E)   The privilege of engaging in the business of operating a taxicab
vehicle in the city granted in the operating permit is personal to operating
permit holders. The rights and the requirements and responsibilities which
attach to the operating permit remain with the holder at all times, the taxicab
vehicle is operated in the city under the authority of the operating permit.
These rights, requirements and responsibilities, which include, but are not
limited to, the requirements of this chapter, will remain unaffected by any
agreement or contractual arrangement between the operating permit holders,
irrespective of the form or characterization of the agreement under which the
operating permit holder and/or driver operates the taxicab vehicle.

business address or telephone, notify the City Manager or his or her designee

terminal, dispatcher service, radio equipment and taximeter; and, provided
that, the person shall have a valid taxicab driver’s permit issued by the City
Council or designee, as provided for in §§

drivers operating a taxicab under an operating permit issued to participants in
the association.

STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS
§ 151.15 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Plan required. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity
without having an erosion and sedimentation control plan approved by the Kings
Mountain Stormwater Division except as otherwise noted within this chapter.
   (B)   Compliance. Person who submits a plan to the Kings Mountain Stormwater
Division shall comply with the provisions of §
151.27 of this chapter.
   (C)   Protection of property. Persons conducting land-disturbing activity
shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property
from sedimentation siltation caused by such activity.
   (D)   More restrictive rules shall apply. Whenever conflicts exist between
federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more restrictive
provision shall apply.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.16 BASIC CONTROL OBJECTIVES.
   A plan may be disapproved pursuant to §
151.27 of this chapter if the plan fails to address the following control
objectives:
   (A)   Identify critical areas. On-site areas, which are subject to severe
erosion, and off-site areas, which are especially vulnerable to severe erosion
and/or sedimentation are to be identified.
   (B)   Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned
and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time.
   (C)   Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and
conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any time.
   (D)   Control surface water. Surface water run-off originating from upgrade
of exposed areas shall be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during
the period of exposure.
   (E)   Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned
and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage to the extent
required by the Act.
   (F)   Manage stormwater run-off. When the increase in the velocity of
stormwater run-off resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to
cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include
measures to control the velocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize
accelerated erosion of the site and to decrease sedimentation to any lake or
natural watercourse.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.17 MANDATORY STANDARDS FOR LAND-DISTURBING ACTIVITY.
   No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this chapter shall be
undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards:
   (A)   Buffer zone.
      (1)   No land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or
improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural
watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the
watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25% of
the buffer zone nearest the land disturbing activity. The minimum width of the
buffer zone shall not be less than ten feet. Visible siltation must not
discharge through the buffer zone. This subdivision shall not apply to a land
disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be
located on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse.
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided, the width of a buffer zone begins and is
measured at least ten feet from the edge of the top of the bank of the
watercourse to the nearest edge of the disturbed area with the 25% of the strip
nearer the land-disturbing activity containing natural and or artificial means
of confining visible siltation. Natural or artificial means of confining
visible siltation must be placed, constructed or installed outside the
undisturbed buffer zone.
   (B)   Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall
be no greater than the angle that can be retained by vegetative cover or other
adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left
exposed will, within 21 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading, be
planted or otherwise provided with temporary or permanent ground cover,
devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion.
   (C)   Fill material. Unless a permit from the Department's Division of Waste
Management to operate a landfill is on file for the official site, acceptable
fill material shall be free of organic or other degradable materials, masonry,
concrete and brick in sizes exceeding 12 inches, and any materials which would
cause the site to be regulated as a landfill by the state.
   (D)   Ground cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity that will disturb one
or more acres is undertaken on a tract the person conducting the land-
disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation and erosion control
devices and practices as are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the
land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction
upon and development of the tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a
permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of
construction or development. Provisions for a ground cover sufficient to
restrain erosion must be accomplished within 15 working days or 60 calendar
days, following completion of construction or development.
   (E)   Prior plan approval. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing
activity that will disturb one or more acres on a tract unless, 30 or more days
prior to initiating the activity, a plan for the activity is filed with the
Kings Mountain Stormwater Division. Should the plan be filed, approved and a
certificate of approved plan issued in less than 30 days from the filing of the
plan, the land-disturbing activity may commence.
   (F)   Plan compliance. The land-disturbing activity shall be conducted in
accordance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.
   (G)   Self-inspections. The person(s) conducting land-disturbing activity
shall perform an inspection of the area covered by the plan after each phase of
the plan has been completed and after establishment of temporary ground cover.
Such inspection reports shall be maintained and made available on-site. Any
deviation from the plan shall be documented. Records shall be maintained until
permanent groundcover has been established.
   (H)   The person(s) (developer or other person who has or holds himself out
as having financial or operational control over the land-disturbing activity)
conducting land disturbing activity or an agent of that party shall contact the
Stormwater Division at least 48 hours before commencement of the land-
disturbing activity.
   (I)   The Stormwater Division may require an onsite meeting with the person
(s) conducting land-disturbing activity, or an agent of that party, to review
and discuss the approved plan before commencement of the land-disturbing
activity.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.18 DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, erosion and
sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be so planned,
designed, and constructed as to provide protection from the calculated maximum
peak rate of runoff from the ten-year storm. Run-off rates can be calculated
using the rational method, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
peak discharge method, or other acceptable methods.
   (B)   In high quality water zones (HQW) the following design standards shall
apply:
      (1)   Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a
maximum total area within the boundaries of the tract of 20 acres. Only this
section shall govern the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW
zone. Larger areas may be uncovered with the written approval of the Director.
      (2)   Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices
within HQW zones shall be so planned, designed and constructed to provide
protection from the run-off of the 25 year storm which produces the maximum
peak rate of run-off as calculated according to procedures in the USDA, Natural
Resource Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for
Conservation Practices," or according to procedures adopted by any other agency
of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or
association.
      (3)   Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and constructed
such that the basin will have a settling efficiency of at least 70% for the 40
micron (0.04 mm) size soil particle transported into the basin by the run-off
of that two-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of run-off as
calculated according to the procedures in the USDA, Natural Resources
Conservation Service's "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation
Practices" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state
or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association.
      (4)   Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and
constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical if
a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions permit a
steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices or
other acceptable ditch liners. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be
sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion.
      (5)   Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for
any portion of a land-disturbing activity in a HQW zone within 15 working days
or 30 calendar days following completion of any phase of construction or
development, whichever period is shorter.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.19 STORMWATER OUTLET PROTECTION.
   (A)   Persons shall prepare a plan that designs the post construction
velocity of the 10-year storm run-off in the receiving watercourse to the
discharge point that does not exceed the greater of:
      (1)   The velocity established by the table in division (D) of this
section; or
      (2)   The velocity of the 10-year storm run-off in the receiving
watercourse prior to development. If conditions (1) or (2) of this section
cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge
point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity
anywhere the velocity exceeds the prior to development velocity by 10%.
   (B)   Acceptable management measures. Measures applied alone or in
combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are
no objectionable secondary consequences. The Commission recognizes that the
management of Stormwater run-off to minimize or control downstream channel and
bank accelerated erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and
ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to
produce successful results. Some alternatives are to:
      (1)   Avoid increases in surface run-off volume and velocity by including
measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased run-off from areas
rendered impervious.
      (2)   Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using
vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high
velocity paved sections.
      (3)   Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities
to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge. These may range from
simple rip-rapped sections to complex structures.
      (4)   Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving
cross sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining.
      (5)   Upgrade or replace the receiving device, structure or watercourse
such that it will receive and conduct the flow to a point where it is no longer
subject to degradation from the increased volume, or increased velocity of the
flow.
   (C)   Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated
that stormwater discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the
receiving watercourse.
   (D)   The following is a table for maximum permissible velocity for
stormwater discharges: units are in feet per second (FPS) and meters per second
(MPS).

sinuous channels.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.20 BORROW AND WASTE AREAS.
   When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person
conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, areas from which borrow is
obtained and which are not regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of
1971, and waste areas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by
the Department's Division of Waste Management, shall be considered as part of
the land-disturbing activity where the borrow material is being used or from
which the waste material originated. When the person conducting the land-
disturbing activity is not the person conducting the borrow and/or disposing of
the waste, these areas shall be considered a separate land-disturbing activity.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.21 ACCESS AND HAUL ROADS.
   Temporary access and haul roads, other than public or private roads,
constructed or used in connection with any land-disturbing activity shall be
considered a part of such activity.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.22 OPERATIONS IN LAKES OR NATURAL WATERCOURSES.
   Land disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or
under a lake or natural watercourse shall minimize the extent and duration of
disruption of the stream channel. Where relocation of a stream forms an
essential part of the proposed activity, the relocation shall minimize
unnecessary changes in the stream flow characteristics.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.23 RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
   During the development of the site, the person conducting the land-
disturbing activity shall install and maintain all temporary and permanent
erosion and sedimentation control measures as required by the approved plan or
any provision of this chapter, the Act, or any order adopted pursuant to this
chapter or the Act. After site development, the landowner or person in
possession or control of the land shall install and/or maintain all necessary
permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures, except those measures
installed within a road or street right-of-way or easement accepted for
maintenance by a governmental agency.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.24 ADDITIONAL MEASURES.
   Whenever the Kings Mountain Stormwater Division determines that significant
sedimentation is occurring as a result of land disturbing activity, despite
application and maintenance of protective practices, the person conducting the
land-disturbing activity will be required to and shall take additional
protective action.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.25 EXISTING UNCOVERED AREAS.
   (A)   All uncovered areas existing on the effective date of this chapter
which resulted from land-disturbing activity that are subject to continued
accelerated erosion, and are causing off-site damage from sedimentation, shall
be provided with a ground cover or other protective measures, structures, or
devices sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion and control off-site
sedimentation.
   (B)   The Stormwater Division reserves the right to require preparation and
approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan in any instance where
extensive control measures are required.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.26 CERTIFICATE OF APPROVED PLAN.
   No person shall undertake any land-disturbing activity subject to this
chapter without first obtaining a certificate of approved plan from Kings
Mountain, through its Kings Mountain Stormwater Division, except that no
certificate of approved plan shall be required for any land-disturbing
activity:
   (A)   For the duration of an emergency, for activities essential to protect
human life and/or property; or
   (B)   For construction of a single-family residence on a single lot that
does not exceed one acre. Despite not being required to obtain a certificate of
approved plan, parties engaged in land-disturbing activities of less than one-
acre are subject to all portions of this chapter. If the erosion and sediment
control measures for the development site are designed for all lot disturbances
and being Kings Mountain, North Carolina, Soil Erosion and Sedimentation
Control Ordinance maintained, individual lots within the development site may
be excluded.
   (C)   If a party has been determined to have been in recurring violation of
this chapter within the past two years on the same property or if a land
disturbing activity requiring a plan is begun without a certificate of approved
plan, the certificate of approved plan fee may be doubled for that party.
   (D)   No certificate of approved plan will be issued to any party having an
outstanding recurring violation on the same property subject to this chapter.
   (E)   This decision may be appealed to the Environmental Review Board.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.27 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PLANS.
   (A)   A pre-submittal conference with Stormwater staff can be requested by
the person(s) conducting land-disturbing activity or an agent of that party to
take place at least ten days prior to submittal of the plan for land-disturbing
activities.
   (B)   At the pre-submittal conference, Stormwater staff shall inform the
applicant of the processes involved with plan review and approval, issuance of
a plan certificate and letter of approval, and the relationship of said plan
and letter of approval with zoning, building code, and other land-use
regulations in effect in Kings Mountain. At the time of application submission,
Stormwater staff also shall notify the applicant of the appeal process as
provided in the chapter.
   (C)   Persons conducting land-disturbing activity on a tract which covers
one or more acres shall file two copies of the erosion and sedimentation
control plan with the Stormwater Division at least 30 days prior to beginning
such activity and shall keep another copy of the plan on file at the job site.
After approving the plan, if the Stormwater Division either upon review of such
plan or on inspection of the job site, determines that a significant risk of
accelerated erosion or off-site sedimentation exists, the Stormwater Division
will require a revised plan. Pending the preparation of the revised plan, work
shall cease or shall continue under conditions outlined by the appropriate
authority.
   (D)   Erosion and sedimentation control plans may be disapproved unless
accompanied by an authorized statement of financial responsibility and
ownership. The person financially responsible for the land-disturbing activity
or his or her attorney shall sign this statement in fact. The statement shall
include the mailing and street addresses of the principal place of business of
the person financially responsible and of the owner of the land or their
registered agents. If the person financially responsible is not a resident of
North Carolina, a North Carolina agent must be designated in the statement for
the purpose of receiving notice of compliance or non-compliance with the plan,
the Act, this chapter, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this
chapter. If the applicant is not the owner of the land to be disturbed, the
draft erosion and sedimentation control plan must include the owner's consent
for the applicant to submit a draft erosion and sedimentation control plan and
conduct the anticipated land disturbing activity.
   (E)   The Stormwater Division shall review the plan and submit any comments
and recommendations to Codes Department staff within 20 days after the
Stormwater Division received the erosion and sedimentation control plan,
recommendations within 20 days or within any agreed upon shorter period of time
shall not delay final action on the plan.
   (F)   The Stormwater staff will review each complete plan submitted to them
and within 30 days of receipt thereof will notify the person submitting the
plan that it has been approved, approved with modifications, approved with
performance reservations, or disapproved. Failure to approve, approve with
modifications, or disapprove a complete erosion and sedimentation control plan
within 30 days of receipt shall be deemed approval. Disapproval of a plan must
specifically state in writing the reasons for disapproval. The Stormwater
Division must approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised plan within
15 days of receipt, or it is deemed to be approved. The Stormwater Division
shall only approve a plan upon determining that it complies with all applicable
state and local regulations for erosion and sedimentation control. If,
following commencement of a land disturbing activity pursuant to an approved
plan, the Stormwater staff determines that the plan is inadequate to meet the
requirements of this chapter, the Stormwater staff may require any revision of
the plan that is necessary to comply with this chapter. Failure to approve,
approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised erosion and sedimentation
control plan within 15 days of receipt shall be deemed approval. The approved
erosion and sedimentation control plan shall expire one year following the date
of approval, if no land disturbing activity has been undertaken.
   (G)   Any plan submitted for a land-disturbing activity for which an
environmental document is required by the North Carolina Environment Policy Act
(G.S. § 113A-1, et seq.) shall be deemed incomplete until a complete
environmental document is available for review. The Stormwater Division shall
promptly notify the person submitting the plan that the 30-day time limit for
review of the plan pursuant to §
151.27(F) of this chapter shall not begin until a complete environmental
document is available to review. The person submitting a plan to the Stormwater
Division, prior to submission of the plan, is solely and exclusively
responsible for determining whether the proposed land disturbing activities
require any form of state or federal environmental certification or
documentation. The Stormwater Division shall condition approval of an erosion
and sedimentation control plan upon the applicant's compliance with federal and
state water quality laws, regulations and rules; and shall disapprove an
erosion and sedimentation control plan if implementation of the Kings Mountain,
North Carolina Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance plan would
result in a violation of rules adopted by the Environmental Management
Commission to protect riparian buffers along surface waters.
   (H)   Any plan required by this section shall contain architectural and
engineering drawings, maps, assumptions, calculations, and narrative statements
as needed to adequately describe the proposed development of the tract and the
measures planned to comply with the requirements of this chapter. Plan content
may vary to meet the needs of specific site requirements. Detailed guidelines
for Plan preparation may be obtained from the Stormwater Division on request.
   (I)   The Stormwater Division may disapprove an erosion and sedimentation
control plan upon a finding that an applicant, or a parent, subsidiary, or
other affiliate of the applicant:
      (1)   Is conducting land-disturbing activity without an approved plan, or
has received notice of violation of a plan previously approved by the
Commission or a local government pursuant to the Act and has not complied with
the notice within the time specified in the notice;
      (2)   Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to the Act or a
local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act by the time the payment is due and
is not currently being appealed;
      (3)   Has been convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. § 113A-64(b)
or any criminal provision of a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Act;
      (4)   Has failed to substantially comply with state rules or local
ordinances and regulations adopted pursuant to the Act. For purposes of this
section (an applicant's record may be considered for only the two years prior
to the application date); or
      (5)   Is in violation of federal, state, or local laws, rules,
regulations or ordinances pertaining to a different phase of the same tract
and/or development
   (J)   Applications for amendment of an erosion and sedimentation control
plan in written and/or graphic form may be made at any time under the same
conditions as the original application. Until such time as the amendment is
approved by the Stormwater Division, the land-disturbing activity shall not
proceed except in accordance with the erosion and sedimentation control plan as
originally approved.
   (K)   Any person engaged in land-disturbing activity who fails to file a
plan in accordance with this chapter, or who conducts a land-disturbing
activity except in accordance with provisions of an approved plan, shall be
deemed in violation of this chapter.
   (L)   Any person engaged in land-disturbing activity that is required by
this chapter to file an erosion and sedimentation control plan shall pay a plan
review fee to the Stormwater Division in an amount to be determined by the City
Council.

   (A)   Whenever the Environmental Review Board has reasonable cause to
believe that any person is violating or threatening to violate this chapter or
any rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, or any term,
condition, or provision of an approved erosion and sedimentation control plan,
it may, either before or after the institution of any other action or
proceeding authorized by this chapter, institute a civil action in the name of
the county, for injunctive relief to restrain the threatened violation. The
action will be brought in the Superior Court of Cleveland County, North
Carolina.
   (B)   Upon determination by a court that an alleged violation is occurring
or is threatened, the court shall enter any order or judgment that is necessary
to abate the violation, to ensure that restoration is performed, or to prevent
the threatened violation. The institution of an action for injunctive relief
under this section shall not relieve any party to the proceedings from any
civil or criminal penalty prescribed for violations of this chapter.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.44 RESTORATION OF AREAS AFFECTED BY FAILURE TO COMPLY.
   The Environmental Review Board may require a person who engaged in a land-
disturbing activity and failed to retain sediment generated by the activity, as
required by G.S. § 113A-57(3), to restore the waters and the land affected by
the failure so as to minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting
pollution by sedimentation. This authority is in addition to any other civil or
criminal penalty or injunctive relief authorized under this chapter.
(Ord. 13-34, passed 11-26-2013)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any person who violates any of the provisions of the Act, this
chapter, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, or who
initiates or continues a land-disturbing activity for which an erosion and
sedimentation control plan is required, except in accordance with the terms,
conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, is subject to a civil penalty.
The maximum civil penalty for a violation is $5,000. The maximum civil penalty
for a violation of a stop work order is $5,000. A civil penalty may be assessed
from the date of the violation. Each day of continuing violation shall
constitute a separate violation.
      (2)   The Kings Mountain Stormwater Department shall determine the amount
of the civil penalty to be assessed under this division as set forth in the
Guidelines for Assessing Civil Penalties for Violations of Kings Mountain's
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance. The Stormwater Division shall
notify the person who is assessed the civil penalty of the amount of the
penalty and the reason for assessing the penalty. In determining the amount of
the penalty the Stormwater Division shall consider the degree and extent of
harm caused by the damage, the cost of rectifying the damage, the amount of
money the violator saved by noncompliance, whether the violation was committed
willfully, and the prior record of the violator in complying or failing to
comply with this chapter. The notice of assessment shall be served by any means
authorized under G.S. § 1 A-l, Rule 4, and shall direct the violator to either
pay the assessment or contest the assessment, within 30 days after receipt of
the notice of assessment, by written demand for a hearing. A hearing on a civil
penalty shall be conducted by the Environmental Review Board within 30 days
after the date of the written demand for the hearing. The Environmental Review
Board shall render its final decision on the civil penalty at the conclusion of
the hearing. Appeal from the final decision of the Environmental Review Board
shall be to the Superior Court of Cleveland County, North Carolina.
      (3)   If payment is not received within 30 days after demand for payment
is made, the Environmental Review Board may institute a civil action to recover
the amount of the assessment. The civil action may be brought in Superior Court
of the county where the violation occurred, or the violator's residence or
principal place of business is located. Such civil actions must be filed within
three years of the date the assessment was due. An assessment that is not
contested is due when the violator is served with a notice of assessment. An
assessment that is contested is due at the conclusion of the administrative and
judicial review of the assessment.
      (4)   Civil penalties collected pursuant to this chapter shall be
credited to the Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund.
   (B)   Final certificate of occupancy with regard to the development of any
tract that is subject to this chapter, the Code Enforcement Department shall
not issue a certificate of occupancy where any of the following conditions
exist:
      (1)   There is a violation of this chapter with respect to the tract.
      (2)   If there remains due and payable to Kings Mountain civil penalties
that have been levied against the person conducting the land-disturbing
activity for violation(s) of this chapter. If a penalty is under appeal, they
may require the amount of the fine, and any other amount that the person would
be required to pay under this chapter if the person loses the appeal, be placed
in a refundable account for surety prior to issuing the certificate of
occupancy.
      (3)   The requirements of the plan have not been completed and the
building for which a certificate of occupancy is requested is the only building
then under construction on the tract.
      (4)   On the tract which includes multiple buildings on a single parcel,
the requirements of the plan have not been completed and the building for which
a certificate of occupancy is requested is the last building then under
construction on the tract.
      (5)   On a tract which includes multiple parcels created pursuant to the
applicable subdivision regulations, the requirements of the plan have not been
completed with respect to the parcel for which the certificate of occupancy is
requested.
      (6)   Any person conducting land-disturbing activities that has been
denied a certificate of occupancy under the provisions in this chapter may make
a written appeal of the decision to the Environmental Review Board.
   (C)   Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any
provision of this chapter, or rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to this
chapter, or who willfully initiates or continues a land-disturbing activity for
which an erosion and sedimentation control plan is required except in
accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan,
shall be guilty of a Class 2 Misdemeanor which may include a fine not to exceed
$5,000.
   (D)   Stop work orders. Whenever a building, sign, or structure, or part
thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered or repaired in violation
of this chapter, the Enforcement Officer may order the work to be immediately
stopped. The stop order shall be in writing and directed to the owner,
occupant, or person doing the work. The stop order shall state the specific
work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions
under which the work may be resumed. Such action shall be in accordance with
G.S. §§ 160A-421 or 153-361, as applicable, or the North Carolina Building

§ 152.14 REGULATIONS FOR VACATED AND CLOSED DWELLINGS.
   (A)   If a dwelling has been vacated and closed for a period of one year
after an Inspector has caused the dwelling to be vacated and closed as
described in § 152.06(B)(l), the Inspector may find that the owner has
abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the dwelling in
order to render it fit for human habitation and that the continuation of the
dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be detrimental to the health,
safety, and welfare of the community, threat to children and vagrants, would
attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to
blight and the deterioration of property values in the area, or would render
unavailable property and a dwelling that might otherwise have been made
available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable housing in
the area, then in such circumstances, the governing body may, after the
expiration of such one year period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance
on the owner, setting forth the following:
      (1)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation can be made at a cost of not more than 50% of the
current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require that the owner
either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
      (2)   If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it
fit for human habitation cannot be made at a cost equal to or less than 50% of
the current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall require the owner to
demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days.
   (B)   If a property owner causes a dwelling to be vacated and closed at
their own discretion, the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Vacated and closed dwellings shall be added to a vacated and closed
inventory, maintained by the Inspections and Codes Department.
         (a)   The owner shall give notice to the Inspections and Codes
Department within 15 days after causing a dwelling to be vacated and closed.
         (b)   If a dwelling has been vacated and closed for a period exceeding
15 days and an owner has failed to notify the Inspections and Codes Department,
the Inspector shall cause the dwelling to be added to the vacated and closed
building inventory. The Inspector shall serve a written notice to the owner
stating that the dwelling has been added to the vacated and closed building
inventory and that the provisions of division (B)(2) and divisions (B)(3) below
will be enforced.
         (c)   Any owner who has vacated and closed a dwelling prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall comply with the regulations contained
herein within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter. If after 30
days, an owner has failed to notify the Inspections and Codes Department and
have their property added to the vacated and closed building inventory, the
Inspector shall cause the dwelling to be added to the vacated and closed
building inventory. The Inspector shall serve a written notice to the owner
stating that the dwelling has been added to the vacated and closed building
inventory and that the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (B)(3) below will be
enforced.
      (2)   The materials and methods used for vacating and closing the
dwelling shall be:
         (a)   Plywood or (OSB) oriented strand board cut to tightly fit over
the window and door openings, flush with the outside of the trim molding;
         (b)   Securely attach plywood or (OSB) oriented strand board to the
frame of the opening with screws placed 12 inches on center around the
perimeter of the plywood or oriented strand board; and
         (c)   Plywood or (OSB) oriented strand boards shall be painted black
using an exterior grade paint.
      (3)   Any time after six months from the date that the dwelling has been
added to the vacated and closed building inventory the Inspector determines
that the owner or agent thereof is not actively working, with visible progress
being made to repair, alter, improve or demolish the dwelling, or a dwelling
has been closed and vacated for a period greater than one year, the Inspector
may find that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter,
improve or demolish the dwelling. In the event, the Inspector shall issue and
cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order requiring the owner, within
the time specified therein, to remove any material which has been placed over
window and exterior door openings.

owner thereof an order:
      (1)   If the repair, alteration or improvement of the building or

violation of this chapter shall fail to comply with the order described in
division (A)(l) above, the Inspector may cause the building or structure to be
repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed.
      (2)   If the owner fails to comply with the order described in division
(A)(2) above, the Inspector may cause the building or structure to be

to be in violation of this chapter and which property or properties shall be
described in the ordinance. No ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition
of a building or structure until the owner has first been given a reasonable

defendant any person occupying such building.

§ 152.34 REGULATIONS FOR VACATED AND CLOSED BUILDINGS.
   (A)   (1)   If a building has been vacated and closed for a period of two
years after an Inspector has caused the building to be vacated and closed as
described in §
152.26(B)(l), the Inspector may find that the owner has abandoned the intent
and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the building and that the continuation
of the building in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the
health, safety, and welfare of the city in that it would continue to
deteriorate, would create a fire or safety hazard, would be a threat to
children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, or
would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in
the area. Upon such findings, the governing board may, after the expiration of
the two-year period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner,
setting forth the following:
         (a)   If it is determined that the repair of the building to bring it
into compliance with the minimum standards of this chapter can be made at a
cost of not more than 50% of the current value of the building, the ordinance
shall require that the owner either repair or demolish and remove the building
within 90 days.
         (b)   If it is determined that the repair of the building to bring it
into compliance with the minimum standards of this chapter cannot be made at a
cost equal to or less than 50% of the current value of the building, the
ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the building within 90
days.
      (2)   In the case of vacant manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial
warehouse facilities, the building must have been vacated and closed for a
period of five years after the Inspector has caused the building to be vacated
and closed as described in §
152.26(B)(l) before the governing board may take action under this division.
The ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds in the
county wherein the property or properties are located and shall be indexed in
the name of the property owner in the grantor index. If the owner fails to
comply with the ordinance, the Inspector shall effectuate the purpose of the
ordinance.
   (B)   If a property owner causes a building to be vacated and closed at
their own discretion, the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Vacated and closed buildings shall be added to a vacated and closed
inventory, maintained by the Inspections and Codes Department.
         (a)   The owner shall give notice to the Inspections and Codes
Department within 15 days after causing a building to be vacated and closed.
         (b)   If a building has been vacated and closed for a period exceeding
15 days and an owner has failed to notify the Inspections and Codes Department,
the Inspector shall cause the building to be added to the vacated and closed
building inventory. The Inspector shall serve a written notice to the owner
stating that the building has been added to the vacated and closed building
inventory and that the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and divisions (B)(3)
below will be enforced.
         (c)   Any owner who has vacated and closed a building prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall comply with the regulations contained
herein within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter. If after 30
days, an owner has failed to notify the Inspections and Codes Department and
have their property added to the vacated and closed building inventory, the
Inspector shall cause the building to be added to the vacated and closed
building inventory. The Inspector shall serve a written notice to the owner
stating that the building has been added to the vacated and closed building
inventory and that the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and(B)(3) below will be
enforced.
      (2)   The materials and methods used for vacating and closing the

denied except as provided in division (C) below. However, the effective date of
a certificate may be delayed for up to 365 days from the date of approval. The

certificate shall be issued. An extension of time may be granted by mutual
consent of the Commission and the applicant. As part of the review procedures,
the Commission may view the premises and seek the advice as it may deem
necessary under the circumstances. The Commission may hold a public hearing on
any application when deemed necessary. The action on an application shall be
approval, approval with conditions or denial and the decision of the Commission
must be supported by specific findings of fact indicating the extent to which
the application is or is not congruous with the special character of the

(Ord. 98-08, passed 4-28-1998)
§ 155.38 HEARINGS.

character of the landmark.
   (C)   The jurisdiction of the Commission over interior spaces shall be
limited to specific interior features of architectural, artistic or historical
significance in publicly owned landmarks; and of privately owned landmarks for
which consent for interior review has been given by the owners. The consent of

owner for interior review shall bind future owners and/or successors in title;
provided, the consent has been filed in the Register of Deeds office and

(Ord. 98-08, passed 4-28-1998)
§ 155.42 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Compliance with the terms of the certificate of appropriateness shall
be enforced by the Zoning Administrator. Failure to comply with the certificate
issued shall be a violation of the zoning ordinance and subject to established
procedures and penalties for the violations.
   (B)   In case any building, structure, site, area or object designated as a
landmark is about to be demolished, whether as a result of deliberate neglect
or otherwise, materially altered, remodeled, removed or destroyed, except in
