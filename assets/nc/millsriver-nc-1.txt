Notes:   *   ABC = Aggregate Base Course, No. 7 stone.
**   Paved roads, if used, shall  meet the minimum state road standards  for
local residential subdivision roads.
 
      (1)   Road construction. All roads must be constructed with suitable
stone and shall  be properly compacted. Used asphalt is unacceptable as a base
course. The subgrade must be of a soil capable of supporting the road above.
The road should be built so that water will drain from the road surface into
side ditches. Because of the difficulty of operating vehicles and moving
manufactured homes  on steep grades and because of the high potential for
erosion, roads should be constructed along the contour of the land where
possible. Maximum road grades shall  be as provided in Table 1. If a
combination of paved and stone-based roads is proposed, the paved sections must
extend 50 feet from any point where the grade exceeds the minimum for a stone-
based road. The Administrator may  require that a professional engineer or
surveyor certify on an as-built drawing that no portion of any internal roads
have grades exceeding the maximum allowed by this chapter.
      (2)   Road drainage and culverts. All internal roads  shall  be provided
with appropriate drainage facilities (see also § 151.050). Road drainage
structures shall  be constructed in accordance with minimum state road
standards . Road drainage side ditches shall  have sufficient depth and width
to carry the expected volume of stormwater runoff. Where roads cross streams or
minor watercourses, culverts shall  be designed and installed in accordance
with minimum state road standards .
      (3)   Turnarounds.  A cul-de-sac or other turnaround approved by the
Administrator is required on any internal road  which serves 10 or more spaces.
Culs-de-sac shall  have a minimum radius of 35 feet. Culs-de-sac and other
approved turnarounds shall  be surfaced with the same material required on the
road they serve.
      (4)   Vertical clearance. All internal roads , including shoulder areas,
shall  have a minimum vertical clearance of 13 feet, 6 inches, to allow for the
passage of emergency vehicles.

fees. The applicant  must demonstrate to the Subdivision Administrator  that
the division is in fact a minor subdivision . If the developable area  of the
remaining parcel is greater than three (3) times the size of the proposed lot
or lots  and the residual area has the potential for re-division, then the
applicant  may  be required by the Zoning Administrator to reapply under the
major subdivision  procedure. The applicant  for a minor subdivision  shall
comply with the following :
      (1)   Expansion.
         (a)   A minor subdivision  may  be expanded under the minor
subdivision  procedure if all of the following  conditions are met:
            1.   The expansion results in a total of 10 or fewer lots  within
the boundaries of the tract  that was the subject of the original minor
subdivision  application.
            2.   The expansion involves no more than a total of three (3)
phases, including the original minor subdivision  application.
            3.   The expansion spans no more than three (3) years  from the

            5.   Applications for phased minor subdivisions that will
ultimately contain four (4) or more lots must comply with the provisions of §
153.046(A)(5) and (6) at the time the original application is filed.
         (b)   If a minor subdivision  is ever expanded, the Planning Board
 may  require the upgrading of improvements, including road  paving, utility
upgrading and additional right-of-way  dedication. If an expansion of a minor
subdivision  results in a total of greater than 10 lots , then the applicant
will be required to reapply for a major subdivision .
      (2)   Except in cases of expansions of approved minor subdivisions
allowed in division (A)(1)(a), above, the minor subdivision procedure may not
be used a second time within three (3) years on property that is less than
1,500 feet from the original property boundaries of the original tract which
was the subject of a previously approved minor subdivision application and
which has been in common ownership with the original tract at any time within
the 3 year period. No person  may utilize the minor subdivision procedures for
the purpose of evading the requirements of major subdivisions . In the event
that a person is found to have used this §
153.046 for purposes other than a bona fide minor subdivision , then the person
 may be required to comply with any and all applicable requirements for a major
subdivision and may be required to re-record a plat. In addition, abuse of this
§
153.046 will be deemed a violation of this chapter and may subject the violator

public, the requirements in §
153.069(B) shall apply and, if private, the requirements of §
153.069(C) through (J) shall apply. A minor subdivision of fewer than four (4)

this chapter except the requirements for road name approval in §
153.071 and for right-of-way access in §
153.075 shall apply. (See also §
153.046A(1)(a)5).

contain a road development plan that has a scaled drawing of the proposed road
cross section and associated drainage improvements, which shall be in
conformance with the standards in §
153.069. Upon review and approval of the drawings, the Subdivision

§ 153.047 PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF FAMILY SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   The purpose of the family subdivision is to allow the creation of lots
from larger tracts for the use of bona-fide family members. Application does
not require submission of a development plan, only submission of the final plat
for approval. No application forms are required; however, §
153.116, Fees, shall apply. The applicant , however, must satisfy the
Subdivision Administrator that such division is in fact a "family subdivision "
by submitting a statement in a form substantially similar to that provided in
Appendix 10. Each family member may be deeded only one (1) lot of record per
family subdivision . The deed for each lot in a family subdivision must contain
an express statement that the conveyance is a conveyance of a lot within a
family subdivision and must contain an express grant of a right-of-way to a
public road .
   (B)   If the family subdivision complies with the standards set forth in
this section, the Subdivision Administrator  shall provide approval in writing
on the face of the final plat and shall retain a copy for town records. Once
the plat has been approved, the final plat  may be recorded and a copy of the
recorded plat shall be return to the Town of Mills River for the record.
   (C)   Within a family subdivision , there must be a minimum of 30 feet right
of way to each lot on the face of the plat and reflected on each deed.
   (D)   No person  may utilize this §
153.047 for the purpose of evading the requirements of any applicable
provisions of this chapter. In the event that a person is found to have used
this §
153.047 for purposes other than a bona-fide family subdivision , then the
person  may be required to comply with any and all requirements for a major
subdivision and may be required to rerecord a plat. In addition, abuse of this
§
153.047 will be deemed a violation of this chapter and may subject the violator
to any and all applicable penalties.

§ 153.048 PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF NONSTANDARD SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   The procedure for review of a nonstandard subdivision , as defined
herein, is as follows: Lots  for public utility use, special use lots  and
cemetery lots , if sufficiently identified and encumbered for all respective
uses (i.e., pump station, water tank, sign lot , common recreation area , and
the like) may  be approved either in conjunction with a major or minor
subdivision , development plan review or separately by the Subdivision
Administrator , upon submission of a plat describing the subdivision. The lots
are not counted in totaling the number of lots  in a subdivision  for
administrative purposes.
   (B)   Procedure for review of townhouse  developments. In cases where
townhouse  development review is not superseded by other regulations (such as
zoning), the townhouse  developments, as defined herein, shall  be reviewed by
the Planning Board . Application for review shall  be made to the Subdivision
Administrator . Plans for each development shall  be prepared in conformance
with §
153.049 and with special provisions, general regulations, and exceptions and
modifications of this chapter, except that the following  sections, upon
request, may  be modified by the Planning Board : §
153.069(G) (Minimum curve radius), §
153.069(H) (Intersections), §
153.075 (Right-of-way  access), §
153.079(A) (Lot  dimensions) and §
153.079(D) (Lot  configuration and frontage). In such cases, the Planning Board
 may  use discretion in applying subdivision  standards.
(Ord. passed 3-1-2004; Am. Ord. passed 10-13-2005)
§ 153.049 PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   Before the plat for a major subdivision  (11 or more lots ) can be recorded,
the applicant  shall  complete the application for a major subdivision  (
Appendix 1 and
Appendix 6) and comply with the following  items.
   (A)   Pre-application conference and site analysis sketch.
      (1)   A pre-application conference shall  be held at least 15 days prior
to the submission of any major subdivision  application. The conference shall
include the applicant  and the Subdivision Administrator . The purpose of the
conference is to acquaint an applicant  with the application process and to
review, in general, the proposed development. The applicant  should be prepared
to discuss the development plans for the entire tract  and any adjacent
property  under the same ownership. The applicant  shall  bring to the meeting
a site analysis sketch (see Figure 1) that shall  identify for the entire tract
the following  features:
         (a)   Streams, creeks, ponds and reservoirs;
         (b)   Floodplains and wetlands;
         (c)   Steep slopes, defined as those greater than 20%;
         (d)   Unique natural areas ;
         (e)   Rock outcroppings;
         (f)   Farmland and pastureland;
         (g)   Wooded or forested areas; and
         (h)   Cemeteries.
      (2)   The site analysis sketch shall  be prepared based on aerial
photography, visual observations and an on-site inspection of the tract . The
site analysis sketch need not be professionally prepared. However, it shall  be
at a scale that is clearly legible and provides sufficient detail to describe
the general location of proposed development and the stated features for
discussion purposes. It is not necessary at the pre-application conference to
have detailed plans with described lots  and rights-of-way . The conference is
intended for the free exchange of information between the applicant  and the
Subdivision Administrator  and to explore how the applicant  intends to design
the development, what density levels are contemplated and what areas are
proposed for preservation, and the like, before a great deal of time and
expense is expended on subdivision design.
      (3)   Pre-application conferences may  be attended by other governmental
agencies or staff , Planning Board  members or those invited by the applicant .
The Subdivision Administrator  may  waive the conferences for successive
sections under an approved master plan.
   (B)   Master plan submission. A master plan developed in conformance with
Appendix 4, shall  be submitted to the Planning Board  through the Subdivision
Administrator  for review and approval for any major subdivision  at least 30
days prior to the date of the regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Board
. The purpose of the master plan is to present the development concept for the
entire project. The master plan is intended to provide general information
about the proposed development to allow for an assessment of its impact on the
orderly growth and development of the town , environmental quality, land
values, natural features identified on the site analysis sketch and the town's
and governmental services. The applicant  shall  submit 1 full-sized copy, 1
reduced-sized copy, and 1 electronic copy of the master plan, all at a scale
appropriate to clearly depict the property . The master plan may  consist of
multiple sheets, if needed. The Subdivision Administrator  may , upon receipt
of the master plan, forward a copy to any review agency  for information
purposes or for comment. Applicants  proposing single section  or phase
subdivisions  may  submit a combined master plan and development plan ("master/
development plan") that shall  be prepared in conformance with this chapter and
the requirements of a development plan, as enumerated in
Appendix 5. If during the development of the project, the master plan is
revised to affect any of the following : increase the number of building lots
to be created or units to be constructed; create a substantive change in the
subdivision  configuration, road  layout, and the like; substantially change
the use of any portion of the tract ; develop or build in areas that were
identified as features in the site analysis sketch (see division (A) above)
and that were identified in the master plan as open spaces or protected areas,
these shall be considered major plan amendments and the applicant  shall then
submit a revised master plan for Planning Board review and approval in
accordance with this section. The Town of Mills River shall provide mailed
public notice and posted public notice on the subject property in advance of
the Planning Board meeting at which the major amendment to the subdivision
master plan will be considered, per §
153.010.
   (C)   Development plan submission and review.
      (1)   A development plan, prepared in conformance with this chapter as
enumerated in
Appendix 5, shall  be submitted to the Planning Board  for review and approval
of any major subdivision . A development plan is a graphic representation or
map of the tract  of land to be developed indicating all proposed divisions of
land, their uses, improvements and other information as may  be required to
fully disclose the applicant's intentions. The purpose of the plan is to
provide general and specific information and is not intended to be a recordable
document.
      (2)   The development plan may  be submitted for the entire subdivision
or any section  thereof, Application shall  be made and submitted to the
Subdivision Administrator  at least 30 days prior to the date of a regularly
scheduled meeting of the Planning Board . The application, including all
drawings, fees and attachments, shall  be submitted at 1 time to the
Subdivision Administrator . The applicant  shall  submit 1 full-sized copy , 1
reduced-sized copy, and 1 electronic copy of  the development plan, all at a
scale appropriate to clearly depict the property . The development plan may
consist of multiple sheets, if needed. Formal review of the subdivision  shall
not begin until the Administrator has verified that the application is
complete. The verification should, when possible, be made within 5 business
days of its receipt. The Subdivision Administrator  shall  notify the applicant
, in writing, of the application's status.
      (3)   The Subdivision Administrator  shall  review the application with
regard to all applicable standards and conformity to this chapter. The
Subdivision Administrator  shall  submit to the Planning Board  a summary of
findings along with comments from review agencies . A copy of the findings
shall  be given to the applicant  prior to the Planning Board's  review.
Subdivision Administrator  shall certify to the Planning Board that mailed
public notice was provided to the owner of the subject property proposed for
development of a major residential subdivision and to the owners of all
property adjacent to the subject property. A public notice sign shall be posted
on or near the subject property as described in §
153.010. The Planning Board  shall  have a maximum of 60 days from the date of
its first consideration of the plan within which to take action. In the opinion
of the Planning Board , if a development plan application is incomplete, the
Planning Board  may  return the application to the applicant  identifying the
specific omissions, without invoking the 60 day action requirement. The
Planning Board  may  take the following  actions: approve a development plan as
submitted; approve the plan with conditions;  (if conditions are agreed to in
writing by the applicant); table for additional consideration; or deny the
plan. The Subdivision Administrator  shall , within 10 days after Planning
Board  review, notify the applicant , in writing, of the Planning Board's
action and any conditions imposed by the Board. Unless otherwise stated by the
Planning Board , any conditions of development plan approval must be satisfied
within the time specified by the Planning Board . If the conditions on the
development plan are accepted by the applicant , the development plan shall  be
approved and the conditions shall  be put in  writing, signed by both parties,
and become binding. Failure to comply with any conditions of approval set by
the Planning Board , including failure to meet deadlines, shall  result in the
development plan approval becoming null and void.
      (4)   The applicant  may , only upon receipt of approval of the
development plan from the Planning Board , proceed with the establishment of
erosion and sedimentation control measures, clearing and other land disturbing
and improvement activities associated with the project. Development plan
approval shall  be valid for 2 years , and the approval shall  be annotated on
the plan itself and certified by the Subdivision Administrator . The Planning
Board  may , for just cause, grant extensions of development plan approval for
a maximum of 2 additional years . The plan shall  have the date of approval and
the date of written  notification to the owner  or owner's agent specifying the
conditions, if any, of the approval. Where the conditions involve the redesign
of the plan, annotations shall  be made on the "revised development plan" only,
and approval shall  not be effective until the plan is certified by the
Subdivision Administrator . Following  development plan approval,  if the
development plan is revised at a later date to affect any of the following:
increase the number of building lots to be created or units to be constructed;
create a substantive change in the subdivision configuration, road layout, and
the like; substantially change the use of any portion of the tract; develop or
build in areas that were identified as features in the site analysis sketch or
existing development plan as open spaces or protected areas, these shall be
considered major plan amendments and must be approved by the Planning Board .
The applicant shall submit a revised development plan to the Subdivision
Administrator for Planning Board review and approval in accordance with this
section. The Town of Mills River shall provide mailed public notice and posted
public notice on the subject property in advance of the Planning Board meeting
at which the major amendment to the subdivision plan will be considered, per §
153.010. Incidental changes or minor amendments may be approved by the
Subdivision Administrator for just cause as long as the changes do not
constitute a substantial deviation from the approved master plan. Minor
amendments to a subdivision development plan that can be approved by the
Subdivision Administrator do not warrant public notice.
   (D)   Final plat  submission and review. A final plat , developed in
conformance with
Appendix 7, shall  be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator  with the
required forms and applicable fees. The final plat  may  include the entire
subdivision  or any section  thereof. The Subdivision Administrator  may
approve a plat for fewer than the number of lots  approved but a surcharge may
be assessed. The Subdivision Administrator  shall  review the final plat  for
conformance with all applicable standards and conformance to the approved
development plan. The final plat  may  be approved administratively  if the
plan meets all requirements of the ordinance and satisfies all conditions
imposed by the Planning Board . If the final plat  is not administratively
approved, it must be submitted to the Planning Board  for approval. The
submission must be made to the Subdivision Administrator  15 days prior to the
regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Board . Upon approval, and before
any lots  are transferred, the applicant  shall  record the final plat  at the
office of the Henderson County Register of Deeds. Incidental changes to the
final plat  which do not in any way affect the character of the development may
be submitted prior to or after recordation and may  be approved for recordation
by the Subdivision Administrator . No lots  governed by this chapter may  be
sold or conveyed until a final plat  is approved and recorded in the office of
the Register of Deeds of Henderson County.

   Any subdivision  of land regulated by the terms of this chapter shall
submit to the Subdivision Administrator  a written  notice from the NCDENR,
Land Quality Section, verifying that a soil erosion and sedimentation control
plan has been received or a written  notice from a professional land surveyor,
engineer, landscape architect, architect, or professional planner certifying
that no plan is required. The plans are required anytime 1 acre or more of land
is disturbed.

§ 153.068 WATER SUPPLY AND SEWER SYSTEM REQUIRED.
   Every lot  within a subdivision  shall  be served by a water supply and
sewer system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of the
proposed use and comply with all applicable health regulations. Where public or
community water supply and/or sewer systems are proposed, a letter from each
respective agency must accompany the application, whereby the letter states
that there is sufficient capacity to make connection to the utility. The
applicant  must provide evidence that water supply and/or sewer system plans
have been approved by the appropriate agency. All public or private (community)
water supply and sewerage systems shall  be installed and shall  meet the
requirements of the Henderson County Health Department or other governmental
authorities having jurisdiction thereof. The development plan may  be approved
contingent on final approval from the agencies; however, the final plat  shall
not be approved until all the final approvals have been obtained.
   (A)   Individual water supply and sewer systems (well and septic tanks). For
subdivisions  in which the water supply and/or sewer system to be installed is
an individual system for each lot , the installation of the systems will not be
required prior to final plat  approval.
   (B)   If the subdivision in question is to have a sewer system other than
one connected to a municipal system, and other than described in division (A)
above, the following required:
      (1)   The applicant must provide a statement of responsibility for any
sewer lines extending beyond the subdivision  tract to the point(s) of
connection.
      (2)   The applicant must provide drawings of sewer lines extending beyond
the subdivision  tract to the point(s) of connection. These drawings should
also show all locations with sufficient area for repair, if needed;
      (3)   Sealed approval of the local Health Department or agency currently
in authority; and
      (4)   Engineered plans, including drawings of sewage lift stations, as to
the system.
      (5)   If the private sewer line is to run along a public road with no
recorded easement , a third party agreement with the agency currently in
authority of said road , the Town of Mills River, and the subdivision must be
reached.
   (C)   Public water supply and sewer system connection requirement.
      (1)   A subdivision  shall be required to connect to a public water
supply system when the subdivision is located within a distance from the
existing water system equal to the product of 100 feet multiplied by the number
of lots proposed for the subdivision . However, if the subdivision is located
more than 5,000 feet from an existing water line, such connection is not a
requirement.
      (2)   A subdivision  shall be required to connect to a public sewer
system when the subdivision is located within a distance equal to the product
of 50 feet multiplied by the number of proposed lots ; however, the maximum
distance required for connection shall be 2,500 feet.
      (3)   Exceptions to this provision may be allowed on the basis of
terrain, availability of acquiring easements , denial of allocation by the
public utility, insufficient capacity of the public system or other
circumstances which are unusual or unique to this site. Requests for exceptions
must be made, in writing, to the Subdivision Administrator who may require that
such requests be supported by a professional engineer’s review of the
subdivision plans and planned route of the utility extension. If the
Subdivision Administrator determines that it would not be economically feasible
for a subdivision to be connected to a public water or sewer system, another
system may be used, subject to approval by the appropriate agencies.
   (D)   Fire hydrants. Any subdivision  served by a public water system shall
meet the respective State of North Carolina's minimum requirements for fire
hydrant installation. For any major subdivision  without a fire suppression
rated water system, that either has or is adjacent to an adequate permanent
surface water supply, the applicant  may  be required to install a dry fire
hydrant system, the type and the location of which is to be determined by the
Fire Marshal. A road  to the water source providing permanent all-weather
access to the water source that is adequate for fire-fighting equipment shall
be required, if applicable.

§ 153.069 ROADS IN GENERAL.
   If the tract  to be subdivided is located on both sides of an existing,
recorded private right-of-way  that contains an existing private road , the
applicant  shall  be required to upgrade the portions of the existing private
road  which are contained on the tract  that is being subdivided to meet the
road  standards found in this chapter. It should be understood that all roads
proposed to be public must originate as private roads  until there is formal
dedication and acceptance by the state  or a municipality. All roads  proposed
to be private may , if designed and constructed to public standards and
dedicated by those with the authority to do so, eventually become public. The
applicant  shall  determine at the time of application if the subdivision
 roads  are to be public, private or a combination of both types. The
designation shall  be subsequently noted on final subdivision  plats. The
applicant  for a commercial or industrial subdivision  shall  provide roads
constructed at no less than state road standards  for public residential
collector roads , regardless of whether the roads  are proposed to be public or
private.
   (A)   Travel way minimum. All roads must have a minimum gravel or paved
travel way of 12 feet.
   (B)   Public roads . All roads  proposed for public use shall  be annotated
"public" on plans and plats and shall  be designed and constructed in
accordance with the standards necessary to make the roads  eligible to be put
on the State Highway Maintenance System at a later date. The standards,
hereafter referred to as "state road standards ," are contained in a
publication of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, Division of
Highways, titled "Subdivision  Roads  - Minimum Construction Standards," a copy
of which is available for review in the office  of the Subdivision
Administrator . Designation as public shall  be presumed an offer of dedication
to the public.
   (C)   Private roads .  All roads  not intended for public use shall  be
designated “private” on plats and plans and shall  be designed and constructed
in accordance with the standards of this chapter. (See also Table 1 in this
section.) Where private roads  are proposed as extensions of existing public
roads , the developer  must clearly justify why existing public roads  should
not be extended for public use. Roads  within family subdivisions  are
expressly exempt from the provisions of this section and are required only to
meet the minimum standards as set forth in §
153.047 of this chapter. Where private road  designs are used for  approvals of
a subdivision , a note shall  be placed on the final plat  stating: The private
roads  indicated on this final plat  need not meet the requirements of the
North Carolina Department of Transportation for acceptance into the state  road
system.
   (D)   Standards for private roads . To be approved, all private roads  shall
meet the minimum design and construction standards according to the following
 road  classifications:
      (1)   PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL COLLECTOR ROAD is a road  or a section of a
road  which:
         (a)   Provides direct or indirect access from the entrance of the
subdivision  inward to 25 or more existing or proposed residential lots  and/or
dwelling units and is designed to be the main travel path for the residential
access. In calculating residential density, dwelling units having driveway
access on the subject road  and dwelling units on side roads  which feed the
subject residential collector road  shall  be counted. The terminus or LAST
BLOCK of a residential collector road  ending in a dead end may  be designed to
the standards of a local residential subdivision  road  as long as the LAST
BLOCK serves fewer than 25 units.
         (b)   Is designed to serve, or has the potential to serve in a future
phase, property  in the same ownership of the applicant  that, if developed,
will meet the 25 dwelling-unit standard.
         (c)   Connects proposed developments with existing developments where
the aggregate sum of dwelling units in both developments is 25 or more.
         (d)   Serves a nonresidential facility located within a residential
development, such as a frequently used recreation area , club house, golf
course, public utility site, and the like. (NOTE: See Table 1, "Collector"
column.)
      (2)   PRIVATE LOCAL RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION ROAD is a road  or group of
roads  which abuts less than 25 residential lots  or serves less than 25
existing or proposed residential dwelling units and does not connect
thoroughfares. (NOTE: See Table 1, "Local" column.)
      (3)   PRIVATE LIMITED LOCAL RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION ROAD is a road  which
abuts no more than three (3) residential lots , each containing or to contain
no more than one (1) existing or proposed residential dwelling unit and its
associated driveway  and which does not connect thoroughfares. (NOTE: See Table
1, "Limited Local" column.)

      (4)   If not specifically listed in Table 1 above or elsewhere in this
chapter, design and subsequent construction of private roads  shall  be
reviewed by the Planning Board  based on the standards and requirements of the
NCDOT and with the local NCDOT District Engineer policy modifications. A
typical road  cross section is shown in the NCDOT publication entitled
Subdivision  Roads  - Minimum Construction Standards, a copy of which can be
reviewed at the Mills River Town Hall.
   (E)   Road  drainage and culverts. All road  or drainage structures shall
be constructed in accordance with state road standards . Road  drainage side
ditches shall  be constructed with sufficient depth and width to carry the
expected volume of stormwater runoff. Where the road  crosses streams or minor
watercourses, culverts shall  be designed and installed in accordance with
state road standards . Development plans shall  show all the drainage culvert
locations, as well as the length, diameter and type of culvert.
   (F)   Road  construction. All roads  must be constructed with suitable stone
and compacted properly. Used asphalt is unacceptable as a base course. The
subbase must be of suitable soil capable of supporting the road  above. The
road  should be built so that water will drain from the road  surface into side
ditches. Because of the difficulty of operating vehicles on steep grades and
the high potential for erosion, where possible, roads  should be constructed
along the contour of the land. No stone-based road  may  exceed the following
grades: 15% local residential road  and 12% collector, and no paved road  may
exceed 18% and 16%, respectively. If combination paved and stone-based road
sections are proposed, the paved sections must extend 50 feet from any point a
road  grade exceeds the minimum for a stone-based road . The Subdivision
Administrator  may  require that a professional engineer or professional land
surveyor certify on the final plat  that no portion of the road (s) have grades
that exceed maximum allowable grade as defined herein or submit a final as-
built graded center line profile showing grade and alignment for all roads .
   (G)   Minimum curve radius. Where practical, roads  shall  be centered in
the road  right-of-way . The minimum curve radius (the distance measured from
the centerline of the road  to a fixed point inside the curve) shall  be no
less than 90 feet except as provided below. The right-of-way  must include
sufficient width for the travelway and the necessary shoulders, ditches and
slopes. Where the existing cross slope on private limited local residential
subdivision  roads  or private local residential subdivision  roads  is 15% or
greater, a minimum centerline radius of 60 feet shall  be permitted. Where the
existing cross slope on private residential collector roads  is 15% or greater,
a minimum centerline radius of 80 feet shall  be permitted. Curve radii must be
noted on development plans.
   (H)   Intersections. The proposed intersection of all roads  should conform
with the corresponding design standards. Adequate sight distances along the
proposed roads  shall  be provided by choosing a good location for the right-
of-way  and clearing sight triangles when building the road . When connecting
roads , the minimum sight distance is 70 feet along the existing road  right-
of-way  and 10 feet along the new road  right-of-way . The intersection of
roads  must provide an adequate place for vehicles to stop before entering the
road . Roads  must have an apron design at proposed intersections in order to
permit a vehicle to enter when another vehicle is waiting to turn.
   (I)   Dead ends, culs-de-sac  and turnarounds. All roads  or sections
thereof with dead-ends or culs-de-sac  should not exceed 2,500 feet in length.
Loop roads  should be encouraged where possible in lieu of culs-de-sac . The
Planning Board  may  require the installation of a temporary turnaround at the
end of a phased project or a partial turnaround along any road  that exceeds
1,500 feet in length. Vehicle turnaround areas shall  be provided at the end of
all dead-end roads  that exceed 300 feet. The required turnaround on a dead-end
road  shall  have a roadway radius of not less than 35 feet. Stub roads  shall
be designed in locations which will permit the future extension of subdivision
 roads .
   (J)   Bridges .  
      (1)   Bridges  on public roads . Bridges  located on proposed public
roads  in residential, commercial or industrial subdivisions  shall  be
designed according to state road standards  for public road  bridges . The
applicant  shall  submit a copy of the bridge  design plans as part of the
development plan application. The plans should include certification from a
registered professional engineer indicating that the plans meet state road
standards  for public road  bridges . The Planning Board  may  approve the
development plan contingent on submission of the plans to the Subdivision
Administrator . However, prior to final plat  approval or release of any
improvement guarantee  the applicant  must submit a copy of documentation
indicating plan approval by NCDOT and a copy of an as-built drawing of the
bridge  with certification from a registered professional engineer that the
bridge  meets state road standards  for public road  bridges .
      (2)   Bridges  on private roads  in residential subdivisions . If bridges
on private roads  in residential subdivisions  are proposed, the applicant
must submit a copy of bridge  plans showing certification from a registered
professional engineer indicating that the bridge  plans meet state road
standards  for public road  bridges  for drainage, hydraulics and minimum live
load. Bridges  proposed for private roads  shall  comply with state road
standards  for public road  bridges  for drainage, hydraulics and minimum live
load. The proposed bridges  must meet the standards for vertical clearance for
roads  shown in Table 1. The travelway width across the proposed bridge  must
not be less than the travelway width of the road  on either side of the
proposed bridge , but in no event shall  the bridge  travelway be less than 12
feet. If the travelway of a private bridge  is less than 18 feet wide and the
bridge  is proposed to accommodate two (2) way traffic, a paved or gravel
turnout shall  be provided on each end of the proposed bridge  to provide space
for at least one (1) vehicle to safely pull over and allow an oncoming vehicle
to traverse the bridge . However, prior to final plat  approval or release of
any improvement guarantee , however, the applicant  must submit a copy of an
as-built drawing of the bridge  with certification from a registered
professional engineer that the bridge  meets the standards required in this
subsection.
      (3)   Bridges  on private roads  in commercial or industrial subdivisions
. Bridges  located on proposed private roads  in commercial or industrial
subdivisions shall  be designed according to state road standards  for public
road  bridges . The applicant  shall  submit a copy of the bridge  design plans
as part of the development plan application. The plans should include
certification from a registered professional engineer indicating that the plans
meet state road standards  for public road  bridges . The Planning Board  may
approve the development plan contingent on submission of the plans to the
Subdivision Administrator . Prior to final plat  approval or release of any
improvement guarantee , however, the applicant  must submit a copy of an as-
built drawing of the bridge  with certification from a registered professional
engineer that the bridge  meets state road standards  for public road  bridges
.
   (K)   Commercial subdivision entrances. Interior roads in a commercial
subdivision  shall comply with Table 1 Road Construction Standards with no
exemption for less than four (4) lots as granted for residential subdivisions .
   (L)   Subdivision  lighting standards. If newly constructed
subdivision roads  include new roadway or pedestrian lighting, the light
fixtures must meet the requirements of §
154.117  (Lighting standards).

upon land in violation of this chapter or a use made of land in violation of
this chapter, the Ordinance Administrator or the other official charged with
the responsibility of enforcing the Town of Mills River Ordinances may
institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking an order of

sizes in accordance with soil characteristics in the town.
   (D)   Certain specialized developments, such as planned unit developments
and manufactured home parks , may be permitted under specific conditions. These
developments must be constructed in full accordance with an approved site plan
and general development criteria which are intended to give latitude and
flexibility in design and, at the same time, ensure the protection of
surrounding properties .
   (E)   By regulating the uses permitted in an established zoning district,
areas can be developed to their full potential without fear of nearby
incompatible development within zoned areas.

the use of minimum specific site standards combined with general standards
which provide the flexibility to impose a higher level of specific site
standards, dependent upon the degree of neighborhood impact.

the requirements of this section. However, the built-upon area of the existing
development  is not required to be included in the built-upon area
calculations.
      (1)   Uses of land. This category consists of uses existing as of the
effective date of this section where such use of the land is not permitted to
be established hereafter in the watershed area in which it is located. Such
uses may  be continued except as follows:
         (a)   When such use of land has been changed to an allowed use, it
shall not thereafter revert to any prohibited use.
         (b)   Such use of land shall be changed only to an allowed use.
         (c)   When such use ceases for a period of at least 1 year, it shall
not be reestablished.
      (2)   Reconstruction of buildings  or built-upon areas. Any existing
building  or built-upon area not in conformance with the requirements of this
section that has been damaged or removed may  be repaired and/or reconstructed,
except that there are no restrictions on single family residential development,
provided:
         (a)   Repair or reconstruction is initiated within 12 months and
completed within 2 years of such damage.
         (b)   The total amount of space devoted to built-upon area may not be
increased unless stormwater control measures that equal or exceed the previous
development are provided.
      (3)   Existing vacant lots . Existing vacant lots  are lots  for which
plats or deeds have been recorded as of May 23, 1994 in the office of the
Register of Deeds of Henderson County. An existing lot  may  be used for any of
the uses allowed in the Watershed Protection Area in which it is located
provided that where the lot  size is less than the minimum specified in this
section, the project requires the issuance of a permit or permits as required
by the Mills River Town Code.
   (H)   Buffer  requirements. All uses within Watershed Protection Areas shall
be required to maintain a minimum 30 foot vegetated buffer  from perennial
stream banks; provided, however, that where development  is approved as a high-
density  development , the setback from perennial streams shall  be 100 feet.
Perennial streams shall  be identified as indicated on the most recent version
of the USGS 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by
local government studies. Where USGS topographical maps do not distinguish
between perennial and intermittent streams, an on-site stream determination may
be performed by an individual qualified to perform such stream determinations.
Water-dependent structures  and public projects, such as road crossings and
greenways, may  be allowed where no practical alternative exists. The
activities shall  minimize built-upon surface area and maximize the use of
stormwater best management practices.
   (I)   Cluster development. Cluster development  is allowed in designated
Watershed Protection Areas in accordance with §
154.080 of this chapter, and under the following conditions.
      (1)   Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single family cluster
development projects; however, the total number of lots  shall not exceed the
number of lots allowed for single family detached developments in § 303.
Density or built-upon area for the project shall not exceed that allowed for
the critical area, balance of watershed or protected area, whichever applies.
      (2)   All built-upon area shall be designed and located to minimize
stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated
stormwater flow, maximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas, and
maximize the flow length through vegetated areas.
      (3)   Areas of concentrated density  development  shall be located in
upland area and away, to the maximum extent practicable, from surface waters
and drainageways.
      (4)   The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural
state. The title to the open space area shall be conveyed to an incorporated
homeowners association for management; to a local government for preservation
as a park or open space; or to a conservation organization for preservation in
a permanent easement. Where a property association is not incorporated, a
maintenance agreement shall be filed with the property deeds.
      (5)   Cluster developments that meet the applicable low density
requirements shall transport stormwater runoff by vegetated conveyances to the
maximum extent practicable.
   (J)   Density  averaging. An applicant may  average development  density  on
up to 2 noncontiguous properties  for purposes of achieving compliance with the
water supply watershed development  standards if all of the following
circumstances exist:
      (1)   The properties are within the same water supply watershed. If 1 of
the properties is located in the critical area of the watershed, the critical
area property shall not be developed beyond the applicable density requirements
for its classification.
      (2)   Overall project density meets applicable density or stormwater
control requirements under 15A NCAC 2B.0200.
      (3)   Vegetated setbacks on both properties meet the minimum statewide
water supply watershed protection requirements.
      (4)   Built-upon areas are designed and located to minimize stormwater
runoff impact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated stormwater flow,
maximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas, and maximize the flow
length through vegetated areas.
      (5)   Areas of concentrated density  development are located in upland
areas and, to the maximum extent practicable, away from surface waters and
drainageways.
      (6)   The property or portions of the properties that are not being
developed will remain in a vegetated or natural state and will be managed by a
homeowners' association as common area, conveyed to a local government as a
park or greenway, or placed under a permanent conservation or farmland
preservation easement unless it can be demonstrated that the local government
can ensure long-term compliance through deed restrictions and an electronic
permitting mechanism. A metes and bounds description of the areas to remain
vegetated and limits on use shall be recorded on the subdivision plat, in
homeowners' covenants, and on individual deed and shall be irrevocable.
      (7)   Development permitted under density averaging and meeting
applicable low density requirements shall transport stormwater runoff by
vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable.
      (8)   A special use permit or other such permit or certificate shall be
obtained from the local Watershed Review Board or Board of Adjustment to ensure
that both properties considered together meet the standards of the Watershed
Ordinance and that potential owners have record of how the watershed
regulations were applied to the properties .
   (K)   Calculation of project density . The following requirements shall
apply to the calculation of project density :
      (1)   Project density shall be calculated as the total built-upon area
divided by the total project area;
      (2)   A project with "existing development," as that term is defined in
15A NCAC 02B.0621, may use the calculation method in division (K)(1) or may
calculate project density as the difference of total built-upon area minus
existing built-upon area divided by the difference of total project area minus
existing built-upon area.
      (3)   Expansions to existing development  shall be subject to 15A NCAC
02B.0624 except as excluded in Rule 15A NCAC 02B.0622(1)(d).
      (4)   Where there is a net increase of built-upon area, only the area of
net increase shall be subject to 15A NCAC 02B.0624.
      (5)   Where existing development is being replaced with new built-upon
area, and there is a net increase of built-upon area, only the area of net
increase shall be subject to 15A NCAC 02B.0624;
      (6)   Total project area shall l exclude the following:
         (a)   Areas below the Normal High Water Line (NHWL); and
         (b)   Areas defined as "coastal wetlands" pursuant to 15A NCAC
07H.0205.
      (7)   Projects under a common plan of development shall be considered as
a single project for purposes of density calculation except that on a case-by-
case basis, local governments may allow projects to be considered to have both
high and low density areas based on one or more of the following criteria:
         (a)   Natural drainage area boundaries;
         (b)   Variations in land use throughout the project; or
         (c)   Construction phasing.
   (L)   Low density projects. In addition to complying with the project
density requirements of the Mills River Watershed Protection Ordinance, low
density projects shall  comply with the following:
      (1)   Vegetated conveyances. Stormwater runoff from the project shall  be
released to vegetated areas as dispersed flow or transported by vegetated
conveyances to the maximum extent practicable. In determining whether this
criteria has been met, the local government shall  take into account site-
specific factors such as topography and site layout as well as protection of
water quality. Vegetated conveyances shall  be maintained in perpetuity to
ensure that they function as designed. Vegetated conveyances that meet the
following criteria shall  be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
division:
         (a)   Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical) unless it is demonstrated to the local government that the soils and
vegetation will remain stable in perpetuity based on engineering calculations
and on-site soil investigation; and
         (b)   The conveyance shall be designed so that it does not erode
during the peak flow from the 10-year storm event as demonstrated by
engineering calculations.
      (2)   Curb outlet systems. In lieu of vegetated conveyances, low density
projects shall  have the option to use curb and gutter with outlets to convey
stormwater to grassed swales or vegetated areas. Requirements for these curb
outlet systems shall  be as follows:
         (a)   The curb outlets shall be located such that the swale or
vegetated area can carry the peak flow from the 10-year storm and at a non-
erosive velocity;
         (b)   The longitudinal slope of the swale or vegetated area shall not
exceed 5% except where not practical due to physical constraints. In these
cases, devices to slow the rate of runoff and encourage infiltration to reduce
pollutant delivery shall be provided;
         (c)   The swale's cross section shall be trapezoidal with a minimum
bottom width of 2 feet;
         (d)   The side slopes of the swale or vegetated area shall be no
steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical);
         (e)   The minimum length of the swale or vegetated area shall be 100
feet; and
         (f)   Low density projects may use treatment swales designed in
accordance with 15A NCAC 02H.1061 in lieu of the requirements specified in
divisions (a) through (e) of this division (L)(2).
   (M)   High density  projects. In addition to complying with the project
density  requirements of the Mills River Watershed Protection Ordinance, high
density  projects shall  comply with the following:
      (1)   Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) shall be designed, constructed,
and maintained so that the project achieves either "runoff treatment" or
"runoff volume match" as those terms are defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0621;
      (2)   For high density projects designed to achieve runoff treatment, the
required storm depth shall be 1 inch. Applicants shall have the option to
design projects to achieve runoff volume match in lieu of runoff treatment;
      (3)   Stormwater runoff from off-site areas and "existing development ,"
as that term is defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0621, shall not be required to be
treated in the SCM. Runoff from off-site areas or existing development that is
not bypassed shall be included in sizing of on-site SCMs;
      (4)   SCMs shall meet the relevant MDC set forth in 15A NCAC 02H.1050
through .1062; and
      (5)   Stormwater outlets shall be designed so that they do not cause
erosion downslope of the discharge point during the peak flow from the 10-year
storm event as shown by engineering calculations.
   (N)   Options for implementing project density . The Town of Mills River has
the following options in addition to those enumerated in divisions (D) and (E)
above, as appropriate.
      (1)   The Town of Mills River may allow only low density development in
its water supply watershed areas in accordance with this section.
      (2)   The Town of Mills River may regulate low density single-family
detached residential development using the minimum lot size requirements,
dwelling unit per acre requirements, built-upon area percentages, or some
combination of these.
      (3)   10/70 option. Outside of WS-I watersheds and the critical areas of
WS-II, WS-III, and WS-IV watersheds, the Town of Mills River may  regulate new
development under the "10/70 option" in accordance with the following
requirements:
         (a)   A maximum of 10% of the land area of a water supply watershed
outside of the critical area and within the Town of Mills River's planning
jurisdiction may be developed with new development projects and expansions of
existing development of up to 70% built-upon area.
         (b)   In water supply watersheds classified on or before August 3,
1992, the beginning amount of acreage available under this option shall be
based on the Town of Mills River's jurisdiction as delineated on July 1, 1993.
In water supply watersheds classified after August 3, 1992, the beginning
amount of acreage available under this option shall be based on the Town of
Mills River's jurisdiction as delineated on the date the water supply watershed
classification became effective. The acreage within the critical area shall not
be counted towards the allowable 10/70 option acreage;
         (c)   Projects that are covered under the 10/70 option shall comply
with the low density requirements set forth in division (C) above unless the
Town of Mills River allows high density development, in which case the town may
require these projects to comply with high density requirements;
         (d)   The maximum built-upon area allowed on any given new development
project shall be 70%;
         (e)   The Town of Mills River may transfer, in whole or in part, its
right to the 10/70 land area to another local government within the same water
supply watershed upon submittal of a joint resolution and approval by the
Commission; and
         (f)   When the water supply watershed is composed of public lands,
such as National Forest land, the Town of Mills River may count the public land
acreage within the watershed outside of the critical area in calculating the
acreage allowed under this provision.
      (4)   New development  shall meet the development requirements on a
project-by-project basis except the Town of Mills River may submit ordinances
that use density or built-upon area criteria averaged throughout the Mills
River watershed jurisdiction instead of on a project-by-project basis within
the watershed. Prior to approval of the ordinance, the Town of Mills River
shall demonstrate to the Commission that the provisions as averaged meet or
exceed the statewide minimum requirements and that a mechanism exists to ensure
the planned distribution of development potential throughout the local
government's jurisdiction within the watershed.
      (5)   The Town of Mills River may administer oversight of future
development activities in single-family detached residential developments that
exceed the applicable low density requirements by tracking dwelling units
rather than percentage built-upon area, as long as the SCM is sized to capture
and treat runoff from 1) all pervious and built-upon surfaces shown on the
development plan and 2) any off-site drainage from pervious and built-upon
surfaces, and when an additional safety factor of 15% of built-upon area of the
project site is figured in.

District in the applicable area:
         (a)   Alteration of a use (without physical expansion). Alterations of
the operations of a use shall be allowed as long as the alterations do not
violate any specific standards of this chapter (see §
154.087), general standards of this chapter (see §
154.138) or conditions of the special use  permit . If an alteration would
result in the violation of any specific standards of this chapter (see §
154.087), general standards of this chapter (see §
154.138) or conditions of the special use  permit , an amendment to the special
use  permit  shall be required, otherwise the alteration will be deemed a

154.066(G) without applying for a new special use  permit . Alterations of
operations shall include, but not be limited to, increases in productivity
arising from the addition of equipment, the addition of employee shifts or the
change of means and methods.
         (b)   Physical expansion of a use. A use may expand its facilities
without any additional restrictions and without securing an amendment to the
special use  permit if the specific standards of this chapter (see §
154.087), general standards of this chapter (see §
154.138), or the conditions of the permit , if any, will not be violated and if
the total size of the structures or areas devoted to the principal uses after
the proposed expansion would not be increased by more than 10%. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no use may expand in accordance with the terms of this exception
on more than 2 occasions without securing an amendment to the special use
 permit . All other expansions will require an amendment to the special use
 permit . If any condition of the special use  permit will be violated by a
proposed expansion to facilities, or the proposed expansion will result in more
than 2 expansions to facilities pursuant to the exception contained herein
above, or the expansion results in the total size of the structures or areas
devoted to the principal use being expanded by more than 10%, then the
expansion will be deemed a violation of this chapter.
      (2)   Uses for which a special use  permit  was not required when
established. For those uses of the same type as those listed in §
154.066(G) constructed or established after the effective date of a Zoning Map
of the Town of Mills River amendment applying the MR-Mixed Use District in the
applicable area, which did not require a special use  permit when the use was
constructed or established, any expansion or alteration to the operations, or
any expansion or alteration to the structures or areas devoted to the principal
use , which bring the use within the definition for those uses listed in §
154.066(G) shall require a special use  permit . The entire use, including but
not limited to the expansion or alteration, shall be required to comply with
all applicable standards in the MR-Mixed Use District.
      (3)   Preexisting uses. For those uses of the same type as those listed
in §
154.066(G) constructed or established before the effective date of a Zoning Map
of the Town of Mills River amendment applying the MR-Mixed Use District in the
applicable area the following requirements shall apply:
         (a)   Alteration of a use (without physical expansion). Alterations of
the operations of a use of the type listed in §
154.066(G) shall be allowed without a special use  permit if the use did not
meet the definition of 1 of the uses listed in §
154.066(G) when constructed or established, and the alteration does not bring
the use within the definition for 1 of the uses listed in §
154.066(G). If, however, the alteration will bring the use within the
definition of 1 of the uses listed in §
154.066(G), then a special use  permit  shall be required. Once a special use
 permit is obtained for a preexisting use, however, further alterations shall
be governed by §
154.066(I)(1)(a) above.
         (b)   Physical expansion of a use. Expansions of the facilities for
uses of the type listed in §
154.066(G) shall be allowed without a special use  permit if the use would not
have met the definition of one of the uses listed in §
154.066(G) when constructed or established, and the expansion does not bring
the use within the definition for one of the uses listed in §
154.066(G). If, however, the expansion will bring the use within the definition
of one of the uses listed in §
154.066(G) or the use would have met the definition of one of the uses listed
in §
154.066(G) when constructed or established, then a special use  permit  shall
be required. Once a special use is obtained for a preexisting use, however,
further expansions shall be governed by §
154.066(I)(1)(b) above.
         (c)   Applicable standards. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
chapter, alterations or expansions to uses required to obtain a special use
 permit pursuant to this §
154.066(I)(3) [whether or not they are later governed by §
154.066(I)(1)(a) or §
154.066(I)(1)(b) above] shall be required to meet the specific site standards
listed in §
154.087 to the extent possible for the expanded or altered portion of the
facility or operation only. Any the alteration or expansion shall be required
to meet the general standards listed in §
154.138 with or without conditions imposed by the Mills River Town Council as
allowed by this chapter. The conditions may include, but not be limited to,
imposition of specific site standards of the types listed in §
154.087. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, development occurring
around a preexisting use will not affect the ability of the use to alter or
expand its facilities or operations.
   (K)   Subsequent events. Events occurring subsequent to the date of an
application for a special use  permit for those uses in the MR-Mixed Use
District requiring the permit , including but not limited to the location of a
health-care facility or school within the stated separation or a change in the
residential density , shall not operate to invalidate the permit or affect the
ability of the use to alter or expand its facilities or operations. In
addition, development occurring around a preexisting use or a use for which a
special use  permit was not required when established will not affect the
ability of the use to alter or expand its facilities or operations.
   (L)   Dimensional requirements - nonresidential. Within the MR-Mixed Use
District, as shown on the Zoning Map of the Town of Mills River, the following
dimensional requirements shall be met:

§ 154.067 MR-CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT.
   (A)   It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be
inappropriate at particular locations in the absence of special conditions.
Some land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts
on both the immediately surrounding area and on the entire community which
cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. There are
also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use
by-right would not be appropriate for a particular property , even though the
use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property
consistent with the objectives of this chapter and the Making Mills River 2040
Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Establishment of a Conditional Zoning District shall only be
considered upon the request of all the owners and/or their representatives of
the property to be included. A Conditional Zoning may not be initiated by the
Town Council , the Planning Board, the Board of Adjustment, the Town Manager,
the Zoning Administrator , or other Town staff.
   (C)   As authorized under G.S. 160D-703, the following conditional districts
are established which require the submission of an application and a master
plan as a prerequisite to any development .
      (1)   A Residential Conditional Zoning District (MR-R-CD).
      (2)   Commercial Conditional Zoning District (MR-C-CD).
      (3)   Industrial Conditional Zoning District (MR-I-CD).
      (4)   Mixed Use Conditional Zoning District (MR-M-CD).
   (D)   Each district is subject to applicable standards and conditions
imposed by the Town Council in the ordinance creating the district. If the
ordinance creating a conditional zoning district fails to provide specific
standards, any development in the district shall comply with the applicable
standards for the corresponding base district contained in this chapter. These
conditional districts are not intended to relieve hardships that should be
resolved by means of a variance.
   (E)   The conditional zoning district classification allows projects of
innovative design and layout that would not otherwise be permitted under this
chapter because of the strict application of conventional zoning district
standards or other general development standards. Conditional zoning encourages
innovative land planning and design concepts by:
      (1)   Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results
from strict application of zoning and development standards that were designed
primarily for individual lots ;
      (2)   Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access,
light, open space, and design amenities;
      (3)   Allowing greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the
same development , including a mix of housing types and non-residential uses in
a conditional zoning district;
      (4)   Promoting quality urban design and environmentally sensitive
development by allowing development to take advantage of special site
characteristics, locations, and land uses.
   (F)   In return for greater flexibility in site design requirements,
conditional zoning districts are expected to deliver exceptional quality
community designs that preserve critical environmental resources, provide high
quality open space amenities, incorporate creative design in the layout of
buildings , open space and circulation; assure compatibility with surrounding
land uses and neighborhood character; and provide greater efficiency in the
layout and provision of roads, utilities, and other infrastructure.
      (1)   (a)   In order to apply for a rezoning to a conditional zoning
district, proposed development projects and subject property must meet both of
the following minimum requirements:
         (b)   Subject property  must have Making Mills River Comprehensive
Plan, Future Land Use Map designation of Community Center, Industrial and
Employment, or Community Crossroads districts. Subject property  total
contiguous acreage: 2 acres.
      (2)   (a)   Uses.
         (b)   Each conditional zoning district ordinance shall specify
allowable uses and associated approval processes as one of the following:
            1.   Permitted by Right (P). A use which is permitted by right must
comply with the development standards mutually agreed to for the conditional
district.
            2.   Permitted with Standards (PS). Same as above except that the
use must comply with 1 or more additional standards not required of other
permitted uses in the district.
            3.   Special Use Permit (SUP). Requires issuance of a Major or
Minor Special Use Permit from Town Council or the Board of Adjustment,
respectively.
      (3)   Development standards.
         (a)   Certain development standards may not be altered by means of a
conditional zoning district, these include: water supply watershed regulations,
stormwater regulations, water supply permitting, wastewater permitting, NCDOT
driveway permitting, and any other state or federal requirements, such as
sedimentation and erosion control permitting, and stream and wetland
disturbance permitting.
            1.   Residential density in a conditional district must adhere to
the Town requirement of a maximum of 1 dwelling unit per 30,000 SF for detached
single-family  developments , and 4 dwelling units per acre for multifamily
developments , tiny home parks , park model parks , and recreational vehicle
parks .
            2.   Residential minimum lot size in a conditional district must
adhere to the Town requirement of no less than 30,000 SF for detached single-
family  developments , and 20,000 SF for single family residential cluster
developments s and planned residential developments . Lot size requirements are
waived for multifamily developments .
         (b)   Unless specifically stated in the approving ordinance all
developments must comply with existing standards for parking, landscaping,
corridor overlay district architectural requirements, road construction
standards, yards , and setbacks, as identified in the most closely related
conventional zoning district.
         (c)   Conditional zoning districts may allow for modifications to any
or all of the following:
            1.   Uses.
            2.   Building height .
            3.   Building size.
            4.   Building architectural design.
            5.   Parking.
            6.   Landscaping.
            7.   Setbacks.
            8.   Open space.
            9.   Signage.
            10.   Number of Principle Uses or Buildings .

§ 154.116 TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS (TIA).
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure that applicants for
new construction, special use permits , major subdivisions, additions and/or
expansions to existing structures , and/or changes of use consider and mitigate
the impact of the development  on the existing and/or proposed roadway system.
A traffic impact analysis (TIA) will ensure that the transportation network has
adequate capacity to handle projected transportation demand associated with the
development  project, identify problems with the transportation system,
delineate solutions to identified problems, and identify improvements to be
incorporated into the proposed development .
   (B)   Traffic impact analysis required. All proposals and applications for
new construction, redevelopment, special use permit , additions and/or
expansions to existing structures  or sites, major subdivisions, changes of
use, and/or any other proposed development  which will result in peak hour
vehicle trips equal to or greater than 75 peak hour trips or which will result
in daily vehicle trips equal to or greater than 750 daily trips using trip
generation rates from the most recent edition of the Trip Generation Manual
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers shall  include an
analysis of the traffic to be generated with a TIA. The traffic impact analysis
(TIA) shall  be submitted to town  staff with the development  application or
subdivision application. In addition to the foregoing, the Town  Zoning
Administrator shall  have the discretion to require a TIA when a development's
expected traffic will substantially affect an intersection or roadway segment
already identified as operating at a failing level of service, when a
development may create a hazard to public safety, or when a development will
substantially change the off-site transportation system or connections to it.
Notwithstanding the above a TIA shall not be required if the property to be
developed has been the subject of a TIA within the previous 3 years and the
projected trip generation of the newly proposed development is equal to or less
than the previous TIA performed and the trip distribution has not significantly
changed.
   (C)   Traffic impact analysis submission guidelines.
      (1)   Any TIA, whether required or voluntary, must be prepared by a
licensed North Carolina engineer and submitted as part of a development and/or
subdivision application. Prior to conducting the TIA, the developer and/or
engineer that will be conducting the TIA must meet with town staff and the
North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) to identify certain
assumptions and scope that shall be addressed in the TIA, including but not
limited to establishing the study area, the trip distribution, the traffic
counts to be utilized, approved developments in the area, additional hours of
analysis (other than A.M. or P.M. peak). and resolve any other questions
specific to the site.
      (2)   An executive summary shall be provided in the TIA outlining the
following: a) detailed description of the proposed development ; b) number of
access points proposed and studied; c) existing and future Level of Service
(LOS) for studied intersections and road segments including the LOS at the time
of build-out; d) existing traffic counts for road (s) and intersection(s)
studied and dates/times counts were conducted; e) A.M. and P.M. peak hour
vehicle trips for pre-development and post-development conditions; f) average
daily vehicle trips for pre-development and post-development conditions; g)
existing traffic accident counts; h) any recommended improvements.
      (3)   The TIA shall address the following: a) proposed land use; b) site
access and site distances at all proposed access points; c) impacts on the
transportation system from the proposed development ; d) physical improvements
or enforceable management strategies to mitigate negative impacts.
      (4)   The TIA shall take into consideration proposed and planned NCDOT
roadway improvement projects and town roadway and pedestrian/bicycle
transportation projects.
      (5)   The TIA shall identify the improvements necessary to maintain level
of service (LOS) D for roads and intersections as defined in the Highway
Capacity Manual.
      (6)   The TIA shall conduct a pedestrian and bicycle analysis. Continuity
and adequacy of pedestrian and bicycle facilities shall be provided to the
nearest attraction (existing or planned) within ¼ mile of the boundary of the
development site. Destinations of significance include public transportation
stops, schools, parks, activity centers, major bicycle facilities and
corridors, and high-density population centers.
      (7)   When calculating vehicle counts for commercial and industrial
developments where the projected traffic primarily consists of trucks, tractor
trailers, and other large commercial vehicles, the following formula shall be
used to equate truck trips to regular passenger vehicle trips. A passenger car
equivalent (PCE) shall be provided in addition to truck traffic counts. Truck
trips shall be converted to passenger vehicle trips using a 2.0 PCE factor for
two-axle trucks, 2.5 PCE factor for 3-axle trucks, and 3.0 PCE factor for 4-
axle trucks and larger trucks. The PCE shall be used to determine if a TIA is
required for developments primarily expected to generate truck traffic.
      (8)   The town may require special/specific analysis in the TIA relative
to the proposed development .
   (D)   Improvements required. In those cases where the town  or the North
Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) requires improvements to be
constructed in order to accommodate additional traffic generated by the
proposed development , the improvements shall  be funded and/or constructed by
the developer in accordance with the standards and direction provided by the
town  or the NCDOT. The improvements shall  be complete and in place prior to
issuance of any certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion/
compliance required for any phase or portion of the project. The town  may
require additional mitigation, onsite improvements, and/or offsite improvements
provided the improvements are acceptable by NCDOT. However, a TIA shall  not be
utilized as a means for the town  to require the developer to make needed
transportation improvements remote from and not affected by the property  for
which the TIA is submitted.
      (1)   Left turn lane, right turn lane, acceleration/deceleration lanes,
and/or right turn taper. Improvements may be required based on requirements of
the NCDOT Policy on Street  and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways or
other NCDOT standards.
      (2)   Additional right-of-way. If a proposed development  falls along a
road  projected to be widened or improved by NCDOT or an adopted town plan,
additional right-of-way along the development's  road  frontage shall  be
dedicated as deemed acceptable by NCDOT.
      (3)   Offsite improvements. If a road  segment or intersection is
currently performing at LOS D or better and is projected to perform at LOS E or
F at the time of build-out of the proposed development , improvements must be
made to maintain the road  segment or intersection at LOS D. If a road  segment
or intersection is currently performing at LOS E or F and is projected to
continue to perform at the same LOS (E or F) at the time of build-out of the
proposed development , the TIA shall  demonstrate how an LOS D could be
achieved and also specify what improvements must be made to ensure that the
road  segment or intersection LOS is not degraded any further than the current
levels. The town may require improvements be made to preserve the existing LOS.
      (4)   Other necessary improvements. Additional improvements may be
required based on the TIA recommendations related to topographic/environmental
conditions, sight distance, street  offsets, conflicting movements, existing
traffic accident counts, circulation, and other potential traffic issues
resulting from the proposed development . Additionally, the town  may require
additional improvements deemed necessary to ensure the safety and welfare of
the town's citizens and transportation network users.

between points can vary depending on the size of the area to be lighted. For
many typical outdoor layouts, a 10-foot by 10-foot spacing grid layout is used.
Larger areas may  utilize a 15-foot or 20-foot grid spacing. This type layout
can also indicate luminance or reflected light instead of illuminance.
      SEMI-CUTOFF FIXTURE. A fixture light distribution where no more than 5%
of a lamp's light intensity is emitted at or above a horizontal plane drawn
through the bottom of the fixture and no more than 20% of the lamp's light

§ 154.179 POWERS AND DUTIES OF ZONING BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:
   (A)   Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error in an order, requirement, decision, determination or
interpretation made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this
chapter pursuant to any of the following :
      (1)   Any person who has standing under G.S. § 160D-1402(c) or the town
may appeal a decision to the board of adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing
a notice of appeal with the Town Clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the
grounds for the appeal.
      (2)   The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the
owner of the property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who
sought the decision, if different from the owner . The written notice shall be
delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail.
      (3)   The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the
written notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing
to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or
constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.
      (4)   It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to
appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing
the words "Zoning Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" in letters at least 6
inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information
about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of
the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least 10 days.
Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting
shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the
posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Absent an
ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall not be required.
      (5)   The official who made the decision shall transmit to the board all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the
appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if
the appellant is not the owner .
      (6)   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays
enforcement of the action appealed from unless the official who made the
decision certifies to the board of adjustment after notice of appeal has been
filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in
nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In
that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining
order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not
stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited
hearing of the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the
appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a
proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the
further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such
property ; in these situations the appellant may request and the board may
grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building  permits
affected by the issue being appealed.
      (7)   Subject to the provisions of subdivision (6) of this subsection,
the board of adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable
time.
      (8)   The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing
as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters
stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the city would be unduly
prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of
appeal, the board shall continue the hearing. The board of adjustment may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from
and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to
be made. The board shall have all the powers of the official who made the
decision.
      (9)   When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D, Article 4 or
any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the
record below and the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. § 160D-1402
(c).
      (10)   The parties to an appeal that has been made under this subsection
may agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. The
ordinance may set standards and procedures to facilitate and manage such
voluntary alternative dispute resolution.
   (B)   Variances. To authorize, upon appeal, variations or modifications of
any regulation or provision of this chapter relating to the dimensional
requirements, construction or alteration of buildings or other provisions, so
that the spirit of this chapter is observed, public safety and welfare secured
and substantial justice done; however, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall not
permit a use of land, building or structure which is not permitted by right or
by a special use  permit  in the district involved.
      (1)   The Zoning Board of Adjustment may issue a variance only on the
basis of affirmative findings of fact for all of the following criteria:
         (a)   There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, as demonstrated by:
         (b)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the
property , such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from
personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are
common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for
granting a variance.
         (c)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant
or the property  owner . The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be
regarded as a self-created hardship.
         (d)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose,
and intent of the ordinance, such that is secured, and substantial justice is
achieved. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
      (2)   Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided
that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.
   (C)   Minor Special Uses; conditions governing application. To grant, in
particular cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, permits
for Minor Special Uses as authorized by this chapter and set forth as special
uses under the various use districts.

submitted indicating the section of this chapter under which the special use
  permit is sought.
         (b)   A public hearing is held pursuant to §
154.182.
      (2)   If the Board of Adjustment finds that in the particular case in
question, the use for which the conditional use  permit is sought will not
adversely affect the health or safety of the persons residing or working in the
neighborhood of the proposed use and will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to property or public improvements in the neighborhood , a
permit may be granted. In granting such a permit , the Zoning Board of
Adjustment may designate the conditions in connection therewith as will, in its
opinion, assure that the proposed use will conform to the requirements and
spirit of this chapter.
      (3)   If at any time after a conditional use  permit has been issued the
Board of Adjustment finds that the conditions imposed and agreements made have
not been or are not being fulfilled by the holder of a conditional use  permit
, the permit  shall be terminated and the operation of the use discontinued. If
the conditional use  permit is terminated for any reason, it may be reinstated
only after a public hearing is held.
      (4)   The Zoning Board of Adjustment may ask for the submission of a
preliminary site plan where a site plan is not required by this chapter.
      (5)   Before any special use permit is issued, the Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall make written findings certifying compliance with the specific
rules governing the individual special use and that satisfactory provision and
arrangement has been made concerning the following where applicable:
         (a)   Satisfactory ingress and egress to property and proposed
structures thereon with particular reference to automotive/pedestrian safety
and convenience and traffic flow and control.

compatibility.
         (d)   Buffering with reference to type, location and dimensions.

Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a temporary use permit to allow a use not
ordinarily permitted in the district, provided that the permit has a fixed
expiration date, and the applicant satisfies any conditions imposed by the
Zoning Board of Adjustment.
   (E)   Watershed Review Board. Unless Watershed Review Board functions are
otherwise designated by the Mills River Town Council, the Mills River Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall  hear and decide cases which arise from appeals or
may  perform other proper administrative functions pursuant to the provisions
set forth in the Mills River Town Code.
   (F)   Major Special Uses. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the
authority to hear and grant, grant with conditions or deny an application for a
Major Special Use  Permit  where the Mills River Town Council has determined
that the Mills River Town Council cannot hear the application due to conflict
of interest, bias, lack of a quorum or other similar reasons and has
specifically delegated its authority to hear and decide the application to the
Zoning Board of Adjustment by resolution. In such event, the Board of
Adjustment shall have all of the powers and duties of the Town Council as
defined in §
154.180(A). Notice requirements of §
154.182 shall apply.

AMENDMENTS
§ 154.195 AUTHORITY OF MILLS RIVER TOWN COUNCIL.
   This chapter, the Official Zoning Map of the Town of Mills River, and the
Town’s adopted comprehensive plan, including the future land use vision map,
may be amended by the Mills River Town Council upon a majority vote on first
reading and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 3-1-2004; Am. Ord. passed 7-29-2004; Am. Ord. passed 10-13-2005;
Am. Ord. 2021-06, passed 4-22-2021; Am. Ord. 2023-04, passed 9-14-2023)
§ 154.196 INITIATION.
   (A)   The text of this chapter, the Official Zoning Map of the Town of Mills
River, the adopted comprehensive plan, and the future land use vision map may
be amended in order to:
      (1)   Correct an error or clarify statements or boundaries;
      (2)   Change the regulations in the text;
      (3)   Apply zoning to previously unzoned areas of the town; or
      (4)   Change the zoning or future land use designation of an area.
   (B)   Zoning map amendment. Except as provided in §
154.067, proposed changes or amendments to the Official Zoning Map of the Town
of Mills River may  be initiated by the Mills River Town Council , the Planning
Board, the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the Town Manager, or 1 or more owners
of property  within the area proposed to be changed or affected, as applicable.
   (C)   Zoning text amendment, comprehensive plan amendment, or future land
use vision map amendment. Proposed changes or amendments to this chapter, to
the comprehensive plan, or to the future land use vision map may  be initiated
by the Mills River Town Council , the Planning Board, or the Town Manager. One
or more owners  of property  within town limits, including designated owner's
agents and legal counsel representing property  owners , may  petition Town
Council  for an amendment to this chapter, to the comprehensive plan, or to the
future land use vision map, only after holding a pre-application conference
with Town Council  to determine the acceptability of the proposed amendment.
      (l)   Pre-application conference required. Prior to submission of an
application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance, the comprehensive plan,
or the future land use vision map by a Mills River property  owner (s), the
applicant shall  arrange a pre-application conference with Town Council ,
coordinated by the Zoning Administrator .
      (2)   The applicant shall submit to the Zoning Administrator a
description of the proposed amendment. The description shall identify sections
proposed for amendment and include draft language or proposed changes.
      (3)   The pre-application conference with Town Council is designed to
inform the applicant of the town regulations and policies concerning amendments
and potential compatibility or incompatibility with the town's adopted
comprehensive plan. The pre-application conference is also meant to inform the
town of the applicant's intentions. Town Council has the authority to allow or
deny the property  owner initiated amendment to continue through the amendment
process. An amendment initiated by 1 or more property  owners in Mills River
may proceed with submitting a formal amendment application only upon a majority
vote from Town Council authorizing such during the pre-application conference.
      (4)   Upon positive direction from Town Council to proceed with the
amendment process, the applicant may submit to the Zoning Administrator a
written application for an amendment, with the applicable fee as identified in
the most recent Town of Mills River fee schedule.
   (D)   When considering any zoning text or map amendment, or comprehensive
plan, or future land use vision map amendment, all proposed changes shall be
reviewed by the Planning Board, but only after a pre-application conference
with Town Council for amendments initiated by 1 or more owners of property in
Mills River. All changes approved or denied by Town Council  shall include a
statement describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with the
town's adopted comprehensive plan, per G.S. 160D-605(a). If a zoning map
amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the future
land use vision map and comprehensive plan, the zoning amendment shall have the
effect of also amending the future land use map in the approved comprehensive
plan, and no additional request or application for a comprehensive plan
amendment shall be required.
   (E)   When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, a
statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be
approved by the Town Council , per G.S. 160D-605(b). This statement of
reasonableness may consider, among other factors: (i) the size, physical
conditions, and other attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned; (ii) the
benefits and detriments to the landowners , the neighbors, and the surrounding
community; (iii) the relationship between the current actual and permissible
development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be
permissible under the proposed amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the
public interest; and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a
zoning map amendment qualifies as a “large-scale rezoning” under G.S. § 160D-
602(b), the governing board statement on reasonableness may address the overall
rezoning.
   (F)   Down-zoning. No zoning text or map amendment that down-zones property
 shall  be initiated nor is it enforceable without the written  consent of all
property  owners  whose property  is the subject of the down-zoning amendment,
unless the down-zoning amendment is initiated by the Town of Mills River. For
the purposes of this section, "down-zoning” means a zoning ordinance that
affects an area of land in 1 of the following ways: (i) by decreasing the
development  density  of the land to be less dense than was allowed under its
previous usage; or (ii) by reducing the permitted uses of the land that are
specified in the town zoning code  to fewer uses than were allowed under its
previous usage, per G.S. 160D-601(d).

         (d)   Conditions. Per G.S. 160D-703(b), specific development
conditions may  be proposed by the applicant and/or the Town of Mills River,
but only those conditions approved by the Town of Mills River and consented to
by the applicant in writing may  be incorporated into the conditional zoning
district ordinance. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a
conditional district shall  be limited to those that address conformance of the
development  and use of the site to Town of Mills River ordinances, existing
development  standards, the Making Mills River 2040 Comprehensive Plan or any
amendments thereto, or the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the
proposed development  or use of the subject property .
         (e)   Modification of final approval. Minor modifications of
conditional district site development  plans approved by the Mills River Town
Council , may  be considered and approved by the Town Manager or Zoning
Administrator , as long as the requested modification does not involve a change
in permitted uses, change in density  of the development , change in roadway
layout or transportation access points, or significant changes in building
locations, or other major site characteristics, and does not increase the
impacts generated by the development  on traffic, stormwater runoff, or similar
impacts beyond what was projected for the original development  approval.
            1.   Minor modifications may be granted for the reduction or
adjustment of up to 10% of the required parking, landscaping, building set-
backs, or change in building dimensions or gross floor area . Any minor
modification must meet all other Town ordinance requirements. Minor
modifications may only be granted for just cause and are only intended to
provide relief based upon a unique physical attribute of the property or some
other factor unique to the property which was not known at the time of approval
and which has subsequently rendered the property difficult or impossible to
develop or use due to the conditions imposed.
            2.   The permit holder shall bear the burden of proof to secure the
modification. Any other modification of the conditions and standards in the
conditional district shall be considered a major modification and shall follow
the same process for the original approval of the conditional district. If
multiple parcels of land are subject to a conditional zoning, the owners of
individual parcels must consent in writing to the requested modification.
   (C)   Application modification. Application forms may  be modified by the
Town Council , Planning Board, Town Manager, or Zoning Administrator , as
necessary.
   (D)   (1)   Conditional district review process and approvals. Preliminary
masterplans may  be considered and approved prior to the final masterplan
approval. This allows the applicant an opportunity to present a request for
conditional rezoning without fully engineered construction details and plans.
Preliminary and final masterplan approvals are valid for 2 years , and the
approval shall  be annotated on the plan itself and certified by the Zoning
Administrator , or designee. The Mills River Town Council  may , for just
cause, grant a single extension of the masterplan approval for a maximum of 1
additional year .
      (2)   If the applicant includes a preliminary master plan in the initial
conditional zoning application which receives Council approval, this
preliminary master plan is valid for 2 years . The applicant is then required
to submit a fully engineered final master plan to the Zoning Administrator
within 2 years of initial approval, which will be reviewed by the Town Planning
Board for conformance with the preliminary plan approval. An applicant shall
only receive a zoning permit to begin project construction after securing
Planning Board approval for the final master plan. If the final master plan
deviates from the preliminary master plan approval, the applicant shall secure
a minor modification approval, or the change shall be considered a major
modification, which requires a conditional zoning re-submittal, recommendation
from the Planning Board, and review of Town Council in a public hearing,
following the same process applicable for the original approval. Final master
plans may also be submitted as part of the initial conditional zoning
application, and if approved by Town Council , no additional Planning Board or
Council review for zoning permit issuance is needed.
   (E)   Consideration. The Planning Board and the Mills River Town Council
will not consider an application for an amendment denied within the preceding
12 months  by the Town Council . This 12 month  waiting period shall  be
calculated beginning from the date of Town Council's decision to deny.

§ 154.198 PLANNING BOARD ACTION.
   Before taking any action on a proposed amendment to this chapter, to the
Official Zoning Map, to the comprehensive plan, or to the future land use
vision map, the Mills River Town Council  shall consider the Planning Board’s
recommendation on each proposed amendment. The Planning Board shall have 30
days after the first consideration of an application for an amendment at a
regular meeting to submit its recommendations to the Mills River Town Council ,
per G.S. 160D-604(b). Failure of the Planning Board to submit recommendations
within the 30 day period shall constitute a favorable recommendation, except
that, if by agreement of the Planning Board, Town Council , and the applicant
30 days is insufficient due to the size of the area, the complexity of the
request or similar circumstances, the Planning Board shall have 60 days to
submit the recommendation. If no written recommendation or report is received
from the Planning Board within the initial 30 day period, Town Council  may act
on the amendment without the Planning Board report. Town Council is not bound
by the recommendations, if any, of the Planning Board, per G.S. 160D-604(b).
Time limitations shall not apply to applications for areas not previously
zoned, or to text amendments, zoning map amendments, comprehensive plan
amendments, or future land use vision map amendments initiated by the Planning
Board, the Town Manager, or the Town Council .

§ 154.199 LEGISLATIVE HEARING.
   Before enacting any amendment to this chapter, to the Official Zoning Map,
to the comprehensive plan, or to the future land use vision map, the Mills
River Town Council  shall hold a legislative hearing . Public notification of
the hearing shall comply with the provisions of G.S. 160D-601, as amended.
   (A)   Newspaper notice. In accordance with G.S. 160D-601, a notice of the
legislative hearing  shall  be published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the Town of Mills River once a week for 2 successive calendar weeks, the
first publication of which shall  not appear less than 10 days nor more than 25
days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. In computing the public notice
period, the day of publication is not to be included but the day of the hearing
shall  be included. The notice shall  include the time, place and date of the
hearing and include a description of the property  or the nature of the change
or amendment to the ordinance and/or Official Zoning Map.
   (B)   Mailed notice. In accordance with G.S. 160D-602, whenever there is a
proposed amendment to the Official Zoning Map or the future land use vision
map, the owner  of that parcel of land as shown on the Henderson County tax
listing and the owners  of all parcels of land abutting that parcel of land as
well as all properties separated from the subject property  by street ,
reserved right-of-way, railroad, or other transportation corridor as shown on
the Henderson County tax listing shall  be mailed by first class mail a notice
of a legislative hearing  on the proposed amendment by first class mail at the
last addresses listed for the owners  on the Henderson County tax abstracts.
This notice must be deposited in the mail at least 10 but not more than 25 days
prior to the date of the legislative hearing . The person(s) mailing the
notices shall  certify to the Town Council  that fact, and the certificate
shall  be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud. However, with specific
approval of the Mills River Town Council  at the time the Town Council  sets a
legislative hearing  on a particular application, the Town Council  may  elect
to use the expanded notice procedure, per G.S. 160D-602(b), which follows in
lieu of or in addition to the first class mailed notice required by this
division if:
      (1)   The proposed amendment would initially zone property added to the
territorial coverage of the Official Zoning Map; or
   (2)   The proposed amendment directly affects more than 50 properties owned
by a total of at least 50 different property  owners .
   (C)   Expanded published notice procedure. If the Town Council  elects to
utilize the expanded notice procedure, the town shall  publish once a week for
4 successive calendar weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the
area an advertisement of the legislative hearing  that shows the boundaries of
the area affected by the proposed Zoning Map amendment and explains the nature
of the proposed change. The final 2 advertisements shall  comply with and be
deemed to satisfy the provisions of G.S. 160D-602. The advertisement shall  not
be less than ½ of a newspaper page in size. The advertisement shall  only be
effective for property  owners  who reside in the area of general circulation
of the newspaper which publishes the notice. Property  owners  who reside
outside of the newspaper circulation area, according to the address listed on
the most recent property  tax listing for the affected property , shall  be
notified by first class mail pursuant to this section. The person(s) mailing
the notices shall  certify to the Town Council  that fact, and the certificates
shall  be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud. In addition to the
published notice, the Town of Mills River shall  post 1 or more prominent signs
on or immediately adjacent to the subject area reasonably calculated to give
public notice of the proposed re-zoning.
   (D)   Posted notice. For any proposed amendment to the Official Zoning Map
or to the future land use vision map, the Town of Mills River shall  post a
sign  in a prominent location on or near the subject property  which indicates
that a zoning map change or future land use map change has been proposed for
the subject property . In the event that more than 1 parcel is involved in a
particular amendment, at least 1 sign  shall  be posted in a central location;
however, the Town of Mills River may  post multiple signs . The sign (s) shall
be posted during the period between 25 days prior and 10 days prior to the
legislative hearing date.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST
§ 154.201 CONFLICT OF INTEREST REQUIREMENTS.
   Elected and appointed boards and Town of Mills River staff shall maintain
conflict of interest procedures pursuant to G.S. § 160D-109 in administering

legislative decision regarding a development regulation adopted pursuant to
Title XV of the Mills River Town Code where the outcome of the matter being
considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily
identifiable financial impact on the member. A governing board member shall not
vote on any zoning amendment if the landowner of the property subject to a
rezoning petition or the applicant for a text amendment is a person with whom
the member has a close familial, business, or other associational relationship.
   (B)   Appointed boards. Members of appointed boards shall not vote on any
advisory or legislative decision regarding a development regulation adopted
pursuant to Title XV of the Mills River Town Code where the outcome of the
matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and
readily identifiable financial impact on the member. An appointed board member
shall not vote on any zoning amendment if the landowner of the property subject
to a rezoning petition or the applicant for a text amendment is a person with
whom the member has a close familial, business, or other associational
relationship.
   (C)   Administrative staff. No staff member shall make a final decision on
an administrative decision required by Title XV of the Mills River Town Code if
the outcome of that decision would have a direct, substantial, and readily
identifiable financial impact on the staff member or if the applicant or other
person subject to that decision is a person with whom the staff member has a
close familial, business, or other associational relationship. If a staff
member has a conflict of interest under this section, the decision shall be
assigned to the supervisor of the staff person or such other staff person as
may be designated by the governing board. No staff member shall be financially
interested or employed by a business that is financially interested in a
development subject to regulation under Title XV of the Mills River Town Code

facilitating or exercising quasi-judicial functions pursuant to Title XV of the
Mills River Town Code shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial
matter in a manner that would violate affected persons’ rights to an impartial
decision maker and process. Impermissible violations of due process include,
but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the
matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed communications with
affected persons outside of defined decision making processes, a close
familial, business, or other associational relationship with an affected
person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter.
   (E)   Resolution of objection. If an objection is raised to a board member’s
participation at or prior to the hearing or vote on a particular matter and
that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members of the

ensure conflict of interest issues do not adversely affect parties seeking
rulings and approvals on legislative or quasi-judicial matters that come before
the Town provided that additional rules and procedures are not inconsistent
with G.S. § 160D-109 and any amendments thereto.

§ 156.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Natural Resources
Ordinance of the Town of Mills River, North Carolina."
(Ord. 2022-18, passed 12-8-2022)
§ 156.002 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of the Natural Resources Ordinance is to mitigate negative
impacts of land development on natural resources to include provisions for
water supply watershed protection, surface water quality management and erosion
control.
   (B)   This chapter outlines processes and defines standards for Watershed
Protection Areas within the Town of Mills River as defined in the Zoning
Ordinance.
(Ord. 2022-18, passed 12-8-2022)
§ 156.003 DEFINITIONS.
   AGRICULTURAL USE. The use of waters for stock watering, irrigation, and
other farm purposes.
   BALANCE OF WATERSHED (BW). The area adjoining and upstream of the critical
area  in a WS-II and WS-III water supply watershed. The BALANCE OF WATERSHED is
comprised of the entire land area contributing surface drainage to the stream,
river, or reservoir where a water supply intake is located.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP). A structural or nonstructural management-
based practice used singularly or in combination to reduce nonpoint source
inputs to receiving waters in order to achieve water quality protection goals.
   BUFFER. An area of natural or planted vegetation through which stormwater
runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that the runoff does not become channelized
and which provides for infiltration of the runoff and filtering of pollutants.
The BUFFER is measured landward from the normal pool elevation of impounded
structures  and from the bank of each side of streams or rivers.
   BUILDING. Any structures  having a roof supported by columns or by walls,
and intended for shelter, housing or enclosure of persons, animals or property
. The connection of 2 buildings  by means of an open porch, breezeway,
passageway, carport or other such open structure , with or without a roof,
shall not be deemed to make them 1 building .
   BUILT-UPON AREA. Built-upon areas shall  include that portion of a
development  project that is covered by impervious or partially impervious
cover including buildings , pavement, gravel areas (e.g. roads, parking lots,
paths), recreation facilities (e.g. tennis courts), and the like. Wooden
slatted decks and the water area of a swimming pool are considered pervious.
   CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT. Cluster development  means the grouping of buildings
in order to conserve land resources and provide for innovation in the design of
the project including minimizing stormwater runoff impacts. This term includes
nonresidential development  as well as single-family residential  and multi-
family developments .
   COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT. A site where multiple separate and distinct
development  activities may be taking place at different times or different
schedules but governed by a single development  plan regardless of ownership of
parcels.
   CRITICAL AREA. The area adjacent to a water supply intake or reservoir where
risk associated with pollution is greater than from the remaining portions of
the watershed. The critical area  is defined as extending either ½ mile from
the normal pool elevation of the reservoir in which the intake is located or to
the ridge line of the watershed (whichever comes first); or ½ mile upstream
from the intake located directly in the stream or river (run-of-the-river), or
the ridge line of the watershed (whichever comes first). Major landmarks such
as highways or property  lines may be used to delineate the outer boundary of
the critical area  if these landmarks are immediately adjacent to the
appropriate outer boundary of ½ mile.
   CUSTOMARY HOME OCCUPATIONS. Any use conducted entirely within a dwelling and
carried on by the occupants thereof, which use is clearly incidental and
secondary to the use of the dwelling for residential purposes and does not
change the character thereof. Provided further that no mechanical equipment is
installed or used except as is normally used for domestic or professional
purposes, and that not over 25% of the total floor space of any structure  is
used for the occupation. No home occupation shall  be conducted in any
accessory building except for the storage and service of a vehicle that is
driven off-site, such as a service repair truck, delivery truck, and the like.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any land disturbing activity which adds to or changes the
amount of impervious or partially impervious cover on a land area or which
otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation into the soil.
   DWELLING UNIT. A building , or portion thereof, providing complete and
permanent living facilities for 1 or more persons.
   EXISTING DEVELOPMENT. Those projects that are built or those projects that
at a minimum have established a vested right  under North Carolina zoning law

   EXISTING LOT (LOT OF RECORD). A lot which is part of a subdivision, a plat
of which has been recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds prior to the
adoption of this chapter, or a lot described by metes and bounds, the
description of which has been so recorded prior to the adoption of this
chapter.
   INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT. Any non-residential development  that requires an
NPDES permit for an industrial discharge and/or requires the use or storage of
any hazardous material for the purpose of manufacturing, assembling, finishing,
cleaning or developing any product or commodity.
   MAJOR WATERSHED VARIANCE. A variance from the minimum statewide watershed
protection rules that results in any 1 or more of the following :
      (1)   The relaxation, by a factor greater than 10%, of any management
requirement under the low density option;
      (2)   The relaxation, by a factor greater than 5%, of any buffer ,
density or built-upon area requirement under the high density option;
      (3)   Any variation in the design, maintenance or operation requirements
of a wet detention pond or other approved stormwater management system.
   MINOR WATERSHED VARIANCE. A variance  from the minimum statewide watershed
protection rules that results in a relaxation, by a factor of up to 5% of any
buffer , density or built-upon area  requirement under the high density option;
or that results in a relaxation, by a factor of up to 10%, of any management
requirement under the low density option. For variances  to a vegetated setback
requirement, the percent variation shall  be calculated using the foot print of
built-upon area  proposed to encroach with the vegetated setback divided by the
total area of vegetated setback within the project.
   NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD. A lot described by a plat or a deed that was
recorded prior to the effective date of local watershed  protection regulations
that does not meet the minimum lot size or other development  requirements of
the statewide watershed  protection rules.

(Ord. 2022-18, passed 12-8-2022)
§ 156.027 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE WATERSHED REVIEW BOARD.
   (A)   Administrative review. The Watershed  Review Board shall  hear and
decide appeals from any decision or determination made by the Watershed
Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter.
   (B)   Variances . The Watershed  Review Board shall  have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, minor variances  from the terms of this chapter
and the applicable sections of the Zoning Ordinance as would not be contrary to
the public interests where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of this chapter would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship,
so that the spirit of this chapter shall  be observed, public safety and
welfare secured, and substantial justice done. In addition, the Town of Mills
River shall  notify and allow a reasonable comment period for all other local
governments having jurisdiction in the designated watershed where the variance
is being considered.
   (C)   Applications for a variance  shall be made on the proper form
obtainable from the Watershed Administrator and shall include the following
information:
      (1)   A site plan, drawn to a scale of at least 1 inch to 40 feet,
indicating the property lines of the parcel upon which the use is proposed; any
existing or proposed structures drawn and indicate north point, name and
address of person who prepared the plan, date of the original drawing, and an
accurate record of any later revisions.
      (2)   A complete and detailed description of the proposed variance ,
together with any other pertinent information which the applicant feels would
be helpful to the Watershed Review Board in considering the application.
   (D)   The Watershed Administrator  shall notify in writing each local
government having jurisdiction in the watershed and the entity using the water
supply for consumption. Such notice shall include a description of the variance
being requested. Local governments receiving notice of the variance request may
submit comments to the Watershed Administrator prior to a decision by the
Watershed Review Board. Such comments shall become a part of the record of
proceedings of the Watershed Review Board.
   (E)   Before the Watershed Review Board may grant a variance , it shall make
the following 3 findings, which shall be recorded in the permanent record of
the case, and shall include the factual reasons on which they are based:
      (1)   There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the
way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter. In order to determine
that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Watershed
Review Board must find that the 5 following conditions exist:
         (a)   If the application complies with the provisions of this chapter
and the applicant can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use
of, the property . Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater
profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify
the Watershed Review Board in granting a variance. Moreover, the Watershed
Review Board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible
deviation from the terms of this chapter that will make possible the reasonable
use of the property .
         (b)   The hardship results from the application of this chapter to the
property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other
hardship.
         (c)   The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's
property , such as its size, shape, or topography, which is different from that
of neighboring property .
         (d)   The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant
who knowingly or unknowingly violates this chapter, or who purchases the
property after the effective date of this chapter, and then comes to the
Watershed Review Board for relief.
         (e)   The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property , rather
than the result of conditions that are widespread. If other properties are
equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a
variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote
equal justice.
      (2)   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this chapter and preserves its spirit.
      (3)   In the granting of the variance , the public safety and welfare
have been assured and substantial justice has been done. The Watershed Review
Board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect
impair the public health, safety, or general welfare.
   (F)   In granting the variance , the Watershed Review Board may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features
of the proposed building, structure , or use as it may deem advisable in
furtherance of the purpose of this chapter. If a variance for the construction,
alteration or use of property is granted, such construction, alteration or use
shall be in accordance with the approved site plan.
   (G)   The Watershed Review Board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an
application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been
no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or
application.
   (H)   A variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered
a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or
watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within
12 months from the date of the decision.
   (I)   If the application calls for the granting of a major variance , and if
the Watershed Review Board decides in favor of granting the variance , the
Watershed Review Board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with
all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall include:
      (1)   The variance application;
      (2)   The hearing notices;
      (3)   The evidence presented;
      (4)   Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on
them;
      (5)   Proposed findings and exceptions; and
      (6)   The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be
added to the permit.
   (J)   The preliminary record shall be sent to the Environmental Management
Commission for its review as follows:
      (1)   If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the
variance qualifies as a major variance and that (1) the property  owner can
secure no reasonable return from, nor make any practical use of the property
unless the proposed variance is granted, and (2) the variance , if granted,
will not result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the Commission
shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with
conditions and stipulations. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision
and send it to the Watershed Review Board. If the Commission approves the
variance as proposed, the Board shall prepare a final decision granting the
proposed variance . If the Commission approves the variance with conditions and
stipulations, the Board shall prepare a final decision, including such
conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance .
      (2)   If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the
variance qualifies as a major variance and that (1) the property  owner can
secure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property without
the variance or (2) the variance , if granted, will result in a serious threat
to the water supply, then the Commission shall deny approval of the variance as
proposed. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it to the
Watershed Review Board. The Board shall prepare a final decision denying the
variance as proposed.

misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished in accordance with G.S. 14-
4. The maximum fine for each offense shall not exceed $500. Each day that the
violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 2022-18, passed 12-8-2022)
§ 156.029 REMEDIES.
   (A)   If any subdivision, development and/or land use is found to be in
violation of this chapter, the Mills River Town Council may, in addition to all
other remedies available either in law or in equity, institute a civil penalty
in the amount of $50, action or proceedings to restrain, correct, or abate the
violation; to prevent occupancy of the building , structure , or land; or to
prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about the premises. In
addition, the N.C. Environmental Management Commission may assess civil
penalties in accordance with G.S. 143-215.6(a). Each day that the violation
continues shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   If any of the provisions of this chapter are being violated, the
Watershed Administrator shall notify in writing the person responsible for such
violation, indicating the nature of the violation, and ordering the action
necessary to correct it. The Watershed Administrator shall order discontinuance
of the illegal use of land, buildings or structures ; removal of illegal
buildings or structures , or of additions, alterations or structural changes
thereto; discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or shall take any
action authorized by this chapter to ensure compliance with or to prevent
violation of its provisions. If a ruling of the Watershed Administrator is
questioned, the aggrieved party or parties may appeal such ruling to the
Watershed Review Board.
